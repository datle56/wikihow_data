      "content": "Treat nausea. Focus on keeping fluids down. This means if you are vomiting everything out, your primary objective should be to alleviate nausea and prevent vomiting. Without fluids, your illness could cause dehydration and will slow your recovery. Many people like to drink a plain carbonated beverage, such as lemon-lime soda, to treat their nausea. Others advocate the use of ginger to calm nausea.

However, you may need anti-vomiting therapy if you have electrolyte disturbances or nausea induced by chemotherapy."

      "title": "Treat diarrhea.",
      "content": "Treat diarrhea. Diarrhea can be described as liquid stool, frequent stool but watery stool here really is the definition of the term. Patients may experience it differently. However, if you are losing fluids via diarrhea you will need to replace these losses with electrolytes containing formulas such as (Gatorade, Pedialyte) as well as water. Because electrolytes specifically, potassium, are key in the electrical conduction of the heart, and potassium is lost with diarrhea, you must be especially alert to keeping electrolytes on board. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are different opinions as to whether it is better to let the viral illness “out” or to stop it with constipating anti-diarrheal agents. Most doctors agree that anti-diarrhea medications can make the symptoms last longer. Consult your doctor before taking one."

      "title": "Treat dehydration.",
      "content": "Treat dehydration. The combination of vomiting and diarrhea will make dehydration your primary complication. Adults that are dehydrated will notice that they are dizzy when they stand, have a racing pulse when standing, have dry oral mucosa, or feel weak. Part of the problem with dehydration is that it brings with it a lack of important electrolytes, such as potassium. Replace these losses with fluids that contain electrolytes, such as Gatorade or Pedialyte, as well as drinking water. If you are losing a fair amount of fluids and your diarrhea is severe, you should see your physician. They will help determine if you are only suffering from viral gastroenteritis and begin treatment. There are other illnesses, such as bacterial infections, parasitic causes, or an intolerance to lactose or sorbitol that could also be causing your illness.

Avoid alcohol, caffeine, anything too basic, or anything too acidic (such as orange juice or milk). Sports drinks (such as Gatorade) will rehydrate you and replenish electrolytes, although unlike the options available at a pharmacy they are not guaranteed to give you all the electrolytes you need.

      "content": "Eat bland foods. Try sticking to a BRAT diet, in which you eat bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. This will be bland enough that you can hopefully keep it down but will give you the nutrients you will need to recover quickly. Bananas will pull double duty in providing bland nutrition and in being rich in potassium, which will counter diarrheal losses. Rice is bland and even nauseated folks can keep this down. You may want to try rice water, mixed with a bit of sugar, but this is still anecdotal. Applesauce is also bland and sweet, tends to be tolerated, even if a teaspoon every 30 minutes. This requires patience, especially if treating children, as they may often only tolerate small sips or spoonfuls. You want to stick to small amounts, as large amounts will trigger vomiting, thereby countering your efforts. Toast is a bland source of carbohydrates that most can keep down. If all else fails, eat baby food. Commercially-produced baby food is meant to be gentle on the stomach, easily digestible, and loaded with vitamins and nutrients. Give it a shot if you can't keep anything else down."

Vomit into something you can clean easily. If you have a few large, dishwasher-safe mixing bowls that you use infrequently (or don't plan to use ever again), consider keeping one with you throughout the day and when you go to sleep.
