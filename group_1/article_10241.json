Most external hard drives use a USB cable to connect to your computer, but you may find that your computer doesn't have a USB-A port (the typical rectangular port). Mac computers and some Windows computers use oval USB-C ports instead of traditional USB-A ports. [1] X Research source Likewise, it's good to know if your external hard drive uses a USB-C cable when your computer only has USB-A ports. You can buy an adapter if needed. If your computer has a USB-C port instead of a USB-A port, you'll need to buy a USB-C to USB-A adapter for your computer. You can find these online and in some tech stores (e.g. Best Buy)."

If you're using an adapter, first connect the end of the adapter that fits in your computer to your computer, then plug the end of the external hard drive's cable into the free end of the adapter."
