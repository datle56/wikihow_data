      "title": "Prepare your oil.",
      "content": "Prepare your oil. Warm up 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of coconut oil or olive oil in a little dish. You can do this in the microwave or on the stove, but be careful not to let it get too hot. It should be warm and comfortable to the touch. If you want a fancier spa, try one of the following mixtures instead: 1 teaspoon of each of the following: almond oil, coconut oil, olive oil, and sesame oil. 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of olive oil, and 4 to 5 drops of vitamin E oil. Castor oil is also a great choice, because it's thick and heavy,and really seeps into the cuticle layer of your hair."

      "content": "Massage the oil into your scalp from roots to tips for 5 minutes. Spread the rest of the oil through your hair, from the roots to the ends. This will help improve the circulation in your scalp."

      "title": "Keep the towel wrapped around your head for 5 to 6 minutes.",
      "content": "Keep the towel wrapped around your head for 5 to 6 minutes. The heat will trap the oil and open up the hair follicles. It will help the oil penetrate your hair and scalp and nourish it. If you have very dry hair, wait 15 to 20 minutes instead. If you're using extra virgin olive oil, you could let the treatment sit in your hair overnight."

    {
      "title": "Wash your hair",
      "content": "Wash your hair using lukewarm water. Use enough mild shampoo to get the oil out. You can add conditioner if your hair is very dry, but the mask in the next step will be nourishing enough on their own."

      "content": "Wait 15 to 30 minutes. How long you wait depends on the type of mask you are using, so be sure to follow the instructions closely. Don't leave the mask on for much longer than directions on the package say. For example, if the mask should be left on for 10–15 minutes, don't sleep in it. It may even cause hair breakage.
