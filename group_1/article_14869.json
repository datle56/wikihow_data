      "content": "Buy or make eggnog around the holidays. Typically, you can only find eggnog in grocery stores and supermarkets around the winter holidays. Look for it in the dairy aisle, close to milk and coffee creamer. If you can’t find it in a store near you, order it online. If you’d like, you can also make your own eggnog out of eggs, milk, cream, and sugar."

      "content": "Mix your eggnog with rum, bourbon, or brandy to give it a little kick. Start by adding 0.5 fl oz (15 mL) of liquor to a glass of eggnog. Taste it and add more alcohol if desired. Although rum and bourbon are most commonly paired with eggnog, you can mix in any amber-colored spirit, such as cognac. [1] X Research source Avoid mixing beer or wine with eggnog since it might not taste very good. Serve your spiked eggnog with cookies, cake, or pie. Remember to always drink responsibly and not to consume alcohol if you are under the legal drinking age."

Avoid keeping eggnog in the door, since it may not be as cold as the rest of the fridge."

Start with about 5 cups (1,200 mL) of your favorite store-bought or homemade eggnog, and pour it into a large punch bowl or pitcher. [6] X Research source Since this cocktail is best served chilled, start with eggnog that’s very cold. If you want to adjust the quantity of the drink, just use the proportion 5 parts eggnog to 1 part liquor. If you want to make your own eggnog, beat 6 egg yolks until they’re frothy, then gradually add 2 cups (470 mL) of whole milk, 1 cup (240 mL) of heavy whipping cream, and 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar."

[8] X Research source Feel free to experiment with different liquors, like amaretto or cognac in place of the brandy, or dark rum in place of the bourbon. To make a non-alcoholic version of this classic cocktail, replace the liquor with more eggnog, but add a few drops of rum extract to taste instead."

A sprinkle of nutmeg is a classic topping for any eggnog drink, but you can add a little extra color by adding a little grated orange zest as well. If you prefer, you can leave off the orange zest and serve the eggnog with a cinnamon stick, instead. If your guests are serving themselves, place a shaker of nutmeg and a bowl of orange zest or cinnamon sticks next to the glasses. That way, everyone can garnish their own drink."
