      "content": "Use social media to get a celebrity’s attention. Communicating with a celebrity online can be a great way to initiate contact without appearing like a stalker. If you have a compelling online presence and a large following, the celebrity may notice your account when you follow or like their posts. [3] X Research source Follow celebrities on platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Instagram, and Snapchat. Make sure your account is public so they can see who you are. Write the celebrity a brief, sincere message in a comment or DM. Be respectful and authentic—celebrities get thousands of messages, and they can’t reply to them all. Some famous people have teams who review their messages for them. Tag them in relevant posts or stories. For example, if you go to a concert or movie they’re in, you can tag them in a positive post about it. Don’t overdo it—you don’t want to seem like a stalker or be blocked."
