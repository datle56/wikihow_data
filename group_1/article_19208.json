      "title": "Drop a subtle, audible hint about being quiet.",
      "content": "Drop a subtle, audible hint about being quiet. Instead of yelling at the person or group that's getting on your nerves, make some small noise that will help them get the point that what they're doing isn't appreciated. If they're constantly chatting while you're looking for a book, try clearing your throat or coughing softly. Hopefully this will help quiet them down. [1] X Research source Try not to shush them loudly in a way that would seem condescending. This might make them want to continue being loud because you tried to embarrass them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask them to be quiet.",
      "content": "Ask them to be quiet. If someone is truly bothering you with their noise, just go up to them and kindly, in a calm voice, ask them to lower their voice. Sometimes just bringing it to their attention that they are being disruptive is all it will take to make them change their behavior. Try using one of these examples: “I’m sorry to be a bother, but would you mind keeping it down a bit?” “Hi. I hate to be that person, but I have a big test tomorrow that I’m trying to study for and I’d really appreciate it if you could tone it down a bit. Thanks!” “Would you mind moving to a different location? This is a quiet work space. Thank you!”"

      "title": "Use nonverbal methods to get people to keep it down.",
      "content": "Use nonverbal methods to get people to keep it down. Most people understand that libraries are meant to be a quiet place. A meaningful glance in their direction should give them a hint that a lack of silence isn't appreciated in such an environment. [2] X Research source Don’t glare at them or make a mean face. This will only make the situation worse."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be considerate if the loud patron is a child.",
      "content": "Be considerate if the loud patron is a child. Try to be understanding if it's children that won't calm down. Infants and toddlers obviously don’t have the same kind of self-control adults do and it is very likely that their parents are just as frustrated about the situation as you are – and probably embarrassed by their child’s behavior too! If you must, ask the parents or caregivers to get the kids to calm down. Generally, don't try to talk to the kids directly. This will probably scare and creep them out or anger their parents since you not only scared their children, you also tried to discipline their kids."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask a librarian or another assistant for help with the noise.",
      "content": "Ask a librarian or another assistant for help with the noise. Most librarians will be more than happy to assist you in these problems – it's their job, after all. An assistant might be more reluctant and might not get as much attention, but they'll usually help you out, nevertheless."
    },
    {
      "title": "Counteract the noise.",
      "content": "Counteract the noise. If you've got noise-blocking headphones, don't be afraid to use them. A mp3 player should also be helpful, but keep the sound down so you don't accidentally ruin someone else's time at the library. Make sure you keep the sound down to a very low level because studying with headphones in has been found to decrease productivity."

      "title": "Utilize a private study space.",
      "content": "Utilize a private study space. Most libraries have rooms you can reserve for studying. If the main part of the library is too loud, try using one of these rooms so that you can close the door and have a more private, quiet space to study or read.

      "title": "Don’t be rude when you ask someone to be quiet.",
      "content": "Don’t be rude when you ask someone to be quiet. While it can be very tempting at moments, remember that rudeness won't get anything done and will only create conflict. And since the person you're trying to calm down will probably react to the perceived mistreatment by mistreating you , things will probably only get louder. [5] X Research source An easy way to avoid the appearance of rudeness is by deflecting the blame onto yourself – like that it is your situation (the big test you have to study for, an important interview you need to prepare for, a severe headache you might have) that is the reason you are asking them to be quiet, not their own rude lack of respect for others."

      "title": "Move to a quieter location.",
      "content": "Move to a quieter location. If someone is being disruptive, try moving locations. If you pack up your things and move father away from them, they may notice and start being more quiet. Either way, you’ll be farther away from the noise and able to concentrate better.

    {
      "title": "Wait for the loud library patron to leave.",
      "content": "Wait for the loud library patron to leave. If they simply won't be quiet, try to tough it out and wait for them to leave. If the project you are working on requires a lot of focused concentration, try working on something less demanding until the loud person leaves and you can focus better. Use this as an opportunity to give your brain a nice little break. If you don't have anything else to do at the library while waiting for the rude people to leave, run any errands you may have that are close to where you are. Just be sure to get back before the library closes."
