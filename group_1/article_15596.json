      "content": "Bleed builds are designed to kill foes using the Blood Loss condition. A “Bleed build” doesn’t require a specific class in Elden Ring; it’s all about taking down opponents as quickly as possible using a combination of weapons, spells, talismans, and other equipment that inflict Blood Loss. Blood Loss (or Bleed) staggers enemies, causing them to take huge amounts of damage passively. [1] X Research source The goal of a great Bleed build is to be able to hit an enemy repeatedly, inflicting more and more Blood Loss until an enemy falls (much faster than they would have without the extra Bleed damage). With a well-made Bleed build, you’ll be able to take out some enemies before they’ve even had a chance to attack you in return! Not all enemies are susceptible to the Blood Loss condition, but there are still ways to defeat them when using a Bleed build."

      "content": "Early game stats Generally, Arcane, Dexterity, and Vigor are the main stats to prioritize for a great bleed build—though Endurance is helpful, too. Arcane is essential for both incantations and buffing weapons, while Vigor allows you to survive damage from foes, and Dexterity will let you deal more damage on fast, agile attacks. Early in the game, aim to have these stats around level 30+: [2] X Research source Vigor : 20 Mind : 12 Endurance : 14 Strength : 12 Dexterity : 18 (or 16) Intelligence : 9 Faith : 8 Arcane : 16 (or 18)"

Add some points to your Endurance, too, to you can stand up to tough enemy attacks. Plus, as you find weapons to use with Ash of War, think about boosting your Mind stat slightly as well. [3] X Research source Vigor : 40 Mind : 21 Endurance : 19 Strength : 12 Dexterity : 30 (or 25) Intelligence : 9 Faith : 8 Arcane : 25 (or 30)"

Aim to have these stats (or something similar): [4] X Research source Vigor : 50 Mind : 21 Endurance : 22 Strength : 12 Dexterity : 30 (or 40) Intelligence : 9 Faith : 15 Arcane : 40 (or 30) Tip : If you need a higher Faith stat to use certain incantations, try taking the points out of Dexterity or Vigor and raising your Faith to around 25."

Get your main stats as high as possible and ensure your Mind and Endurance have reached a comfortable point, too. If you find a Larval Tear (in the Village of the Albinaurics, for example), use it to get 5 extra Arcane or Mind points. Overall, aim for these stats: [5] X Research source Vigor : 60 Mind : 21 Endurance : 22 Strength : 12 Dexterity : 45 Intelligence : 9 Faith : 15 Arcane : 45 Tip : Depending on your play style, you could split Dexterity and Arcane 50/40 rather than 45/45. You could also give Vigor 50 points and get Arcane or Dexterity up to 60 if you prefer!"

      "title": "Weapons",
      "content": "Weapons Choose weapons with the innate ability to inflict the Bleed condition, regardless of any other spells or talismans you use with them. Most of the weapons you’ll want for a Bleed build are blades, including: [6] X Research source Bandit’s Curved Sword . This curved sword has the highest damage output of its type—and when dual-wielding, you can set the Bleed affinity on both. Location : Limgrave and the Altus Plateau, dropped by Skeletal Bandits. Requirements : 11 Strength and 13 Dexterity. Dragon Communion Seal . A seal that buffs all Dragon Communion incantations by 15%; since Bleed builds often use Dragon incantations, it’s an excellent item to have. Location : Fringefolk Hero’s Grave. Requirements : 10 Faith and 10 Arcane. Blood Uchigatana . This weapon causes Bleed build-up passively. It's even more effective when combined with moves like the Ash of War: Bloody Slash. Location : The Deathtouched Catacombs in Limgrave. Requirements : 11 Strength and 15 Dexterity. Nagakiba . This is another weapon that causes Bleed build-up passively and becomes more powerful when combined with many of the Ashes of War mentioned below (though you’ll need 18 Strength to use it). Location : North of Murkwater Cave or near the Seaside Ruins’ Site of Grace at Bloody Finger Hunter Yura’s camp. It can be looted from him after defeating him. Requirements : 18 Strength and 22 Dexterity. Eleonora’s Poleblade . This blade comes with unique attacks (like Bloodblade Dance, which deals Bleed damage) in addition to dealing Fire damage and staggering enemies. Location : The Second Church of Marika, after defeating Eleonora, Violet Bloody Finger. Requirements : 12 Strength, 21 Dexterity, and 19 Arcane. Rivers of Blood . A katana that comes with a unique skill (Corpse Piler), capable of causing massive Bleed build-up on foes. Location : Outside the Church of Repose, southeast of the Mountaintops of the Giants. It’s dropped by a defeated Bloody Dinger Okina. Requirements : 12 Strength, 18 Dexterity, and 20 Arcane. Godskin Peeler . This twinblade is one of the game’s most powerful weapons and comes with a unique skill (Black Flame Tornado). It can also be infused with a Blood Ash of War. Location : Windmill Village in the Altus Plateau, lootable after defeating the Godskin Apostle. Requirements : 17 Strength and 22 Dexterity."

      "title": "Armor",
      "content": "Armor Aim to use heavy armor whenever you can with a bleed build to get extra protection and Poise (so you won’t get interrupted as much when making attacks and using Dragon incantations). Beyond that, there are a few specific pieces of armor and equipment that can really boost a bleed build: [7] X Research source White Mask . This powerful mask raises your attack power when an enemy is inflicted with blood loss, making it one of the only essential armor pieces for a Bleed build. Location : The Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum area in the blood-filled lake. It’s dropped by one of the three Nameless White Mask invaders there. Mask of Confidence . This mask boosts your Arcane stat by +3, which is a crucial stat for any Bleed build. Location : The Carian Study Hall, but only after you use the Carian Inverted Statue during Ranni’s quest."

      "content": "Choose Ashes of War that can buff a weapon’s Bleed build-up. Ashes of War are special moves that can bind to your weapons, allowing you to use them in battle. Thus, some are particularly effective at buffing the Bleed build-up from swords, spears, and katanas. These are the best Ashes of War for a Bleed build: [8] X Research source Ash of War: Seppuku . You injure yourself, taking damage and coating your weapon in blood. In exchange, your attack power and ability to inflict Bleed build-up increase for 60 seconds. This is the most essential Ash of War for a Bleed build! Location : East of the Freezing Lake’s Site of Grace. Ash of War: Bloody Slash . You coat your weapon in blood before slashing foes. This move has a short area of effect (AoE) and deals high damage, though it’s really only significant at low levels since it doesn’t cause Bleed build-up. Location : At the top of Fort Haight, dropped by a Godrick Knight. Ash of War: Blood Blade . You wound yourself, coating your weapon in blood and launching it at a foe to cause Bleed build-up and deal massive damage. This is preferable to Bloody Slash because of the extra Bleed build-up. Location : The Altus Plateau, northeast of Erdtree-Gazing Hill’s Site of Grace. A Teardrop Scarab drops it. Ash of War: Blood Tax . You make a combo attack, thrusting your weapon into an enemy while regenerating your health simultaneously (based on your max health rather than the damage dealt. Location : A cave in the Mohgwyn Dynasty area of the Lands Between."

      "content": "Equip helpful talismans to enhance your Bleed build. Talismans are special accessories designed to buff your character in various ways; they’re powerful but can’t be upgraded. The most important talismans for a strong Bleed build include: [9] X Research source Lord of Blood’s Exultation . A talisman that raises your attack power by 20% for 20 seconds whenever an enemy (or other player) has the Bleed status. This is likely the most important talisman for anyone’s Bleed build! Location : The Leyndell Catacombs, dropped by the boss inside the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. Millicent’s Prosthesis . A talisman that grants Dexterity a +5 buff and increases your attack power with successive attacks—both of which can strengthen your character in combat. Location : The Windmill Heights Site of Grace, though you must kill Millicent to get it. If you’d rather not, you can get the +5 Dexterity buff from the Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom talisman instead. Winged Sword Insignia . A talisman that increase your character’s attack power with each successive attack. Location : Stillwater Cave, dropped by the defeated Cleanrot Knight boss. Primal Glintstone Blade . A talisman that reduces the focus-point cost of spells by 25% but also reduces maximum hit points by 15%. It’s helpful because it allows you to play with a lower Mind stat (and increase your others instead). Location : Stargazer’s Ruins in the Mountaintops of the Giants, in a chest near the center of the ruins. Radagon Icon . A talisman that reduces the time it takes to cast spells, making it easier to spam incantations during tough battles. Location : The Raya Lucaria Academy, inside a treasure chest on the second floor, near the Debate Parlor’s Site of Grace. Claw Talisman . A talisman that increases your jump attack damage by 15%. Location : Stormveil Castle, on a body atop a watchtower."

Dragon Communion incantations—a subgroup of spells focused on using draconic powers to deal damage—are especially effective with Bleed builds, though there are other valuable incantations too. [10] X Research source Bloodflame Blade . Enchant your right-hand weapon with Bloodflame, allowing you to cause additional Bleed build-up in combat. Requirements : 12 Faith and 10 Arcane. Ekzyke’s Decay . Summon a dragon that can breathe scarlet rot at foes, dealing physical and magic damage as well. Requirements : 23 Faith and 15 Arcane. Rotten Breath . Conjure a cloud of scarlet rot and breathe it on foes, which is a status effect dealing damage over time. Requirements : 15 Faith and 12 Arcane. Swarm of Flies . Release a swarm of bloodflies that deal damage to foes, inflicting Hemorrhage and building up blood loss. Requirements : 11 Faith and 16 Arcane. Dragonice . Spew icy breath at enemies, dealing magic damage and inflicting Frostbite. Requirements: 15 Faith and 12 Arcane. Dragonclaw . Rend foes asunder with the power of a summoned dragon claw. Requirements : 17 Faith and 13 Arcane. Dragonmaw . Summon a dragon head to bite at foes, dealing physical damage. Requirements : 24 Faith and 16 Arcane. Blessing’s Boon .

You can customize your flask using Crystal Tears; the ideal choices for a Bleed build are Leaden Hard Tear (which grants perfect Poise) and Dexterity-knot Crystal Tear (which boosts Dexterity by +10). Then, use the following tactics: [11] X Research source Start fights with a jumping attack so you can get a bonus from your Claw Talisman. Dual-wield any of the blades recommended above to deal as much damage as possible. Use the Seppuku Ash of War when an enemy is particularly tough or won’t bleed."

For example: Blessing’s Boon (or any healing effect) is most useful in areas with many enemies, where you’re more likely to get hit. Similarly, try using Ezyke’s Decay when multiple enemies are close together, ideally to clear out most of a room. Then, use Scarlet Rot to target stronger enemies from a distance. [12] X Research source When you want to use incantations mid-fight, swap out one of your two weapons for the Dragon Communion Seal, then use Ekzyke’s Decay, Dragonclaw, Dragonmaw, Dragonice, or Rotten Breath."
