      "content": "Eat 225-325 grams (1-2.5 cups) of complex carbs each day. Complex carbs are slowly digested and absorbed by the body, which means they provide more nutrients and keep you full longer. It’s a good idea to reach for complex carbs, which include whole-grain flour, sweet potatoes, oats, and/or brown rice. These healthy carbs are usually higher in vitamins and other nutrients than simple carbs, like white bread and white rice. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Choose wheat, multigrain, or rye bread and whole wheat pasta. If you like oatmeal for breakfast, pick whole oats. Depending on your individual needs, your doctor might recommend that you eat fewer carbs."

      "content": "Fill at least half of your plate with vegetables to get 5 servings a day. Veggies are packed with nutrients and are surprisingly easy to sneak into your diet. Consider eating dark leafy greens like kale, collard greens, mustard greens, and Swiss chard. Create a simple sauté with olive oil, garlic, and a little salt and pepper, which will be a surprisingly tasty meal as well as a nutritious one. [2] X Research source Add spinach to a smoothie in the morning to add a serving of leafy greens that you won’t even notice. The next time you make tacos, try throwing in some peppers and onions. Pasta dishes are a great place to add extra veggies. Toss some mushrooms in with your spaghetti or lasagna. Don’t be afraid to try new foods. If you think you don’t like vegetables, just try another kind."

You can grab an apple or pear as a mid-morning snack, or look for ways to integrate fruit into other dishes. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Add berries or a banana to your morning cereal or oatmeal. Fresh fruits taste great in salads.

      "content": "Eat healthy, lean proteins to get more energy. Protein helps you build muscle and gives you a steady supply of energy throughout the day. Choose lean proteins to avoid adding too much fat to your diet. There are great choices that include meat and plant-based proteins. There's an ongoing debate about how much protein you need each day, so check with your doctor or use an online calculator for specific amounts. Some examples of healthy proteins include: [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Lean cuts of chicken, pork, and turkey Fish, such as salmon, white fish, and tuna Nuts like cashews, almonds, and pistachios Beans, such as black beans, pinto beans, and cannellini beans Lentils and chickpeas"

      "content": "Choose healthy fats for 20-35% of your daily calories. You need to consume fat for your body to function correctly. However, it's important to choose the right kind of fats. Read food labels and select foods that are low in saturated fats. Typically, you should aim to eat less than 20-30 grams of saturated fat each day. Choose foods like avocados, salmon, tuna, and nut butter to get the healthy fats that you need. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids are good fats, which you should try to consume regularly. They help lower the \"bad cholesterol\" in your body by raising \"good cholesterol\". Foods that are high in fatty acids are olive oil, nuts, fish oil, and various seed oils. Adding these \"good\" fats to your weekly diet can lower your cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart disease. Avoid trans fats and saturated fats. Trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils, are a form of unsaturated fat commonly found in processed foods. Consuming them raises your risk of heart disease."

Avoid adding salt to your food after it is prepared and try to steer clear of packaged foods that can contain a lot of extra sodium. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Instead of flavoring your food with salt, try adding fresh herbs like cilantro, chives, or dill for a big flavor boost. Canned vegetables can contain a lot of sodium so reach for fresh or frozen whenever possible. Talk to your doctor about how much salt is okay for you to have. If you have high blood pressure or heart issues, you might need to limit your intake even more."

Water is essential for good health, so make sure to drink at least 11.5 (2.7 L) cups a day if you are a woman and 15.5 cups (3.7 L) if you are a man. Try keeping track of how much water you drink so that you know you are getting enough. Try getting a water bottle that is clearly marked so it’s easy to measure. Another good idea is to drink before you even get thirsty. That will help you make sure that you don’t get dehydrated. [7] X Research source Carry water with you so you can easily pick it up when you're thirsty.

      "content": "Eat when you are hungry instead of when you are emotional. It’s normal to turn to food when you are experiencing certain emotions. The key is to pay attention to why you are eating and try to do it only when you are actually hungry. If you find yourself eating more than you would like, start writing down when you eat and how you feel so you can track patterns. [9] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, maybe you eat when you are stressed or sad. Try to find a relaxing activity that can serve as a replacement. Try taking a nice walk or listening to a good podcast instead of reaching for a snack. If you use food as a way to celebrate, that’s totally fine to do in moderation. If you find that you are overindulging during happy times, try to celebrate by treating yourself to something other than food. Maybe you could book a trip or buy yourself a new pair of shoes."

      "content": "Enjoy your food and eat slowly. It takes some time for your stomach to tell your brain that it's full. Circumvent the problem by consuming your food slower. That way, by the time you get the message and start feeling satisfied, you haven't consumed extra food. As a bonus, eating more slowly can help you really savor and appreciate your meal. [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Chew each mouthful 20 to 40 times to fully release all of the flavors. Slow yourself down by waiting 5 or 10 minutes between each course if you’re eating a large meal. Drink a full glass of water throughout your meal. Stopping for sips will slow your eating, as well as help you feel more full. Put your fork down between bites. This is a physical reminder to finish the food in your mouth before taking another bite."

The more you pay attention to how your food is made and where it comes from, the more likely you are to make healthy choices. Try to buy fresh, local food if your location and budget allows for that. [12] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

This will keep you energized throughout the morning. Skipping breakfast might leave you famished by lunch, causing you to binge as a way to compensate. Plan your breakfasts for the week in advance so that it’s easy to grab a simple, healthy meal to start your day. [13] X Research source A small breakfast is better than no breakfast. If you don't feel up to a full meal, at least drink some water and eat a piece of fruit, a protein bar, or a piece of whole-wheat toast. Try some make-ahead options like a fruit and yogurt parfait, a frittata, or overnight oats. Avoid skipping breakfast on the day of an important exam, job interview, or another critical event, where you may be distracted by your hunger or not have enough energy for your brain to work to its full potential."

Doing this allows you to eat slightly less at your meals, giving your body a more manageable amount of food to digest, and keeps your blood sugar at a consistent level throughout the day. A good plan for the day might look like: Breakfast: A smoothie with protein, fruits, and vegetables. Morning snack: An apple with nut butter or a small portion of cheese. Lunch: A salad with lots of veggies, lean proteins, and a grain like quinoa or farro. Afternoon snack: Hummus, bell peppers, and whole wheat pita.

Try to choose meals that use similar ingredients (to make shopping easier), but that have enough variety so that you won’t get bored. If you can, try to prep some of your meals in advance so that you always have a healthy option handy. [15] X Research source You might plan to make veggie fajitas one night, and then use the leftover vegetables in a Mexican-inspired salad the next day, for example. Wash and cut up all of your produce for the week right after you get home from the store. That way, you’ll always have a healthy snack to grab. Try boiling several hard-boiled eggs at the beginning of the week so that you can have a grab and go breakfast or a protein to add to salads."
