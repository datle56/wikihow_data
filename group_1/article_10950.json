      "content": "Choose worsted weight cotton yarn. You'll need a 4-ounce (113 g) skein of worsted weight yarn or #4 yarn like afghan or aran yarn. Look for yarn made from all cotton since acrylic yarn can melt if you set a hot pan on it. [1] X Research source Pick a solid yarn or get multi-colored yarn for a vibrant potholder."

      "title": "Make a slip knot.",
      "content": "Make a slip knot. Pull a length of yarn and twist the end into a loop. Slide your thumb and forefinger into the loop and use them to grab the yarn tail. Hold the working yarn with your other hand so you can pull the tail through the loop near its center or near the loop-side of the tail. Gently pull the working yarn to close the loop around the tail as you pull it through to make another loop. [2] X Research source If you're new to making slip knots , practice a few times. To tell if you've correctly made a slip knot, keep pulling the yarn in opposite directions. The knot should come undone instead of tightening."

Bring the hook through the loop to make 1 chain. Then, repeat this to make a total of 35 chain stitches, which should be around 10 inches (25 cm) long. [4] X Research source This makes the foundation or bottom edge for your potholder. Although gauge doesn't matter very much for this project, you may want to crochet tighter if your chain is longer than 10 inches (25 cm) or make looser stitches if your chain is too short."

      "content": "Make a single crochet (SC) into the foundation chain. Insert your hook into the chain stitch that's closest to the hook and wrap the yarn around it once. Bring the hook back through the chain so you have 2 loops on the hook. Wrap the yarn around the hook 1 more time and pull your hook through the 2 loops to create 1 single crochet stitch. [5] X Research source The single crochet stitch is one of the fastest crochet stitches to work, so this potholder comes together quickly."

Make a SC stitch into the back of each stitch until you reach the other end of the row. You'll make 35 SC stitches along the back of the foundation chain. This completes the first full row of SC. [8] X Research source It's really important that you don't join the rows and turn the work. Instead, remember to SC into the back loops."

You don't need to make extra SC stitches in the corners since you've already established them. Just remember to keep making SC stitches into the stitches of the SC row immediately before it, rather than into the chain stitches. Depending on your tension, you'll need to knit around 40 rows of SC with 71 stitches each. When your potholder is at least 8 inches (20 cm) square, work to the end of the last row you'd like to complete.

Before you sew it closed, however, bring the yarn through your last stitch and make a knot.

Then, tie off the yarn and use your hook to pull the tail into the center of the potholder.
