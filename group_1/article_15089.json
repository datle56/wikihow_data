Using a sharp knife, cut the peel into quarters from top to bottom, leaving a pinky-sized space at both ends so the orange stays intact. [2] X Research source The slits should be about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) deep. You can also place the orange on a cutting board and hold it firmly to make the slits."

The drying process will change the shape of the oranges a little anyway, and mismatched slits can look even more charming and rustic.

[6] X Research source It probably won't take a full day, but be prepared to leave them in there for long time depending on the size of the oranges and the power of your oven. If you need to use your oven for something else during this time, it’s okay to take them out for an hour, just remember to let the oven cool to the lowest heat setting before putting them back in.

If you notice some parts are drier than others, check to make sure that all slits go down to the pulp and cut shallow slits a little deeper if necessary.

[10] X Research source The pulp inside the slits should appear dark orange or maroon with no signs of moisture. [11] X Research source If they feel spongy or sticky, put them back in the oven and check on them in another 4 hours. Don’t worry about over-drying the oranges, so if you’re not sure, leave them in for a little longer. Allow them to cool completely before handling, which will probably take a couple hours."
