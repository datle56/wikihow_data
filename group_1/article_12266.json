      "content": "Use the microwave if you plan to cook the chicken immediately. Microwaving frozen chicken leads to uneven thawing (some parts of the outside may even begin to cook in the microwave), which can affect the texture, moisture, and taste of the chicken later. It also warms the chicken into the “Danger Zone,” making bacteria growth more likely. [1] X Research source The microwave is best for boneless, skinless chicken breasts since they’re more likely to thaw evenly compared to other cuts or whole chickens. [2] X Research source"

If not, continue to defrost in 1-minute intervals until the chicken is thawed all the way through. [4] X Research source Be careful to follow your microwave's specific instructions and power levels to make sure that the chicken does not start to cook. If your microwave doesn’t have a defrost setting or you’re not sure how much power to use, set the power to 20%. [5] X Research source Depending on the thickness of the chicken and your particular microwave, this method may take up to 10 minutes."

Plan to cook your chicken right away once it’s thawed to kill any germs that may have gathered while defrosting.

      "title": "Seal your chicken in a plastic freezer bag if it’s not already wrapped.",
      "content": "Seal your chicken in a plastic freezer bag if it’s not already wrapped. The leak-proof bag will keep bacteria from contaminating the chicken during the thawing process, as well prevent the chicken’s bacteria from contaminating the surfaces around it. If the chicken is still in its original packaging, use that. [7] X Research source Do not use the chicken’s original packaging if it’s been torn or damaged in any way. Cold water thaws chicken faster than the refrigerator, but requires more of your attention throughout the process. A pound (455 g) of chicken may take an hour or less to thaw, while a 3-4 pound (1.4-1.8 kg) package may take 2-3 hours. A whole chicken takes about 30 minutes per pound (455 g).

Do not use warm or hot water—this brings the chicken into the “Danger Zone” and may encourage bacteria growth. If you’re thawing a whole chicken, use your kitchen sink if you can’t find a bowl large enough to hold it."

When the water is allowed to warm up, the chicken may enter the “Danger Zone” while it thaws, resulting in bacteria growth. Empty and refresh the cold water about every half hour to keep the chicken thawing at a safe rate. [9] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source If you’re unavailable to change the water every 30 minutes, ask a family member or someone who will be around to change out the water for you. Alternatively, place the bagged chicken in the sink and allow cold water to run over it until defrosted. However, this method wastes a lot of water and doesn’t shave much time or effort off of letting the chicken sit in cold water, so it may not be worth it."

Go to source There’s a slight chance that some bacteria may grow during the cold water thawing method if the chicken ever sits in the “Danger Zone” (for example, if you were late to change the cold water). To protect yourself, cook the chicken right away to kill any germs. Once the chicken is cooked, refrigerate or freeze it again for storage. Do not freeze or refrigerate raw chicken that has been thawed with the cold water method without cooking it first. If the plastic bag was damaged or punctured during thawing, make sure to thoroughly wash the bowl or sink and counters to kill any chicken germs that may have spread."

Using the refrigerator is the safest way to defrost your chicken because it keeps your meat out of the “Danger Zone” where bacteria can grow (40-140°F (4-60°C)), but it is the method that takes the longest. The exact amount of time it takes to defrost depends on the cut and weight of the chicken: Individual chicken breasts, thighs, or drumsticks typically take 12-24 hours to fully thaw. [11] X Research source A small whole chicken or clump of chicken frozen together that weighs under 5 lb (2.3 kg) will take about 24 hours.

If you’re unsure, cut a small slit in the thickest part of the chicken and slip your fingertip inside—the flesh should be soft without any ice crystals. If you’re thawing a whole chicken, place your hand in the major cavity of the chicken. If there are ice crystals within the chicken, it needs to be defrosted longer."

Always check the temperature of your chicken with a food thermometer to ensure it’s cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 °F (74 °C), especially when cooking from frozen.
