      "title": "Join a rhythmic gymnastics club in your area.",
      "content": "Join a rhythmic gymnastics club in your area. Consider the distance from your home, cost of classes, and training schedule when choosing a club. Visit the club and make sure the equipment, including the mats, are in good condition and are cleaned often. The gym should also have multiple coaches with rhythmic gymnastics training and experience that focus on safety above all else. If you are looking to compete seriously in rhythmic gymnastics, ensure the gym has advanced training tools, like a pit, trampoline, and tumble-track. Do an Internet search to find clubs in your area if you live outside the U.S. The cost of classes can vary widely. Contact a few local gyms to see what classes cost in your area. Some schools offer rhythmic gymnastics programs. This can help lower some of the costs for kids and adolescents."

      "content": "Adhere to the club’s dress code. Generally, to practice, rhythmic gymnasts wear a black dance-style leotard with black leggings or shorts. No jewelry is permitted and your hair must be tied back neatly, usually in a bun. You can wear toe shoes (also called half shoes which aid in turning) or go barefoot for both practice and competition. For competition, rhythmic gymnasts wear a beautifully decorated unitard or rhythmic leotard with a short skirt. Practice your routine a few times in your competition outfit so you can work out any issues if necessary."

      "title": "Get the necessary supplies.",
      "content": "Get the necessary supplies. When starting out, the gym will generally provide the apparatuses, but you should purchase your own if you plan to practice at home. You may also want toe shoes, a variety of leotards, adhesive tape to decorate your apparatuses, and a ribbon roller. Choose a high-quality gym bag to carry all your equipment and supplies. Expect to pay between $100 and $200 USD for a set of all 5 apparatuses, depending on the quality. Toe shoes cost around $35, training leotards are about $20, and competition leotards range from $100 to $300 each."

      "content": "Exercise outside of class. If you want to be a rhythmic gymnast, you’ll need to dedicate yourself to practicing. Even if you don’t always visit the club or take classes, aim for 360-minute exercise sessions per week outside of the gym. You should also stretch for 40 minutes every day to increase your flexibility. [2] X Research source Do the butterfly stretch , a backbend , or arm exercises. You can also swim , jog , or ride your bike ."

Aim to eat lean proteins, such as chicken and fish, and lots of veggies, like eggplant, leafy greens, and carrots. You can have small amounts of fruit, including berries and melons, and grains, like cereals or breads, too. Make sure you are drinking at least 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of water per day to stay hydrated.

      "content": "Try the ball. Gymnasts usually start with the ball as their first apparatus. A ball routine will include bouncing, throwing, and rolling. Practice rolling the ball from one hand, down your arm, across the back of your neck, and down the other arm. You can also throw the ball high up in the air and catch it with your legs or feet. Try throwing the ball and completing a trick, like a front walkover , then catching the ball. [4] X Research source The ball is usually made of either rubber or synthetic rubber. It has a diameter of 18 to 20 cm (7.25 to 8 in) and must weigh above 400 g (0.9 lb). The ball can be any color."

Practice doing turns or spins while jump roping , or twirl or toss the rope while doing tricks, like the splits . You could also do a cat or stag leap over the rope. [5] X Research source The rope is generally made of hemp or a similar material, and the length varies depending on the height of the gymnast. One or two knots are tied on each end to aid in holding on to the rope, which must be either all or partially colored. Stand with both feet on the middle of the rope and hold the ends up alongside your body. The ends of the rope will fit directly under each armpit if it is the right length. [6] X Research source"

Try to throw the hoop up in the air and do a trick, like a cartwheel , before catching it. You can also toss the hoop in front of you and dive through it or rotate the hoop around the ankle while doing a back walkover . [7] X Research source The hoop may be made of wood or plastic and can be any color. The hoop should be between 51 to 90 cm (20 to 35.5 in) in diameter, and it must weigh at least 300 g (0.66 lb)."

      "content": "Learn how to use the clubs. Two clubs are used and may be juggled, tossed, or thrown. Swing them around and practice completing turns or tricks after you toss them up in the air. You can also toss and catch the clubs then move into a trick, like a dive roll or a handstand . [8] X Research source The clubs may be made of wood or synthetic material. The length of each club is from 40 to 50 cm (15.75 to 19.66 in). Each club must weigh above 150 g (0.33 lb) and is typically weighted on each end. The shape is similar to a bottle. The neck and head may be covered with adhesive tape."

      "content": "Try out the ribbon. The ribbon is one of the most popular—and difficult—apparatuses. Practice making patterns with your ribbon, like spirals or zigzags, but be careful not to get a knot in it. You can also manipulate the ribbon while doing tricks, like pirouettes and penche. [9] X Research source The ribbon itself may be satin or another non-starched material. It may be any color, and it must weigh at least 35 g (1.25 oz). The width of the ribbon should be 4 to 6 cm (1.5 to 2.4 in). The length from one end to the other must be at least 6 m (20 ft). The stick may be made of bamboo, wood, plastic, or fiberglass."

      "content": "Improve your endurance. Rhythmic gymnasts are constantly moving and performing tricks back to back. To increase your endurance, run a mile each day, then perform one of your routines immediately afterward. You can also practice performing several of your routines back to back. [12] X Research source Track the time it takes you to run a mile to see if you are making progress. For instance, if you started out at 10 minutes and have shortened the time to 8 minutes in the course of a month or so, you’re on the right track. If you’re consistently sore or if your joints hurt, you may be pushing yourself too far. [13] X Research source"

Aim to strength train for 60 minutes 3 times a week. Do pull ups and push ups , along with crunches and planks. Also try squats and lunges .

      "title": "Improve leaps and jumps.",
      "content": "Improve leaps and jumps . Leaps and jumps are a crucial part of rhythmic gymnastics. The difference between a leap and a jump is while a jump starts and lands on two feet, a leap takes off of one foot and lands on the other. With this display of flexibility along with the look and feeling of weightlessness, rhythmic gymnasts spend much of their time on these elements. Once you have a single jump or leap down, practice combinations. Some types of jumps and leaps to master are: [15] X Research source Split leap and a split jump (jump with a split at the height). Straddle leap and straddle jump (also known as side leap or jump). Leaps or jumps with twists (where a turn is added while in the air). Donut or sheep jump (the gymnast touches their head with both feet)."

Turns often include more than one rotation, and improving your balance will help when learning turns and pirouettes. Master single turns before trying doubles, triples, or combinations. Some turns to aim to learn are: [16] X Research source Fouettés (often done en tournant or à la second). Pirouettes (including double or triple pirouettes). Ring turn (a turn in a needle position)."
