[12] X Research source The price of these plans may be high, with a common rate being roughly $0.50 USD per 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ), but it is typically more cost effective than attempting a large scale project without proper documentation of your home's structure.

Be careful that you accurately depict your home's structure in the blueprints."
