      "content": "Create zones for your interests or hobbies. Of course, you will be sleeping in your bedroom, but you probably use it for other activities as well. You may want to plan for a space to do homework or crafts, choose a spot for playing video games or watching television, designate an area for practicing a musical instrument, or set aside a space for doing your hair or makeup. [1] X Research source If you have a ton of activities and interests, try to make spaces for just a few of your favorites. This will help prevent the activity or hobby spaces from becoming overwhelming."

      "title": "Pick your colors or theme.",
      "content": "Pick your colors or theme. Think about what items you already have that you want to reuse. If you love your bedspread, choose colors that match or accent it for painting or accessories. If your favorite color is red, choose 1 or 2 light accent colors to go with it. Be sure to thoroughly consider what colors or theme you want, and think about if you will still like it in a few months or even a few years. [2] X Research source A few ideas for themes include: music, sports, technology, nautical, retro, modern, metropolitan, and boho. If you’re not sure how to begin, start by picking a color you like and go from there."

      "content": "Paint or paper your walls. Changing the wall color can give your room a whole new feel. You can paint your walls or put up temporary wallpaper. Feel free to paint only 1 wall, all of them, or even the ceiling. If you choose a dark color, it’s best to use it on an accent wall rather than for your entire room. Be sure to get your parents’ permission, follow all directions, and ventilate the area. [3] X Research source If you’re not allowed to paint or paper your walls, try adding a mural or decorating with peel-and-stick decals. You could also make the space look fresh with wall hangings, framed pictures, or other wall décor.

      "title": "Pick a desk.",
      "content": "Pick a desk. A desk is an essential part of your room. You can use it to do your homework, surf the web, write in your journal, etc. Choose one that fits your needs as well as your personal style; maybe you want a simple, streamlined desk or perhaps you need one with lots of drawers or built-in shelves. Don’t forget to pick a chair to go with your desk, and ensure it is the right height for writing or typing comfortably. If possible, try to sit at the desk before you buy it. That way, you’ll know whether it’s comfortable and a good size for you. A desk can also double as a vanity where you can do your hair and makeup."

      "content": "Dress up your bed. An interesting bed frame is a great way to personalize your room; consider a funky headboard or even a sleigh bed, depending on your style. A bedspread or comforter can also be a statement piece for your room. Choose a bold pattern or a fun texture to add personality to your room. If your walls are patterned or filled with poster and photos, you may want to stick with a solid bedspread to keep the room from becoming too busy.

      "content": "Set out seating. You’ll likely want a space other than your bed for you or your guests to sit on. Beanbag chairs are relatively cheap and are super comfy. Gaming chairs are great for those who love to play, or you could add ottomans that open for extra seating as well as storage. Pillows also make great seating, so set out some colorful or printed pillows if you can’t get new chairs. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a lot of space to work with, ottoman storage cubes are a perfect option. These can serve triple duty as seats, storage containers, and little tables!"

      "title": "Decide where things will go.",
      "content": "Decide where things will go. It’s usually best to start with your bed and move on from there. Keep in mind those activities you thought of when planning your new space. Create zones for different purposes, such as sleeping, working, relaxing, and playing. You can use a curtain, or even furniture, to separate the spaces, like putting a desk in the middle of your room to separate your sleeping area from the space where you watch television or play video games. [8] X Research source Think about your daily routines when you’re arranging your space. For example, you’ll need to have plenty of room in front of your dresser so that you can easily open the drawers when you’re getting dressed in the morning."

      "title": "Cover your windows.",
      "content": "Cover your windows. Blinds or drapes can help block out the light at night as well as give you some privacy. Choose blinds or curtains that fit your style and the theme or colors you chose for your room. [9] X Research source Even if you can’t change your window coverings completely, you can still add your own style. For example, consider adding a sheer curtain over your blinds for a pop of color. You could even hang beads over your windows or in your doorway. If you want a darker space for daytime naps, try putting in blackout shades or curtains."

      "content": "Light up your room. Lamps or lanterns are essential for your room. Not only will they give you extra lighting, but they are a great way to tie in accent colors or personalize your space. You could even go with a neon sign for an extra cool touch. [10] X Research source Make sure to get lights for essential areas. For example, get a reading light for your nightstand and a lamp for your desk or work area."

      "title": "Add rugs.",
      "content": "Add rugs. Rugs are a nice way to change the look and feel of your bedroom. A fun and funky print can liven up your space as well as add some extra padding if you have hardwood floors. Choose 1 large rug or a few smaller ones, depending on your space. [11] X Research source Even if you already have a carpet, a rug on top can help keep the carpet clean. It can also add a little extra warmth and softness to the floor, which is great when you step out of bed on cold mornings."

      "title": "Hang posters",
      "content": "Hang posters or photos. These will help you personalize the space. Choose a dreamy landscape to help you relax, or an informational poster, like the periodic table, to keep your mind sharp. You can also put up maps, calendars, or cork boards. Add pictures of yourself, your pets, your friends, and your family to make the room your own. Add items that help the room feel like you. For example, you might choose posters of your favorite movies or bands, print out some photos you took, or put up some of your own drawings. A great thing about picture frames and cork boards is that you can change out the pictures for new ones whenever you want to update your space!"

      "content": "Get a wastebasket. This is an essential item for keeping your space tidy. Place the wastebasket in a part of your room where you’re most likely to use it. For example, if you like to snack at your desk while you’re doing your homework, put the wastebasket there so you can easily throw away wrappers, napkins, and crumbs. If you do throw away a lot of food garbage, remember to take out the trash regularly so it doesn’t start to smell or attract bugs. Look for a garbage bin or wastebasket that fits your space and matches the style of your room."

      "content": "Keep bins under your bed for extra storage space. If you don’t have a lot of room to keep your stuff, the space under your bed can make a great storage area. Measure the space so that you know what size the bins need to be to fit there. Look for clear plastic bins with lids so you can see the stuff inside while also protecting it from dust. [13] X Research source You can also buy rolling shelves designed to fit under beds. These are great because they’re super easy to slide in and out!"

You can put them above your bed or over your desk, or even get shelves that are angled to fit in corners. Use them to store books and other items or to display decorations and collectibles.

Look for an organizer that has space for shoes, accessories, and any other items you want to keep in your closet. Keep items that you use a lot front and center, where you can reach them easily. If you have items in the closet that you rarely need (like that sleeping bag you use once a year on family camping trips), put them up high or in the back. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Start a daily tidying routine. The best way to keep your room clean and tidy is to work on it a little bit every day. Set aside a few minutes to make your bed, pick up any clothes that didn’t make it to the hamper, and throw any loose trash in your wastebasket. Take a look around and tidy up any other objects that are out of place. [16] X Research source Make time to sweep or vacuum occasionally, and don’t forget to take out the trash! If you ever eat in your room, make sure to bring any used dishes, cups, and utensils back to the kitchen."
