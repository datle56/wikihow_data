      "content": "Believe it or not, vinegar absorbs odors. Whether you’ve recently cooked fish or you're dealing with an overheating appliance, putting a bowl of white vinegar in the smelly space can do wonders. Simply fill a bowl or open container with 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of white vinegar and leave it on a counter or table. [1] X Research source If you’re preparing to cook fish, try placing a couple drops of vinegar on the raw fish to help eliminate odors. If a fishy odor is in your home and you haven’t recently prepared fish, it’s most likely because a wire, circuit breaker, or outlet is overheating. This is extremely dangerous, so contact an electrician right away."

Wash heavily-soiled towels in their own load to avoid spreading bacteria. [12] X Research source Have multiple towels ready to go, so you can swap them out the minute one gets dirty."
