Make a slipknot to get started and then yarn over and pull through the slipknot to make your first chain. Yarn over and pull through twice more to make your first 3 chain stitches. [1] X Research source Keep chaining multiples of 3 until you are happy with the length. [2] X Research source If you just want to practice this stitch, then try making a chain of 12. This will allow you to create a sample swatch. For a larger item, such as a washcloth, scarf, or blanket, make chains in multiples of 3 until the chain is the length that you want the finished project to be."

      "content": "Go behind the next stitch to make a front post double crochet stitch. Next, you need to work a double crochet stitch into the back of one of your stitches from the previous row. This is called a front post double crochet stitch. The only difference between a front post double crochet stitch and regular double crochet stitch is that after you yarn over for the first time, you need to insert the hook behind the stitch rather than going into it. Insert your hook behind the stitch that is just below your next stitch. Then, yarn over again and complete the double crochet stitch as usual. [7] X Research source Make sure to work the front post double crochet stitch behind the top of your last double crochet stitch, and not into the stitch. Working the stitch this way will push the yarn forward and help to form the waffle pattern. [8] X Research source"
