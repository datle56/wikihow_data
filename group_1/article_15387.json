      "title": "Eat the right amount of protein.",
      "content": "Eat the right amount of protein. You probably know that the body builder's diet is very high in protein. Growing muscles do need quite a lot of it, but past that point any extra protein is just calories, and therefore less effective than carbs. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For most people, 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day should be plenty. [2] X Research source However, body builders need to get between 1.2 and 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. [3] X Research source To find your weight in kilograms, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2. For example, 200 pounds divided by 2.2 is about 91 kilograms. To get your daily range for grams of protein, just multiply your weight in kilograms by 1.2 and then by 1.7. For example, 91 x 1.2 = 109 and 91 x 1.7 = 155. This means that your range for the day would be between 109 and 155 grams per day. (You can round your answers up or down to the nearest whole number for convenience.) Some good options for high-protein meals include: London broil/top round steak, salmon, chicken breast and pork tenderloin. Being vegetarian or vegan doesn't mean you can't eat like a body builder. In fact, vegan body builders are becoming more and more common. Some vegan substitutes include soy (and other legumes), seitan, quinoa, buckwheat, and mycoprotein. [4] X Research source For breakfast, try egg yolks and oatmeal, or high-protein cereal and a protein shake. Stay away from sugary cereals. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Never skip meals.",
      "content": "Never skip meals. Skipping meals is as bad as skipping workouts. Your body needs the nutrients in your meals to keep building mass. [7] X Research source If life makes it hard to schedule meals, consider keeping a small cooler with you with a meal or two in it at all times. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep it balanced.",
      "content": "Keep it balanced. While protein is crucial, it's also important to eat balanced meals. In particular, vegetables and complex carbohydrates need to be a staple in your diet. [9] X Research source Some bodybuilders recommend asparagus, broccoli, or spinach, but there are many other options."

      "title": "Moderate the fat.",
      "content": "Moderate the fat. Some fat is fine, but avoid excessive amounts. Avoid foods with added fats like butter and fried foods. In particular skip the butter, oil, and rich sauces when possible. Use a light cooking spray in the place of butter and oil whenever you can. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid processed food.",
      "content": "Avoid processed food. Body builders try to \"eat clean.\" This means that you should avoid unhealthy choices like fast food and processed food. [12] X Research source These foods turn into fat and not muscle. Remember, you are what you eat! [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't eat sweets.",
      "content": "Don't eat sweets. You should avoid refined sugars and other simple carbohydrates in most scenarios. These foods are empty calories that take the place of healthier options that build muscle mass. [14] X Research source Your best bet is to get these foods out of your home so you aren't tempted to eat them. [15] X Research source Carbohydrates before bed are the worst. Because you won't be exercising for several hours, your body will store these carbs as fat. [16] X Research source There is one exception to this rule: right after a hard workout, some simple carbohydrates are okay. If you're craving a bagel right after a session at the gym, you can indulge that craving, as long as you don't forget to eat your protein. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Dine out moderately and carefully. When you eat out, you lose some control over what goes into your meal. Restaurant food in general also usually contains more fat and salt than the food you prepare at home. Try not to eat out too often. [18] X Research source When you do eat out, try to stick to clean proteins and simple vegetable side dishes. Scan the menu for the choice that best fits the body building diet.

      "title": "Don't eat too much.",
      "content": "Don't eat too much. Many people hear \"bulk up\" and assume that means you have free reign to eat as much as you want. This is definitely not the case. Body builders need to watch the amount they eat just as much as anyone else. [20] X Research source The math here is simple. If you are taking in more calories than you are burning off through exercise, your body will store those calories as fat. As a body builder, your calorie threshold might be higher than the average couch potato. But that threshold is still there. [21] X Research source It's a good idea to read food labels, count calories, and make sure you are taking in as close to the right amount of protein as possible. You need lots, but there is such a thing as too much. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Cheat occasionally. It's usually a good idea to plan for occasional cheating. If you know you get to cheat on a meal, maybe once a week, it will help control the temptation to cheat at other times. [23] X Research source You can use you \"cheat\" meal as a reward for reaching workout goals. This can be a strong motivator! [24] X Research source"

      "title": "Snack on micellar casein protein before bed.",
      "content": "Snack on micellar casein protein before bed. A pre-bedtime snack can help you fight the urge for an unhealthy midnight snack. Some bodybuilders swear by micellar casein protein for this, either as a supplement or in cottage cheese. [25] X Research source The argument goes that this protein takes longer to digest, letting your slower nighttime metabolism take full advantage of it. This is because it is a milk-derived protein that curdles when it contacts the acid in your stomach. This curdling slows down digestion and absorption of amino acids."

      "title": "Consider changing the type of fat you eat.",
      "content": "Consider changing the type of fat you eat. Fats pack in a lot of calories in a small volume, making it easier to meet your meal goals when bulking up. You definitely need some fat for a healthy diet anyway â€” the question is, what kind? Most experts tout monounsaturated fatty acids and Omeg-3 fatty acids, found in fish and avocadoes. [26] X Research source Saturated fat is generally considered unhealthy, but some bodybuilders suggest fitting a small amount into your diet. Monounsaturated fatty acids and Omega-3 fatty acids are important for muscle growth. They can be found in foods like fish and avocados."

      "title": "Consider taking supplements.",
      "content": "Consider taking supplements. Used in moderation, dietary supplements can help you fill in any gaps in your diet. Prepackaged body building supplements, along with a good protein powder, can compliment your daily meals. [27] X Research source It's important, however, not to over-rely on supplements. You should be getting the bulk of your nutrition from fresh foods, which are better for your body. Supplement sellers often make inaccurate claims. Most will not have any effect that you couldn't replicate with a good diet."

One common myth claims you need to eat 6+ meals a day to encourage glycogen storage, or replenish amino acids, or prevent catabolism. A thorough look at the evidence demolishes these ideas. [28] X Research source [29] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source What matters is the amount of calories and nutrients you consume, not how you spread it throughout the day. If you feel better and work out harder on 3-4 larger meals a day, go for it."
