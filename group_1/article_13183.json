      "content": "Look on your city’s website for yard waste pickup times and rules. Most towns and cities have a curbside yard waste pickup service, but every community has its own rules and regulations about what they will pick up, when they pick it up, and how you have to leave it. Go to your local government’s website and find the page about yard waste collection, then read all the information before you set out leaves and branches for pickup. [1] X Research source If you don’t know what your city’s website is, you can do a quick google search with keywords like “yard waste collection” or “yard waste pickup” and the name of where you live. For example, “yard waste collection Seattle Washington.” Many communities distribute yard waste bins along with recycling bins and garbage bins, which makes it easy to put your leaves and branches out for collection. If you do have a yard waste bin, it’s still important to read up on local guidelines about what you can and can’t put in the bin, what days and times the city picks up yard waste, and other important info."

      "content": "Put leaves and small branches in a yard waste bin or a paper lawn and leaf bag. Throw the leaves and branches you want to dispose of into your city-provided yard waste bin, if you have one. Use paper lawn and leaf bags if you don’t have a yard waste bin or if your yard waste bin is full and you have additional leaves and branches to dispose of. [2] X Research source You can purchase paper lawn and leaf bags online or at any home improvement center. Department stores and garden centers also usually sell them. Some communities might also allow you to put leaves and branches in a container labeled “yard waste only.” This is a piece of information you would be able to find on your local government’s website. If any small branches are too gnarly to fit neatly into your yard waste bin or lawn and leaf bags, you can saw them up or break them apart until they fit."

      "content": "Bundle large branches together with twine or rope. Look on your city’s website to find out the maximum allowed dimensions for bundled branches. Gather large branches together into neat bundles that are no bigger than the permitted dimensions, then tie a piece of twine or rope around the bundles to secure the branches together. [4] X Research source For example, you might only be permitted to put out bundles that are up to 4 ft (1.2 m) long and 2 ft (0.61 m) wide. There might also be limitations on how big the branches can be, such as up to 4 in (10 cm) in diameter. Note that branches and other yard waste generated by landscapers are usually not allowed to be left for curbside pickup. In other words, if you hire a landscaper to trim your trees and rake leaves, they are responsible for disposing of the waste."

      "content": "Set your yard waste by the curb before the designated day and time for pickup. Double-check what days and times your city collects yard waste. Place your yard waste bin, paper lawn and leaf bags, and bundles of branches neatly by the curb where you normally place your garbage and recycling before the designated time, so it will get picked up by the city’s collection service. [5] X Research source For example, your city’s yard waste collection time might be between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. on Mondays. In this case, you would have to put out your leaves and branches on Sunday night or before 7:00 a.m. on Monday. Make sure that your yard waste is not obstructing bike lanes, sidewalks, or traffic. If you miss the collection time for some reason, wait until the next pickup day to put your yard waste out. Don’t just leave it sitting out for days until the next time the city comes around to collect it."

      "content": "Search online for a local yard waste drop-off facility. Google keywords like “yard waste drop-off site,” “yard waste disposal facility,” or “composting center” and the name of where you live to find somewhere you can haul your leaves and branches to. Note the locations of each facility, the times they accept drop-offs, and what materials they do and do not accept. This is an alternative to putting your yard waste out for collection if you need to get rid of a large amount of yard waste, if there is no curbside pickup service in your area, or if you are a professional landscaper who is responsible for disposing of the yard waste you generate. You might find a variety of facilities in your area that accept leaves and branches, such as composting depots, dumps, recycling facilities, and even community gardens. You can choose the site that is most convenient to you."

Make sure they fall within the size limitations allowed by the drop-off site you will take them too.

      "content": "Place leaves into paper lawn and leaf bags. Most drop-off facilities require you to deliver leaves and plant trimmings inside paper lawn and leaf bags. Fill each bag up as much as possible to minimize the number of bags you use. [7] X Research source Yard waste recycling facilities usually won’t accept leaves if they are inside plastic bags."

Double-check the hours that your chosen facility is open on the day you plan to drop off your yard waste. Load the leaves and branches into a vehicle and drive them to the facility.

      "content": "Hire someone to haul your yard waste away if you don’t have a proper vehicle. Contract a landscaper, a waste hauler, or just someone with a pickup truck to come take your yard waste to a drop-off facility if you don’t have a vehicle that you can fit your leaves and branches into. Schedule a time for them to come pick up the yard waste and take it away to properly dispose of it at a facility. [9] X Research source There are lots of junk hauling services that will take away pretty much anything you can imagine. You can find these services by Googling something like “yard waste hauling service” or “junk haulers” and the name of where you live."

      "content": "Mow over leaves to mulch them into your lawn. Spread leaves out over your lawn using a rake or leave them where they have fallen off of trees. Run a lawnmower over them to cut them up into fine mulch that will decompose into the soil under your lawn and provide additional nutrients. Make sure there are no branches or large pieces of debris on your lawn before you start mowing over the leaves."

      "content": "Put layers of leaves in a composting bin to turn them into useful compost. Layer leaves into a backyard composter along with kitchen scraps, lawn trimmings, and other organic matter. They will decompose and turn into compost that you can use for gardening projects. If you don’t have a composting bin, you can build one on a free afternoon. Composting will cut down on the amount of yard waste you have to put out for collection or haul away, not to mention it’s useful and great for the environment!"

      "content": "Burn leaves and branches if it is permitted in your area and safe to do so. Check local bylaws to find out if burning yard waste is permitted in your area. Create piles of yard waste in large, open areas, away from anything flammable like overhanging trees or buildings, and set your leaves and branches on fire to dispose of them. [10] X Research source Burning leaves and branches emits pollutants, and there’s always a risk of accidentally spreading a fire, so use this technique as a last resort. Try to recycle as much as you can by turning leaves into mulch or compost, then burn whatever you can’t use. If you live in a rural area without a yard waste collection service or a nearby drop-off facility, this might be the most practical method to get rid of your leaves and branches."
