This method should be used with round heads of cabbage, the most common being green cabbage, red (or purple) cabbage, and savoy cabbage. Note that there are some similarities between this method and the standard method used for cutting long cabbages, but there are a few small difference, as well."

[1] X Research source If you are using a wooden or plastic cutting board, stabilize it by placing a dry dish towel underneath. This prevents the board from slipping around as you cut the cabbage. It is not usually necessary if you have a non-slip cutting mat, though. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Slice the cabbage in half lengthwise. Cut the cabbage in half from top to bottom, slicing it straight through the stem or core end. Hold the cabbage steady with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand. Cut carefully so that you do not accidentally slip and cut yourself while working with the cabbage."

      "title": "Make another lengthwise cut in each half.",
      "content": "Make another lengthwise cut in each half. Turn each half so that it sits cut-side down. Cut each half in half again, cutting through the core once more, essentially dividing the head into quarters. [3] X Research source Since the cut-side is flat, it will be easier to hold the cabbage still with that side facing the surface. Once you cut the cabbage into quarters, though, the quarters will need to be flipped over so that the cut-sides face up, thereby exposing the core."

Make an angled cut on either side of the core to remove it from each quarter. [4] X Research source At this point, you should also peel off any tough or wilted outer leaves. This is also the point in time at which you should rinse the cabbage under cool, running water."

Hold the cabbage steady with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand. Cut carefully so that you do not accidentally slip and cut yourself while working with the cabbage. Stabilize the cutting board by placing a dry dish towel underneath. This may not be necessary if you have a non-slip cutting mat, however."

[7] X Research source You could try this method with a long cabbage variety, like napa cabbage, but you may not have much success. Long varieties of cabbage tend to have looser leaves, and you may lose too many of the inner leaves while trying to remove the core via boiling, as called for in this method."

      "content": "Remove any damaged leaves. Peel off any torn, damaged, or wilting leaves before proceeding to core the head of cabbage. Most of the outer leaves will drop off once you dunk the cabbage in the boiling water. Since the good leaves can be preserved, however, it is still advisable that you separate the bad leaves ahead of time."

      "content": "Stick a fork into the core. Apply firm pressure so that you can shove the prongs of a metal fork as deep into the center of the core as possible. Ideally, the fork will be inserted so far that the individual prongs will be just barely visible from the outside of the cabbage. A good portion of the fork needs to be stuck inside. To test whether or not enough has been inserted, try lifting the cabbage with nothing but the fork. If it does not drop off or show signs of doing so, you have inserted enough of the fork into the core."

      "title": "Cut around the core.",
      "content": "Cut around the core. Use a smooth knife to cut a circular incision around the core of the cabbage head. Hold the fork with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand. Cut carefully, especially as you turn the knife toward the hand holding the fork. Being careful can help prevent you from accidentally cutting yourself while working with the cabbage. If you want to skip the boiling part altogether, try cutting into the core at an angled circle, with the knife tip facing inward toward the center of the cabbage. If you plan to follow through with the boiling steps, however, cut a vertically straight circle all the way around the core."

If you were unable to remove the core, dip the head of cabbage into the boiling water and let it cook for a few minutes, just until it begins to soften. [8] X Research source Work carefully to avoid burning yourself with the boiling water or the hot steam. After about 5 minutes, the outer leaves should start falling off. This is when you can remove the cabbage from the boiling water."

The core should be easier to remove at this point now that it has been softened. The tip of the knife should point toward the center of the cabbage as you work around the core."

    {
      "title": "Use the remaining cabbage as desired.",
      "content": "Use the remaining cabbage as desired. Since this method is a little more involved and more difficult than the standard method, it is generally only used for recipes that require a whole head of cabbage, such as stuffed whole cabbage. [9] X Research source This method is also ideal when you want to cook the core whole, since the other methods require you to cut the core into sections before removing it."
