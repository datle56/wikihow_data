      "content": "Discover the person's year of birth and the local jurisdiction where they were born. Birth records are often held at the county level, so you will need to know at least the state and preferably the local jurisdiction to recover them. If you do not already know when and where your relative was born, then you can try using census records or ancestry websites to discover this information. Check the online index of census records for the years 1790-1940. These can show you if the person's name appears in the census. If so, you can look up their information at the National Archives or one of the 14 regional archives. Census records are confidential for 72 years, so the 1940 census is the latest one that can be searched.

Some like familysearch.org let you look through databases for free. In most cases, you cannot see the actual certificates, but you can view the information from them. There are also fee-based services like archives.com and ancestry.com, which offer free trials during which you can access the information you desire. Be aware that records are confidential for all but immediate family records for 75 or more years after the birth date. In addition, most states did not begin recording birth records until after 1880 (usually around 1905), so the amount of records which are in the public domain is limited. Local counties or cities may sometimes have older records that have been digitized. If using a paid site, be sure to cancel your membership before your trial is up to avoid being charged."
