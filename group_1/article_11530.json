[1] X Research source Under the new program, DoorDash drivers (called Dashers) can earn points by performing well on their deliveries. After accumulating enough points, they'll qualify for access to three different Dasher Reward tiers—Silver, Gold, and Platinum—and a wide range of benefits. Dasher Rewards combines several separate rewards programs—including Top Dasher, Dash Now, Priority Access, Large Orders Program, Early Access Scheduling, and VIP Support—into one app that's easier to navigate. The reason for the change, DoorDash said, was that the separate programs \"didn't always work together and could be confusing.\" [2] X Research source"

Meanwhile, the Gold tier requires 65-74 points and the Platinum tier requires 75-100 points. Once a Dasher reaches a new tier, they must maintain or increase their points or they'll be demoted to the next lowest tier.

However, DoorDash does offer a few perks to new Dashers to help them pass this requirement as quickly as possible. You get those perks regardless of whether you have a high Overall Dasher Rating or not, but only during those first 50 deliveries. [4] X Research source By the 50th delivery, you'll have hopefully raised your Overall Dasher Rating to at least 60 points so you can immediately begin accessing Dasher Rewards. Some of the perks new Dashers enjoy are Dash Now; priority access to high-paying orders; and 24/7 VIP Support. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Earn points based on your performance to access the 3 reward tiers. DoorDash awards points based on how well Dashers perform across 4 categories: accepting orders (up to 25 points), completing orders (up to 35 points), delivering them on time (up to 30 points), and earning high customer ratings (up to 10 points). These points contribute to their Overall Dasher Rating, which determines which rewards tier they qualify for. [6] X Research source In the old rewards program, Top Dasher, DoorDash evaluated Dashers' performance on the last day of every month and moved them up or down in tiers depending on how well they scored. In the new Dasher Rewards program, Dashers are assessed on a rolling basis. So if, for example, they earn enough points to move up to Gold (the second tier) in the middle of the month, they'll immediately get access to those new rewards."

[7] X Research source This incentivizes Dashers to continue accepting and completing as many orders as possible, as well as delivering all of them on-time and gaining high customer ratings. If you lose points or your ratings drop , you'll fall down to the next lowest reward tier. If your Overall Dasher Rating drops below 60 points (the minimum amount needed to qualify for Silver), you'll lose your Dasher Rewards completely until you can build it back up again."

That means they're more likely to see more offers for orders with higher base pay and more tips. The Dasher that takes these orders has a better chance of making a bigger profit on their deliveries. [8] X Research source What are high-paying orders? High-paying orders are orders that pay more to the driver. DoorDash selects them based on factors like the area the Dasher is delivering in, the distance they have to drive to complete the order, and the time of day or night."

But during peak times when a lot of orders are coming in, DoorDash offers drivers in Dasher Rewards tiers the option to \"Dash Now.\" This means they can start accepting and delivering new orders right away and maximize their earnings!

For example, in the old program, Dashers had to complete 200 deliveries before they could even begin to qualify for benefits. In the new one, they only have to complete 50."

The first reason is you can increase your Overall Dasher Rating (and gain access to more rewards) by performing well on delivery, completion, and customer rating. Your chance of getting more points for these metrics may be higher on bigger, more complex orders. The second is you have a better chance of scoring higher tips for large and high-paying orders."
