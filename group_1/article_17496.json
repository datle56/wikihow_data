      "title": "Stop beating the cream as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Stop beating the cream as soon as possible. If you’re beating the cream by hand, stop whipping it as soon as you notice it’s started to deflate and form a grainy texture. If you’ve walked away from your standing mixer, turn it off as soon as you remember you left it running. [1] X Research source Any further agitation will separate the cream and turn it into butter. Your over-whipped cream will not be salvageable if it’s on the way to becoming butter."

      "content": "Check the cream to see how over-whipped it is. You should be able to fix the cream if it’s deflated, sticks to the sides of the bowl, but only somewhat grainy. If it’s very grainy, has turned a pale yellow, or if it’s started to separate into butterfat and buttermilk, you’ll have to start from scratch. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Expert Source JoAnna Minneci Professional Chef Expert Interview. 23 December 2021. [4] X Research source You’ll probably have to add one fourth to one third of the amount of cream you started with, but adding a little bit at a time will help you control the consistency.

      "content": "Refrigerate your cream if you need to leave the house. If you need to run to the store for more cream, put your over-whipped cream in the fridge. If you leave it out at room temperature, the fat will continue to break down and make it more difficult to salvage. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold in the unwhipped cream gently.",
      "content": "Fold in the unwhipped cream gently. A rubber spatula is a great tool for gently folding in the unwhipped cream. Carefully incorporate the unwhipped cream, and add more one tablespoon at a time until the mixture is smooth and forms soft peaks. [7] X Research source You can use a whisk if you don’t have a rubber spatula. Just whisk gently: don’t beat or whip the mixture. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Stop folding when you've reached a smooth consistency. Stop mixing as soon as you've folded in enough cream to make your topping presentable. You won't want to end up with another over-whipped mess! Serve a spoonful on your favorite dessert or refrigerate it until you're ready to use it."

      "title": "Keep beating until the cream separates into butter and buttermilk.",
      "content": "Keep beating until the cream separates into butter and buttermilk. You should see the cream separate into pale yellow butter and thin buttermilk within ten to fifteen minutes. [9] X Research source The amount of time will depend on how long you whipped the cream before you noticed you over did it."

      "content": "Strain the butter and buttermilk mixture through a colander. Once the butter and buttermilk have separated, you’ll have to strain the solids from the liquid. Pour the mixture through a colander into a large bowl. Press the solids you catch in the colander to strain as much liquid as possible. [10] X Research source Don’t throw away the liquid buttermilk that you’ve drained. You can use it in a variety of recipes."

      "content": "Rinse the butter in an ice bath until the water runs clear. Roll the solids you’ve strained into a ball. Place the ball in a bowl of ice water, and knead the ball to squeeze out even more buttermilk. Change the water and repeat the ice bath process until the water doesn’t become cloudy with buttermilk.

      "content": "Knead the butter to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. After giving it ice baths, continue to knead the butter until you can’t squeeze out any more liquid. Moisture can harbor bacteria, so squeezing out as much liquid as possible will extend the butter’s shelf life. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Flavor your butter with salt, herbs, citrus zest, or honey.",
      "content": "Flavor your butter with salt, herbs, citrus zest, or honey. Homemade unsalted butter tastes wonderful on its own, but you can also add your choice of flavors. Salt and herbs, such as dill, thyme, or rosemary, are great savory choices. If you added sugar or vanilla when you were making whipped cream, add a sweeter flavor, like lemon zest or honey. Amounts will vary based on how much butter you’ve made. A little bit of flavor will go a long way, and you can always add more if necessary, so just start by adding a dash. A quarter to a half teaspoon of any added flavoring agent should be a good start. If you have lots of over-whipped cream to turn into butter, you could split it into batches and add a different flavor to each."

      "content": "Strain the buttermilk through a fine sieve. Pour the buttermilk that you separated from the butter solids through a fine-mesh sieve, cheesecloth, or a coffee filter. Giving it one last strain will remove any traces of solids. [13] X Research source It will then be perfect for making pancakes, dressings, fried chicken, and lots of other recipes."
