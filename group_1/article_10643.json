If you need to create large amounts of files, use the touch command as follows: touch filename{01..20}.txt. This will create 20 new files using that file name. Add multiple filenames after the \"touch\" command to create multiple files (i.e. \"touch file_1 file_2 file_3\"). Alternatively, you can create a file in any directory you want by adding the directory path after the \"touch\" command (i.e \"touch /home/username/Documents/blank_file.txt\") You can create a file in multiple directories by adding the directory names after the touch command. For example touch category/file1.txt subcategory/blank_file.txt or touch {category,subcategory}/blank_file.txt . If the file you are trying to create already exists in the directory, the time stamp for that file will be updated instead."
