You can also use cables or a barbell. Just use whatever is easiest for you. [5] X Research source You can even just use canned goods as weights to start out. Instead of having your wrists facing inward, you'll grasp the bar with the tops of your hands towards your face. Keep your hands at shoulder width or closer together."

      "content": "Incline the bench up to work the triceps long head. Inclining the bench upwards will put more work on the long head because you're moving more toward an overhead position. If you're specifically wanting to work this muscle, increase the incline. [6] X Research source The triceps long head is the muscle at the back of the upper arm on the inner side."

However, if you're on an incline bench, you may be inclined to keep your upper arms perpendicular to your body. Always check to make sure your upper arms are perpendicular to the floor instead.

If you straighten your arms completely, you likely get a little rest at the top, which feels good but doesn't work your triceps as much. However, if you stop just short, you're continuing the pressure on your arms, which helps work them that much harder.
