[11] X Research source If the only thing all four terms has in common is the number \"1,\" there is no GCF and nothing can be factored out at this point. When you do factor out a GCF, make sure that you continue to keep it at the front of your equation as you work. This factored out GCF must be included as part of your final answer for that answer to be accurate. Example: 4x 4 + 12x 3 + 6x 2 + 18x Each term has 2x in common, so the problem can be rewritten as: 2x(2x 3 + 6x 2 + 3x + 9)"

Look at the signs before the second and fourth terms. When the two signs are the same (both positive or both negative), factor out a positive number. When the two signs are different (one negative and one positive), factor out a negative number. Example: 2x[(2x 3 + 6x 2 ) + (3x + 9)] = 2x 2 [2x 2 (x + 3) + 3(x + 3)]"
