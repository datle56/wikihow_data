By searching your house first, you may be able to quickly find your cat and avoid searching beyond your home. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Check everywhere, even in tight or small spaces. Look behind and under furniture. If there are areas where you can't reach or see, try using a hair dryer to blow warm (not hot) air into that space. If your cat is there it might flush them out. Ask your family members if they have seen your cat. Try shaking a bag of treats to coax your cat out from its hiding spot. Call out your cat's name. Hearing your voice can sometimes call your cat out. Listen for your cat's voice as you search to help pinpoint its location."

Try looking under your car or even under the hood of your car. If you have any trees near your house, try checking if your cat may have climbed them. Always call out for your cat as you search.

The two main forms of pet ID are tags and microchips. Tags are attached to your cat's collar. These tags are usually metal and have your contact information engraved on them. Microchips have to be implanted by a veterinarian. The chip contains your contact information digitally, as a back up in case the collar and tags should come off. Always keep the information on the tags or in the microchip up to date. This will ensure that anyone who finds your cat will know exactly where to return your cat."
