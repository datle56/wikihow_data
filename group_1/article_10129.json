Accept the positive feelings you have about wearing diapers and being a diaper lover, such as pleasure, excitement, and satisfaction. If you are overcome with guilt, shame, and fear about wearing a diaper, look at these feelings, too. It may be easier to disregard or ignore these emotions, but move closer to them. [1] X Research source Instead of worrying what people may think if they find out, learn to be comfortable with yourself and your feelings first. Explore the feelings you have about wearing a diaper and acknowledge all of them, both positive and negative. Ask yourself how wearing a diaper contributes to your self-perception and identity. Some negative feelings that may come up are fear of others finding out, or feelings of guilt or shame. You may be experiencing a lot of self-criticism. Especially if you want people to be understanding of you, it’s important that you understand your own motivations and feelings first. One way you can confront and work through these feelings is through journaling. The process of journaling allows you to define and get some distance from your emotions. Taking even just a few minutes each day to write down how you are feeling can bring clarity to your thoughts and feelings. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Deal with guilt and shame . You may be feeling a lot of guilt and shame about your lifestyle. Guilt is the feeling that something you've done violates a moral code, that something is \"wrong.\" Shame is the feeling of embarrassment, powerlessness and may come from self-disapproval or the disapproval of others. There is no need to feel guilt or shame about being a diaper lover. If you can successfully work through these feelings, you will be better able to accept yourself. Guilt is supposed to signal a person that he is doing something wrong or harmful — if you feel guilt after eating an entire cake, that's your brain telling you that this behavior is unhealthy and harmful. Or, to put it another way, guilt is the feeling you have done something bad, shame is the feeling you are bad. But experiencing guilt over your identity as a diaper lover is \"unhealthy\" guilt, because what you are doing is not hurting you or anyone else. If guilt exists to help us learn from our mistakes, what you must learn is how to change your mindset and accept this part of you. One way to heal shame is to accept that you have no control over the feelings and behaviors of others. People have the choice to be open and understanding, judgmental and closed off — and these choices have nothing to do with you. Once you stop taking other's behavior personally, you may begin to feel your shame lessen. [4] X Research source"

Adult babies like to act and be treated like an infant: taking a bottle, playing with baby toys, or sleeping in a crib. Some diaper lovers solely enjoy wearing a diaper and may wear one discreetly and otherwise live a \"normal\" life. You may want to act as an adult baby or you may not; it’s up to you to explore and decide. Some people use diapers to feel comfortable or for sexual foreplay. The behavior is not necessarily tied to baby or infant lifestyle."

This is especially true if you enjoy diaper wearing during sexual activity. It can be nerve-wracking to tell your partner, but go for it and don’t leave it hanging if it’s something important to you. Let your partner know you want to talk to them about something intimate that’s important to your heart. Say, “It’s important to be honest with you and show you all of who I am. Part of who I am is a diaper lover.” Be open to answer any questions your partner may have. Appeal to your partner. If your partner believes in being sexually adventurous, say “I know you enjoy being sexually adventurous, and this is a new adventure to practice together.” [10] X Research source Create boundaries that both you and your partner feel comfortable within. For instance, you may want to start small and work your way up, such as wearing diapers around the house at first, then bringing them into more intimate settings.

Many people misunderstand the feelings and motivations of diaper lovers. It’s up to you whether you want to wear diapers in public or at home or both. This largely depends on your motivation for diaper wearing, whether you use a diaper for comfort or for sexual reasons. If you’d like to discreetly wear a diaper in public, wear loose clothing to hide the diaper bulge and keep diaper-wrinkling noise to a minimum. Wearing diapers to bed is a popular option."

If it makes you feel more comfortable, have a good story for why you might own them for those \"just in case\" scenarios."
