Some state government agencies have created programs to subsidize solar panels, but these are only available for low-income families who meet certain requirements.

The phrase “free solar panels” is a misleading marketing tactic that solar companies use to refer to a solar lease agreement or power purchase agreement (PPA). These agreements mean that you pay no upfront cost, but you pay a monthly fee to rent solar panels. If you believe a solar company is misrepresenting its products, contact the Federal Trade Commission and a state protection office in your state or territory.

With a solar lease, a solar company installs their panels on your property for $0 upfront and asks you to sign a contract where you agree to pay a monthly fee to use them. [3] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Some companies might misrepresent leases as “free” because you don’t pay money upfront—however, you still have to pay a monthly fee. Pros: You don’t pay the initial cost of the panels, which can range from $8,500 to $30,500. Leases also take less toll on your credit score and your solar company has to pay for any repairs, maintenance, or part replacements. [4] X Research source Cons: You don’t own the panels and can’t benefit from cost-reducing incentives like federal tax credits. Most leases have a term between 15 to 20 years, and if you sell your home before then, the new owner has to agree to take over the payments. [5] X Research source"

With a PPA, the solar company installs the panels with no initial cost, but instead of a fixed monthly payment, you pay for the electricity the solar panels generate. [6] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Some companies set the PPA cost lower than local electric rates to make it more appealing and advertise these agreements as “free” because there’s no upfront cost. Pros: When solar panels have a low energy production during winter or cloudy days, your PPA payment is reduced for that month. Cons: You don’t own the panels and miss out on cost-saving incentive programs. Most PPAs also have a 20-year term, and if you have a new owner, they have to agree to take over the payments. Some also have escalator clauses, which means the amount you pay increases along with inflation and local utility rates."
