      "content": "A delta male is described as a responsible man who takes pride in his work. Often described in pop culture as a “normal guy,” a delta male is thought to be one of the most common types of men. They are believed to contribute to society by showing up to work on time and taking pride in their job. They're said to love to learn new skills in order to contribute more, and it's thought that they typically have very thriving home lives with loving families. [1] X Research source Need an example? Think of characters like Jim from The Office or Higgins from Ted Lasso . These men are hardworking and dependable, but don’t necessarily need to be in the spotlight."

      "content": "Hard working. Delta males are often portrayed as the backbone of society.

    {
      "title": "Natural follower.",
      "content": "Natural follower. According to the male hierarchy stereotype, alpha males may yearn for the spotlight, but delta males are different. They’re described as totally okay with hanging out backstage and letting other people take the lead. Even if they never get to be in charge or take point on something, society says they’ll be okay with it. [4] X Research source This may be because they’re shy or reserved, or it may be because they’ve been leaders in the past and didn’t enjoy it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loving family man.",
      "content": "Loving family man. Delta males are described as hard-working, but they are also described as great family men.

    },
    {
      "title": "Desires respect.",
      "content": "Desires respect. While delta men are often portrayed as not being leaders, it doesn’t mean they don’t want respect.

[5] X Research source This can be something as simple as a “good job” from their boss or coworkers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Possibly resentful.",
      "content": "Possibly resentful. Pop culture often describes a delta male as blaming other people for his problems instead of looking inward. However, many self-described delta males reject this definition, and instead focus on the good aspects, like being a hard worker. [6] X Research source For instance, maybe his first girlfriend cheated on him, and now he has trust issues. Instead of seeing a therapist and processing his emotions, he might hold onto those trust issues and cause new problems in new relationships. Worried you might fit into this stereotype? Work on letting go of grudges to focus on moving forward."

    {
      "title": "Adaptable.",
      "content": "Adaptable. Delta males are described as great adapters, and society may not view them as delta males forever. If they are motivated enough, delta males can become leaders and transform into alpha males , at least according to pop culture. And if they turn inward and embrace their introverted side, the social hierarchy says that they can cross into gamma or omega male territory."

    {
      "title": "A comfortable, stable life.",
      "content": "A comfortable, stable life. Pop culture says that delta males often live comfortably, buying land or a home relatively quickly. They are portrayed as hard workers who take pride in their jobs until they’re able to kick back and relax during retirement."

      "title": "It's said that alpha males lead, while delta males get the work done.",
      "content": "It's said that alpha males lead, while delta males get the work done. If an alpha male is described as the CEO, delta males are described as the managers and workers beneath him. They may not be in charge or willing to lead, but they’ll definitely do their job to the best of their abilities. Alpha males need delta males in order to reach their goals, so society says they work well together. Alpha males love to get recognition for their hard work, which is described as less important to delta males."

      "title": "It's believed that sigma males reject the hierarchy, while delta males thrive within it.",
      "content": "It's believed that sigma males reject the hierarchy, while delta males thrive within it. Sigma males tend to shun the hierarchy and create their own rules, at least according to the definition from the male social hierarchy. On the flip side, delta males are described as recognizing that they need the hierarchy in order to reach their goals. While sigma males may lag behind in the workforce, delta males are believed to use the rules of society to propel themselves forward. [7] X Research source For instance, if a sigma male and a delta male are working at the same job, a delta male is more likely to meet their deadlines and get a promotion (or so the theory goes). This is because delta males care about what their leaders think of them, while sigma males don’t."
