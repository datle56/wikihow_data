To start your corkscrew curl, crochet a foundation chain as long as you want and then add 3 more foundation chain stitches. You can use any size crochet hook you like. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that the corkscrew curl won't be as long as the foundation chain because it will coil and become shorter."

To make a dc stitch: [2] X Research source Wrap the yarn over and pull it through the stitch. Wrap the yarn over and pull it through the first 2 loops. Then wrap the yarn over and pull it through the remaining 2 loops to make 1 double crochet stitch."

This will make 1 sc stitch. Make 5 more stitches around the magic ring and then pull the tail of the yarn tightly. The center of the magic ring should close once you've pulled the yarn enough. To make a larger spiral, make as many sc stitches or double crochet stitches as you like."

      "content": "Avoid joining the rounds with a slip stitch. If you use the slip stitch or start with a chain, you'll actually crochet a flat circle instead of a spiral. Instead, continue to crochet in the round. To make the spiral, slide a stitch marker at the end of each row so you can keep track of how many rounds you've made."
