      "title": "Identify areas that could use improvement.",
      "content": "Identify areas that could use improvement. There are some models of wellness that describe wellness in terms of physical, social, emotional, intellectual, vocational, environmental, spiritual and financial dimensions. [2] X Research source Be honest with yourself about how satisfied you feel in each aspect of wellness. That way you can create a wellness plan tailored to your needs. Give each area a ranking from 1-10, with 1 being the poorest rank and 10 being the best. From this, you can determine which area needs the attention. But remember, each area relates to another, so you won't necessarily benefit from focusing all of your attention on one area to the detriment of others."

      "title": "Set goals.",
      "content": "Set goals. Once you identify the area or areas that you feel you need to work on, begin setting your goals. Write down specific goals you want to accomplish in each area. Create achievable short-term goals that will move you towards increasingly larger long-term goals. Make sure your long-term goals are also reasonable and doable. For example, if you are 25 years old, a reasonable long-term goal might be financial security by the time you retire at age 65. An unreasonable long-term goal would be becoming a billionaire by the age of 30. Be patient with yourself. Personal evolution does not generally take place overnight, nor is it usually very easy. But it is doable, so don't get discouraged if change doesn't happen immediately."

      "title": "Keep track of your progress.",
      "content": "Keep track of your progress. Make up a chart or a journal in which you can outline each aspect of personal wellness and the goals for each. Set aside a calendar designated for tracking your wellness progress. Mark important dates and checkpoints so that you can see your progress. Begin by establishing your baseline of wellness for a particular aspect, write it down, then check in again after a month or two. Seeing the positive effects of what you have already accomplished may be the best motivational fuel."

      "title": "Update your wellness plan.",
      "content": "Update your wellness plan. As you develop greater personal wellness, you may that certain goals take more or less time than you anticipated. Or you might find that some goals are no longer inside the scope of what you want to accomplish. So make a point to monitor your progress and reassess your needs every 6 months or so. That way you'll keep your wellness plan in harmony with your personal growth and progress. The process of achieving personal wellness is dynamic. Your needs, your goals, your environment, and your relationships may all change. You then want to decide how you want to change along with them. While your particular situation may change, by keeping these goals at the forefront, you can achieve a greater degree of control of how those changes will affect you. If for example, you set a weight loss goal of 10 pounds in 6 months, at the end of 6 months, re-evaluate that goal. Are you happy with your current weight? Do you want to lose more? If you are happy with your weight, your new goal may be maintenance. If you want to lose more, perhaps your new goal is 10 additional pounds in the next 6 months."

      "title": "Get support.",
      "content": "Get support. Having the support of others can be crucial to maintaining your drive and motivation. Your supporters can hold you accountable, offer encouragement when needed, and perhaps even join you in your efforts. Get professional help and advice where needed. If for example, you want to improve your diet and nutrition to attain physical and mental wellness, you may want to consult with a nutritionist. If you are looking for financial stability, talk to a financial advisor. Join support groups that address whatever area(s) you might need encouragement in. Start a “buddy system” with a friend, spouse, or relative for various aspects of your wellness plan. For example, if you're working on financial wellness, getting your spouse involved can be an important step in getting closer to both relationship wellness and emotional wellness."

      "content": "Set goals for physical wellness. After assessing each dimension of your personal wellness, it's time to begin setting goals. Keep your initial goals simple and achievable. You don't want to get frustrated by difficult goals right off the bat. It's a good idea to go to a local fitness center and inquire about physical evaluations. Talk to your physician first before embarking on a physical wellness plan if you're overweight or have a history of medical problems. Start by walking more often. Park your car further away from an entrance and walk more. Use the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator. Walk around the block or take your dog out for a nice walk. Speak to your physician if you are overweight or have a significant medical history of heart disease, respiratory disease, arthritis, or any other serious medical condition. Your physician can help you set safe, reasonable goals. Make sure the physical activity you choose is something you like to do and not something someone talked you into. If you like the activity, you are much more likely to keep at it. Work your way up to increased activity. If you have spent the last 5 years with low to moderate physical activity, you're probably not quite ready for a triathlon. Start slowly and gently, increasing your activity level when you feel ready and able. Be patient and try a low-impact activity first like yoga, tai chi, or qigong.

      "title": "Set goals for your nutritional wellness.",
      "content": "Set goals for your nutritional wellness. How do you know what the best diet is with all of the conflicting diets and advice? Try starting with some relatively simple rules: Consider speaking with a nutritionist who can help you determine the ideal nutrition for you and your body. Eat food that is as close to its natural form as possible. Try to limit processed and prepared foods and cook from scratch instead. Use a crock pot or stick to basic foods like rice, beans, and vegetables if you're pressed for time. You might also consider preparing food for the week ahead of time and storing it in the freezer until you're ready to eat it. Limit your red meat consumption (prefer grass-fed if possible). Increase the amount of fish (wild over farm raised) and skinless poultry you eat. [6] X Research source Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you consume. Your intake of vegetables should be higher than your fruit intake, since fruit contains sugar. Increase the amount of water you drink. Or at the signal of thirst you have to drink. Be alert for food sensitivities. If you suspect you're sensitive to a particular food, eliminate it from your diet for at least 2 weeks. Foods that may cause sensitivity include gluten, dairy, milk/lactose, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and soy. [7] X Research source Visit the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) website for advice on nutrition for kids, parents, men, women, and seniors. Give yourself 30 days on a new plan to form healthy eating habits and to fully evaluate the effects. Dedicating yourself to the plan for the full duration can be a powerful but difficult step so surrounding yourself with a knowledgeable and supportive community may be helpful."

      "content": "Set mental wellness goals. Mental wellness takes work, but even if you've suffered from depression, anxiety, or another mental disorder, you can improve your mental wellness with the right actions. Try these approaches to reduce depression, anxiety and stress: [8] X Research source Set aside time to quietly relax each day. Take a walk when you feel distressed. Set aside time to do relaxing activities you enjoy like reading, gardening, watching movies, etc. Learn and use deep breathing techniques. For example, breathe by expanding your abdomen rather than your chest. This technique allows your diaphragm--the flat muscle below your lungs--to drop by expanding your abdominal muscles. Take 100 deep breaths each day. [9] X Research source Practice positive affirmations. Some examples of positive affirmations include: “yes, I can,” “I am successful,” “I feel better every day,” etc. You might write your affirmation on a sticky note and post it where you can see it. [10] X Research source Seek out the support of a therapist or support group. Remember: If you're taking medication for a mental disorder, never stop the medication or change the dose on your own. Doing so can be very dangerous and you should only do so under the guidance of your mental health professional."
