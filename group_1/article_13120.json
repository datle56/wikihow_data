      "title": "Clogged spray arms",
      "content": "Clogged spray arms Your dishwasher's spray arms dispense the water through small holes. If these holes are blocked with food, plastic, or calcium deposits, the water won't be able to get through them. [1] X Research source How to fix: Remove the spray arms and clean the spray holes. Unscrew the upper and lower spray arms and soak them in warm soapy water. Use a toothpick to poke debris from the holes and a toothbrush to gently scrub off any remaining grime. Rinse the spray arms off, let them dry, and screw them back into place. Sometimes calcium deposits build up on spray arms. These are harder to remove than food. If soaking them in warm water alone doesn't help, try soaking them in a solution with equal parts white vinegar and water. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Damaged spray arm support tube",
      "content": "Damaged spray arm support tube The support tube that leads to the spray arm receives water from a water supply tube nozzle at the back of the dishwasher. If the spray arms are getting little to no water, the support tube might be leaking and need replacing. [4] X Research source How to fix: Examine the spray arm support tube for cracks or holes. If you find any, unscrew the spray arm and unclip the support tube from the rack. Replace the entire assembly with the one recommended by your dishwasher manufacturer in the manual."

      "title": "Clogged drain filter",
      "content": "Clogged drain filter The drain filter at the bottom of the dishwasher is supposed to separate the large food particles from the water before it drains. When the filter gets too dirty, the excess debris gets taken up into the spray arms and clogs the holes. [5] X Research source How to fix: Check if the drain filter is dirty. Locate the filter in the back and bottom of the dishwasher. Pull it out and soak it in warm, soapy water in the sink. Use a soft toothbrush to remove any stubborn debris. Rinse the soap off the filter until the water runs clear, let it dry, and then put it back in the dishwasher. [6] X Research source If the filter looks damaged or moldy, throw it away and buy a replacement that fits your dishwasher model."

      "title": "Blocked water circulation pump",
      "content": "Blocked water circulation pump Sometimes food or plastic gets stuck in the impeller mechanism that forces the water into the spray arms, blocking the water's path. [7] X Research source If this is the problem, you may hear the motor humming, but your dishes will still be dirty because the pump isn't circulating water through the spray arms. How to fix: Remove the water circulation pump and assess the damage. First, unplug the dishwasher from the power source and shut off the water supply. Then, detach the dishwasher from the counter and the floor and pull it out. Tip it onto its back so you can unplug and detach the pump. [8] X Research source If the pump appears blocked but has no other obvious damage, remove the debris and reinstall it."

If you've owned your dishwasher for that length of time or longer and it starts malfunctioning, you may save more money in the long run by replacing it with a new one."

      "title": "In the wash cycle, water enters the dishwasher via the water inlet valve.",
      "content": "In the wash cycle, water enters the dishwasher via the water inlet valve. The water pools in the bottom and heats up, and the heat activates the dishwasher detergent to create suds. A circulation pump intakes the soapy water and pushes it to the spray arms, and the spray arms spray the water onto the dishes at a high pressure. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "After the (now dirty) water drains, the dishwasher starts a rinse cycle. The tub fills with water again, the pump sends the water to the spray arms, and the spray arms rinse the dishes clean. The rinse water drains and the dishwasher starts a heating cycle to dry the dishes. [14] X Research source Most Whirlpool , Frigidaire , GE , Bosch , and KitchenAid dishwashers work the same way and use the same basic components. The parts they use vary in shape and size based on the dishwasher model, so check your manual or ask the manufacturer to tell you the number of the part you need to replace."
