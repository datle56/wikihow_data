      "content": "Know your hair type. When you know what type of hair you have, you are better able to keep it healthy by meeting its needs. You can discover your hair type by gauging its density, texture, and strength. Density: Look at a patch of hair on the top of your head. If you can barely see your scalp through your hair, you have thick-density hair; if the hair is more spaced out, it’s of a fine density; and if it’s somewhere in the middle, your hair is of a medium density. Also, the thinner your part line, the higher the density. Texture: Observe an individual strand of your hair. How thick or thin is the strand in relation to the hair of other people you know? You can also gauge how thick or fine your hair is by tugging on it — thick-textured hair will be stronger/less likely to break than fine-textured hair. Fine hair feels more flexible and can have difficulty holding volume while thicker hair tends to be stubborn and full. Strength: Hair strength is measured by porosity and elasticity. Wash and towel-dry your hair, then feel it: if your hair feels quite wet, it’s more damaged/porous; if it feels quite dry, it’s healthier/less porous. The farther you can stretch your hair without it breaking, the more elastic and healthy it is."

If you have fine hair, you can use volumizing or thickening shampoos and conditioners; if you have thick or oily hair, you may want to use a deep-cleansing shampoo and a light conditioner. There are myriad products to choose from — just be sure to choose something that suits your hair. In general, salon brands are thought to be of a higher quality than drugstore brands. Look for sulfate-free shampoo since sulfates can damage your hair. [5] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020."

      "content": "Deep condition your hair regularly. You can do this using a store-bought conditioner or a homemade one. If you do buy a deep conditioning treatment, opt for a salon brand, as drugstore brands will likely contain lower-quality ingredients. How often you deep condition your hair will depend on how healthy it is: if your hair is very damaged, deep condition it once a week. Pay close attention to the instructions on the bottle. A protein-based conditioner, for instance, will strengthen your hair, but can make it brittle if left on too long."

If you can’t afford to buy expensive salon conditioning treatments, and you’d rather not use drugstore brands, you can pamper your hair at home with the following treatment: [7] X Research source Massage your scalp and the ends of your hair with some warm oil. Options for oil include coconut, olive, and sweet almond, among others. Which oil you use will depend on your hair type and personal preference. [8] X Research source Jojoba oil is a safe bet for all hair types. [9] X Research source Wrap a hot, damp towel around your head. This will help the oil penetrate your hair. Just make sure it’s not too hot! [10] X Research source Apply a hair mask to your hair. The type of mask will depend on your hair type. For dry hair, apply a paste of 1 or 2 egg whites and honey to your hair; for greasy hair, apply a paste of aloe vera gel, amla powder, and water to your hair. [11] X Research source"

How often you wash your hair will depend on your individual hair. Some people find that they need to wash their hair every day or two to keep it from getting too oily; others are able to wash their hair once or twice a week. When washing your hair, be gentle: massage the shampoo into your roots and then let it move down through the rest of your hair — don’t rub it into your hair, as this can cause damage.

Be especially careful about putting your hair into a ponytail or braid when it’s wet and more prone to damage. The same goes for extensions and weaves, which can pull on your hair.

Here are some key foods to eat for healthy hair: [26] X Research source Fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel contain omega-3 fatty acids, which protect you from disease and help your body grow and maintain healthy, shiny hair. Greek yogurt contains protein and vitamin B5 (also known as pantothenic acid), which are both essential for healthy hair growth. If you don’t get enough protein in your diet, your hair growth stalls. [27] X Research source Dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale contain vitamin A, iron, beta carotene, folate, and vitamin C, which are all helpful in maintaining a healthy scalp and hair. Vitamin C in particular is hugely helpful in preventing breakage. Sweet potatoes and other orange fruits and vegetables such as carrots, pumpkins, cantaloupe, and mangoes contain the antioxidant beta carotene, which helps keep hair hydrated and shiny. Cinnamon and other spices boost your circulation, helping to deliver oxygen and nutrients to your hair follicles. Sprinkle blood-flow-boosting spices into your various meals and beverages. Eggs are a great source of protein, iron, and biotin — a B vitamin that helps with hair growth."
