      "content": "Eat dinner early to give your digestive system a break. Your body doesn’t need fuel while it’s resting, such as during the night when you’re asleep. Eating too close to bedtime can disrupt your sleep and your body won’t be able to burn this food as efficiently, so it might end up storing it in your body as excess fat. Aim to stop eating at least 3 hours before bedtime and allow your body a long break in between dinner and breakfast.

      "content": "Learn to identify when you’re hungry . Tuning in to your hunger signals can help you to avoid overeating or eating out of boredom. If you’re unsure if you’re hungry, take a moment to think about when you ate last and how much you ate. If it’s been more than 3 hours, you may be hungry. If it’s been less than 3 hours, consider if your urge to eat might be motivated by something else. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Some people use the acronym HALT to stop themselves from eating mindlessly. HALT stands for Hungry, Angry (or anxious), Lonely, and Tired. If you’re not hungry, ask yourself if you’re experiencing any of these emotions. Then, look for a way to deal with the feeling without food. For example, if you’re angry (or anxious) about something, it might help you to pinpoint what it is. If you’re lonely, call up a friend and ask them to meet you. If you’re tired, a quick nap might help to refresh you. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try following an intermittent fasting diet. Intermittent fasting is when you keep your meals within the same 8 to 10-hour window during the most active part of each day. This limits when you can eat and gives your body more time to burn the calories you take in. You may find that you eat less as a result. Identify a window that works for you and commit to eating all of your meals within that time frame.

Fruits and vegetables are loaded with nutrients and fibre, and they’re lower in calories than most other foods; especially if they're organic (pesticide-free). Fill up half of your plate with 1 to 2 servings of vegetables or fruits at each meal. This will help you to fill up faster and stay full longer. [7] X Research source You can steam , stir-fry, roast, or boil your vegetables. Prepare them however you like! Try having a side salad or raw vegetable slices with your meal if you don’t want to cook vegetables.

      "content": "Add a serving of lean protein to your plate at each meal. Protein should make up about 1/4 of your plate at each meal. Protein-rich foods include meat, fish, beans, and eggs. Some dairy products are also high in protein, such as cottage cheese and Greek yogurt. Opt for lean proteins, such as skinless chicken breast , tilapia, ground turkey, beans, tofu, and egg whites. This will reduce the amount of fat and cholesterol in your diet, which is better for you overall. [9] X Research source Check the item’s packaging to find the serving size. Serving sizes vary among different types of protein foods. For example, a serving of meat or fish is 3 oz (85 g) while a serving of beans or cottage cheese is 1/2 cup (120 g)."

      "title": "Limit your intake of oils and fats.",
      "content": "Limit your intake of oils and fats. A healthy level of fat in your diet is between 20 and 35%. For someone following a 2,000-calorie diet, this would work out to about 44 to 77 grams of fat daily since each gram is worth about 9 calories. But it’s best to consume healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and limit or avoid unhealthy ones, such as saturated fats and trans fats. Include 2 to 3 servings of olive oil, nuts, seeds, or avocados in your daily diet to get healthy fats. [10] X Research source Aim to get no more than 10% of your daily calories from saturated fat. For example, if you are on a 1,700-calorie-per-day diet, then no more than 170 of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. This works out to be about 19 grams of saturated fat per day. Make sure that you check labels on foods to find the trans fat content. If a food contains trans fat, don’t buy it or eat it. Trans fats are commonly found in margarine, shortening, powdered coffee creamer, and many packaged convenience foods, such as packaged baked goods.

[12] X Research source There’s no perfect amount of water for everyone to drink. Drink whenever you feel thirsty. If your urine is pale yellow and you don’t feel thirsty, you are well-hydrated. Moderate alcohol intake is also fine. Drink no more than 1 alcoholic beverage daily if you’re a woman, or no more than 2 alcoholic beverages daily if you’re a man. One alcoholic beverage is 12 fl oz (350 mL) of beer, 5 fl oz (150 mL) of wine, or 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) of spirits.

As long as you’re eating healthy foods most of the time, it’s fine to have a treat, such as a donut, a couple of slices of pizza, or a milkshake now and then. Try to keep your treats to once or twice per week and plan them ahead of time to reduce the chances that you’ll overdo them.

Make sure to budget for the calories that your splurge will cost if you’re keeping track of calories with an app or food diary. For example, if you know that 2 slices of pizza will be about 600 calories, then you might eat a light lunch so you have more calories to spare."
