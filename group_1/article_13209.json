      "content": "Get waste kits if you'll be traveling in cold, dry areas with little soil. Poop breaks down fast in rich soil, especially if the area is warm and sunny. If you plan on exploring a cold environment that doesn't have a lot of soil, it would be hard to dig a hole for feces, so buy human waste kits before you go. These kits contain a large bag, toilet paper, and antibacterial wipes. [1] X Research source Buy waste kits from outdoor supply stores or online. You can usually buy a single kit for less than $5 or buy a bulk package. If you're hiking or camping in a park, they may give you waste kits when you buy a permit for the park. You should also pack out poop if you are within 200 feet (61 m) of water."

      "content": "Spread out a waste bag and poop directly into the bag. Unfold the large waste bag from the kit and set the toilet paper and antibacterial wipe to the side. Arrange the bag so it's spread out as wide as possible. Then, squat over the bag and poop into it. [2] X Research source If you need to urinate as well, don't pee in the waste bag. Instead, try to urinate somewhere wet or on rocks, pine needles, or gravel. Then, poop into the bag. If you find it difficult to poop into the bag, you can poop into a hole and then transfer the poop into the bag once you're done."

      "content": "Wipe with toilet paper and use an antibacterial wipe to clean your hands. Use the toilet paper that came with the kit to wipe and drop the toilet paper into the bag with the poop. Then, open the antibacterial wipe and rub it thoroughly over your hands to kill germs. Put the used wipe into the bag, too. [3] X Research source The waste bag contains a gelling material that breaks down the feces."

      "title": "Seal the bag shut and throw it away in a trash can as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Seal the bag shut and throw it away in a trash can as soon as possible. Squeeze the excess air out of the bag so it's easier to pack. Depending on the type of bag you have, twist the bag closed or pull drawstrings to draw it shut. Then, seal the top edge of the bag. Carry the bag with you until you come to a trash can and toss it in. [4] X Research source You can use the same bag more than once if there's space in the bag for more feces. Keep in mind that you will need more toilet paper and antibacterial wipes or hand gel. Never leave your waste kit on the side of a trail or at a campsite. You may be fined if you improperly dispose of feces in a campground or park. If you have to carry the waste bag in your backpack, you might want to place it in a bigger plastic bag to prevent leakage until you can throw it away."

      "content": "Pack the feces in a sealable plastic bag if you don't have a waste kit. Waste kits make packing out poop a lot easier, but you can use household items to make your own kit. Bring toilet paper, a large sealable plastic bag, and a disposable food storage container. [5] X Research source To use your homemade kit, poop directly into the bag and wipe with any type of toilet paper. Squeeze out the air and seal it shut before you put it into the disposable container."

Any time you handle the waste kit or plastic bag containing poop, wash your hands afterwards with soap and water as soon as possible. If you donâ€™t have access to soap and water, use hand sanitizer or sanitizing wipes to clean your hands. Wash for at least 20 seconds, and make sure to wash all surfaces of your hands, including your wrists, the backs of your hands, and under your fingernails. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Washing your hands will help get rid of dangerous germs that could cause disease. If your hands are obviously dirty, try to rinse them or wipe them with a damp cloth or wet wipe before using hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer is less effective at killing germs on greasy or dirty skin.

      "content": "Find a spot that's away from water if you want to bury the feces. The germs from feces can easily contaminate the water supply if you toilet near a river, pond, or lake, for instance. Choose an area for the hole that's far from water to protect your water supply. [8] X Research source 200 feet (61 m) is about 70 adult-sized paces. Don't bury the waste kit since it won't break down easily. Instead, only use a cat hole if you plan on pooping directly into the hole and burying it."

      "content": "Look for a secluded spot away from trails or campsites. You don't want someone accidentally coming across you while you're toileting, so find an area that's not near people. This might mean that you need to hike into a forested area to find a good spot. [9] X Research source Consider making your cat hole near fallen timber, on an isolated hillside, or in an area with thick undergrowth. Make more than 1 cat hole if you're camping with a group or camping for more than 1 night."

Bring a small shovel or garden trowel with you and dig a hole that's deep enough to hold the poop and hide the odor. Make it 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) deep and 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) wide. [10] X Research source Pile the dirt from the hole on the ground next to it. You'll use the dirt to fill in the hole once you're done. If you're in the desert, don't make the hole as deep since it will take longer to break down. Dig your hole just 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) deep so the sun and heat speed up the process."
