      "content": "Set up your document specs. Within the right panel, type your desired height and width into the boxes provided. We recommend doing 350 px x 350 px for a font. You should also specify the number of artboards. The amount of artboards correlates to the number of characters in your font. Click “Create” in the bottom right once you’re done. [2] X Research source For example, you should set 52 artboards if you want to make a font with uppercase and lowercase letters. You should add more artboards for any additional numbers or characters! Be sure that your dimensions are in pixels, rather than points. You can change this by clicking on the drop-down menu next to “Width” and selecting “Pixels.”"

      "title": "Create guides.",
      "content": "Create guides. Guides are lines you can add (that don’t actually appear in the final product) to help you keep your letters even. First, add rulers on the top and left sides of your document by clicking on “View” > “Rulers” > “Show Rulers.” To add a guide, simply click on one of the rulers and drag your mouse to a desired location on your document. [3] X Research source Dragging the vertical ruler (on the left) will place a vertical guide, while dragging the horizontal ruler (on the top) will place a horizontal guide."
    },
    {
      "title": "Space out your guides.",
      "content": "Space out your guides. For fonts, we suggest adding three horizontal lines to each artboard: the baseline, height, and cap. The baseline is the bottom guide where all letters will rest. The height is the middle guide indicating the top of lowercase letters. The cap is the top guide indicating the top of all uppercase letters. The spacing should be relatively even, but we recommend making the height and cap slightly closer together."

Then, click again where you want the line to end. Continue clicking to add more line segments to this path. Whenever you want to end the path, press Enter on your keyboard. [4] X Research source This method only allows you to draw straight lines. This is great for letters like “L,” but follow along for how to draw curves!"

Before releasing, drag your cursor around to see a curve form. Continue dragging until you are satisfied with a certain curve, then release your mouse. Click, hold, and drag your cursor to other places until you’ve created your desired shape. Press Enter on your keyboard to finish the path. This is helpful for letters like “R,” where you need to add a curve. This is also great for stylizing your font!"
