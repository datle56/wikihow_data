You get to decide how their opinions are to your personal relationship. Know that it may be harder to move on from the infidelity based on how it was discovered. [4] X Research source Afifi, W.

Tell your partner that your feelings are legitimate and important even if the other person does not think you should feel hurt or sad. It is important to express your feelings with words instead of with your body. You may use hugs, tears, kisses, or other calm forms of interaction; never use punches, hits, slaps, or general violence. This is not an opportunity to hurt the other person. If you feel the desire to hurt the other person, say so but don’t actually try to do it."

Remember that this conversation is about how each of you feel, not about what is fact or argument. Listen to your partner’s needs in the relationship. Can you give them what they need? It is possible that the infidelity was the result of someone feeling neglected, yet uncomfortable with saying so. Your partner’s feelings are legitimate and important even if you do not “agree” with what they feel. If your partner’s feelings are not legitimate and important to you, then you might want a conversation about ending the relationship."

Examples of concrete steps: giving you access to their phone, or calling and checking in at night. You might each be taking different steps but towards the same goal. Or, you might help one another take steps and do each together. It may help to write these down, similar to rules in a classroom, and sign your names at the bottom like a contract."

Set up ways to be held accountable for the future actions. For example, if your partner does not give you access to their phone one night, you have a set-up protocol or discussion to handle it already. This contingency planning of sorts allows for the “concrete” steps to have some flexibility. You can show that you are trying even if you sometimes break a rule or fail to take a step. Ultimately, you and your partner should each be accountable for communicating and being trusting of one another. Have a way to talk about if you think one person is not being held accountable. A promise to do better works in the short-term, but must be kept in the long-term in order to have value."

It may seem scary to trust someone to do exactly what they failed to do last time, but there is no alternative that leads to a trusting relationship again. Trust yourself.
