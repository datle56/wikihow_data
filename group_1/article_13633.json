      "content": "Pay attention in class. Understand what is being taught in class. A lot of students refuse to pay attention in class because they think that when they get home, they can just flip through the pages in their textbook and that's all. However, the question is, if you can study on your own and don't need any assistance of a teacher, then why bother to even attend class? It's just a waste. [1] X Research source Listen to the teacher upfront. Take down notes on what the teacher emphasizes."

To achieve this, you must first have the knowledge of certain things; in other words, the first step is the very basic step to continue your pathway to studying smart. The following steps are the guidelines to studying smart. For example, it may be a good \"study smart\" strategy to start each study session with the topics that you struggle with the most, then move onto easier subjects that you feel more confident in. Reader Poll: We asked 492 wikiHow readers about how they organize their studying, and 47% of them said that they tackle the most difficult topics first, while they have the most energy . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Spend at least half an hour to study a sub topic daily. Use this time to fully comprehend and understand the material. The biggest mistake students make is to only try to understand when exams are approaching. This is the failure that almost all students make. [2] X Research source The time you use to revise before the exam should not be the moment you try to understand and comprehend certain knowledge. Your revision moment should rightfully be the moment of merely recalling what you have known. That being said, revision should not last longer than 4 hours. It all depends, however, because sometimes we might have more topics to go through."

[3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Remember to always relate ideas and concepts, rather than focusing entirely on memorization. Memorization doesn't help when a certain question is twisted. To relate concepts and ideas, you need to find your own way of relating them together. For instance, if you are studying osmosis, try to relate the concept in daily lives; use the pickling process, for example. You could then relate to hemolysis, cremation, hypertonic or hypotonic. This method works best for all subjects, particularly Additional Mathematics."

How does it happen? Why it happens? Why is it the reactivity increases or decreases?"
