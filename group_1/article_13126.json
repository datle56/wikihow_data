      "content": "Wash your hands. Soap and water are all you need. Work up a good lather. Then, rub your hands together long enough to sing the “Happy Birthday” song. Make sure you get the backs of your hands, fingertips, and under your fingernails, if possible. Dry your hands thoroughly with a clean towel. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you do not have access to running water, then you can also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Washing your hands with water is best, but using hand sanitizer is better than nothing. If you are disinfecting someone else’s wound, then you may also want to put on a pair of clean, disposable vinyl or latex gloves. However, this is not absolutely necessary."

      "content": "Stop the bleeding, if necessary. If the wound hasn't stopped bleeding on its own, place a clean or sterile bandage or gauze over it and apply direct pressure. Do not remove the gauze or bandage until you are certain that the bleeding has stopped or you may pull away tissue and cause the bleeding to start again. Elevate it above the level of your heart. This will direct the blood flow away from the injury point. [2] X Research source If you can't raise the wound, apply pressure to a pressure point (an artery above the injury) on the wrist, bicep, at the top of the thigh, or behind the knee.

Use a soapy washcloth to clean around the wound. Avoid getting soap in the wound, as it could cause irritation. Rinse the area with clean water and dry it with a clean towel or cloth. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you could clean the wound with salt water and a piece of gauze. Dip the gauze in the salt water and gently blot the wound with it. [6] X Research source If any dirt or debris is in the wound, try to remove it with a pair of sterilized tweezers that have been cleaned with rubbing alcohol. Do not use your fingers. Seek medical help if any dirt, debris, or other object is too deep for you to reach or if the wound is deep and has an object inside of it.

The color of the drainage is especially important and drainage that is thick and yellow, brown, or a sickly green color indicates that you may have an infection.
