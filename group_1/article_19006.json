      "content": "Boil a pot of water and pour it into a container or small tub. Fill the pot with enough water to dunk your hair into. Heat it on the stove until it’s boiling, then remove it from the heat. Pour the hot water into a glass bowl, plastic tub, or container large enough to hold it. [2] X Research source Dyed tips will probably only need around 4 cups of water, while larger sections of hair may require more. This technique works best with dip-dyed or grown-out hair, rather than hair with color close to the roots. Be extra cautious when working with hot water. Avoid sloshing or splashing the water to prevent burns."

Use a measuring spoon to measure out the baking powder and stir it into the hot water until the 2 ingredients combine completely. The mixture may fizz when you do this, which is completely normal, so don’t be alarmed! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak your Kool-Aid-dyed hair in the water for 30 seconds. Place the dyed sections of your hair into the water. In seconds, you should start to see the color coming off of the hair. By the end of the 30 seconds, the water should be the color of the Kool-Aid, and your hair should be faded back to its natural color. [4] X Research source This method is extremely drying for your hair, so make sure you only soak for 30 seconds or less."

      "content": "Dump the water and wash your hair in the shower. Pour the baking soda water into the sink and immediately rinse the sink out. Wash your hair in the shower with shampoo and warm water. After the shower, you should be able to tell that the Kool-Aid has significantly faded. Use a moisturizing shampoo because baking soda is drying."

      "content": "Use a deep conditioning treatment to restore your hair’s moisture. This method is very drying and strips your hair of its natural moisture. Always work a conditioning product into your hair afterwards, such as a deep conditioner or a conditioning mask. Let the product soak in for 15-30 minutes, then rinse it out completely with cool water to seal the cuticle."

      "title": "Repeat the next day if the first round didn’t remove all of the color.",
      "content": "Repeat the next day if the first round didn’t remove all of the color. Lighter hair colors tend to hold onto dye, especially vivid colors like Kool-Aid. Your hair may need a second round to completely remove all of the Kool-Aid dye, so repeat the same process the next day and make sure to moisturize well after each soak."

      "content": "Mix equal parts baking soda and shampoo together to form a paste. In a plastic or glass bowl, stir together baking soda and shampoo in a 1:1 ratio. To ensure you make enough to cover your dyed hair, measure out the amount of shampoo you would normally use in the shower and then add the same amount of baking soda. [5] X Research source Anti-dandruff shampoo is said to work best because of its high pH, which fades hair dye. However, you can also use a clarifying shampoo instead."

      "content": "Work the paste into your wet hair until it lathers. Scoop some paste into your hand and start working into the hair where the dye starts. Use your fingers to work the paste down toward the tips, adding in more paste as needed, until you’ve covered the entire dyed section of hair. [6] X Research source You don’t need to apply the paste to your natural hair, just the Kool-Aid sections. If your color starts at the roots, make sure to start working the paste in at the roots and work all the way down to the tips of your hair. If only your tips are dyed, start applying the paste an inch or two above the dyed section to make sure you don’t miss any of the color. Unlike the hot water and baking soda method above, this method is safer to use on the scalp."

Be sure to rinse your hair with cool water to seal the cuticles."

      "content": "Use a deep conditioning treatment after using any color-fading methods. Because any technique that strips color from your hair is drying, you’ll likely notice dryness, brittleness, or split ends in your hair afterwards. Deep-conditioning will give your hair an instant infusion of nutrients and restore some of the moisture stripped by the treatments. [8] X Research source You can either buy a conditioning product or make your own with castor oil. Focus the deep conditioner on the ends of your hair, which will likely be the most brittle.

Once a week, apply a moisturizing hair mask to your whole head and leave it on for the directed amount of time, then gently rinse it out with warm water. You can either purchase hair masks or make your own with ingredients like yogurt, honey, and olive oil. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Shampoo every 2-3 days to let your hair restore its natural oils. Since your hair will be dry and brittle after these color-removing treatments, you’ll need to give it a break from shampoo as well. Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo to clean your hair once every 2-3 days. In between, your hair will have time to regain its natural sebum, which makes it healthy and shiny. [11] X Research source If your hair feels extremely brittle, just give it a quick rinse and apply conditioner to the ends."

Waiting 4 weeks should give your hair time to strengthen and replenish its moisture, but you may need to wait an extra 1-2 weeks if your hair still feels dry."
