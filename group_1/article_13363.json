Alternately, you may draw a sacred circle on a piece of paper large enough to stand on. Light candles around the circle before you step inside. Candle magic is thought to enhance the power of a spell by tapping into the elements, which are represented by the different parts of the candle—fire, air (to feed the flame), water (liquid wax), and earth (solid wax). Set an intention for your spell as you light the candles. [1] X Research source"

Here are a few examples of words you can use to place your hex: To cast a binding spell and prevent the person from taking actions, repeat, \"I bind your feet from bringing you to harm me. I bind your hands from reaching out to harm me. I bind your mouth from spreading tales to harm me. I bind your mind from sending energy to harm me.\" Say this while wrapping the poppet in black ribbon. To cast a love spell over someone you desire, say the words, \"Bright the flame. Light the fire. Red is the color of desire.\""

      "content": "Make a poppet. A poppet is a small magical doll, also known as a voodoo doll . Choose a piece of black cloth and cut 2 layers in the shape of a small person. The shape should look vaguely similar to the person on whom you want to place a hex. Sew the edges together but leave the top of the head unsewn. Black cloth is best, but if you don't have it on hand, you can use another color. Your poppet should be created from all natural materials. Avoid using polyester fabric or other man-made fabrics; black magic is not as easily conducted through manmade materials."

      "content": "Fill the poppet. Fill it up with earth, a few powerful crystals, and hair and nail clippings from the person you want to hex. Sew up the head to close the poppet. Ideally, the poppet should contain something the person you’re hexing has had physical contact with. If you can’t get their hair or nails, try anything they’ve touched or owned, like a piece of clothing or even a note they wrote."

      "content": "Draw a circle with a pentagram inside. This powerful symbol is present during most black magic rituals. It is traditionally drawn in the ground using a wand hewn from a hazel tree. You may use a stick or another implement to draw the symbol if Hazelwood isn't available. Choose a strategic location that will give your spell the best chance to work. Spirits will have a harder time visiting a location that's populated by a lot of people, so choose a place in the woods or another area not frequently visited. Graveyards are a classic place to choose if you're planning on conjuring the dead."

If you are summoning a demon or some other spirit, you must learn its true name before the spell will work. There is no one spell that will work to bring true love, give you immortality, and so on. Do research to find a spell, or write your own if you'd like."

Another name for a grimoire is a “Book of Shadows.” You can create your own Book of Shadows or use one that was already compiled by another magic practitioner. One famous example is The Witches’ Way, by Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar."

There are different rituals for everything from casting a spell to gain wealth to raising the dead from their graves. Most rituals involve the following elements: A site is chosen for casting the curse or spell. A circle is drawn on the casting site, and a pentacle is drawn inside the circle. This is called a circle of power. Candles, herbs, crystals, charms, and other materials are employed to help draw out the spirits. [2] X Research source Words of power (relevant to the particular outcome you want) are repeated 3 times."

[3] X Research source The threefold law (Wiccan Rede) states that what you put forth comes back to you threefold. Do you feel so strongly about using black magic that you're willing to suffer should the magic come back to harm you? Be sure that the outcome you are hoping to obtain is completely worth it."

Black magic is considered a dark art because you use it to get what you want by means of controlling someone else or harming them with negative energy. [4] X Research source If your aim is to help others or bring about some form of peace and justice, look into white magic instead. If you want to practice magic for personal gain, black magic is what you should use. Here are common reasons why people use black magic: To keep someone bound in place. If someone is harming you and you wish to stop them, you can use a binding spell to stop the person's actions. To cause someone to be attracted to you. Love spells are among the most popular when it comes to black magic. To achieve immortality or improve your health. To communicate with the dead."

      "content": "Understand curses and hexes. Aside from conducting a classic black magic ritual, there are other ways to perform black magic. Placing a curse or hex is done to bring ill fortune to another person, or to make them do what you want them to do. Be very careful about using curses and hexes. It's up to you to determine whether your reasons for wanting to bring misfortune to another person are valid. You must use your power wisely."
