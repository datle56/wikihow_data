      "content": "Fold the sleeves inward first if the dress has any. You want the sleeves to cross the chest and lay flat against the body of the dress. Start with the right sleeve and fold it inward keeping the fold even with the arm seam. Do the same with the left sleeve. [1] X Research source If the sleeves go past the waistline of the dress, fold the crossed sleeves upward so they fit in the top half section."

      "title": "Fold the dress in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Fold the dress in half lengthwise. Align the skirt’s side seams so they are even. Give the dress a quick shake to smooth out any ruffles and use your hands to smooth out the fabric of the skirt. [2] X Research source Try folding the dress on a flat, hard surface, like a table. This will help you fold more neatly. It is okay if the skirt of the dress is taking up a lot of space even after being folded in half. The important part is getting the seams lined up evenly so you have a side of the dress that is straight."

      "content": "Fold the excess skirt material toward the straight line of fabric. The goal is to make the shape of your dress a neat rectangle. If there is too much material (i.e. the skirt fabric now extends past the straight fold you made lengthwise) you’ll fold the excess material again, in the opposite direction. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the dress in half or thirds.",
      "content": "Fold the dress in half or thirds. Start by folding the bottom of the dress toward the top of the dress. This will give you a good idea of how many times you will need to fold the dress to make it the right size. [4] X Research source When the dress is completely folded, it should be a neat square or rectangle. For a short dress, one fold in half will work, but for a knee-length or calf-length dress, you may need to fold the dress in thirds to make it the right size for storage. If the dress is exceptionally long, like a floor-length sundress, you may want to fold the dress into even smaller sections."

      "content": "Fold dresses in a dry-cleaning bag or unscented grocery bag for travel. This trick works really well to protect the dress from getting ruffled by other clothes in your suitcase. You will put the dress into the bag before starting any of the folding steps. Align the top of the dress with the top of the bag and fold as instructed above. [5] X Research source If the dress is longer than the bag, fold the excess skirt material up into the bag and proceed to fold as normal. Don’t flatten out the bag and push out all the excess air. A little air buffer can help protect the dress and keep it fresh when you travel."

If you are trying to save space, moving those summer dresses into storage when winter comes around is a great way to free up some room!

This will help keep them smelling fresh until you take them back out of storage."
