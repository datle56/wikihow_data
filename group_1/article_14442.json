      "content": "Draw a rough sketch of the room and write in the measurements. Skip the ruler or graph paper and just use a pencil and blank paper. If you’re measuring a basic rectangular room, simply jot down your 4 measurements next to the corresponding walls. If the room has walls that jut out or sink in in certain places (such as for a closet) add those measurements as well in the appropriate spots. [2] X Research source Write down feet/inches measurements as 10’3¼” (10 feet 3¼ inches), and metric measurements as a decimal (i.e., 4.5m)."

      "content": "Convert your measurements with a scale ruler for precision. A scale ruler (or architect’s scale) looks like a triangular-shaped ruler and can adjust measurements to your preferred scale quickly. The different sides of the scale are marked with different common scale ratios—for instance, ¼” = 1’ (¼ inch = 1 foot), which is common for architectural drawings. Once you find the side with your preferred ratio, do the following steps: [3] X Research source Lay your chosen side of the ruler on your paper. Draw a line on the paper from the zero mark on the ruler to the number mark on the ruler that matches the length of the wall you’re drawing. For example, if the scale is ¼” = 1’, and the wall you measure is 11 feet, you would draw to the eleventh ¼” mark. If you don’t have a scale ruler, use a regular ruler and come up with a scale that fits its measurements. For example, have ½ inch on paper equal 1 foot in real life."

      "content": "Use a “one square equals one foot” scale on graph paper for simplicity. If you don't have a scale ruler, a typical 8 in × 10.5 in (20 cm × 27 cm) sheet of graph paper with a grid of 0.25 in (0.64 cm) squares will work just fine. At this size, you’ll find approximately 41 squares running along the long side of the paper and 31 squares on the short side. So as long as the room isn't bigger than 40 ft × 30 ft (12.2 m × 9.1 m), a single square can represent one square foot. This ¼” = 1’ scale (also represented by the ratio 1:48) is very common in architectural measurements in the U.S. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Calculate the maximum scale you can use to draw your plan in feet and inches. If your graph paper is 41 by 31 squares, reduce it to 39 by 29 to provide some space around the edges of the paper. If your room is a square or rectangle, round the measurements up to the next whole foot (e.g., 10’2” x 8’6” becomes 11’ x 9’). If it isn’t, determine the smallest square/rectangle (rounded up to the nearest whole foot) that the entire room would fit into. Then: Multiply the square/rectangle measurements (e.g., 11’ and 9’) by 2, 3, 4, and 6. In this case, you’ll get 22’ x 18’, 33’ x 27’, 44’ x 36’, and 66’ x 54’. Use the pair of multiplied numbers that are closest to 39 x 29 without going over. In this case, it is 33’ x 27’ (the multiple of 3). Since the multiple of 3 fits the parameters, draw your plan so that 3 squares equals 1 foot."

Reduce the number of squares you’ll use on the graph paper (e.g., 41 x 31 to 39 x 29) to create some space around the edges. Take your room measurements and round them up to the nearest tenth of a meter (e.g., 4.23m x 3.37m becomes 4.3m x 3.4m). Or, find the smallest square/rectangle (rounded up to the nearest tenth of a meter) into which a non-square/rectangular room will fit. Then: Multiply the square/rectangle measurements (e.g., 4.3 x 3.4) by 2, 4, 5, and 10. In this case, you’ll get 8.6 x 6.8, 17.2 x 13.6, 21.5 x 17.0, and 43.0 x 34.0. We use 2, 4, 5, and 10 in this case so that the decimals come out as nice even numbers. Use the pair of multiplied numbers that are closest to 39 by 29 without going over. In this case, it’s 21.5 x 17.0 (the multiple of 5). Since the multiple of 5 fits the parameters, draw your plan so that 5 squares equals 1 meter."

[7] X Research source For furniture that isn’t square or rectangular, find the smallest square/rectangle into which the piece will fit and use those measurements. For instance, if a wingback chair has a maximum width of 2’6” and a length of 2’, represent it with a 2 ½” x 2” rectangle (using the ¼” = 1’ scale).
