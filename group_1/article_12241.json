  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Protect your groin, throat, stomach, and eyes with your hands and arms.",
      "content": "Protect your groin, throat, stomach, and eyes with your hands and arms. These are the most vulnerable parts of your body, and the parts that a serious attacker is most likely to try to hit. A serious blow to your stomach or throat could leave you helpless. So, block your attacker’s blows with your hands and upper arms. If it’s possible, deflect any punches or slaps so they land on your shoulders or upper torso. [1] X Research source If you end up on the ground and the assailant is kicking or striking you, roll into a ball and cover your head."
    },
    {
      "title": "Head-butt your attacker if they grab you from behind.",
      "content": "Head-butt your attacker if they grab you from behind. In some cases, you may not see your attacker coming towards you. If you feel someone grab you from behind, head-butt backwards so that the back of your skull hits them in the nose. If that doesn’t work, bend your knees to drop your weight and hit the aggressor in their nose with your elbow. A sharp blow with either your head or your elbow should make the attacker release you. [2] X Research source If someone grabs you from the front, try head-butting them in the nose with your forehead. If you’re not able to do this, punch the assailant in 1 of their armpits. This should cause them to loosen their hold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strike your assailant with a makeshift weapon from your environment.",
      "content": "Strike your assailant with a makeshift weapon from your environment. If you’ve given your attacker a few blows and they’re continuing to attack you, look for a weapon on your person. Stab at your attacker’s eyes with you keys or beat their face with a bag or purse. Or, if there happen to be stray sticks or metal poles in your environment, hit back at your attacker with these. You could even throw dirt or sand in their eyes to temporarily blind them. [3] X Research source Of course, these items are not ideal weapons to use in a fight, but they could be the difference between a couple of stitches and a serious stay in the hospital. Many people also carry pepper spray, which is a great option to use against your assailant if you’re being attacked."
    },
    {
      "title": "Return to your defensive position after striking your assailant.",
      "content": "Return to your defensive position after striking your assailant. Don’t give your attacker the chance to grab your arm or catch you off balance after you’ve struck out at them. As soon as you hit them, return to the defensive position with your knees slightly bent and your hands raised. Raise your dominant hand in front of your cheek and hold your other hand in front of your temple. If you are hit hard in your cheek or temple, you may pass out. Protecting these parts of your face is very important. While you’re fighting, try to continue making as much noise as possible. This may deter the attacker or draw other people to the area. Yell things like, “Leave me alone!” or “Get away from me!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Seek medical attention if you were injured during the attack.",
      "content": "Seek medical attention if you were injured during the attack. Once you’ve made it to safety—whether that’s a crowded public place or the privacy of your home—look yourself over and make sure you weren’t injured. If you find that you were hurt, visit your doctor or an Urgent Care center. If you’re just lightly scratched or bruised, you may only need to apply an adhesive bandage and perform a couple other basic First-Aid tasks . Hospitals often have the staff to deal with threats and attackers if they try to continue the fight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hit their knees with your feet or elbow to reduce their mobility.",
      "content": "Hit their knees with your feet or elbow to reduce their mobility. Kicking your attacker’s knees is a reliable way to cause them substantial pain and to keep them from being able to run after you very quickly. Since the knees are only a couple of feet off the ground, the attacker also won’t be able to grab your foot when you’re kicking. Kick the front of their knee if you want to cause serious injury and either side of the knee to instantly destabilize the attacker. [4] X Research source If your attacker has already knocked you to the ground, strike at the sides of the attacker’s knees with your elbows."
    },
    {
      "title": "Jab",
      "content": "Jab or scratch your attacker in their eyes. Form your dominant hand into a fist and punch your attacker in the eyes. You can also try scratching at the person’s eyes if you have long fingernails. The eyes are one of the most vulnerable spots of the body, and a quick strike to the eyes can quickly change a would-be attacker’s mind. They’ll also be temporarily unable to see, giving you a chance to escape. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that you’re not trying to blind your aggressor, just inflict some damage so you can escape the scene. If you have pepper spray with you, spray it into your attacker’s eyes to temporarily blind them and cause a great deal of pain. Or, try stabbing them in the eyes with your keys."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hit the attacker in the nose with a fist or open hand.",
      "content": "Hit the attacker in the nose with a fist or open hand. The nose is also a vulnerable, sensitive area. To harm your attacker, give them a punch in the nose. You can also hit them in the nose with the base of your open palm. Alternately, if your attacker is within 2 feet (0.61 m) of you, try hitting them in the nose with an elbow. [6] X Research source Hitting your attacker in the nose will leave them in immense pain and should give you time to quickly leave the area."

    {
      "title": "Punch the aggressor in their Adam’s apple or at the base of their throat.",
      "content": "Punch the aggressor in their Adam’s apple or at the base of their throat. If the person attacking you leaves their throat uncovered, jab a punch at their neck. Aim for the Adam’s apple or for the soft patch between their collarbones at the base of their neck. A firm hit to either of these spots will temporarily cut off the attacker’s airflow and give you a chance to make an escape. [7] X Research source Be aware that a hard punch to the Adam’s apple could collapse someone’s airway and kill them. Unless you are literally fighting for your life, don’t hit the attacker as hard as you can in the Adam’s apple."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick your assailant in the groin if you’re being attacked by a man.",
      "content": "Kick your assailant in the groin if you’re being attacked by a man. A solid kick to a man’s groin is a reliable way to incapacitate him for several minutes; he may even drop to the ground in agony. When you’re lining up your kick, aim for the center of the groin directly in between your attacker’s legs. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that your attacker will likely be expecting a kick in the groin and may quickly move away or block your kick. If you’re being attacked by a woman, kicking her in the groin isn’t necessarily a bad idea, but it won’t be as effective as it will against a man."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your escape while your assailant is incapacitated.",
      "content": "Make your escape while your assailant is incapacitated. As soon as you have a chance to disengage from the fight, escape as fast as you can and seek help. [9] X Research source Immediately call 911 dispatch and explain what is going on. If you happen to see a police officer, stop them and ask for their help. Whether you’re speaking to a 911 dispatcher or a cop, give a statement of what happened. Never try to “finish” a fight. If you see that your opponent is in pain (e.g., because of a blow to the throat, eyes, or groin), don’t wait around to see if they are ok. Run away and get to safety: your car, inside a building, or in a crowd of people where the assailant won’t be able to find you."

    {
      "title": "Project confidence and awareness so that you’re not an easy target.",
      "content": "Project confidence and awareness so that you’re not an easy target. Muggers and other violent criminals try to prey on easy targets: people who aren’t very aware of their environment and who can be ambushed easily. So, instead of walking with your head pointed down looking at your phone, stand up straight, walk briskly, and keep your shoulders back and chin up. Avoid making eye contact with anyone who you feel may be following you, but do glance around yourself so you’re aware of your surroundings. [10] X Research source If a would-be attacker feels that you’d make a difficult target, they’ll leave you alone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk your way out of a fight to avoid physical violence.",
      "content": "Talk your way out of a fight to avoid physical violence. If the potential aggressor starts to speak to you roughly, say calming things to diffuse the situation. Ideally, you’ll calm the aggressor down, or at least buy yourself enough time to leave the scene. Try saying something like, “Look, I don’t think there’s any reason for you to be aggressive. I’m going to get in my car and drive away now. Don’t follow me.” [11] X Research source Even if the aggressor raises their voice or says insulting things, don’t get into a shouting match. Stay calm and try to diffuse the situation so you can leave."
    },
    {
      "title": "Escape the scene to lose the attacker if you have the opportunity.",
      "content": "Escape the scene to lose the attacker if you have the opportunity. When someone is approaching you aggressively, try to get away by ducking into your vehicle, walking inside a business, or blending into a crowd. If you have a chance to flee and escape a potential attack without fighting, do it. Try throwing a wallet or watch in 1 direction and then run in the opposite direction to escape. [12] X Research source Or, if an attacker asks for your wallet, credit cards, jacket, or shoes, hand the items over. It’s not worth potentially losing your life just to hang on to some money."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shout at the aggressor to deter them from attacking you.",
      "content": "Shout at the aggressor to deter them from attacking you. In nearly all cases, attackers look for victims who they can easily—and quietly—subdue. Most will avoid loud situations that could draw other people (or even the police) to the scene. So, if someone is approaching you and may attack, loudly shout “Back off!” [13] X Research source If they advance further, keep shouting. Yell something like, “Get out of here!” or “Leave me alone!” If you have a cell phone with you, you could pull it out and shout, “I’m calling 911 right now if you don’t back off!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stand in a defensive position",
      "content": "Stand in a defensive position in case the aggressor attacks you. If you can’t escape or diffuse the situation, begin preparing yourself for a strike. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your non-dominate leg in front and pointing outward. Keep your weight centered over both feet. Crouch a little so that your center of gravity is low, and bring up your hands to protect your face. [14] X Research source This stance will make it harder to fight you and will give you more control when you need to defend yourself. Keeping your body compact will prevent you from flailing and will make it easier to keep your balance during strikes."
