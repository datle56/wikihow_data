      "content": "A classic ducktail gives you a clean, slicked-back look. Ducktail hairstyles work best if you have a full head of medium-long hair. You should typically have 2-4 inches (5.08 cm-10.16 cm) of hair all around to achieve this polished yet dramatic look. Rub a nickel-sized amount of strong-hold pomade through your hair with your fingers, and using a wide-tooth comb, rake back the sides of your hair, so they touch at the back of your head. Then, slick back the hair on the top of your head toward the nape of your neck, et voila—you’re rocking a classic ducktail! Ducktails, unsurprisingly, get their name from their resemblance to a duck’s side-swept backside. Hey, cool is cool! Ducktail hairstyles are high maintenance. Greasers working this style in the 50s would often carry a comb in their pocket to slick back their hair to the sides throughout the day. [1] X Research source"

Your low fade will be an awesome accent beneath your ducktail at the upper part of your head. [3] X Research source For at-home styling, rub a dollop of moisturizing hair mousse through your hair with your fingers, focusing on poofing out the back tuft of your hair by your neck that your barber left. This accent piece can also be braided for a stylish edge."
