      "title": "Don’t take it personally.",
      "content": "Don’t take it personally. Their words are about them, not you. Sometimes, when others are hurting, they may lash out at you with hurtful words. Everyone does this from time to time. It is often done without thinking, and they may even regret the words later. [1] X Research source If someone says something hurtful to you, try to remember that they are probably hurting. Send compassion back to them rather than taking their comment personally."

    {
      "title": "Validate the person who hurt you.",
      "content": "Validate the person who hurt you. If a person says something hurtful to you, respond gently in a way that validates the person, but not their unkind words. Whether or not the other person intended their words to be hurtful, this type of response is likely to catch them off guard, and they may be more likely to stop and think about how their words affect you. For example, you could say something like, “Wow, I’m shocked to hear such a good person say something so unkind.”"

      "title": "Set a timer to stew.",
      "content": "Set a timer to stew. Rather than dwelling on the hurtful words others say to you, give yourself a deadline to stew them over. Feel the hurt for a designated amount of time. Then, choose to let them go. For example, you might usually spend hours or even days mulling over these comments. Start setting a timer for about 10 minutes. Think about how the comment made you feel and acknowledge the pain. Once the timer finishes, put those feelings down and don't pick them back up again."

      "title": "Write the words down, then destroy the paper.",
      "content": "Write the words down, then destroy the paper. If you’re more of a hands-on person, you might take power away from hurtful words by destroying them. Write the words down on a sheet of paper. Then, you might rip the paper to shreds, toss it into a fireplace, or scratch out the words with a pencil or pen."

    {
      "title": "Replace it with a positive comment.",
      "content": "Replace it with a positive comment. Offset the impact of negative words by replacing them with your own positive words. This works because you are cancelling out the negative comment in your mind by following it up with a more positive, uplifting comment. [2] X Research source For example, if someone said, “You’re ugly,” you might replace that comment by saying to yourself, “There is only one of me in the universe. I am special and unique.”"

    {
      "title": "Use the words to become stronger.",
      "content": "Use the words to become stronger. In what way does this situation test you? Evaluate the hurtful words and see if you can channel them into productive action. Question why the words hurt you and what you can do about it. [3] X Research source For instance, if someone said, “You’re weak,” and you believe that, you might feel upset or angry. However, if you take action, such as learning to defend yourself or strengthening your mental functioning, you can prevent those words from hurting you ever again."

      "title": "Make your own opinion your priority.",
      "content": "Make your own opinion your priority. Your confidence is always teetering on a ledge when you allow others to dictate how you feel about yourself. Stop placing so much weight on what others think about you. Instead, your own opinion should be the most important. [5] X Research source For example, if someone says, “You’ll never amount to anything,” but you don’t truly believe that, remind yourself of what you think. You might say to yourself, “That’s not true. I believe I am destined for greatness.”"

      "title": "Get things done to feel more confident.",
      "content": "Get things done to feel more confident. How you feel about yourself and your abilities is intimately linked to your self-confidence. You can boost your self-confidence by taking on more challenges. Think about a goal or task that you would like to accomplish. Then, break it down into little steps that you can complete one at a time. [6] X Research source For example, if you want to become financially independent, you might start by getting a job. Then, you might look for a place to live that fits your income level. Then, you might create a savings account or invest in stock that benefits your long-term financial status.

There is always something to be learned from a conflict or painful experience. Once you’ve had some time to move away from the initial hurt, take time to reflect on what happened. Some things to think about include: What might have been going on in the other person’s life, or in your relationship with them, to trigger the unkind words? Was there any truth in the words that you might be able to benefit from, even if they were phrased harshly or in an unhelpful way? If someone speaks to you this way again, how can you deal with it better in the future?"
