      "content": "Make sure you have an apple-shaped body. Before you begin to think about dressing for your body type, you should confirm that you do indeed have an apple shaped body. Some people mistake a pear-shaped body for an apple-shaped body. An apple shaped-body is heavy in the middle and above the waist, while a pear-shaped body is heavier below the waist and in the upper thighs. Here are some other characteristics of the apple-shaped body: [1] X Research source A wide torso Broad shoulders An average-to-fuller bust An undefined waist Thinner arms and legs A flat bottom Hips that are narrower than your bust You don't have to have a very large belly to be apple shaped -- it just means that your center of gravity, or your extra weight, resides in your belly area."

      "content": "Draw attention away from your middle. To dress your apple-shaped body, you'll want to take attention away from your middle, since it's already full.

      "content": "Emphasize your bust. If you have an apple-shaped body, then you must have a great bust, so don't be afraid to flaunt it. Showing off your bust will not only emphasize one of your most amazing features, but it will also take attention away from your middle. To emphasize your bust, you should wear v-necks, plunging necklines, or A-line dresses, to lengthen your body and draw attention to your bust. Wear shirts or dresses that flow from under your bust, expanding at the waist. Remember that drawing attention to your bust is different from looking top-heavy. You don't need to wear elaborate necklaces or tops with ornate patterns near the neck. You already have a great bust, so it needs no adornments."

You can do this with a pair of short-shorts, or high heels that lengthen your body and balance out your bottom half. Don't minimize your legs by wearing big heavy boots, leggings, or skinny jeans. This will only make your gorgeous legs look smaller."

Instead, pick a shirt or top that flows downward from your bust, like a top with a high-waistline, empire waist, or A-line. Here are some things to keep in mind as you choose the shape of your top: A shirt or dress that has a tie at the waist will also help add definition to your figure.
