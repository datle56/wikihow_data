      "title": "Wash and condition your hair.",
      "content": "Wash and condition your hair. Your hair needs to be clean, conditioned, and still damp to get the best results from this curling method, so you may want to wash your hair before you get started. [1] X Research source If you do not have time to wash your hair or if you have recently washed and dried it, then you can also spray water onto your hair to make it damp."

      "title": "Use some leave-in conditioner and brush your hair.",
      "content": "Use some leave-in conditioner and brush your hair. While your hair is still wet, apply some leave-in conditioner or a curl cream and work it through your hair with your fingertips. Then, use a brush or comb to get rid of any tangles. When you are finished, your hair should be tangle-free. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Make sure that you apply the leave-in conditioner while your hair is still damp. Do not put it on after you hair has dried. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply some hair gel.",
      "content": "Apply some hair gel. To ensure that your curls will stay put after you take out your twists in the morning, work a dollop of styling gel through your strands. You can use your brush or comb to work the gel through your hair or just use your fingers. [5] X Research source You can also use mousse in place of hair gel. Mousse contains alcohol, so it will dry out your hair a bit and this will help to hold the curls for longer."

      "title": "Brush one section into a high pigtail.",
      "content": "Brush one section into a high pigtail. Use your comb or your fingers to divide your hair into two sections. Then brush these sections to opposite sides of your head. Next, take one of the sections and brush it up towards the top of your head. [6] X Research source It is important to position the twists on top of your head because putting them on the sides or back of your head might make sleeping uncomfortable. You can use hair clips to secure your hair in high pigtails until you are ready to twist them or just do one pigtail at a time. If you have lots of hair or if your hair is thick, then you might find it easier to separate it into more than two sections. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist the hair into a bun.",
      "content": "Twist the hair into a bun. Take the hair and then start to twist it all in one direction. Keep twisting the hair until it begins to coil up into a bun. When you have twisted all of the hair and it is all coiled up into a bun, then secure your hair with a hair tie. [8] X Research source Repeat the same process on the other side."

      "title": "Wait for your hair to dry and remove the hair ties.",
      "content": "Wait for your hair to dry and remove the hair ties. Your spiral curls will not be ready until your hair has dried completely. You will have to leave the buns in your hair at least overnight. If your hair is really thick, then it might even take a little longer for them to dry. [9] X Research source To check the dryness of your hair, remove one of the hair ties and unfurl the twist part way. Then feel the hair in the center of the twist to see if it is dry. When your hair is completely dry, you can remove the hair ties."

    {
      "title": "Use your fingers to separate the spirals.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to separate the spirals. As you unfurl the twists, gently pull apart the big spiral curls. Instead of having one big spiral curl, you will have many smaller spirals. [10] X Research source Go slowly to ensure the best results. You can divide the big curls so that the spirals are all about the same size or create different sized spirals. Do not use a brush or comb. If you brush or comb through the spirals, then they will lose their form and become frizzy."

      "title": "Add a bit of texturizing spray.",
      "content": "Add a bit of texturizing spray. If your hair does not hold a curl for long, then adding a texturizing spray may help. To set your curls, try spraying on some texturizing spray. Hair spray may weigh down your hair and cause some of the spirals to loosen. Texturizing spray will help the curls to maintain their form and bounce. Make sure that the texturizing spray gets onto all of the spirals. You may even want to flip your hair upside down to reach the ones underneath."
