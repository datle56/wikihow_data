      "title": "Identify important keywords used in a video.",
      "content": "Identify important keywords used in a video. TikTok makes words and phrases blue that are relevant to the video. So, watch the video all the way through and listen for any words and phrases used by the creator that are related to their content. Then, look for any text that they use in the video itself, in their caption, and in their hashtags. Looking at common words and phrases used by other commenters is helpful too. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re watching someone do a red-carpet fashion review, relevant keywords might be the event name, the notable celebrities at the event, the fashion designers, the films or TV shows the celebrities are in, and “red-carpet” or “fashion review.” Choose popular videos to increase your likelihood of turning your comment blue. Videos with a lot of views and comments have more data for TikTok to sift through, which helps them determine if your keywords are relevant to the video."

      "title": "Type the keywords and phrases into a comment.",
      "content": "Type the keywords and phrases into a comment. Once you’ve gathered the relevant phrases and words associated with your video, simply type them into a comment . Feel free to just comment the relevant phrases or words, or add them into a more detailed comment about the video. [2] X Research source If the video has a suggested search at the top of the comments, copy that into your comment. Likewise, if other comments have blue text, use those words and phrases in your comment. For example, on a video about crocheting a sweater, you might comment “Crochet sweater tutorial” or “Your crochet sweater tutorials are so easy to follow, I’ve loved every one that I’ve made! I’m going to try this pattern ASAP.”"

      "title": "Check back on your comment after a few minutes.",
      "content": "Check back on your comment after a few minutes. TikTok doesn’t immediately turn your comment blue, so watch some other videos for a couple of minutes as you wait. Then, go back to the video and find your comment. If TikTok found the words in your comment relevant to the video, they’ll now be blue with a tiny magnifying glass next to them. [3] X Research source 1.3- When you click on the blue text, TikTok takes you to the search results for that phrase. If your blue text is “rollerskating,” when you click it you’ll see other videos about rollerskating."

      "title": "TikTok chooses to turn comments blue based on their algorithm.",
      "content": "TikTok chooses to turn comments blue based on their algorithm. Right now, there’s no button for you to press or a symbol to add to make your comments blue. Instead, TikTok uses their algorithm to turn comments blue if the words are relevant to the video, are used a lot, or are commonly searched. [4] X Research source While commenting relevant keywords on popular videos boosts your chances of making comments blue, it’s not a perfect method. Sometimes your comments will turn blue, and sometimes they won’t."

      "title": "Blue comments link to a search for the word or phrase on TikTok.",
      "content": "Blue comments link to a search for the word or phrase on TikTok. These comments are an internal search feature that TikTok is currently testing. The blue text in comments links to a search for the word that is related to the content in the video. This is supposed to help users find more content that they’re interested in and boost content creators’ reach and views. [5] X Research source The blue search text is also a way for TikTok to better compete with other apps and search engines like Google."
