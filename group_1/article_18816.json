      "content": "Pour 2 tbsp (28.6 g) of baking soda into a bowl and add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of water. Baking soda is used in many household cleaners and air fresheners because it naturally absorbs odors. Take advantage of this quality by making a baking soda wash for your hands. Start by mixing the baking soda and water together with a spoon until it forms a paste. If the baking soda is still too powdery, add a little more water. Don't dump in so much that the mixture is mostly liquid. This won't stay on your hands and the smell will remain."

      "content": "Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of lemon juice into a bowl. Vinegar binds with odors and removes them from the air, while the citric acid in lemon juice neutralizes the smelly ammonia in fish. Combine these 2 ingredients in a bowl. Then add a drop of dish soap. Mix the contents together with a spoon and let it sit for 30 minutes. The lemon juice can be freshly-squeezed or from a store-bought bottle. It will have the same effect. If you have sensitive skin, you should skip this solution. Undiluted vinegar can burn and irritate your skin. Consider another solution if you're prone to skin irritations. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"
