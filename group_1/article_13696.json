      "content": "Blowout Fade or Brooklyn Fade In the ‘10s, Pauly D of Jersey Shore popularized the classic blowout fade. The look features a temple fade and a blow-dried blowout, with the top hair gelled and combed to stick upward.

      "title": "Blowout Taper Fade",
      "content": "Blowout Taper Fade A blowout taper haircut features a gradual fade all around, while the top is left lengthy and volumized. Unlike a classic Brooklyn fade, this look has a close, gradual shave all around instead of just at the temples. [2] X Research source Ask your barber for a tapered fade on the sides and back, leaving the crown long."
    },
    {
      "title": "Straight Blowout",
      "content": "Straight Blowout For a more severe take on the blowout, ditch the tapered fade for a high one and get a straight blowout of the hair on the crown. You’ll need thick hair for this look, as the style defies gravity while featuring a sleek, straight texture. [3] X Research source Tell your barber you’d like a high fade to the crown and plenty of length on top, to be styled straight upward. Many barber shops use numbers that correspond to clipper guards to indicate the length of a hairstyle. Carnevale-Russo explains, “The higher the clipper, the more hair that's going to be left on the head...So a one or a zero is going to be a fade-type haircut.”"

      "title": "Afro Blowout Fade",
      "content": "Afro Blowout Fade The blowout fade works with all hair textures and styles, including the afro. A low taper fade and a neat afro on top define this take on the classic style. [4] X Research source To ask for this haircut at the barber’s, request a very low taper fade, leaving your afro as-is on top or trimming it to your desired length."
    },
    {
      "title": "Undercut Blowout",
      "content": "Undercut Blowout Turn the blowout haircut into an edgier look by opting for an undercut instead of a tapered fade. This look creates a sharp contrast between the sides and top of your head. [5] X Research source Ask your barber for an undercut on the sides and/or back, leaving medium length on top."

      "title": "Messy Blowout",
      "content": "Messy Blowout While the classic blowout haircut is typically gelled straight up, a messy look adds a modern flair. Start by getting the blowout taper haircut. To get the disheveled look, run pomade through your hair after blow-drying it, scrunching as you go. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Blowout with High Fade",
      "content": "Blowout with High Fade Get a high fade to make a bolder style statement with your blowout. This fade starts above the temples rather than above the ear. Your hair is mostly shaved on the sides and back, so the length on top can take the spotlight. [7] X Research source At the barbershop, ask if you can get a high fade on the sides while keeping a long top."

    {
      "title": "Blowout with Mid Fade",
      "content": "Blowout with Mid Fade If you’re not a fan of the blowout taper fade look, but not ready to commit to the high fade, the mid fade is for you. This fade should start halfway between the top of the ears and the start of the crown. [8] X Research source To request this blowout haircut, simply request a mid fade all around and medium or long length on top, depending on your preference."

      "title": "Curly Blowout Fade",
      "content": "Curly Blowout Fade For those with curly hair, a blowout fade can become a striking study in contrasts. The voluminous texture of your curls on top is essentially a natural blowout—paired with a super-close bald taper fade on the sides. [9] X Research source Ask your barber for a bald taper fade on the sides, a taper fade in the back, and a wash and style on top."

    {
      "title": "Wavy Blowout Fade",
      "content": "Wavy Blowout Fade Wavy hair can be a lot to style. Getting a blowout fade haircut will rein in the sides and leave enough length on top for you to gel it upward into a stylish quiff hairstyle. [10] X Research source Tell your barber you’d like a soft tapered fade on the sides and back, leaving plenty of length at the crown for a blowout style."
    },
    {
      "title": "Volumized Blowout",
      "content": "Volumized Blowout Also known as the long blowout, this twist on the trendy haircut features an especially voluminous top for a dramatic look.

[11] X Research source At the barber, ask for cropped or faded sides and a volumized style at the crown."

      "title": "Spiked Blowout",
      "content": "Spiked Blowout Another blowout that doesn’t feature a fade is the spiked blowout. This look begins with short sides that blend seamlessly with the length at the crown of the head. Use pomade or hair wax to style the top hair upward after blow-drying, pulling strands of hair into spikes for interesting texture. [12] X Research source Ask your barber for some light shearing on top to help create your spiky texture, and short sides and back (you can specify how short)."

      "title": "Blowout Fade with Line Up",
      "content": "Blowout Fade with Line Up The line up adds a subtle, sharp detail to your basic blowout fade, emphasizing the gap between the fade and the crown. While it may require more regular touch-ups, it pays dividends in terms of style. [13] X Research source Tell your barber you’d like a blowout fade, with a line-up on one or both sides of the crown (near your temple). You can request a straight line up or a curve."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mohawk Blowout Fade",
      "content": "Mohawk Blowout Fade If the blowout fade isn’t punk enough for you, add a mohawk. Start by getting a regular blowout taper fade haircut. At home, use a comb and product to style the long hair on top of your head both upward and inward until it resembles a mohawk. How spiky you want it is up to you. [14] X Research source At the barber, request your desired fade all around, leaving all or most of your length on top which will be blown out and ready for styling."

Give in to your ‘80s nostalgia with a haircut that’s a cross between a mullet and a traditional blowout fade. Note you’ll need extra length all around to pull off this style.

    },
    {
      "title": "Crown or Pompadour Blowout Fade",
      "content": "Crown or Pompadour Blowout Fade Also known as the pompadour fade, the crown fade is a contemporary update to the straight-up blowout fade haircut. This variation leaves extra hair in the front for a volumized, shapely look that stands out among the rest. [15] X Research source To request this style, ask your barber for a pompadour fade, requesting either a gradual taper fade or a mid fade. Ask for some shearing of the crown, leaving extra length at the front by the hairline to create your pompadour."

    {
      "title": "Detailed Blowout Fade",
      "content": "Detailed Blowout Fade If you find a barber that’s creative and skilled enough, you can add a design to your blowout fade. Specifically, the fade portion can be clipped to create a pattern, whether it’s a couple zigzag lines or a dynamic pattern. While the blown out portion of the hair is usually the star of this style, a detailed fade will steal the spotlight. Instead of requesting a specific design, ask your barber for examples of past detailed fades they’ve done. If there’s one you like in their portfolio (that you think would work on your hair length and color), let them know you want that fade along with a blowout style on top."

    {
      "title": "Blowout with Burst Fade",
      "content": "Blowout with Burst Fade Rather than varying the length or texture of the blown out portion of hair on your crown, shake things up with an interesting fade. A burst fade, which follows a circular arc from behind the ear, is a complementary style for a mohawk or mullet blowout. [16] X Research source Ask for a burst fade blowout, leaving length on top. Specify if you’d like a mullet as part of your look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blowout with Drop Fade",
      "content": "Blowout with Drop Fade Drop fades have taken social media (and barbershops) by storm. The pattern is simple: the hair is left somewhat close to the ear but curves as it reaches the back of the head, forming a U shape. While often paired with a cropped haircut up top, a blowout variation would leave you plenty of volume to work with. [17] X Research source Tell your barber you want a drop fade, with mid to long length on the crown for blowing out and styling."

    {
      "title": "Wash and blot-dry your hair.",
      "content": "Wash and blot-dry your hair. Clean hair is the best base for a blowout style. You don’t want your locks weighed down by oil and grime. Shampoo, condition, and rinse as usual before blotting your hair dry with a towel. [18] X Research source Once your hair is dry, spritz or massage heat protectant throughout your hair. This will protect your strands from damage when you blow dry."

    {
      "title": "Rough dry with a blow dryer on medium heat.",
      "content": "Rough dry with a blow dryer on medium heat. Set your blow dryer to medium heat—there’s no need to blast it on the highest setting. When you’re rough drying, work your dryer over your entire head to help it dry and gain volume. Point the dryer upward at the roots, lifting your hair with your other hand as needed. [19] X Research source Chiz says, “If your hair lays really flat down, you sort of want to push it the opposite way and dry it in that direction.” Try flipping your hair over and blow drying at the cuticle to shape your hair in the right direction and add volume."

    {
      "title": "Use a round brush and blow dryer to style.",
      "content": "Use a round brush and blow dryer to style. Once your hair is mostly dry, begin gently brushing your hair upward with the rounded brush as you blow dry downward for a blowout effect. Continue until you’ve smoothed and completely dried every section of the top of your hair. [20] X Research source Alternatively, Chiz says you can use a blowout brush tool. “Different brands have different versions of it, where you can actually dry and smooth your hair at the same time,” she explains, adding, “If you do it that way, it tends to last a little bit longer.” The front section of your hair may need extra time to volumize and dry completely. To create extra volume, try blow drying the top section of hair forward while moving both the dryer and the brush from side to side. Those with curly hair will want to use a diffuser to help define their curls while drying. Low heat and low speed settings should suffice."

    {
      "title": "Manually style with your desired product.",
      "content": "Manually style with your desired product. Depending on your hair’s texture and the style you’re going for, you’ll need a different product. To introduce texture, use a sea salt spray . For a solid look, use a strong pomade . Apply hair wax to tame flyaways and help lock the style in place. Whichever product you use, you can apply the product evenly through your hair with your fingers. Then, comb to style as desired. [21] X Research source If you have wavy hair and want to define your waves, scrunch your hair as it dries to help your natural texture shape up and shine."
