      "content": "Stretch, but don't exercise the back. When it's time to execute your one-armed pullup, don't try to do it after a back workout or arm workout of any kind. It will be the hardest move in your routine, so you want your muscles to have all of their energy. [1] X Research source Try a little cardio to warm you up first, then roll out your muscles with a ball or foam roller."

      "title": "Grip the bar with one hand.",
      "content": "Grip the bar with one hand. Some people prefer the palm to face toward you, which is technically more of a chin-up but makes the move a bit easier to execute. You can stand facing the bar or turn so that the bar is next to your lifting arm. Try different techniques to see what feels comfortable."

      "content": "Hold the wrist of your lifting arm with your other arm. You will only need to do this the first few times, but it will help support your lifting arm and also give you a little extra lifting power. [2] X Research source Think of your non-lifting arm as the \"support arm\" and only use it as needed. Try to rely on the lifting arm to do most of the work, but use the support arm to help pull yourself up."

      "content": "Try swinging your other arm. Instead of holding your wrist, or once you've accomplished a pullup using a supporting arm, swing your non-lifting arm a bit. This will give your body momentum, which makes that first rep a bit easier. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Lift your body off the ground. Bend your arm at the elbow and focus your lifting between your shoulder blades and across your arm muscles. Lift all the way up, until your head passes the bar. Be careful not to hit yourself on the chin on your way down! It can help to bend your legs under you, crossing your ankles. This gives your body more stability than if you let your legs flail."

      "content": "Build your arm strength . Before you can do regular pull-ups, and especially before mastering the much more challenging one-armed pull up, you need to build strength in your arms. There are many exercises you can do to help build muscle mass and strength in the arms: Work on one armed lat pulldowns. You need to train on a lat pulldown or cable pull machine to execute this move, which involves pulling a weighted handle down to your chest. [5] X Research source Start at comfortable weight (which will vary depending on your fitness level), but work up to two to three repetitions using 20 or 30 percent more weight than your body weight. For example, if you weigh 150, your goal will be to accomplish 2-3 repetitions lifting 180-195 pounds. [6] X Research source Be sure to work both arms equally at each training session. Try the bench press . Bench pressing weight engages both your chest and your arms, which are both players in proper pull-ups. You can start with just the bar if you have no arm strength, or as much weight as you can manage. Gradually add more weight over the course of 3-5 weeks to increase muscle mass and strength. [7] X Research source Master push-ups . Push-ups engage your arms, chest, and back, and can help strengthen your arms for pull-ups. Once you've mastered regular push-ups, learn the one armed push up and be sure to master it with both arms."

      "title": "Build your back strength.",
      "content": "Build your back strength. Contrary to what you might have heard, the arms are not the most important muscle group involved in executing a pull-up. In fact, the serratus anterior (SA) muscle, located on your back under your shoulder blades, holds all the muscles together that are needed for executing a pull-up. If yours is not correctly conditioned, your shoulder blades are out of position and pull-ups are next to impossible to execute, no matter how strong your arms. [8] X Research source Soften the SA and surrounding muscles first, by using a lacrosse ball, tennis ball, or foam roller to release tension and get your muscles in the right position. Laying on a mat or rubber floor, or leaning against a wall, roll the ball hard against your muscles across your pectorals (your chest), teres muscles (directly behind and in your armpits), and SA muscles. Roll gently at first, then increase pressure in tender spots. [9] X Research source Strengthen your back and particularly your SA muscles by focusing on back exercises such as downward facing dog, push ups, reverse flys, and cable rows."

      "title": "Master two-armed pull-ups.",
      "content": "Master two-armed pull-ups . You will need to be able to do more than 25 strict pull ups before you learn the one arm pull up. Using the proper form is crucial as you learn how to do this in order to avoid injury and maximize the benefit of the workout. Using an overhand grip and keeping your hands about shoulder-distance apart, hang from a pull-up bar with your arms extended. Slowly raise your body by bending the elbows, bringing your chest as close to the bar as you can. Slowly lower yourself back to arms extended. [10] X Research source Be sure to exercise different grips. You can do chin-ups, which are like typical pull-ups but with your hands slightly closer together and your palms facing towards you. You can also try widening your grip to engage the back muscles. Once you've mastered regular pull-ups, introduce a new challenge by raising yourself with two arms but lowering yourself with only one, alternating arms at each pull. This gets you one step closer to full one armed pullups. [11] X Research source"
