      "title": "Take a mouth hit from your vape.",
      "content": "Take a mouth hit from your vape. Turn your vape on and let it warm up if it needs to. When you’re first trying to do a ghosty, start with a small hit by only breathing in for a few seconds. Instead of inhaling the vapor all the way into your lungs, just hold it in your mouth. [1] X Research source Fully charge your vape pen to ensure it works properly and produces the most vapor."

    {
      "title": "Hold the vapor in your mouth for 2-3 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the vapor in your mouth for 2-3 seconds. Keeping the vapor in your mouth helps the vapor form into a dense cloud so it forms a ball or ghost-shape when you exhale it. [2] X Research source Avoid breathing the vapor into your throat or lungs because then the cloud won’t retain its shape very well."

    {
      "title": "Shape your mouth into an O.",
      "content": "Shape your mouth into an O. Slowly open your mouth and make a small O-shape with your lips. Be careful not to exhale so you don’t lose all the vapor before you do the trick. [3] X Research source Making a small O with your mouth makes a smaller, denser cloud of vapor. Opening your mouth wider makes a larger cloud, but it won’t look as full."

      "title": "Push the vapor out with your tongue.",
      "content": "Push the vapor out with your tongue. Start with your tongue near the back of your mouth. Then, slowly move it forward toward your teeth without exhaling. The vapor will puff out from your mouth in a dense ball or “ghost” and float in front of your face. [4] X Research source Move your tongue slowly at first so the ball of vapor stays close to your face. As you practice and perform the vape trick more, try moving your tongue faster to push the vapor out even further."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inhale the vapor back in your mouth.",
      "content": "Inhale the vapor back in your mouth. Before the ball of vapor gets too far away, breathe in through your mouth to suck it back in to finish the trick. This time, inhale the vapor all the way to your lungs before exhaling to get the full effect. [5] X Research source Learning how to do a ghosty can take a little bit of time and practice, so don’t get discouraged if you don’t get it right away on the first try."

      "title": "Waterfall",
      "content": "Waterfall Start by taking a big hit from your vape and keeping the vapor in your mouth. Hold a bottle or large glass up, open your mouth, and let the vapor slowly flow into the container. Once it’s full, slowly pour the vapor onto a table or another flat surface so it looks like a waterfall. [6] X Research source Put a couple of ice cubes at the bottom of the bottle you’re using to help the vapor get even thicker."

      "title": "Tornado",
      "content": "Tornado Take a long hit from your vape and hold the vapor in your mouth for a few seconds so it has time to thicken up. Rest your chin on a table, and slowly let the vapor flow out of your mouth so it covers the surface. Then, place your hand at the side of the table and quickly move it toward the center of the vapor. Lift your hand straight up, and the vapor will follow in a small tornado. [7] X Research source Make sure there aren’t any fans or air vents nearby, or else all the vapor will blow away before you can finish the trick."

      "content": "Dragon Hit your vape and let it stay in your mouth for a few seconds. Then, purse and position your lips so there are small openings in the corners of your mouth. Forcefully exhale the vapor through your mouth and nose at the same time to do the dragon trick and make it look like you’re breathing smoke. [8] X Research source If you have trouble breathing out of your nose and mouth at the same time, practice without vaping first. Take a big breath in and try quickly contracting your lungs to force the air out."

      "title": "French Inhale",
      "content": "French Inhale Start with a larger hit from your vape and let the vapor sit in your mouth for a few seconds so it becomes denser. Keep your tongue near the back of your mouth to prevent the vapor from going into your throat. Then, open your mouth and push out your bottom lip slightly. As the vapor flows out of your mouth, inhale through your nose to draw it back in. [9] X Research source This trick is also known as the “Irish Waterfall”."

      "content": "Bane Take a large hit from your vape and keep it in your mouth for a couple of seconds. Hold your tongue at the back of your mouth so vapor doesn’t go down to your lungs. Open your lips slightly, and keep your top and bottom teeth close together. At the same time, slowly exhale and breathe in through your nose. [10] X Research source The vapor will be split into multiple columns that resemble Bane’s mask from the Batman series."

Then, slowly exhale into the bottle’s mouthpiece so a bubble fills with vapor on the cut end. Let the bubble float away or pop it to release the cloud. [11] X Research source Be careful not to exhale too hard or fast, or the bubble will pop as you’re blowing it."

Quickly force a small amount of air out from your throat like if you were silently coughing to blow the vape rings . [12] X Research source Keep your tongue flat near the back of your mouth so it doesn’t block the vapor or prevent a smoke ring from forming."

      "content": "What vapes and e-liquids work best for vape tricks? While you can use vape pens, a vape tank or mod with 80W of power and 0.5 ohms of resistance works best for making dense vapor for tricks. Then, fill your vape with e-liquid that has a high vegetable glycerin (VG) content to help the vapor clouds look fuller. [13] X Research source If you plan on practicing vape tricks often, opt for a low- or no-nicotine e-liquid as well."

      "title": "How do you do vape tricks without coughing?",
      "content": "How do you do vape tricks without coughing? Take smaller hits from your vape when you’re first practicing tricks. Focus on your mouth shape and how fast or slow you push the vapor out of your mouth instead. As you get used to the motions, then start taking slightly bigger hits and using more vapor. Using e-liquid with lower nicotine levels can also make the vapor less harsh so you’re less likely to cough."

      "title": "What is the difference between a “mouth hit” and a “lung hit”?",
      "content": "What is the difference between a “mouth hit” and a “lung hit”? When you take a mouth hit, you inhale lightly to only keep the vapor in your mouth. When you take a lung hit, you inhale deeper so the vapor goes into your lungs instead. Doing a mouth hit helps make the vapor look thicker so it’s easier to do tricks with."
