[1] X Research source You might also want to try writing out the story of how you came to have this item and any information about it that you find important. Often times, it’s not necessarily the item that we are missing, but the memories or the people attached to it. Was this item something of your mother’s and you’re particularly upset because your mother passed away? Or perhaps this item is something from your childhood that you have always had. Write about the meaning of the item. Journaling about the lost item can be therapeutic for you and what you write may also evolve into a meaningful document that can serve as a placeholder for the lost item."

If you are not sure who threw it away, begin asking your family members questions about who last saw the item and who threw it away. If you share a room with your sibling, you might ask them “Hey, have you seen my blanket? I can’t find it anywhere.” If your sibling tells you they are the one who threw it away, don’t react negatively or dramatically. Take some time to step away and calm down."

Please come to me next time, and ask me personally if there is anything you plan to throw out or give away.\""
