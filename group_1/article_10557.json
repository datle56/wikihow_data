As you’re coming up with your character, think about features that can really bring out their personality without having to say it out loud. [3] X Research source Cartoon characters are meant to be larger than life, with details and traits that are exaggerated and dramatic. For instance, if your character is bookish and shy, then maybe their eyes are sunken and are always looking down.

For instance, your character can turn slightly red when they’re angry, or they could have a pale shade of green skin when they’re feeling ill.
