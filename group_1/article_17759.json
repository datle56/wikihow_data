      "title": "Remove the screws from the base of the phone.",
      "content": "Remove the screws from the base of the phone. Use a very small star-shaped (pentalobe) screwdriver to unscrew the two screws at the base of the phone. The base is right below the home button. Take care not to drop the small screws on the floor after you've removed them. [1] X Research source A very small Phillip's screwdriver won't work to remove these screws. A pentalobe screwdriver has five points and is a security feature that Apple frequently uses for its products. Warning: Disassembling your iPhone may void your warranty. Check your warranty information before attempting to fix your phone yourself."

      "content": "Cover the screen with packaging tape. If your screen is so damaged that the glass is broken in several places, the suction cup may not be able to stick to the screen. If so, cut a strip of clear packing tape and cover your screen with one smooth piece. This will also prevent you from accidentally cutting yourself on the broken glass.

      "title": "Apply heat to the bottom of the bottom edge of the phone.",
      "content": "Apply heat to the bottom of the bottom edge of the phone. On most newer water-resistant phones, the screen is held on by an adhesive. Apply heat to loosen the adhesive. You can use a hairdryer, heat gun or a specialized heating pad that comes with screen repair kits."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a suction cup to the screen.",
      "content": "Apply a suction cup to the screen. Take a small suction cup and place it directly on the bottom half of the screen. Press down firmly so it sticks to the broken screen. Your suction cup should have a metal ring extending from it, making it easier to handle. [4] X Research source If the suction cup is having trouble sticking to the screen, slightly moisten the suction cup and press it against the screen. Try not to cover up the home button when putting the tape on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull up on the suction cup.",
      "content": "Pull up on the suction cup. Gently pull up on the suction cup while you hold the phone down. You may need to firmly pull up on the screen several times before it starts to come away from the frame. When it does, move the suction cup to the corner of the screen so you have greater leverage when pulling it away. [5] X Research source Remember to avoid covering the home button with the suction cup. If you cover it, the cup won't be able to suction the screen away."

    {
      "title": "Insert a pry tool.",
      "content": "Insert a pry tool. Once part of the screen is starting to lift away at the bottom corner, take a thin pry tool and insert it underneath the screen. Gently take the pry tool and slide it along the bottom to loosen the screen. [6] X Research source Your repair kit may have come with thin plastic sliders or opening picks that you can insert once you've begun prying up the screen."

    {
      "title": "Slide the pry tool around the entire edge.",
      "content": "Slide the pry tool around the entire edge. Slowly slide the pry tool along each side of your phone's screen so that you loosen it evenly. Avoid pulling up a lot on one side since this could damage or split the screen or home button. Your goal is to loosen and then remove the screen in one piece. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source Water-resistant phones will lose their water-resistance once they are disassembled. You might find it easier to slide a thin opening pick instead of a prying tool when loosening the edges of the screen. Be careful not to insert the pry tool in more than a few millimeters. You could damage the internal components of the iPhone."

    {
      "title": "Lift up the screen.",
      "content": "Lift up the screen. Hold the bottom of the phone down by placing your fingertips on one side of the phone. Hold your other hand over the phone so that your thumb is one side of the screen and your index and middle finger are on the opposite side. Gently lift the screen up about 90 degrees to the right. [9] X Research source Be aware that the screen is still connected to the phone by cables. Be careful not to damage the cables when lifting the display away from the phone."

      "content": "Remove the connector shield. When you open the display, you should see a metal plate held on by screws. This metal plate is the connector shield. Remove the screws and lift the connector shield. There may be more than one connector depending on the model of your iPhone. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source Keep your screws and shield together but away from any other screws and parts you've already removed. This will make it easier to reassemble."

Take your pentalobe screwdriver and remove the two small screws. [14] X Research source If you find it difficult to unscrew the screws, an adhesive may be keeping them in place. Continue using the screwdriver until they come out. While some people recommend using a hairdryer to warm up the adhesive, this can overheat and damage the phone's LCD. If you have a screen replacement that has the home bottom and other components attached, skip to the next part."

You should see two small screws on the backplate itself (near the home button at the bottom and the earphone piece near the top) and two along each side of the phone. Take your pentalobe screwdriver and remove the screws. Remove the backplate and set it aside. [15] X Research source [16] X Research source Consider setting each screw near where it goes on the phone. This will make it easier to remember where each one goes when you reassemble the plate. On iPhone 11, the backplate is below the speaker assembly."
