      "content": "Glove compartment Open your Honda’s glove compartment and look for a sticker placed inside. The sticker is probably a white rectangle (like a credit card) with lots of codes printed on it, including your radio code, radio serial number, navigation codes, and more. Check for a code labeled “Anti-Theft Radio Code” or something similar. In some cases, there may be a loose card with codes printed on it rather than an adhesive sticker."

      "content": "Owner’s manual Grab your owner’s manual from the glove compartment (or wherever you store it) and look for a sticker with the radio code on the front or back cover. This sticker is identical to the one placed in your glove compartment and will also have the radio serial number and other useful codes printed on it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Online Navigate to the Retrieve Radio/Navigation Codes page on Honda’s website and fill in the requested information to find your radio code. Enter your VIN (vehicle identification number), ZIP code, email address, phone number, and radio code serial number, then select “Radio Code” toward the bottom of the form (there are options to retrieve your radio code, navigation code, or both). Click “Submit” to access your code. To find your VIN , look for a sticker in the driver’s side door jamb. If there isn’t one, check the driver’s side dashboard (viewable from outside through the windshield), your vehicle title, or your insurance card. [2] X Research source Your radio serial number location depends on when your Honda was manufactured: 2001 or newer models: Turn on the radio, then press and hold 1 and 6 at the same time (on some models, press and hold 1 and 6, then turn on the radio). Your 8-10 digit alphanumeric serial code will appear on the screen. [3] X Research source Models older than 2001: Remove the radio and look for a sticker with the serial number on the side of the case. If you’re not comfortable removing the radio yourself, take your Honda to a dealership—a technician can access the serial number and also retrieve your radio code."

When the “CODE” message appears, enter your radio code with the preset buttons (the numbered buttons that let you bookmark your favorite radio channels for quick access). Once the code is entered, the radio will beep and your connection will be fully restored immediately. [5] X Research source If the code doesn’t work, turn the radio and car off and try again. Make sure to enter the code exactly as it appears on your manual sticker or the Honda code retrieval website. If it still doesn’t work, schedule an appointment at a Honda dealership and have a technician take a look. Most Honda radio codes are 5 digits, but some models may have a 6- or sometimes 4-digit code."
