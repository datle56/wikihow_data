    {
      "title": "Look underneath the headline of an article or blog post.",
      "content": "Look underneath the headline of an article or blog post. Most news sites and blogs will list the date underneath the article's title, along with the author's name. Check for the date right under the title or at the start of the article’s text. [1] X Research source There may be a 1-sentence secondary headline or an image between the title of the post and the date. Keep scrolling to see if the date is listed below the secondary headline or image. Some articles may have been updated after their publication date. When this is the case, you should see a disclaimer at the beginning or the end of the article that says when it was edited and why."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the bottom of the web page for a copyright date.",
      "content": "Check the bottom of the web page for a copyright date. Scroll to the bottom of the page and look at the information there. You may see copyright information or a publication note. Read this information to see if it provides an original date of publication. However, keep in mind that this date may be the last time the website was updated rather than the publication date. [2] X Research source The date a site was updated is the last time anything was added or changed on the page. That means the information you’re reading may have been published at an earlier date. However, a recent copyright or update means the site is active and updated, so the information may be trustworthy. Look at the section of the article that contains a short bio of the author. Sometimes, the date may be right above or below it."
    },
    {
      "title": "See if the date is part of the URL.",
      "content": "See if the date is part of the URL. Look in the address bar and scroll through the URL. Some blogs and websites autofill the web address with the date a post was written. You may find the full date, or you might just find the month and the year. [3] X Research source Make sure you are on the web page dedicated to the individual post, not an archive or index page. Click on the post’s headline to confirm you’re on the post-specific page. Many blogs edit the URL so it’s shorter and easier to search, so you may not find the date there."

    {
      "title": "Look at the timestamps on any comments to get an estimate.",
      "content": "Look at the timestamps on any comments to get an estimate. While this is not the most accurate method, it can give you a sense of when the article was first published. Look next to the username in the comments to find the time when the comment was written. Scroll until you find the earliest date. If the user interacted when the article was published, this will be the closest date to publication. You can’t use this date to cite a website. However, it can help you gauge when the website was published, so you’ll have an idea of how old the information is. If it seems recent, you might decide to go ahead and use the website but cite it as “no date.”"
