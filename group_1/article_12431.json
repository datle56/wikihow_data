For example, if you're trying to delete a picture or a text file, you will likely want to look in the default \"Documents\" folder, which typically holds those file types. If you don't know where your file is, type its name into the Start search bar, right-click the file when it pops up, and click Open file location to go directly to the file."

Common extensions include the following: .txt - Text files (files made in Notepad). .docx - Microsoft Word files. .jpg or .png - Picture files. .mov, .wmv, .mp4 - Video files. .mp3, .wav - Sound files. .exe - Executable files (e.g., a setup file). .lnk - Shortcut files.

Right-click the Start button in the bottom-left corner of the screen, then click Command Prompt in the pop-up window. Type \"Command Prompt\" into the Start menu search bar (for Windows 8, hover your mouse in the top-right corner of the screen and click the magnifying glass), then click the \"Command Prompt\" icon when it appears.

For files with spaces in their names, place quotation marks around the entire file name: \"I like turtles.jpg\" instead of I_like_turtles.jpg or similar.
