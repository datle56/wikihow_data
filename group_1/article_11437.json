      "content": "Stand so that your back is facing a wall-mounted mirror. To cut the back of your hair, you will need to make sure that your face is in the opposite direction to the largest mirror. A bathroom mirror works well for this purpose. If you don’t have a wall-mounted mirror, a mirror propped up on a dresser will also work."

      "content": "Ask someone to hold a mirror so you can see the back of your head. A handheld or small makeup mirror works best. It will take a little bit of experimenting to find the best angle that you can use to see the back of your head. Ask a friend or relative to help you and have them adjust the mirror until you can see the back of your head. A smaller makeup mirror that is attached to the wall, and can easily be adjusted to different angles would be a great alternative if you don’t have someone to help you. Hold your head at a downward angle—that will make it easier to get a straight line along your neck. [1] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 November 2020."

      "content": "Position the clippers with the blade side held upwards. The teeth of the blade need to be facing the back of your neck. The blade will be parallel to the floor. Swap the hand that you hold the clippers with throughout the process. For example, when you are trimming the right side of your neck, hold the clippers in your right hand, and swap as you move across your neck. You will also need to swap the mirror between hands as you change the hand that you hold the clippers in. If possible, have a friend or relative hold the mirror for you."

      "content": "Shave a horizontal guideline straight across the back of your neck. Look for your natural hairline and shave this line along your hairline. This will likely be where the outline from your previous haircut is. Watch in the mirror the whole time as you shave the back of your neck . Keep the line as clean and straight as possible. Stick as closely as possible to your natural hairline, as this will have the best results."

      "title": "Turn the clippers over.",
      "content": "Turn the clippers over. They will need to be facing in the opposite direction to how you held them previously. Make sure that the teeth are now in an upwards direction. This is so that you can cut your hair upwards towards the guideline you just made."

      "title": "Shave upwards from the bottom of your neck to the guideline.",
      "content": "Shave upwards from the bottom of your neck to the guideline. Make small vertical strokes that reach from the bottom of the hair on your neck, and end at the guideline you shaved. Continue shaving vertical sections up to the guideline until there is no hair below the guideline. Make sure that you only shave below the guideline that you created and not above. Tie up or clip back your hair if you don’t want to cut it. This will remove any untidy hair on your neck and give you a clean shave. Trim this area as slowly as steadily as you can to avoid shaving too high. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim the corners of your neck if you prefer a more rounded cut. Create a small rounded guideline on the edges of your hair on your neck. Then remove the small patches of hair that are beyond the guideline, as you did in the previous step. While you are in the process of rounding the corners, you can also check if there is any stray hair behind your ears."

These scissors will cut hair cleanly and neatly, and will help you to avoid getting split ends. [3] X Research source Never try to use paper, craft, or kitchen scissors to cut your hair."

      "content": "Flip your hair forward and comb through it. Make sure that your head is hanging down lower than your neck, so that all of your hair is off your neck and hanging forward towards the ground. Brush or comb it all forward and make sure that there are no tangles . Your hair can be either wet or dry to do this. If you hair is wet, remember that wet hair will shrink slightly as it dries and bounces up. It’s also easier to see any existing layers if your hair is upside down."

Don’t try to trim off more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) at once. [5] X Research source If you accidentally cut off more hair than desired, you will end up having to cut the rest of your hair to that length. However, if you cut off too little hair, you can always cut more."

Find the angle that you can check the back of your hair with. If the back of your hair looks a little uneven in the mirror, you can always flip your hair back over and adjust it."
