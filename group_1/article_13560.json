You can put your upper arm in front of you with your palm flat on the floor for support. [2] X Research source If you feel unstable laying this way, bracing the soles of your feet against a wall will help you feel more secure. Another way to increase your stability is to bend your lower knee at a 90-degree angle. Your top leg should still be extended straight out.

Keep your body in a straight line and activate your glutes to help you lift your leg. [4] X Research source Don't focus on how high you can lift your leg. To work your glutes, you need to keep your hips as straight as possible. If you're rolling forward to lift your leg higher, you're not getting the full benefit."

Control the movement, resisting the weight of your leg, rather than simply letting it fall. [5] X Research source Stopping your foot before you reach your other foot and leaving it hovering in the lower position keeps your glutes activated between reps."

Make sure you don't start tilting forward or get sloppy with your form. Then roll over to do the same number of reps on the other side. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The number of sets you do depends on your overall level of fitness. If you're just starting out, you might only be able to do 1 set. Add another set every couple of weeks to continue to challenge yourself as you get stronger."

Lift your leg out to the side in a slow, controlled movement until you feel the oblique muscle on the side of your torso contract. You'll also feel a nice stretch down the back of your thigh. [8] X Research source It's important to keep your torso straight and maintain good posture. If you find it difficult to balance, use a table or the back of a sturdy chair for stability.

If you want to make the exercise a little more difficult, stop when your toes are hovering just above the floor rather than going all the way down to touch the floor."

Square up your feet under your hips, point your left toes, and repeat the exercise with your left leg. [11] X Research source If you're doing interval training, you can also add side leg raises to your routine, doing as many as you can in 45-60 seconds. [12] X Research source Instead of doing all the reps and then switching sides, you can also alternate between sides. Just make sure you're maintaining good form. [13] X Research source"
