      "content": "Try a low fade on hair that has more texture. For hair that’s thick or wavy, buzz the hair with the shortest clipper guard settings at a lower area. The best place to do this is below the ears and around the nape of the neck. Low fades show off a hair's texture better and work with the hair's natural pattern. [1] X Research source The longer the hair is on top, the lower the fade will start down the person’s neck. A fade is different from a taper cut. A taper cut leaves the hair a bit longer, while a fade usually shaves down to the person’s natural hairline. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a high fade for more contrast.",
      "content": "Choose a high fade for more contrast. This is a style that trims away most of the hair on the back and sides of the head. They can either leave it as a short buzz cut or have it shaved down to the skin. With the lowest clipper guard settings, start at the nape of their neck and work up to their temples. A high fade will give them a much cleaner and sleeker look. [3] X Research source High fades work well with square or round face shapes because they lengthen the appearance of the face. For the highest contrast, try a “skin fade,” which shaves the hair all the way down to the scalp. A mid fade is a bit more noticeable as a low fade, but doesn’t expose the scalp as much as a high fade. The fade starts at a point above the ears and offers a lot more styling options."

      "content": "Get a pair of styling scissors and clippers that have at least 3 guard lengths. Choose a pair of clippers with at least 3 different guard lengths so you can blend the hair as you go. Use the clippers on the back and sides of their head as well as their nape. Then go in with your styling scissors for the hair on top. [4] X Research source If they’re looking for a softer fade, you can also use styling scissors on the back and sides to create what’s called the “scissor fade.” However, this is an advanced technique, so don’t attempt it unless you are very experienced with fades. Do not use household scissors to trim hair, as it can result in a blunt or uneven cut. Use clippers near the top of their head if they want their hair shorter than 1 in (2.5 cm)."

      "title": "Wash and dry the hair before cutting it.",
      "content": "Wash and dry the hair before cutting it. Damp, clean hair is easier to work with while cutting fades. Wash the person's hair with shampoo, rinse it with water, and dry it with a towel or let it air-dry until it’s just damp rather than soaking wet. The hair shouldn’t be so wet that it clumps together. If that’s the case, you may end up cutting out chunks of their hair by accident."

      "title": "Trim the top",
      "content": "Trim the top with styling scissors. Lift sections of hair straight up from the top of the head so that the tips of the hair protrude from between your forefinger and middle finger. Trim the tips of the hair with the scissors until you reach the desired length. Continue trimming the hair at the top of the head in sections until you've trimmed it all to the same length. If the person has bangs, trim the bangs in sections for a neat and even line."

      "content": "Trim the entire sides and back with a long guard size. Set the clippers to a long guard length and buzz the entire back and sides . The size of the guard length will depend on how long you want the top of the fade to be. Work against the grain of the hair to achieve an even cut. Continue trimming until each section of hair is a uniform length. [5] X Expert Source Arthur Sebastian Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 29 April 2019. Use a vertical movement to cut the hair, starting at the hairline and then sweeping up toward the top of the head. Lift the clippers up and outwards slightly at the end of each stroke as you get closer to the rounded part of the person’s head. This helps the cuts fade together smoothly. Leave more of the hair outline visible around the temples to achieve the popular “temple fade’ style."

If you find any uneven spots, use the appropriate clipper guard length to blend them out . Then, turn the blade around and use it to go around the edges of the hairline. This will help to create a clean outline. Use a razor along their hairline to get an even sharper line. [9] X Research source"

Although fades grow out evenly, their style can change significantly as they grow out and so might require routine trims.
