      "content": "Ask them calmly in a private conversation. If you must ask someone's pronoun, wait until you are talking only to them. It can endanger people if their pronoun is questioned in public, and others might simply find the attention unwelcome. Ask calmly. If you ask with a lot of nerves, they may feel too awkward to answer. Take a deep breath before you ask. You might begin by saying, \"Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?\" or \"There's something I realized I never asked you.\""

Even if people usually guess your gender identity correctly, it's still polite to share your pronouns when you're asking someone else to share theirs. [1] X Research source You might say, \"I use he/him pronouns. May I ask what you use?\" If you have known one another for a while, you might feel awkward asking. Simply apologize for not having asked earlier. You may say, \"I realize I never asked for your pronouns. I use she/her. What do you use?\" If you suspect a friend's pronoun may have changed, ask them. \"Melissa, may I ask if I am using the wrong pronoun for you? I heard Arthur refer to you as \"they,\" and I realize I've always called you \"she.\"\""

Many people are nonbinary or genderqueer, meaning they don't identify as a man or woman. Instead, ask what words you should use to refer to them. [2] X Research source Instead of asking \"What is your gender,\" ask, \"What pronouns do you use?\""

      "content": "Ask a mutual acquaintance. It's usually considered acceptable to ask a mutual acquaintance, especially if you know them better than you know the person in question. For instance, if someone introduced you to the person, you can ask them what the person's gender identity is. You might say, \"I want to check so that I don't misgender Jamie. Can you tell me what pronouns Jamie uses?\""

People who know them well will probably use the correct pronoun. [3] X Research source If you hear people using different pronouns, you can ask one of them which is correct in a private moment. Some people do use multiple pronouns, such as \"she\" and \"they,\" so their friends will not be surprised if you haven't figured it out."

      "title": "Notice any cues in how they present themselves.",
      "content": "Notice any cues in how they present themselves. Name, hairstyle, clothing, and body language are all ways people express gender. For instance, if someone has a masculine name, wears masculine clothing, and moves in a masculine manner, they are more likely to use masculine pronouns. This is especially important if you suspect someone may be transgender. If their clothing strongly suggests one gender, and their features do not necessarily correspond, you should trust the clothing over their physical features. Observation is not a failsafe method: gender expression and gender identity aren't always the same! Some people present in an ambiguous manner, and others may express masculinity or femininity without identifying as the corresponding gender. [4] X Research source"

In the meantime, avoid using gendered language until you do know their gender. You can refer to people by their name instead of saying \"he\" or \"she.\" Few people are offended by the gender-neutral pronoun \"they\" if used in situations where you are not certain."

Find a private moment as soon as you can and say that you're sorry. [6] X Research source You can say, \"I'm sorry I was calling you the wrong pronoun. I should have asked.\" If you had a slip-up, say, \"I want to apologize for using the wrong pronoun back there. There's no excuse. I'll be more mindful in the future.\" If you use the wrong pronoun in front of a group, correct yourself immediately and apologize briefly. Say, \"I mean she, sorry about that.\""
