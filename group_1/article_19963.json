Signing up for the waitlist, unfortunately, does not guarantee you a ticket—if you're planning a trip to NYC, you'll want to keep that in mind. However, if the show is able to fill your ticket request, you'll be notified through the ticket provider (1iota). You'll need to be 16 or older to join the waitlist and to attend a taping, even if a parent or guardian is present. [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source Follow the instructions provided in the email to claim your e-tickets. [6] X Research source You'll need to provide the full names of everyone in your party once you receive the email from The Tonight Show. When you check in, all people in your party must be present, and they'll all need valid ID. Tickets are non-transferrable—the names you enter must match the names of the people you bring to the taping of the show."

[7] X Research source Check your ticket for the exact time to be there, but plan to show up early to ensure you don't miss your spot. On the day of taping, you and your party should go to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and use the West 50th Street entrance to check in. Everyone will need to provide valid ID to secure their tickets.

Leave your personal items at home or in your hotel room before you attend the taping.

      "content": "Go to The Shop at NBC Studios between 10 AM and 3PM on the day of show taping. Even if you didn’t get off of the waitlist, you may be able to get in on the day of taping with standby tickets if there is last-minute availability. To qualify for a standby ticket, you'll first need to get in line for a standby card, which you can later redeem for a standby ticket if any ticket holders cancel before check-in. The Shop at NBC Studios is located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, just like the Tonight Show, except you'll need to go to the 6th Ave (Avenue of the Americas) entrance between 49th and 50th St. [10] X Research source Standby cards are distributed on a first come, first served basis. While staff won't start giving out cards until 10 AM, many people line up much earlier than that—sometimes even as early as 1 AM. Begin standing in line by 5:00 am at the latest for the best chance of getting your card. Standby cards are limited to 1 card per person—if you have a larger group, make sure everyone who wants to attend the taping is present, as each person can only collect one standby card."

You will be called by the card number that's printed on your standby card. If your number is announced, claim your ticket for the taping. If it is not, you can always try again on another day. Like the waitlists, having a standby card does not guarantee you a ticket. If there aren't enough cancellations, your standby card may not grant you a ticket when you return for the show. When you return for your standby ticket, make sure you're ready for the show! Leave shopping bags, backpacks, and other large items at home or in your hotel room, as you won't be able to bring them into the studio or store them anywhere on site. The dress code for The Tonight Show is smart casual, so dress appropriately. No costumes are allowed."
