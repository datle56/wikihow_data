      "content": "Rainbow flag 🏳️‍🌈 The rainbow flag became a symbol of LGBTQ+ pride in 1978 when Gilbert Baker, an openly gay artist and drag queen, designed it for San Francisco's annual pride parade. Baker was asked to create the flag by Harvey Milk, one of the first openly gay elected officials in the U.S., to represent the LGBTQ+ community. Baker chose the rainbow because he wanted to create a symbol that represented diversity and made a proud statement, and he believed the rainbow was ideal because it's found in nature.
