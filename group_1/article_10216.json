At the end of the day, you are in control of your life and what comes next—there is no pressure, deadline, or obligation to follow through with any of your thoughts.

Whenever you’re tempted to give into these thoughts, though, try thinking instead about all the people in your life who love you and would miss you if you weren’t around.

A trusted friend or loved one can help walk you through exactly how you’re feeling and give you valuable advice and pointers on how to move forward. [4] X Research source If you aren’t sure who to reach out to, trained counselors are always available if you call your country’s suicide hotline (988 in the US). Free online sources like 7Cups , My Black Dog , and Togetherall are also great places to chat with understanding peers. Never feel embarrassed or “weak” about asking for help . According to psychologist Catherine Boswell, Ph.D, it’s important to realize that “asking for help is a sign of strength and not weakness.” Boswell also suggests viewing your situation in reverse. If someone came and asked you for help, would you judge them? It’s important to extend the same kindness and patience to yourself that you would to others. Sharing your thoughts can be a helpful way to give yourself a reality check, agrees clinical psychologist Urmi Patel, PsyD. By talking it out, you can realize that these thoughts are false, and that ending your life isn’t the right way to resolve whatever issue you’re facing."
