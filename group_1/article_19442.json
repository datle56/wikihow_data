      "content": "Apply an antifungal topical treatment twice a day for two weeks. There are a ton of foot fungus treatment options, and basically all of them will help clear up your fungus. Talk to a pharmacist or just pick up any OTC antifungal cream, powder, spray, or lotion. Read the label carefully to apply it to your foot. Typically, you just apply the cream, powder, spray, or lotion twice a day until the fungus goes away. According to board-certified podiatrist Miguel Cunha, \"A doctor may also prescribe an oral antifungal for more severe cases.\" So long as the ingredients in your product include clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, naftifine, oxiconazole, sulconazole, terbinafine, or terconazole, it’s going to help combat the fungus.

[3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you don’t treat your shoes at the same time you’re treating your foot, the fungus may come back. Board-certified podiatrist Miguel Cunha suggests \"spraying something like Lysol along the inside and outside of your shoes, which helps kill the bacteria or fungus.\" Cunha stresses that \"both bacteria and fungus can lead to odor, athlete's foot, or fungal nails later on.\" You can do this multiple times if you want to be totally sure that you’ve gotten rid of all of the spores."

      "title": "Keep your feet as dry as possible until the fungus is gone.",
      "content": "Keep your feet as dry as possible until the fungus is gone. Fungus likes dark, moist environments, so keeping your feet dry and aired out will help speed the healing process up. Don’t wear shoes unless you absolutely have to, and if you do need to wear shoes, pick a breathable pair. Change your socks out whenever they start to get damp, and never put the same socks on after you’ve taken them off. [4] X Research source Alternating the shoes you’re wearing every day may also help. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Dry your feet thoroughly after you get out of the shower every day. Don’t let them air dry on their own. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Do not go barefoot in public. This is the most common way a foot fungus spreads."

If the rash covers most of your foot, your skin is flaking off, or the infection has spread to your nail, it’s best to see a doctor. These kinds of fungal infections typically require stronger oral medication. [7] X Research source In most cases, your doctor will tell you to take the drug for 6-12 weeks until the fungus clears up. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your nail is in a really rough shape, your doctor may prescribe you a medicated nail polish or cream. Your doctor may also suggest a minor surgical procedure to apply the antifungal drug directly underneath your nail, or remove it entirely. These drugs are extremely effective, but they can cause damage to your liver for some people. Your doctor may suggest you get regular blood tests while you’re taking the antifungal medication just to keep an eye on things.

If it doesn’t, see your primary care physician. They’ll be able to prescribe you something stronger to clear up the irritated skin. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are a lot of different fungi out there, and some of them are a little more resilient than others.

      "content": "It’s typically caused by walking barefoot in a public space. If you shower at the gym, change your shoes at work, or you work outside with your shoes off, you may accidentally pick a fungus up on the ground. You can also get a foot fungus if you accidentally touch someone else’s skin and they’ve got a fungal infection. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Sharing towels with another person can make your feet more susceptible to foot fungus. Locker rooms, communal showers, and gyms are especially likely to harbor foot fungus. If possible, wear flip flops while you’re showering or changing at the gym."

The people who do experience side effects typically get a bit of itchiness, burning, or redness, but even then the side effects are harmless and go away on their own. Since these topical treatments are so low-risk, there’s no real reason to try experimenting with DIY home remedies. [16] X Research source"
