      "content": "Trace your foot. With a pen or pencil, trace the outline of your foot. Keep the pen or pencil as close to your foot as possible. This will help ensure an accurate measurement. [2] X Research source You'll get the most accurate measurement if you have someone else trace your foot while you remain seated upright, but it's okay to do it yourself. Alternatively, you can use a soft tape measure to measure the length and width of your foot directly."

      "content": "Measure the width between the widest points of each foot. To figure out the correct width for your shoes, you’ll need to determine your foot width. Identify the areas on your feet with the largest width. Take a tape measure or ruler to measure both widths.

The pencil will have created a small amount of space, making your measurements slightly larger than your actual feet. To determine your most accurate foot width, subtract 1 ⁄ 5 inch (0.51 cm) from each measurement. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify your shoe size. With a simple internet search, you can find a general size chart for shoe size. Match the length of your foot with the corresponding shoe size. But also take note that there are different size charts based on gender. For example, a foot around 8.5 inches (22 cm) would be a women’s size 5 based on U.S. sizes. In European countries, the measurement of 8.5 inches (22 cm) would be a 35 or 36."

After identifying your shoe size, look back to the width measurements of your bigger foot. Figure out what the width would be for your shoe size based on that measurement. [6] X Research source For example, a woman with size 5 shoes with a shoe width around 4 inches (10 cm) would require an extra wide shoe. In stores, extra wide shoes are normally labeled as \"E.\""

      "content": "Use specific sizing charts when possible. Every sizing chart is different, and some companies’ shoes may run slightly smaller or larger than average. When buying shoes, see if the manufacturer has a specific sizing chart before assuming your shoe size based on a general chart. This will help increase the likelihood shoes will fit properly, especially if you're making purchases online."

For example, running or gym shoes are typically worn with socks, so put on your normal workout socks when measuring your feet.

It's always better to try shoes on prior to purchase, to increase your chances of finding the perfect fit.
