This means that you cannot prevent or cause it. 0.1% to 0.3% of pregnancies are molar. [3] X Research source In a complete molar pregnancy, the genetic material from the mother’s egg is lost or inactive and the genetic material from the sperm is duplicated. In a partial molar pregnancy, the father provides twice as much genetic material as normal, even though the genetic material from the mother is still there. This can happen if two sperm fertilize one egg."

If your HCG levels do not drop back to normal after treatment, it suggests that all the cystic tissue may not have been removed.
