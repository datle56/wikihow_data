If you live in a place that gets cooler weather during fall, consider wearing some short-sleeved or long-sleeved shirts; these can be worn under cardigans, or over lacy tank tops.

Wear a plaid, button-up shirt over a white tank top or short-sleeved shirt. For a classic fall look, pair this with some jeans and work boots. Consider layering jumpers or knitted dresses over a long-sleeved shirt and some tights or leggings."

      "content": "Choose the right patterns. There are certain patterns that are more associated with fall than others. Fabrics with bright, cheerful tropical flowers (such as hibiscus) will remind people more of summer or spring, and may look out of place on a cool, rainy, fall day. Plaid and houndstooth are perfect for fall, however; they are more somber and reserved, which blends well with the cool weather. Consider wearing dark florals instead. An example of dark florals is anything with a black, navy, plum, or burgundy background. Flowers that work well with fall include roses, thistle, and pansies."

Consider pairing solids with patterns, lights with darks, and mixing textures. Here are some ideas to get you started: Try pairing leather and lace.
