      "content": "Help them down. If you notice a person starting to faint, try to catch them and slowly lower the person to the ground. When people faint, they are unable to protect themselves with their hands when they fall. Although typically a person who faints does not incur serious injuries, preventing hitting the ground will protect them. Of course, do this only if it is safe for you--if the person who is fainting is much larger than you, for example, this may put you into a hazardous situation. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Position the person on their back. Tap or shake the person, to see if they have regained consciousness. In most cases, people who have fainted regain consciousness quickly (usually between 2 minutes and 20 seconds). [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source When people faint, they fall, which brings the head to the same level of the heart. In this position, it is easier for the heart to pump blood to the brain. Therefore, recovery can be just as sudden as fainting is. If the person regains consciousness, inquire about any pre-existing symptoms or conditions that may have caused the fainting. Symptoms such as headache, seizure, numbness or tingling, chest pain or trouble breathing are all worrisome. In such cases, emergency services (EMS) should be called. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Help the person rest if they regain consciousness.",
      "content": "Help the person rest if they regain consciousness. Loosen any constrictive clothing (like a tie or collar) on the person to make them comfortable. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Let the person lay on the ground and rest for at least 15-20 minutes. This provides enough time for blood to return to the brain. Give the person room to breathe and fan the victim with fresh air. If fainting happens in a public place, crowds typically gather in order to see what happened. Ask people to back up unless they are actually helping the situation. Give the person water and/or food once they are conscious and stable; food and water will help revive them. Dehydration and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) are common causes of fainting. Do not let the person get up too quickly. Encourage them to stay lying down for a few minutes. This will allow blood flow to the brain to fully regain. Additionally, abrupt rise may precipitate another fainting episode. Once people have regained consciousness, they may try to brush it off by standing and trying to walk too soon after the incident. If the person has a head injury, additional symptoms (such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe headache, etc.) or a preexisting condition (pregnancy, heart disease, etc.), they should consult a doctor."

      "content": "Check for a pulse if the person does not regain consciousness quickly. Call or ask someone else to call EMS. This is also an opportunity to have someone look for an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED). Assess the pulse at the person's neck because that is where it will be the strongest. Place your index and third fingers on the neck of the person to the side of the windpipe and feel for the pulse. [7] X Research source Assess the pulse only on one side of the neck at a time. Checking both sides can compromise the blood supply to the brain. If there is a pulse, try to raise the person’s legs a couple of feet above the ground. This helps blood flow back to the brain."

Place the heel of one hand at the center of the person’s chest. Place the other hand on top of the first. Be sure not to bend your elbows. Use your whole upper body weight and compress on the person’s chest. The chest must be compressed as you push straight down by at least 2 inches. Push down on the chest at about 100 compressions each minute. Continue chest compressions until EMS arrives and takes over."

In some cases, it is possible to prevent a potential fainting spell by taking the proper precautions and avoiding possible triggers. Some preventative steps include: [14] X Research source Staying hydrated and eating regularly: It is essential to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and other fluids, especially on hot days. Eating regular, healthy meals can help ameliorate feelings of dizziness and weakness associated with hunger. Avoiding stressful situations: For some people, fainting is brought on by stressful, upsetting or anxiety-producing situations. Thus, it is important to stay calm by avoiding these kinds of situations as much as possible. Avoiding drugs, alcohol and cigarettes: These items are full of toxins that are generally unhealthy and can induce fainting in some people. Avoiding changing position quickly: Fainting is sometimes caused by sudden movement, such as standing up too quickly after sitting or lying down. Try to stand up slowly, and hold onto something stable for balance, if possible."
