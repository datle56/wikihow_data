      "title": "Set up the peg and wickets for your croquet court.",
      "content": "Set up the peg and wickets for your croquet court. Standard croquet courts are 28 by 35 yards (26 m × 32 m), but you can adjust the size to fit the area you have. Get a croquet set that has all the materials you need, including the mallets, balls, wooden pegs, and wickets (hoops). Place the wooden croquet peg in the center of the court. Position 2 wickets so they’re 7 yards (6.4 m) north and south of the peg. Then, place the remaining 4 hoops near each corner of the field so they’re 7 yards (6.4 m) away from the boundary edges. [1] X Research source When you’re setting up croquet , consider using flags or cones to mark the corners of the court so you can tell which areas are in bounds."

    {
      "title": "Play with 2 people or split into teams of 2.",
      "content": "Play with 2 people or split into teams of 2. Croquet works best as a 2- or 4-player game. One person or team uses the blue and black balls, and the other person or team uses the red and yellow balls. Some croquet sets come with enough mallets and balls for 6 or 8 players so you can play a larger game."

    {
      "title": "Flip a coin to see who goes first.",
      "content": "Flip a coin to see who goes first. Whichever person or team goes first takes the black and blue balls, while the other person or team takes the red and yellow balls. The player with the black ball starts the game. [2] X Research source The order of the players goes black, red, blue, and then yellow, which are also painted in order on the central peg to remind you. Alternatively, place each of your balls near one of the central wickets and take turns hitting your ball toward the peg. Whoever gets closest to the peg gets to go first."

    {
      "title": "Place the balls within 1 yard (0.91 m) of the starting corner.",
      "content": "Place the balls within 1 yard (0.91 m) of the starting corner. The starting corner is where the south and east boundary meet, and is usually called corner 4 (IV). Place your croquet balls anywhere within 1 yard (0.91 m) of the corner to make a legal first shot. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hit the ball with your mallet toward the first wicket.",
      "content": "Hit the ball with your mallet toward the first wicket. The first wicket is the one closest to the south and west boundaries. The person with the blue ball becomes the first “striker.” Line up your croquet mallet next to your ball and take a single shot toward the wicket. [4] X Research source You’re only allowed 1 shot on your turn and there are no bonus shots. Avoid touching any other croquet balls with your mallet when you’re the striker because it’s considered a “fault.” If you commit a fault, then you have to pick up your ball and take the shot again. For the first 4 turns, the players hit the balls from the starting corner. After that, each person plays from where their ball is positioned. If you ever hit a ball out of bounds, then place it at the spot where it went out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Score 1 point for hitting your ball through the wicket.",
      "content": "Score 1 point for hitting your ball through the wicket. Wickets can only be scored if the ball is hit through the current playing side. For the first wicket, the ball has to roll through it toward the north boundary. Once a player hits a ball and it completely rolls through the wicket, they score a point for their team. [5] X Research source Only 1 player or team can score on each wicket. A ball does not score points if any part of it is still inside of the wicket. If a player knocks another person’s ball through the wicket, then the ball’s owner scores a point. If multiple balls go through the wicket at the same time, whoever had the ball closest before the stroke scores the point."

    {
      "title": "Check for offside balls and move them to a penalty zone.",
      "content": "Check for offside balls and move them to a penalty zone. After scoring a point, check if there are any balls that are further than halfway between the current wicket and the next wicket position. These balls are considered “offsides” and the other player can place them along the east or west boundary so they’re in line with the center peg. [6] X Research source A ball is not considered offsides if it rolled there from the stroke that was just played or if it was hit there by another ball."

    {
      "title": "Aim for the next wicket after a ball runs through the previous one.",
      "content": "Aim for the next wicket after a ball runs through the previous one. After the first wicket, then aim for the second wicket on the opposite side of the court. After each time a ball rolls through the wicket, move on to the next one. [7] X Research source The third and fourth wickets are on the east side of the court and the balls must roll through them going from north to south. The fifth and sixth wickets are in the center of the court and balls must roll through them from south to north. The wickets on the west side of the court become the seventh and eighth going from north to south. The wickets on the east side are ninth and tenth going south to north. The center wickets are eleventh and twelfth going from north to south. It’s possible to go through multiple wickets with a single shot if you’re able to line it up properly."

      "title": "Win the game after reaching 7 points.",
      "content": "Win the game after reaching 7 points. Continue playing the game and taking turns hitting balls through the wickets. As soon as a player or team scores their seventh point, they win! [8] X Research source If both players or teams are tied at 6 points, then break the tie by being the first to hit a ball through the top east wicket going from north to south."

      "title": "Association croquet",
      "content": "Association croquet This variation is also known as “British croquet,” and it’s just a little more complex than golf croquet. When you hit your ball through a wicket, you may take another shot toward the next wicket. If your ball hits another ball, then you earn 2 extra shots. [9] X Research source Players take their extra shots immediately, so someone may make multiple shots in a row before another player takes their turn."

      "title": "American 6-Wicket",
      "content": "American 6-Wicket In the American version of croquet that uses 6 wickets, you start your ball a mallet’s length away from the first hoop. While you can earn extra shots from hitting balls and running through the wickets, you can only do it after you pass through the first one. After you hit a ball to earn an extra shot, it’s considered “dead” until your ball rolls through the next wicket. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "American 9-Wicket",
      "content": "American 9-Wicket In a 9-wicket setup, there are pegs on each end of the court with 2 wickets in front of them. The other wickets are arranged in an X-shape near the middle of the court. In this version, players try to hit their ball through the wickets in order until they reach the turning peg. Then, they work their way back through the remaining wickets and try to be the first person or team to hit both balls against the starting peg. [11] X Research source Once a ball hits the starting peg, pick it up and remove it from the game so it’s not in the way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Poison",
      "content": "Poison Poison croquet adds an extra layer of fun to a 9-wicket game. If you hit a ball through the final wicket without striking the peg, your ball is considered “poison.” When it’s your turn, you may hit your ball into another player’s to eliminate the ball from the game. Whoever has the last ball on the court wins the game! [12] X Research source If you hit a poison ball with your ball, you earn an extra shot. If you can knock the poison ball through a wicket, then it’s removed through the game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stinger",
      "content": "Stinger Similar to Poison, your ball becomes a stinger if you make it through all the wickets without hitting the last peg. However, you must hit your ball through wickets 1, 2, and 4 before you’re able to eliminate other balls from the game. Whoever has the last ball on the court, wins! [13] X Research source You can get rid of a stinger ball by knocking it into the final peg."

      "title": "Standard grip",
      "content": "Standard grip Standard grip is the most common way to hold a croquet mallet, and it’s the best if you’re a beginner. Position your dominant hand near the bottom of the handle and place your non-dominant hand right above it. Wrap your fingers securely around the handle and keep your wrists loose while you’re swinging. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Solomon grip",
      "content": "Solomon grip Hold the end of the handle with your dominant hand so your knuckles are facing away from you. Place your other hand on the handle just below it so your thumb is facing up. [15] X Research source The Solomon grip works great when you want to get a lot more power out of your swing or if you’re at an angle to your target."

    {
      "title": "Irish grip",
      "content": "Irish grip Place your hands near the idle of the handle so both of your thumbs are facing down on the front of the mallet. Wrap your fingers around the back of the handle. [16] X Research source The Irish grip gives you a little more finesse so you can make tricky shots that don’t require a lot of power."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roquet",
      "content": "Roquet A roquet is when you purposefully hit your ball so it hits another ball so you earn an extra shot. Aim the mallet head in the direction that you want to hit the ball, and try to hit the ball when the head is parallel to the ground so the ball rolls straight. [17] X Research source Practice your aim in your spare time by setting a ball a short distance away and aiming for it. If you’re able to consistently hit the other ball, then try increasing the distance. After you roquet in Association croquet, you may pick up your ball and place it anywhere so it touches the ball that it just hit."

    {
      "title": "Cut rush",
      "content": "Cut rush When you roquet a ball from a short distance, try to aim a little off-center so the other ball goes in a different direction. If you want the ball to move right, then aim a little more to the left. To make it go left, then try to hit it on the right side. [18] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Takeoff",
      "content": "Takeoff After you roquet and are able to place your ball, set it so you have a clear path to the next wicket or ball you’re aiming for. Make sure you only hit your ball with your next shot so it travels in a straight line without any interference. [19] X Research source This works great if you have a clear line to your next target so you don’t accidentally move your opponent’s ball closer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drive",
      "content": "Drive When your ball is touching another ball, try to keep the mallet head parallel to the ground during your stroke. When you follow through, your opponent’s ball will travel a lot further than your ball, which can help you stay in line with the next wicket you’re aiming for. [20] X Research source Driving is a great choice if you want to knock your opponent’s ball really far away so you’re at an advantage. Try standing closer to the ball if you want to make your ball travel even shorter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop shot",
      "content": "Stop shot Angle your mallet head so the face is slightly angled up. When you swing and hit your ball into another, the other ball will roll far away in the direction you’re aiming, but your ball will stay in place. [21] X Research source Lift your mallet head a little so you don’t accidentally hit the ground during your stroke."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll shot",
      "content": "Roll shot Angle the back of the mallet head so it’s off the ground. Hit your ball into the other ball and follow through so your ball rolls about the same distance as the other. [22] X Research source This shot can help you approach a wicket if another ball is in your way, and sometimes your ball may even roll further."
    },
    {
      "title": "Split shot",
      "content": "Split shot Split shots make the ball you’re striking and your opponent’s ball travel in different directions. Line your ball up on the opposite side of the direction you want the other ball to go. Then, aim your mallet in the direction you want your ball to roll. Use a smooth and steady shot to hit the balls so they travel in different directions. [23] X Research source Use split shots to help your ball roll closer to a wicket or peg and send your opponent’s ball further away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Jump shot",
      "content": "Jump shot Hold the mallet head so it’s at a 45-degree angle to your ball. Use a sharp, swift motion to hit the ball and avoid following through with your mallet. The ball should bounce off the ground and go into the air. [24] X Research source Jump shots work great if there’s another ball that’s in front of a wicket so you don’t accidentally hit it in."
