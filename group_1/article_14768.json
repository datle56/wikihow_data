      "content": "Wear fitted jeans and a playful top for daytime parties. You want to be comfortable and wear a style that's true to you, but you also want to show that it's a special occasion. So take your everyday wear and add a special touch to bring it up a notch. For example, spruce up your casual jeans with a sequined tank top and a fluorescent clutch.

      "content": "Wear a maxi or midi dress with sandals for outdoor daytime parties. If the party is going to be mostly outdoors, flowy dresses with playful patterns are perfect for daytime fun. If the print is bold, accessorize with minimalist pieces. For solid-color dresses, feel free to wear a few minimal pieces of jewelry or a single statement piece. A chunky necklace is a great way to show off your décolletage. Pair a single-colored maxi or midi dress with colorful shoes or a patterned jacket. Transition the outfit to nighttime by belting the waist, putting on heels, and donning a long, fitted cardigan for cool nights."

      "content": "Add drama at night with dark wash jeans and an off-the-shoulder top. Nighttime parties call for more drama, mystery, and allure. [5] X Research source Show off your shoulders with a fun off-the-shoulder top, and top it off with a small statement clutch and some booties. Choose appropriate clothing that isn't too flashy or sexy. Remember, the party isn't about you and how good you look, it's about the person whose birthday it is!"

      "content": "Wear a blazer over a button-down with tailored shorts or jeans. A nice, fitted blazer will make any pair of shorts or jeans look sophisticated, especially if you do a “French tuck.” [6] X Research source Finish the look with a pair of nice loafers, sneakers, or flats. For women, transition the look to nighttime with a pair of low to mid heels or wedges. For men, turn it into a nighttime look by changing into a pair of slacks, chinos, or dark wash denim.

      "content": "Pair a cardigan with a graphic tee and fitted jeans for day or night. Layering a cardigan or blazer over a comfy tee looks more polished than the t-shirt alone. Just make sure the t-shirt isn't too loose or long to avoid looking unkempt. Leave the shirt untucked for an ultra-casual look and tuck it in slightly to show off a nice belt buckle.

      "title": "Wear a maxi or midi dress to pool parties.",
      "content": "Wear a maxi or midi dress to pool parties. If you're going to a pool party, you might want to wear something you can get in and out of easily (like a maxi dress or thin shirt and shorts that you don't care about getting damp). Wear comfortable sandals or flip flops to match the laid-back poolside vibes. If the party is both indoors and outdoors, dress for the weather and bring layers."

      "title": "Wear a comfy shirt with shorts or simple jeans to children's parties.",
      "content": "Wear a comfy shirt with shorts or simple jeans to children's parties. Most children's parties are ultra-casual, so your everyday wear will work just fine here. There's probably going to be lots of activities going on, so you'll want to be comfortable and able to move around quickly (especially with younger children in attendance). Avoid wearing white jeans or a white shirt so you they won't get stained from spills or grass. Wear cargo pants or shorts for pocket space if you might need to hide small objects that aren't safe for younger children and toddlers. If you're a parent, bring a large bag for snacks, water, sunscreen, and anything else you or your child might need."

      "content": "Wear a colorful wrap or cocktail dress for daytime festivities. Semi-formal parties during the day call for smart attire in playful colors and patterns. [9] X Research source Pair a knee-length (or just above the knee) dress with cork wedge heels or low heels for comfort and style. Wedges are a good choice if you know that you'll be walking on grass. If the venue is a hotel, you'll be wanting to dress up more with an outfit like this. [10] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist & Speaker Expert Interview. 29 July 2020."

      "content": "Pair a flashy skirt with a simple fitted blouse and low heels. A flashy sequin skirt goes perfectly with a simple (tucked in) top will make a statement without looking overdone. Top it with a cropped denim or leather jacket for cooler weather. The louder the outfit, the simpler your accessories should be. Let the sequins be the focal point and accessorize with a simple gold or silver necklace or bracelet. Turn it into a nighttime look by wearing strappy heels and adding a small clutch."

      "title": "Wear a cocktail dress or tailored suit for fancy nighttime parties.",
      "content": "Wear a cocktail dress or tailored suit for fancy nighttime parties. If the birthday party is at night and taking place in a fancy restaurant or upscale lounge, that's the time to break out those cocktail dresses, tailored suits, and dress shoes! Aim to look sharp and sophisticated with a spoonful of glamour and drama. Opt for a dress that sits right at the knee. [11] X Research source If you go shorter, make sure that it has a medium or high neckline so you're not revealing too much skin. Go bold and dramatic with darker colors and structured, romantic shapes (like an off-the-shoulder neckline). A tailored suit is always a great choice for men (lighter colors for daytime and darker for nighttime) with a nice pair of loafers or dress shoes. A tie is optional so long as you wear a collared button-down. Steer clear of any loud patterns unless it's just a pop here and there (like on a pocket square)."

      "title": "Accessorize to complement your outfit.",
      "content": "Accessorize to complement your outfit. Accessories can complement your style and highlight your best features. But too many accessories can look cluttered and distracting, so be tasteful and remember: less is more! A simple bangle or bracelet will call attention to your wrists, while an understated gold or silver necklace can highlight your décolletage. For men, a puffed pocket square and a nice watch can make any simple suit look posh. If you're wearing a solid color, accessorize with a single statement piece (like a necklace, bracelet, or earrings). With bold patterns, keep accessories small and to a minimum. Keep your silver jewelry looking polished by soaking it in baking soda and hot water in a bowl lined with aluminum foil. [12] X Research source Men should choose a pocket square that's a shade lighter or darker than the main color of the suit to make it stand out. And don't match it directly to your tie (if you're wearing one). Instead, choose a secondary color from your shirt or blazer to match it to."

      "content": "Go thrift shopping for retro themes. If you have the time and don't mind spending a little money on a themed outfit, thrift stores are a great resource to find clothes that could fit various decades. For 1950s, look for pastels and waist-high skirts with a little retro bell shape. If the theme is 1970s, opt for high-waisted jeans (with flared legs), paisley patterns, psychedelic prints, ponchos, and clunky platform shoes. [13] X Research source Whether you're familiar with the theme or not, doing some research will spark your creativity. Look through your wardrobe for items that might fit the theme. Even if you don't have clothing that directly matches, combining mismatched pieces and layering them can do wonders!"

You can wear a pastel shirt, leggings of any color, and a pastel colored skirt over it with a colorful scarf tied around your waist. You won't exactly look like a mermaid, but the color scheme will allude to that idea!"

      "content": "Cut up an old skirt to make a cape or toga. Old clothes you don't wear anymore are perfect for costumes because you can cut and shape them to fit various themes. For example, that old maxi skirt you no longer wear can be cut open down the side and fashioned into a cape or draped like a toga."

      "content": "Use tin foil or bubble wrap for intergalactic or campy 80s glam themes. Tin foil and bubble wrap can be a creative way to make normal clothes look interstellar for an outer-space-themed party or 80s shin-dig! It won't necessarily look fashionable, but it will show off your creativity and sense of humor. Cut rounded triangular pieces of foil and safety pin them to an old jacket to make shiny shoulderpads. Tape bubble wrap around your arms, legs, or torso for a spacesuit or alien look."

      "content": "Rip the sleeves off of old shirts and sweaters for various themes. Simply tearing the sleeves off of sweaters and shirts can work with tons of themes. Look like a Breakfast Clubber by tearing long sleeves off of sweaters or jersey shirts at the shoulder seam. Rip some holes in the front and back in it to make it ultra-grunge or punk. Save your ripped shirts and sweaters for a great zombie-apocalypse Halloween costume! Drape a studded belt diagonally across your torso (like a messenger bag strap) to accessorize a punk or grunge theme."

      "content": "Use jean scraps to make counterculture patches. Cut old jeans into shorts and then cut the pant legs into small squares to make patches you can safety-pin on a shirt or jacket for a counterculture look. To fray the edges of the shorts, comb and tease out the fibers from the freshly cut edges. If you want to scuff up the jeans to look worn in, rub the outside of the jeans down the side of a cheese grater. Make sure you don't want to wear the clothing (as is) anymore before you cut into it!"
