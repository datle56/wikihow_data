      "content": "Choose a dye color that’s darker than the wig itself. You can only darken a human hair wig, not lighten it, since the bleach in the dye can damage the hair. To achieve light colors, start with a light-blonde wig or a wig that’s naturally closer to white. [1] X Research source If you’re going for a natural look, find your skin’s undertones , and use a hair dye color that matches your skin tone: gold and caramel hair tones work well with warm skin tones, blonde and yellow hair tones work with cool skin tones, and neutral skin tones work well with pretty much any hair color (lucky you!). [2] X Research source For artificial colors: blues are outgoing, oranges are warm and friendly, and purples are imaginative and spiritual. [3] X Research source Bright colors like pinks and yellows are fun and bold. Don’t dye human hair with fabric dye, which can damage the hair (the last thing we want). Only use hair dye."

      "content": "Purchase a 20-volume hair developer. Hair developer opens your cuticles to allow hair dye to penetrate your hair, and is sold by “volume,” or penetrating power. [4] X Research source A 10-volume may be too weak, a 20-volume developer will let you change the color by one or two shades, while a 30-volume will let you make the hair even darker. In most cases, a 20-volume developer will be just enough to get you that perfect color. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix the dye and the developer in a plastic bowl.",
      "content": "Mix the dye and the developer in a plastic bowl. Read the instructions on your dye to see how much dye you should combine with the developer in the plastic bowl . Mix with a plastic spoon. If the dye looks a little light, don’t worry. It will darken over time. Use rubber gloves to protect your hands from irritation or staining. [6] X Research source If your wig goes down below your shoulders, you may need two boxes of hair dye. It’ll be pricier, but don’t skimp on your hair. Do not use a metal bowl or spoon to mix your dye. The metal can oxidize the dye, causing it to change colors."

      "title": "Mount the wig on a stand and separate it into 4 sections.",
      "content": "Mount the wig on a stand and separate it into 4 sections. A wig stand will keep your wig's shape and style intact while you dye it, and will make it easier to work with the hair. Place the wig on the stand as you would put it on your own head, securing it by pushing T-pins through the wig cap and into the stand. If you don’t have a wig stand, you can use a styrofoam mannequin head, or simply use the soaking method below to dye the wig. The dye might drip off of the wig. To prevent any stains on your furniture, you can put a towel or plastic tarp around the wig stand."

    {
      "title": "Gather the hair into 4 separate sections.",
      "content": "Gather the hair into 4 separate sections. Use hair ties to make 4 buns on the wig: 2 at the base of the wig, and 2 more toward the front. This will make it easier to manage as you brush-dye the wig, holding strands of hair that you’re not currently dyeing out of the way. [7] X Research source If your wig is longer or more voluminous, divide it into as many sections as you need to feel comfortable handling the hair."

      "title": "Test the dye on a few strands of hair.",
      "content": "Test the dye on a few strands of hair. With your fingers or a dye paintbrush , apply the dye to a small section of hair. Test it somewhere that is not easily seen. Wait 30 or 40 minutes. If you like the color, apply it to the rest of the wig. If you don’t totally love it, try a different shade of hair dye. [8] X Research source Also, do an allergy test prior to applying the dye to the wig if you have particularly sensitive skin. Dab a tiny dot onto the back of your hand and monitor it for 30-40 minutes. If your skin becomes irritated, use a different brand of dye.

      "title": "Paint the dye into the hair.",
      "content": "Paint the dye into the hair. Starting at the bottom of the wig, take sections of hair and brush the dye into the hair, working from the root to the tip. When you’ve finished applying it to a section, let it hang loose and move on to the next section. Repeat this technique for each of the sections of hair. [10] X Research source You can also dye by soaking the wig in the bowl with the dye. With your hands, gently scoop the dye over the wig and spread it through the layers of the wig. Be gentle. Try not to roughly rub the dye into the wig. You can achieve lowlights by only painting the dye into some strands, or dye either the roots or the ends for a cute dual-tone look."

      "title": "Brush through the hair.",
      "content": "Brush through the hair. Once you’ve completely coated the hair in dye, use a comb or a wig brush to distribute the dye throughout the wig and ensure that the dye is evenly applied to the entire wig. This will help the dyed hair look more natural, which is key when it comes to human hair wigs. Use a clean but old hair brush that you don’t mind staining with hair dye."

      "title": "Leave the wig for 30-40 minutes to let the color set.",
      "content": "Leave the wig for 30-40 minutes to let the color set. Read the package on the dye to see how long you should leave it. In most cases, this will be about half an hour to an hour. If you can’t find this information, check the wig every 10 minutes. When it has reached the right color, you can wash it. [11] X Research source If you do not have a wig stand, leave the wig in the bowl to set and cover it with plastic wrap."

      "title": "Shampoo the wig.",
      "content": "Shampoo the wig. Use a color-safe shampoo or a special shampoo manufactured for human hair wigs in particular. Wash the wig by placing it under a tap with warm water to get rid of any excess dye before lathering the wig with shampoo. Rinse out the shampoo when you are done. [12] X Research source Handle the wig gently, and avoid unneeded tugging or pulling, as this could damage the wig."

      "content": "Pat the hair dry with a towel and blow dry it. Gently squeeze the wig with the towel to remove excess water. Hold it with one hand or mount it back on the wig stand, and use a blow dryer on low heat to dry the hair in sections. [15] X Research source While you’re drying it, you can style the wig to your liking. Once dry, try it on in the mirror and admire your new ‘do. A blow dryer can damage some wigs, or cause some hair dyes to discolor if used immediately after dyeing. Check the dye’s packaging instructions for drying tips, and hang your wig to air dry if you’re unsure."
