      "content": "A clogged filter, drain, or drain hose can cause a sewage smell. The most common reason for a sewage smell is dirty water. When the filter, drain, or drain hose is clogged, dirty water stands in your dishwasher or hose, leading to a sewage smell. Food build-up can clog the filter, making it harder to drain and contributing to the sewage smell. [1] X Research source This smell transfers to your dishes, making them also smell like sewage. If there isn’t enough room for an air gap in your drain hose, wastewater may transfer back into your dishwasher and cause the sewage smell."

      "content": "If a new dishwasher smells like sewage, the drain hose may be damaged. When installed improperly, an unleveled or damaged drain hose doesn’t leave room for an air gap, which is responsible for keeping dirty water out of your dishwasher. The lack of an air gap means water that should have been drained is going back into your dishwasher, leading to the sewage smell. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Deep clean the filter and drain.",
      "content": "Deep clean the filter and drain. Remove the rack from the bottom of your dishwasher to access the small round filter, and twist it counterclockwise to remove it. Then, remove the mesh filter at the bottom of your dishwasher. Get rid of any food build-up on the filters using a bottle brush. Soak both filters in hot soapy water, then clean the drain around the filter. [3] X Research source Food residue often gets caught in the drain, so keep your eyes open and get rid of any debris you see. Get deep into the crevices to remove any unseen debris. If you have a self-cleaning filter, check it every morning for food debris, and rinse as needed. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Drain your dishwasher and unclog your drain hose . First, remove all of the water from your dishwasher if it hasn't drained properly with a cup, towel, or wet/dry shop vac. To disconnect the drain hose, unscrew the panel on the bottom of your dishwasher and locate the hose. Once you have located the hose, go to where it connects to the pump, place a bowl or pan underneath to catch spills, and remove the hose. After removing the hose, insert and remove a drain snake to get rid of any potential clogs. [5] X Research source If you are unable to do it yourself, call a plumber to snake the line, get rid of the clog, and give you advice for preventing clogs in the future. [6] X Research source If you’ve cleaned your new dishwasher and the smell still doesn’t go away, contact your manufacturer for help."

      "content": "Clean the interior of the dishwasher with soapy water and vinegar. Remove the racks and spray arms from the dishwasher, then make a solution of hot soapy water and vinegar to soak them in. Soak them to get rid of any unseen bacteria. Wipe the spray arms to remove any residue. Treat the interior by spraying it with a cleaning solution, then use a brush or cloth to wipe it down. [7] X Research source Wipe the seal on the door down to get rid of any food build-up. Check the holes where the spray arms go for any food build-up and clean accordingly. Mix 2 cups (240 grams) of baking soda and 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of hydrogen peroxide and apply it to the interior before scrubbing to break down scum. Check the salt and rinse aid levels to make sure your dishwasher is performing to the best of its ability. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Run one cycle with vinegar, then one with baking soda, and repeat. Cleaning expert James Sears says to fill a dishwasher-safe bowl with distilled white vinegar and put it on the top rack of your empty dishwasher, then run it on a hot cycle. Remove the bowl, then sprinkle baking soda across the bottom of your dishwasher and let it sit for a few hours. For this step, cleaning expert Raymond Chiu suggests running a quick, hot, empty cycle. Check for a sewage smell and repeat the process if it remains. Check your dishwasher manual before using vinegar, as some manufacturers advise against it. Be careful when removing the bowl of vinegar. It will be very hot! [9] X Research source"

Wipe down the interior with a cleaning solution and a cloth, and check any areas that frequently hold food build-up, like the seals and drain. [10] X Research source Cleaning expert Chris Willatt suggests deep cleaning your dishwasher every six months and cleaning your filter once a month, especially in an area with mineral-heavy water. Repeat the baking soda and vinegar method every month to prevent build-up. Remove any food debris from your dishes before loading, as they can clog the filter and bring the sewage smell back."
