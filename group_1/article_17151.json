He might be worried that you’ll have some awkward run-ins with other dates if you two go elsewhere. [1] X Research source If you want to know for sure, casually mention visiting a new restaurant, movie theater, or park in a different area of town, then gauge his reaction. If he’s really playing you, then he’ll act flustered or annoyed that you suggested somewhere else. Ask yourself if he’s always the one who decides where you should go. Of course, he may just want to take charge for other reasons, but this could be a giveaway that he wants to steer you away from places where you’re likely to run into some of his other dates. The same is true if he only wants to hang out late at night. Usually, this means he’s only after a booty call, and not a real relationship."

If your guy never wants to meet your friends, it may be because he doesn’t want to make the relationship a serious commitment. If he doesn’t want you to meet his friends, it may be for the same reason, with the additional worry that his friends may say something about the other people he’s seeing. Whether he’s seeing someone else or not, if you’ve been together for a while and he’s shown no interest in wanting to meet your friends or have you meet his, then it’s a red flag. [3] X Research source If he doesn’t want to become a bigger part of your life, then it’s likely because he doesn’t want things to get too serious. He might also be worried that you’ll find out he likes someone else . That said, if you try to rush him into meeting your friends, or even your family, after just a few weeks of dating, then you may be moving too fast. He may have legitimate reasons for taking things slow, like wanting to make sure he knows where things stand, or giving his friends some time to get used to the idea of him having a new partner."

If things are great when you and your guy are alone and he suddenly gives you the cold shoulder when you run into him at the mall or outside a restaurant, then something is definitely up. Either he’s acting weird because he’s seeing another person and doesn’t want to be seen with you, or because he doesn’t want his friends or anyone else to think he’s dating you. Either way, this is be a cause for concern. If he really cares for you, then he’ll be excited to see you and maybe even show you some affection. Of course, he doesn’t have to be as affectionate in public as he would be in private, but he will act like he really wants to see you. [4] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. Read his body language for signs that he likes you. Does he make eye contact and move toward you? If so, then that’s a good sign. But if he stands away from you, crosses his arms over his chest, and keeps looking around instead of looking at you, then this means that he’s trying to keep his distance."

Though not all guys are into holding hands, for example, if he really cares for you, he’ll want to give you some sort of affection. [5] X Research source You don’t want to put the pressure on him to be affectionate in public too early, but if you’ve gone on several dates and he still stands a foot away from you any time you’re out together, then this may be a cause for concern."

Whether this means he’d rather hang with another date or spend time with his buddies, if he’s always hot and cold, then he’s definitely playing with you.

He would always spend a night out with his buddies, but when it comes to you, he’ll only hang out with you on certain times, when you suspect that his friends might be busy or that he has nothing else on his social calendar. If he really likes you, then he’ll think of you as a priority, not as social sloppy seconds. If you want to know if he’s playing with you, see if he’ll ever give up a night with his friends for a nice evening with you. [8] X Research source If the guy is serious about you, then he’ll be excited about hanging out with you instead of his friends, at least some of the time.

If he’s always checking his phone and then texting away from your direction, stepping out to take calls a lot without telling you who called, or goes hours without picking up his phone with no explanation, then it may be because he’s playing you. [9] X Research source The same goes if you two aren’t connected on social media or if he’s blocked you from seeing his social media accounts. Think about it: does he ever leave his phone out, even for a second, or is it always stuck in his pocket? Though you don’t want to snoop through it, if you can tell that he’s freaked out even about the idea of you seeing who is calling or texting him, then you may have a problem. Another thing you can look out for is if he turns off his phone completely when he’s hanging out with you. Though this may be a sweet gesture to give you his full attention, it may also be his way of warding off other partners who might be calling him when you’re together. If you don’t trust your partner, it’s unlikely that this relationship can work out long-term. Keep that in mind as you decide whether or not to continue things with him.

The truth of the matter is that if a guy really wants to hang out with you, he’ll find the time to do it. It’s different if he’s actually super busy, but if you know he’s hanging out with others, that’s a red flag.

Though you don’t want to spy on him or get too obsessive, if one of your friends is at a party where he’s talking to other people, ask your friend what it was like.

If he’s nervous, he might start stuttering or fidgeting. Though you don’t want to interrogate him, if you just ask a few questions without making a big deal about it, you may even be able to catch him in a lie .

Tell your friends to be honest with you and not lie just to spare your feelings. They can investigate a bit if you really want them to. If it won’t look too obvious, you can have one of your friends casually show up in a place where your guy is likely to be and to keep an eye on him to see how he is with other people.

Or, look through his room for suspicious items like female clothing that is obviously not yours. Snooping is a last resort, so only do it if you feel like you really need answers and nothing else is working. [21] X Research source The problem with snooping is that even if you’ve found evidence, you’ll have to admit that you’ve been going through the guy’s things if you want to call him out. This will likely make him angry at you, and will take the focus off the real situation. Don’t use this method unless you’re ready to end the relationship, since he may be angry enough to break things off. If you’re looking through his phone, have an excuse ready in case he catches you. You can say that your phone died and that you were looking up the restaurant where you two were having dinner or that you needed to quickly check your email or something.
