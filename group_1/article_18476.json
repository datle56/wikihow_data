      "content": "Uncover your boyfriend’s juiciest stories with this simple game. The rules of this classic party game are simple: hold up all 10 fingers and take turns making statements that begin with “Never have I ever…” followed by something you’ve never done—the crazier, the better! Each time one of you has done whatever the other is talking about, put down a finger. The game ends when one of you runs out of fingers. [1] X Research source For example: “Never have I ever gotten lost in a foreign country.” “Never have I ever stolen something.” “Never have I ever met someone famous.” To play Never Have I Ever as a drinking game, take a sip of your drink every time you’ve done something in your boyfriend’s “Never have I ever” statements (as opposed to putting a finger down). Never Have I Ever is a fun way to learn about the wild things you and your boyfriend have done before meeting one another!"

If he guesses one of the other statements, you win the round."

      "content": "Build a funny story with your boyfriend one sentence at a time. Are you and your boyfriend natural storytellers? Start the game by coming up with a single introductory sentence. Then, have your boyfriend build off of that with a sentence of his own. Take turns adding sentences to the story, creating a plot and characters by steadily playing off of one another. See what you can come up with together! For example, you might begin the story by saying, “Once upon a time, a princess escaped from her tower and decided to go on an adventure.” Then, your boyfriend could follow up with something like, “She traveled to the nearest city and quickly befriended a talented street performer, so they created an act together.” Since this is more of a collaborative effort, simply end the game once your story reaches a natural stopping point."

Take turns asking one another, “Truth or dare?” If you choose “truth,” your partner has to ask you a question you must answer honestly. If you choose “dare,” they have to dare you to do something. Since you’re playing Truth or Dare with your boyfriend, you could always make it a little steamier by asking flirty “truth” questions and giving raunchy dares. [3] X Research source Truth: “What turns you on?” Truth: “What outfit do I look sexiest in?” Truth: “Who’s your celebrity hall pass?” Dare: “Send me a photo of yourself I’ve never seen.” Dare: “Do a sexy dance!” Dare: “Kiss your favorite part of my body.” You can play truth or dare without revealing too much personal information. Before starting the game, discuss what topics are off-limits or uncomfortable for each of you. It can include things like past relationships or personal traumas. If a truth question is too personal or uncomfortable, use the skip option and move on to the next question."

For example, if you and your boyfriend had your first kiss at the local lake’s recreation area, your word might be “dock.”"

      "content": "Ask your boyfriend deep, fun, and steamy questions. Normally, this game involves thinking of something and letting the other player ask 20 “yes” or “no” questions to figure out what it is. You can certainly still play that, but if you want something a little more relationship-focused, this version involves asking your boyfriend 20 questions about himself (and answering him when he asks you 20 questions). [4] X Research source For example, you could ask: “You get a single superpower. What is it?” “What do you find most attractive about me?” “Where would you want to go next time we go on vacation?” “What’s your favorite part of our relationship?” “What would be your perfect date?” “Do you have any fantasies you haven’t shared with me yet?”"
