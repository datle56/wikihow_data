      "content": "Choose between a permanent, semi-permanent, or demi-permanent dye. Permanent dye will last the longest and can cover gray hairs and roots. Semi-permanent dye can only darken hair, and will last up to 8 washes. Demi-permanent dye can slightly lift your hair color, and will last up to 25 washes. If you're using permanent dye, apply it to your hair when it's dry. For semi-permanent dye, shampoo your hair and dye it while it's still slightly damp. [1] X Research source"

You can also lay down newspaper or garbage bags to protect floors and surfaces from dye stains.

[5] X Research source The bathroom is generally the best place to work, especially if you have a window that lets in natural light. You can use the mirror to check up on your progress, use the countertops as a workspace, and the sink and shower are readily available in case you need to rinse off."
