      "content": "Hold your scissors at the side of your head angling towards your nose. Position a pair of sharp scissors in your hand so that you’re creating the first side of the ‘V’ shape. Hold the scissors at your temple, right above your eyebrows, and angle the scissors downwards so they’re pointing at your nose.

Go slowly as you cut so you’re not cutting off too much hair at once and finish the cut when you get to the bottom of the ‘V’ shape right in between your eyes.

[8] X Research source Remember that your bangs will get a little bit shorter once they dry, so avoid cutting them super short to begin with. Your bangs will start off shorter on the side and become longer as they reach your nose."

      "content": "Start at your nose and cut the other side of your bangs to form the 'V'. With one half of your ‘V’ bangs done, use your scissors to make a cut that mirrors the finished side. Start in the center of your nose and make the cut diagonally upwards, trimming your hair slowly and combing it out as you go.

      "content": "Continue making small snips until both sides look even. Comb through your bangs and see which areas need to be touched up so that both sides of the ‘V’ are even. It’s normal to need to go back and forth on both sides making small snips until they’re perfectly even, which is why it’s important not to cut too much hair at once. [10] X Research source Avoid trimming the bottom of the ‘V’ shape too much so that it stays longer than the two shorter top sides. Comb out your hair to make sure that the tip of the ‘V’ is at the center of your head."

Cut the stray hairs that you find as you comb so that your ‘V’ shape is clean and straight. [13] X Research source It’s possible that you’ll always be able to find some stray hairs as you continue to brush out your hair, so don’t worry too much if it doesn’t always stay consistent."

A hair straightener is also useful for curling the bottom of your bangs up under themselves slightly to give them a more natural curve.
