If your stream lag doesn't get any better—or gets worse—switch Hardware Acceleration back to the setting it was before. The Hardware Acceleration setting can be found in Settings > Voice & Video . There is also a Hardware Acceleration setting in Settings > Advanced . Disabling one Hardware Acceleration setting will not disable the other."

      "title": "A laggy stream could be caused by a sub-optimal internet connection.",
      "content": "A laggy stream could be caused by a sub-optimal internet connection. Issues with your modem or router often cause these problems. Restart your router if all network processes are laggy. If your modem or router has a power button, use that to turn it off and back on. Otherwise, unplug the modem or router for a few seconds, then plug it back in. If you live with other people, make sure that it's okay to restart the modem or router first, as this will cause the internet in your house to go down momentarily."

      "content": "Sometimes, a laggy stream is caused by a Windows permissions problem. You can resolve this by running Discord in administrator mode. To do this, search for Discord in the taskbar search bar, right-click it, and select Run as administrator . If running Discord as an administrator fixed the problem, you might want to always run Discord as an administrator. To do this, right-click the Discord icon on your desktop, select Properties , then click the Compatibility tab. Check the box that says \"Run as an administrator\" and click OK to save."

      "content": "Ethernet connections are faster than Wi-Fi connections. If you are currently connecting to the internet with Wi-Fi, switching to a wired connection can get rid of stream lag. Using an Ethernet cable is more reliable and gets you faster internet speeds, which can help improve your stream performance on Discord. For the best performance, use a Cat 5e, Cat 6, or Cat 6a ethernet cable."

      "content": "DirectX might be causing the issues. Dxdiag (or the DirectX Diagnostic Tool) is a tool that reports information about your DirectX components and drivers. Some users have reported that they've fixed a laggy Discord stream by checking dxdiag for problems. [1] X Research source To do this, type dxdiag in the taskbar search bar, then click \"dxdiag\" to run it. The dxdiag icon is blue with a yellow \"x\" on it. Allow dxdiag to finish loading, then click on each tab and check the \"Notes\" section for any issues. If dxdiag finds a problem, resolve it before checking Discord again. If dxdiag says a program or file is causing problems, but you're not sure what that program or file does, research it before you remove it. Accidentally removing files or programs that your computer needs can cause it to stop working entirely."
