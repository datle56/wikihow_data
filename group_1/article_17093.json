      "content": "Learn how the bible is organized. It is divided into Book Chapter:Verse . For example, if you wanted to look up John 3:16, first you would turn to the book of John. You would then turn to the 3rd chapter (the number before the colon is the chapter.). You would then find the 16th verse. Verses are usually arranged with small numbers within the text.

The first part of the Bible is called the Old Testament (Tanakh -- Jewish) Bible of the \"books of Moses\" and other ancient prophets' writings and second the New Testament of Christian books starting with the four Gospels of Christ written by Christian Jews -- and as many as fourteen (or as few as seven, some say) books all ascribed to one Greek Jew, the Apostle [Saint] Paul (born Saul of Tarsus), more on his contributions to the Bible Christianity in the \"Tips\" section.
