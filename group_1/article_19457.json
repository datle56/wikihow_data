      "content": "Learn about your options. There are a few different ways that your dentist can close a gap or gaps in between your teeth. Before you schedule an appointment with your dentist, think about which option best suits your situation. If you have a single small gap (less than 5 millimeters), dental bonding might be your best option. Dental bonding is not permanent and the composite material may stain over time (if you smoke or eat or drink colored foods and liquids), but it is the quickest and cheapest method of correcting gaps in between teeth. [2] X Research source If you have discoloration and/or chips in your teeth in addition to gaps, then veneers might be your best option. Veneers are custom-made covers for your teeth so they are similar to dental bonding, but they can provide more dramatic, attractive results. In addition, veneers can't stain as they are made of ceramic and a cosmetic dentist can give you a perfectly adapted smile according to your eyes and facial anatomy. If you have multiple gaps, gaps wider than 5 millimeters, crooked teeth, and you do not want to cover up your existing teeth, then braces might be your best option. [3] X Research source Braces straighten your teeth using wires that are attached to your teeth with composite material, much like the material used in dental bonding. If you have multiple gaps that do not exceed 5 millimeters, then Invisalign might be your best option. [4] X Research source Invisalign closes gaps and straightens teeth using a series of ultra-thin, clear aligners that you switch out every two weeks."
