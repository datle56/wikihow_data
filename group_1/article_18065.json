      "content": "Drink a carbonated beverage. Soda, beer, sparkling water, champagne, or other carbonated beverages contain gases (that's what makes them so delicious and bubbly!). Drink them, and the gases will build up in your stomach. More than likely, the extra pressure will trigger a burp, which might help to relieve your abdominal discomfort. Try it! For best effects, don’t just drink the beverage—chug it. Drinking quickly will make you swallow even more air, increasing the probability of a big belch. Drinking through a straw will help too."

      "content": "Drink water from the side of the glass that's farther from your mouth. To do this, hold a glass of water and lean over at the hips, as if you’re drinking from a water fountain. Place your mouth on the opposite side of the cup and slowly tilt the water into your mouth. Take small sips, swallow, and then stand up straight. This way, you're swallowing more air, and you know what that means! Belching is likely to follow.

      "content": "Make chamomile tea (or, fennel, cumin and coriander seed tea). Chamomile has been shown to help with gastrointestinal issues, so it might be worth a shot if you’re gassy. Boil a cup of water and steep your chamomile tea in it for about 5 minutes. As you sip your tea, it may feel easier to belch. [2] X Research source Drink a fennel, cumin, and coriander seed tea. Fennel, cumin, and coriander seeds all have been shown to help with indigestion. Mix equal parts of fennel, cumin, and coriander seeds together so they’re thoroughly combined. Steep 1 teaspoon (2 g) of the seeds in a mug of hot water and slowly sip it to help relieve your gas.

      "content": "Snack on some sugary candy or gum. The key to belching is to increase pressure and swallow more air. When people eat hard candies or gum, they tend to swallow more. And they're not just swallowing candy, but air, too. This can lead to extra burps, and less discomfort for you!

      "content": "Take antacids. Some types of antacids create excess gas, which will increase your urge to burp. Your doctor might prescribe you an over-the-counter variety, or you can go pick up a pack yourself. [5] X Research source Antacids will also help to control acid reflux or “heartburn,” which is a common cause of abdominal discomfort and belching. Win-win!"

      "content": "Receive a Botox injection if you suffer from no-burp syndrome. If you never burp (ever), make an appointment with your doctor. You might be dealing with no-burp syndrome, and if that's the issue, they'll help you schedule a Botox consultation. Your cricopharyngeus muscle might be working too hard, inhibiting the belching process no matter how hard you try. Receive a quick Botox shot, and the issue often resolves itself. [6] X Research source For some people, no amount of pressure or discomfort seems to bring on the burp they're waiting for. This is a clear sign of no-burp syndrome. For people with this disorder, standard hacks won't do the trick. Some people may experience more than just bloating and flatulence. They may even hear a noisy gurgling sound in the back of their throat."

      "content": "Trigger your gag reflex. Triggering your gag reflex should be a last resort, as it causes an unpleasant sensation and sometimes even vomiting. Though, if nothing else works, it does oftentimes trigger a burp, too. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Most people have gag sensitivity. In order to trigger yours, touch the soft palate at the back of your mouth with a clean finger or toothbrush. The aim here is to make you burp, not vomit. Be light on the touch and only engage the reflex enough to release the air in your stomach."

      "content": "Inhale with a closed mouth until you feel air at the base of your throat. First, sit up straight so you're in a comfortable breathing position. Expand your throat and jaws and then suck air in your mouth. Suck the air backwards until you feel an air bubble at the base of your throat. Once you've done this, block the front of your mouth with your tongue. [8] X Research source To do this, take your tongue and touch it to the top of your mouth. Forcing air into your throat can take a little practice. You don't want to inhale so forcefully that you swallow the air, otherwise you will feel more bloated. Try to keep it in your throat. Release the air slowly by lowering your tongue and parting your lips, letting it escape."

If everything you've tried is unsuccessful and you just want to burp, not relieve pressure, try repeating the first steps. This time though, fully swallow the air into your throat. First, exhale as much air as you can to empty your lungs. Take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can. Exhale, inhale another deep breath, and try to swallow the air. [9] X Research source This may not come naturally. One way trick that might work is to drink a glass of water while holding your breath. Pinch your nose, too, to ensure that you do not exhale any of the air."

      "content": "Burp the air out. Once you have swallowed enough air, you should feel more pressure building up in your abdomen and esophagus. Open your mouth and allow a resounding belch to escape. [10] X Research source Tighten your abdominal muscles when you feel the burp rising. This should maximize both its force and volume. Practice your burp on demand. Over time, the procedure will become easier and less uncomfortable."

      "content": "Watch your diet. Gas is commonly produced by the digestion of food, and some foods are worse than others. Beans, onions, cabbage, and other cruciferous vegetables, and whole grains are all notorious for producing gas. Avoid these foods or eat them with digestive aids if you are having issues with chronic bloating. [11] X Research source Cut foods that have simple sugars and carbohydrates as well. Other foods that cause gas include fibrous fruits like apples, peaches, raisins, and apricots, vegetables like garlic, cucumbers, Brussel sprouts, and legumes. Foods that don’t tend to produce gas include meat, fish, eggs, poultry, and carbohydrates like rice. Eat probiotic yogurt. Yogurts with active bacterial cultures can ease digestion and reduce the amount of gas you produce. Taking a digestive enzyme can work similar results. Eat smaller bites or portion sizes , and avoid sucking on hard candies, drinking through straws, or chewing gum. These activities all lead you to swallow air and will increase bloating."

Also, make sure that you're avoiding sodas and other carbonated drinks. Otherwise, you may end up more bloated. Try some of these carminatives to see whether they work for you. For instance, teas made from peppermint, anise, and ginger – all carminatives – are thought to relieve bloating. Foods that contain carminative herbs and spices allspice, clove, juniper, bergamot, sage, thyme, basil, cinnamon, and nutmeg may also relieve symptoms. You can purchase carminatives at natural health stores or many grocery stores."

      "content": "Consider potential allergies and disorders that might be the culprit. Occasional gas and bloating is natural. However, if you find that your symptoms are persistent, there may be an underlying issue like stress, food intolerances, gastrointestinal disorders, or poorly fitting dentures. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Take note of any correlation between your diet and gas. For example, lactose intolerance, the inability to digest milk products, can cause flatulence, bloating, and abdominal cramps. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or SIBO, could also cause excess gas or bloating. Try to eliminate whole grains, legumes, soft cheeses, and fiber-rich fruits. Talk to a doctor if you are frequently uncomfortable and cannot determine the cause."
