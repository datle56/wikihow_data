      "content": "In this variation on playing classic Hangman , one player thinks of a word and writes a dash for each letter on a piece of paper. Other players take turns guessing letters. If they guess correctly, the letter gets written on the corresponding dash. If they guess incorrectly, the letter is written somewhere else on the page, and a part of a spaceman (or astronaut) is drawn on the paper. If the players can guess the word before the spaceman drawing is complete, they win! Other variations on Hangman include Snowman and Apple Tree. Snowman follows the same rules as Spaceman, except the lead player draws a snowman instead of an astronaut. In Apple Tree, an apple tree is drawn with 10 apples. If players guess the wrong letter, it is written in one of the apples. The game ends when the apple tree is full of letters!"

[1] X Research source Their line can be horizontal or vertical, but they cannot connect two dots that are at a diagonal. When a player completes the fourth side of a square or box, they write their initials in that box. They can then draw another line. The game ends when all boxes have been completed or “claimed” with a player’s initials. Whoever has claimed the most boxes is the winner!"

On the left side of each grid, label each row with letters A-J. [2] X Research source In their respective grid, each player should secretly draw where they want to place their five ships: aircraft carrier (5 squares), destroyer (1 square), battleship (4 squares), cruiser (3 squares) and submarine (2 squares). Ships can be positioned horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Once all ships have been placed, the first player can guess where their opponent put their ships by naming a coordinate, e.g. “A5,” “J9,” or “D1.” The other player then declares whether that coordinate “hit” or “missed” their ship. If a ship is hit, cross out that coordinate box. Once every box of a ship has been hit, the ship is sunk. Play continues this way, with players taking turns giving coordinates. The game ends when one player has lost all their ships, making the other player the winner."

Each player takes turns drawing a straight line through the dots that’s exactly 5 dots long. The new line cannot retrace any part of a previously drawn line, and exactly one of the five dots must be a new dot that wasn’t originally part of the grid. The game ends when no more lines or segments can be drawn. While you can play this game on plain printer paper, it may be easier to visualize the dots if you use dot graph paper .

Players take turns guessing the numbers and the Mastermind will tell them how many digits are correct and in the right place and how many digits are correct but in the wrong position. Players continue guessing until they discover the secret number. [3] X Research source For example, suppose the secret number is “0138,” and a player guesses “2035.” The Mastermind would say that they have one correct digit that's in the right place (“3”), and one correct digit that's in the wrong place (“0”). The Mastermind doesn’t have to tell the players what the number values actually are. To increase this game's difficulty level, limit the number of guesses the players have."

      "content": "Draw a rectangle on a piece of graph paper. The rectangle should resemble a soccer field. Draw very small rectangles on each short side to resemble “goals.” Draw a dot (the “soccer ball”) in the middle of the paper. On each turn, a player can draw a line segment from the dot’s current position to the next intersection on the graph paper. This action is equivalent to moving or “kicking” the soccer ball. Players cannot free draw lines—they must draw along the edge or diagonal of a square on the graph paper. They can cross existing diagonals, but they cannot draw directly over a line that’s already been drawn. If the ball reaches an intersection for the first time, the ball stops there and the next player takes their turn. If the ball has been at that intersection before or hits the field boundary, the ball bounces and the player must take another turn and draw another line. This continues until the ball reaches an intersection it’s never been at before. If the ball reaches the back edge of a player’s “goal,” their opponent wins a point and the ball returns to the center of the field. The game is won by whichever player is the first to score 3 points."

Assign each player as Xs and Os. Ask the X player to place their X anywhere on the mega-board. [4] X Research source The X player’s choice affects where the O player can put their O. For example, say the X chose the top left mini-board and placed their X in the bottom-right corner of that board. The O player must then place their O in the bottom-right mini-board, but they can place their O anywhere on that board. If they place it in the center of the mini-board, the X must use the center mini-board for their next turn. When a row is completed on any mini-board, the winner claims that square on the mega-board by drawing a large X or O through it.
