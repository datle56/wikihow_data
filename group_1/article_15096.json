Tilt your head forward so that you're facing the floor. Position your towel at the back of your neck horizontally and start draping your hair with both of your hands. Twist the towel gently, not too tightly, and lift your head back up to its original position. [4] X Research source Replace it with a new towel when your existing towel turban becomes heavy and wet."

Conditioner locks in moisture and helps repel water to prevent your hair from absorbing more water than necessary following a bath or shower. Apply conditioner, mostly focusing on the ends of your hair, and rinse after a few minutes. You can also use a leave-in conditioner for anti-frizz and a shiny look as well as a faster dry.

      "content": "Use hair products that say “blow-dry” or “quick dry” on their label. Many commercial hair products such as lotions and primers now contain heat-conducting substances that wick moisture away from your hair. Apply these products to your hair as directed, prior to blow-drying or air-drying your hair, and distribute them evenly on your head. [6] X Research source Don’t apply any products until your hair is towel-dried and the excess water is soaked. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use hairsprays with alcohol. Normally, it’s not advised to use products with alcohol since they can make your hair dry, but if you’re really in a rush and your hair is still wet, try using a hairspray or mousse that has some alcohol content—it will help you hair dry faster.

      "content": "Blow-dry your hair outside of the bathroom. It might come naturally to blow-dry your hair in the bathroom but the after-shower steam won’t be helpful for drying it fast. Consider moving to your bedroom or another room to avoid dampness in the air and accelerate the drying process. As an alternative, open up the bathroom window and let the steam evaporate for a few minutes before you blow-dry your hair."

      "content": "Rough-dry your hair before reaching for the brush. Prior to using a brush during blow-drying, use your fingers as a comb and toss your hair from one side to the other. Keep doing this rough-drying method for 50 to 75 percent of the time, and then switch to a brush. To dry your hair like a pro, dry upwards for more volume, and downwards for smooth and glossy hair."

      "content": "Use a microfiber brush or ceramic round-barreled brush for the rest of your blow-dry. A microfiber brush has the ability to absorb moisture while you brush, and a ceramic round-barreled brush can conduct the heat coming from the dryer onto your hair strands while also shaping them nicely. Such brushes with fewer bristles than regular ones also allow for more airflow. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Divide your hair into four sections for increased efficiency. Although this may sound like a lot of work, it actually helps you dry your hair more efficiently and effectively instead of handling all of your hair at once. Once you section your hair in four, hold three of the sections in place with clips. [11] X Research source Working in manageable sections is beneficial for nearly all styling techniques, not just drying hair."
