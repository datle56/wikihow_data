      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly to your ears and hairline to prevent stains. Henna will stain your skin, including your scalp, ears, and neck. While wearing latex gloves, rub a thin layer of petroleum jelly on your forehead, temples, upper neck, and behind your ears. The oils in the jelly will act as a barrier, preventing the henna from touching your skin. If your hair is dirty, wash and dry it before applying the petroleum jelly. Make sure your hair is clean before moving on to the next steps."

      "content": "Spread the henna mixture evenly throughout your hair. Use hair sectioning clips to part your hair into 2-3 even chunks. Then put on clean latex gloves, place a golf-ball-sized chunk of henna in your palm, and smear it against your hair. Start with the back of your head and slowly work your way forward. Massage the mixture into your hair and scalp until all your hair is completely coated. [4] X Research source The wet henna will make your hair look green and muddy. This is normal and will wash out with water. Wear an old shirt while applying the henna to avoid staining any nice clothes. If you accidentally get henna on your skin, immediately wash it off with soap and water so it doesn't stain."
