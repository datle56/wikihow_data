      "content": "“Fi amanillah” roughly translates to “May “Allah” protect you.” In Arabic, “fi amanillah” is a phrase that roughly translates to “be with the safety of Allah” or “may Allah protect you.” “Fi” means in/within, “aman” means safety and security, and “Allah” is the Islamic God. Altogether, fi amanallah means to be safe within the hands of Allah. It is a deeply religious phrase that expresses faith, concern, and trust in Allah. [1] X Research source “Fi amanillah” is pronounced fee ah-man-al-uh . ”Fi amanillah” is a “dua,” which is a short prayer or invocation to Allah that is considered sacred in Muslim culture.

      "content": "Muslims use “Fi Amanillah” to wish someone well during a departure. Muslims mainly use “Fi Amanillah” when they’re parting from someone else, similar to how goodbye is used in English. If a Muslim is getting ready to travel or seeing their friend off as they embark on a new journey, they may say “Fi Amanillah” to wish them safe travels in the hands of Allah, especially if it’ll be a long time until they see them again. [3] X Research source Example: Man, I can’t believe you’ve been blessed with the opportunity to travel the country for the summer. I’m going to miss you! Fi amanillah!” Example: I’m proud of you for moving to your dream city. You’ve been working towards this for years. I hope that we can see each other again, one day. Fi amanillah! Avoid using this phrase unless you have a deep understanding of its religious significance. It can be culturally insensitive since you are invoking Allah, a god you don’t personally worship."

Use “Allah Hafiz” (which translates to “God protect you”) to express your thanks and return the sincerity. [4] X Research source A Friend: Safe travels to you, my friend. Fi Amanillah!” You: I appreciate it, my friend. Allah Hafiz, inshallah!” If you aren’t Muslim, avoid using a “dua” and instead say something like “I appreciate it! I hope all goes well for you, my friend.”"
