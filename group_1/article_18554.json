      "content": "Link your Instagram with your other social media accounts. You can do this from within Instagram's Settings menu. Adding a social media account (such as Facebook) to your Instagram's information will extend your posts' availability to social media users who don't use Instagram or don't know that you have an Instagram account. For example, linking your Facebook account to your Instagram account will alert any Instagram-using Facebook friends that you're on Instagram. As a result, they may decide to follow you. Once you've linked a social media account to your Instagram, you'll have the option of posting your Instagram photos to both Instagram and the linked account (e.g., Twitter) simultaneously. Doing this will increase the number of people who can see your photos."
