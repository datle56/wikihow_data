      "title": "Rashi is the equivalent of a moon sign.",
      "content": "Rashi is the equivalent of a moon sign. In Vedic astrology, the sky is depicted as a 360-degree circle divided into twelve sections (Rashis) corresponding to each zodiac sign. The term Rashi literally means \"collection,\" referring to the groups of stars that compose each section of the sky and subsequent zodiac sign. Therefore, your moon sign depends on which Rashi the moon was located at the time of your birth. Rashi is used to divine information about a person's actions, behaviors, and overall personality traits. A Moon sign (Rashi) carries greater weight in Vedic astrology than the sun. This is the reverse of western astrology, which considers a person's Sun sign to represent their core personality. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an online calculator to find your Rashi sign. Enter your birth date, time, and location into the calculator and ensure that your information is accurate.

      "title": "Rashi can also be determined using your name.",
      "content": "Rashi can also be determined using your name. In Hindu culture, names can be chosen based on a person's Rashi, with the first few letters corresponding to a particular sign. For instance, a name beginning with \"Gha\" would have the Mithuna Rashi—otherwise known as a Gemini moon sign. Consult a chart or use a name calculator to determine your Rashi sign using just your name. Try a site like http://www.astrosage.com/calculators/naamrashi.asp . Keep in mind that this method of finding your Rashi is only recommended if you don't know your birth information. Using your birth date is more accurate."

      "title": "Mithuna (Gemini), Tula (Libra), and Kumbha (Aquarius) are air Rashis.",
      "content": "Mithuna (Gemini), Tula (Libra), and Kumbha (Aquarius) are air Rashis. Air is the element that rules intellect and communication in Vedic astrology, making air signs among the most eloquent and clever Rashis. However, air Rashis also risk being too analytical, making them seem aloof to other people. Mithuna Rashi, or Gemini, is quick-witted and extremely social. They can make conversation with anyone but appear inconsistent because of their dual nature. Tula Rashi, or Libra, strives for balance in all things. They are friendly and diplomatic, skilled at negotiating and mediating to solve conflicts. Kumbha Rashi, or Aquarius, are freedom-loving air signs with lofty goals. They tend to put the well-being of society above their own needs, which means this sign can sometimes neglect their closest relationships."

      "content": "Karka (Cancer), Vruschika (Scorpio), and Meena (Pisces) are the water Rashis. Water is the element of emotions, making water Rashis more sensitive and intuitive than other signs. They can be oversensitive but have a strong desire to nurture and connect emotionally to the people they care about. Karka Rashi, or Cancer, is a kind and caring sign that tends to avoid conflict at all costs. They can get their feelings hurt easily but find solace in friends and family.

      "title": "Nakshatra is your birth star.",
      "content": "Nakshatra is your birth star. In Vedic astrology, your Nakshatra provides an analysis of where your mental energy is directed, how your mind works, your sense of intuition, and your emotional self. Each section of the sky is further subdivided into 27 lunar constellations—or Nakshatras. As a subdivision of Rashi, \"Nakshatra\" refers to the constellation that the moon crossed when you were born. Nakshatras are one of the aspects unique to Vedic astrology. Some astrologists recognize a 28th Nakshatra, Abhijit. However, to find your Nakshatra, use the default 27. Nakshatras are organized by temperament since the \"mood\" of a Nakshatra determines the attitude of anyone under that star."

      "title": "Use an online calculator to find your Nakshatra.",
      "content": "Use an online calculator to find your Nakshatra. A Nakshatra reading generally requires year, month, day, time (with AM/PM included), and city or town of your birth. The moon moves into a different Nakshatra every day, so your information should be as precise as possible. Finding a Nakshatra involves pinpointing the position of the Moon within one constellation at the time of your birth, so it's easier to let a calculator do the work! A site like https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/nakshatra-vedic-astrology-online-calculator or https://aaps.space/nakshatra-finder/ can help you find your Nakshatra. Just like Rashi, you can verify any information using your birth certificate or asking a parent."
