The obstacle in question can also directly tie into the riddle’s subject; that way, there’s a thematic pattern to the riddles and dungeon. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re throwing your players into a dungeon inhabited by a mad druid, you might have them answer a series of nature-themed riddles. If the players are navigating an underwater prison or talking to the ruler of an underwater city, you might choose riddles with aquatic-themed answers."

      "content": "Start with the answer and work backward from there. The trick to making a riddle for your D&D game is knowing what you want the subject of the riddle to be. Then, you can brainstorm and find creative ways to describe that answer—and turn those into a complete riddle. For example, try using: [6] X Research source Abstraction . Break the subject down into the most straightforward concepts possible. Metaphors . Use a metaphor (or simile) to describe the riddle’s subject. Vague descriptors . Describe a particular aspect of the subject in a way that isn’t totally obvious. Extra hints . Provide one or two details to point problem-solvers in the right direction, if necessary. For example, say your subject (and answer) is a pillow . Using abstraction, we might say it’s a soft comfort item for sleeping on. Then, we might use a metaphor and say it’s “a downy cloud.” A complete riddle might be: “A downy cloud, close enough to touch, but only with your head.”"
