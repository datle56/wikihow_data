In the field, while it may seem like common sense to buckle your safety belt, you'll find almost no farmers strapping themselves in. More likely than an accident in your tractor will be the need to quickly turn off the engine and hop out and do something that needs doing. The safety roll bar will help to prevent serious injury.

Alternatively, a finish mower can be put on the 3-point hitch. Belly mowers allow for a tighter turn radius and make it easier to mow around obstacles. Rear mowers are faster and easier to add and remove. Don't use finish mowers for brush mowing. They have rigid blades and can be damaged if they hit a stump, rock, or other immovable object."

Most Kubotas and other common smaller tractors have a wide variety of attachments, including buckets that will make your tractor into a kind of small-scale backhoe. You can haul brush and other junk around your property. [8] X Research source Follow proper driving safety when using a bucket. Never drive with the bucket in full \"up\" position, but always remember to raise it into the drive position so it's not dragging in the mud. Make sure to add some weight to the back of the tractor when lifting heavy loads with the front-end loader. This can be wheel weights, a ballast box, or an implement. If you want to dig in rocky soil, you will likely want to add bucket teeth. If you live in an area with frequent, heavy snowfalls, you may wish to replace the bucket with a snow plow. If your tractor does not currently have a loader, it is possible to add one, however, it is very expensive."

Both locations allow you to easily adjust the hitch to the height required for properly towing the trailer, and allow you to quickly attach/detach trailers without needing to jack the tongue. Installing the hitch on the rear is better for towing trailers long distances. It is also better for moving trailers with a lot of tongue weight. Putting a hitch on the front improves visibility if you need to push a trailer into a confined space."

      "title": "Watch your exhaust stack.",
      "content": "Watch your exhaust stack. Ideally, the tractor should emit very little to no smoke while it's in use. If smoke is coming out, pay attention to the color. Black smoke from the exhaust means the engine is getting more fuel than it can handle, and the extra fuel is not being completely burned. To resolve this, try either gearing down and increasing RPMs to reduce the load on the engine, or cleaning the air filter to ensure the engine is getting enough air. If the tractor is still smoky, one or more fuel injectors may be stuck open and need cleaning or replacement. Grey smoke consists of atomized diesel fuel that didn't get hot enough to burn. A small amount of grey smoke after a cold start is normal and should go away when the engine warms up. However, if the smoke persists when the engine is hot, there's a good chance one or more cylinders have low compression, often due to an exhaust valve being stuck open. Blue or white smoke is a sign of engine damage and should be addressed immediately. Blue smoke means the engine is burning oil, often due to worn rings. White smoke often means coolant is leaking into the engine due to a blown head gasket."

      "title": "Learn how to get extra traction.",
      "content": "Learn how to get extra traction. Sometimes you may have to operate the tractor in environments with poor traction, such as snow or deep mud, resulting in the machine becoming stuck. Many tractors have independent brakes for the left and right back wheels. Try applying some brake to the slipping wheel. Alternatively, try locking the rear differential (often a foot pedal activated by your right heel). This forces both back wheels to turn at the same speed, which can be useful if one wheel has traction and the other doesn't, or if you're driving across a slope. Be aware that doing this will make cornering difficult, as the tractor will want to drive in a straight line. Put the tractor in four-wheel-drive if equipped. This can be especially useful if you have a heavily loaded bucket. Make sure to turn off the four-wheel-drive on hard surfaces, as it will cause increased wear on the transmission."
