      "title": "Develop your dribble.",
      "content": "Develop your dribble. Before you attempt a crossover, make sure you've got a good handle on power dribbling and can maintain good ball control. A good crossover requires that you dribble effectively with both hands and can drive the lane from either direction."

      "title": "Fake to your dominant side.",
      "content": "Fake to your dominant side. To do an accurate-looking fake, push the ball to the side you're dribbling it in. Step the way you fake, and lean that way, too. Keep your eyes focused on the defender's hips and midsection, rather than the hands or legs, which the defense will use for distraction. When the hips turn in the direction you're faking, that's when you'll know you've faked effectively. [1] X Research source Also consider faking to your non-dominant side and crossing back over to your dominant hand and driving from your strong side. Keep the D guessing."

    {
      "title": "Hesitate.",
      "content": "Hesitate. This is the most important and convincing part of the crossover dribble. When the ball is up, some players will give a little hop, as if you're about to quickly drive to your dominant side. The ball will be in your palm at this moment, so really what you're doing is less about dribble and more about feigning motion. Watch videos of great crossover players to practice and imitate their hesitation move. Be careful not to palm the ball, or you'll be whistled for a dribbling violation."

      "title": "Stay low and wide.",
      "content": "Stay low and wide. Since the move involves bouncing the ball in between you and the defender, you'll want to make sure that you're low to the ground and that you're leading with the foot on your dominant side. [2] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021. Allen Iverson was great at keep the ball very far away from his body, but still totally controlling its bounce. You want to look as much like you're heading to that direction as possible. Don't open yourself up to a steal. [3] X Research source Don't look at the ball as you're doing the move. Keep your eyes on the defender and up-court, scanning for possible open spaces, open teammates, and opportunities."

      "title": "Cross the ball over.",
      "content": "Cross the ball over. When you've got the defensive player turned in the direction you want, quickly power dribble across your body, switching to your other hand. [4] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021. At this instant, you should be open to set for a jump shot or pass the ball to your teammate. It'll happen in an instant, so be ready to act as soon as you've completed the move. Practice this move a couple times to really get it perfect!"

    {
      "title": "Go behind your back.",
      "content": "Go behind your back. Instead of crossing over in between yourself and the defender, which can be tricky and dangerous, bounce the ball behind your back to shift directions. This uses your body to shield the ball, and can leave defenders in your dust. Practice dribbling behind your back before trying this move. You can't see where the ball is going, so it can be a difficult maneuver to pull off."

    {
      "title": "Dribble between your legs.",
      "content": "Dribble between your legs. Another effective shielding technique is to dribble the ball between your legs. Most typically, you'd dribble back through your non-dominant leg, catching the ball with that hand, but you can improvise in all sorts of ways. Try going back to front, from your non-dominant side to your dominant side as your hesitation maneuver, fake toward that dominant side and abruptly cross it back over between your legs again."

    {
      "title": "Double-up.",
      "content": "Double-up. If you've gone to the well one too many times and your defender catches you in the act by staying centered when you try your crossover, kick the ball back into your dominant hand and drive in the direction you tried to fake. This double crossover will often go so far as to trip up the defender, leading to this move's reputation as the \"ankle-breaker.\""

      "title": "Get creative.",
      "content": "Get creative. Try different combinations of between the legs and directional shifts to improve your offensive game. The simple crossover is really just a quick dribble, but when you've mastered that and can effectively crossover, your offensive game will only be limited by your imagination."
