      "title": "Use steam.",
      "content": "Use steam. Fill a one-quart pot with water. Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat and place on a heat resistant mat on a table. Drape a large, clean cotton towel over your head and then place your head over the steaming pot. Close your eyes and keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water so that you don't burn yourself. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts. Then reduce the inhales and exhales to two counts. Do this for 10 minutes or for as long as the water is still steaming. Try to blow your nose during and after the treatment. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Keep any children away from the pot while it is boiling and while it is steaming. Try to do a steaming treatment when there aren't any children around. You can use this technique frequently, up to every two hours. You can do a steam every two hours or as often as you like. Try placing your face over the steam coming from a hot tea or bowl of soup when you're at work or out and about. You can also add herbs and essential oils (one to two drops) to your steaming water. Spearmint or peppermint, thyme, sage, oregano, lavender, tea tree oil, and black lavender oil have either antibacterial, antifungal or antiseptic properties.

      "title": "Take hot showers.",
      "content": "Take hot showers. Taking a long, hot shower works very similarly to the steam treatments described above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is useful in clearing out blocked nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure. Try blowing your nose naturally. The heat and steam will help moisten and liquify the secretions in the sinuses to better facilitate their evacuation. [5] X Research source You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses. Warm a moist washcloth in the microwave for two to three minutes. Always take care not to burn yourself. [6] X Research source"

Using a bulb syringe purchased at the drugstore, irrigate your nostrils with this homemade saline rinse to help loosen and liquify your nasal secretions and relieve congestion. Try doing two sprays in each nostril.

      "title": "Try a neti pot.",
      "content": "Try a neti pot. A neti pot is miniature tea pot-shaped device that has become popular and gained support from the medical community as a way of cleansing your sinus passages. The neti pot works by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other. You simply fill the “teapot” with warm water and tilt your head to allow the water to pour into your right nostril and drain out the left. Then, do the other side. [9] X Research source It is important that you use water that is distilled, sterile, or already boiled and cooled. Always rinse the neti pot after each use. There have been some reports of rare amoebic infections via the neti pot. This can be avoided by using water that meets the above criteria.

      "title": "Use a humidifier.",
      "content": "Use a humidifier. To help improve the health of your sinuses, place a humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep. A humidifier produces steam and moist air, which will help clear out the nasal passages. [11] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source When your nasal passages are blocked, you need to focus on keeping your nasal passages and sinuses moist. Although many people think that if you have a runny nose, that dry air is the trick, dry air only further irritates the membranes in your nasal passage. Humidifiers are especially good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating. Even placing a hot water bottle near the ear may have a similar effect and help to draw out ear fluid."

      "title": "Drink fluids.",
      "content": "Drink fluids. Make sure that you drink lots of water (at least 8 full glasses a day) because this will thin out your mucus and can help prevent sinuses blockages, and thereby ease pressure. [12] X Research source Thinned out mucus is much more likely to drain. Whenever you feel the beginnings of sinus pressure, make a concerted effort to stay hydrated. [13] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Warm tea can also be useful because it has a similar effect to steam, and the warmth will allow the nasal secretions to flow out."

      "title": "Eat something spicy.",
      "content": "Eat something spicy. Hot salsa, peppers, hot wings, horseradish, and other spicy foods can get your nasal secretions flowing and thereby help to relieve the pressure in your sinuses. The nose is best blown when the secretions are moist and fluid. That is why remedies that generate this are effective. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For sushi lovers, try wasabi. The spicy topping will temporarily relieve sinus pressure and help clear your sinuses."

      "content": "Try acupressure or manual massage. Apply gentle pressure using your index and middle fingers, rotating in a circular motion over the forehead (frontal sinus) and the bridge of your nose and behind your eyes (orbital sinus) as well as under the eyes (maxillary sinus). Do this for several minutes and then blow your nose right after. Although some studies support the use of acupressure for sinus congestion, more research needs to be done to determine whether it is effective. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can also apply an oil, such as rosemary or peppermint, as you massage that may open up your sinus passages. Just don't let the oil get into your eyes. Consult with your doctor first before trying aromatherapy. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Exercise. Exercise is a natural decongestant. Getting your heart rate up just enough to break sweat can help clear your nasal secretions. If you can do some aerobic exercise, such as running or cycling for even 15 minutes, you may experience some relief. However, if you have a fever, you should avoid exercise. [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can even try moderate exercise, such as going for a brisk walk."

      "title": "Use a nasal steroid spray.",
      "content": "Use a nasal steroid spray. Intranasal steroids, such as fluticasone (Flonase) and triamcinolone (Nasacort), which is now available over-the-counter, work by reducing inflammation in the nose. Nasal steroid spray has the benefit of having no major side effects like those caused by many oral decongestants and antihistamines, such as drowsiness and dry mouth. Note, however, that it takes a few days for the steroid to build up to its full effect; this means that you will not experience immediate relief. [19] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you're using Flonase, the typical dosage is one spray per nostril twice daily. There are also other nasal steroids available with a prescription, such as mometasone Furoate (Nasonex). Potential side effects include indigestion, nausea, and headaches. New guidelines have suggested that intranasal steroids should be the first line of treatment for sinus congestion. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Take antihistamines.",
      "content": "Take antihistamines. Some people find antihistamines useful, particularly in longer-lasting occurrences of sinus infections, because they can ease nasal congestion. Oral antihistamines include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec) and Loratadine (Claritin). Note, however, that some older antihistamines can have serious side effects for the sinuses, including the drying up of the mucous membranes of the nasal tissue and thickening the secretions, and can also cause drowsiness. [21] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source [22] X Research source Take 25 milligrams of Benadryl every eight hours as needed for congestion. This drug may prove difficult to tolerate due to its side effects of drowsiness and “fogginess.\" Take 10 mg of Zyrtec once daily. Children older than six years of age may take this as well, in doses of 5-10 mg per day, depending on weight. Consult the instructions. This medication may cause some drowsiness. Take 10 mg of Claritin once daily. Second generation antihistamines such as this one have a much improved side effect profile and are less likely to cause drowsiness. [23] X Research source You could also try a prescription antihistamine nasal spray such as azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) or olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanase)."

      "title": "Use decongestants.",
      "content": "Use decongestants. Using an over-the-counter decongestant or medication can help relieve pressure in your sinuses by unblocking the nasal passages. You can get them in the form of nasal sprays or as oral medication and they can be purchased at most pharmacies. Consult your doctor before using any nasal decongestant sprays or oral decongestants and always be sure to follow any instructions on the label. [24] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source [25] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Nasal decongestant sprays should not be used for more than 3 days at a time. Longer term use has been linked to \"rebound\" swelling of the nasal passages. Oral decongestants, such as Sudafed or Bronkaid pills, however, can be used for up to two weeks without supervision by a physician. While the \"rebound\" swelling is less common with oral decongestants, some people experience palpitations or a rise in blood pressure. Avoid nasal sprays containing zinc. These have been linked to permanent loss of the sense of smell (though this is rare)."
