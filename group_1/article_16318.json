      "content": "Pretend to have a wrist injury for a small but effective fake injury. Faking an injury on your wrist is an easier injury to work around, because you’ll still be able to walk and get around normally. Depending on which hand you pretend to injure, you might just have to write or use silverware differently. Blame your fake wrist pain on an impact injury, caused by falling on your outstretched hand, which can cause sprains and strains. Pretend to have an arm injury. Faking an injury on your arm is an easier injury to work around. Depending on which arm you pretend to injure, you might just have to be excused from schoolwork or gym. This injury can last 2-3 weeks."

      "content": "Pretend to have a hurt shoulder for a longer recovery period. For a more serious injury, say that you’ve pulled your shoulder muscle. You can say the injury was caused by an awkward fall at home or while playing sports. The time it takes to heal a torn shoulder muscle varies, but you can make it up to 6 weeks if you need to.

      "title": "Wrap your wrist",
      "content": "Wrap your wrist or shoulder with an elastic bandage. Wrapping up your injured wrist or shoulder will give others a visual reminder of your injury. Get an roll of elastic bandage, which you can find at a drugstore, and wrap it tightly around either your wrist or your shoulder. Make sure that the wrap is snug, but not tight enough to cut off circulation. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To wrap your wrist, wind the bandage around your hand and thumb up to your mid-forearm. To wrap your shoulder, wrap the bandage once around the shoulder bone and muscle, then draw it across the back and around the opposite armpit and your chest. Repeat 1-2 more times."

      "title": "Ice your injury a few times a day.",
      "content": "Ice your injury a few times a day. Set an ice pack or a pack of frozen vegetables on your injury every 2-3 hours, for 15-20 minutes at a time. Do this throughout the day if you can, even at school or work. Wrap a thin towel around the ice to protect your skin from being irritated. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source During the day, you can store the ice in a freezer at work or in the nurse’s office if you’re at school. To securely wrap ice onto your shoulder, set the pack in place and secure it with a tight bandage wrap."

      "content": "Put your arm in a sling to make your injury more noticeable. You can get a simple cloth arm sling online or at most drugstores and large general stores. Use it for at least the first 2-3 weeks of the injury to show the seriousness of the injury. It also serves the dual purpose of reminding you not to use your “injured” arm!"

      "content": "Show some pain when you have to move your arm. If you do have to move your wrist or shoulder at any point, subtly show your pain by grimacing and moving slowly and carefully. Avoid using your arm as much as possible, though, to remind people of your injury. If you’re pretending to have hurt the wrist or shoulder on your writing hand, you’ll have to switch to your other hand for the duration of the “injury.”"

      "content": "Fake a sprained ankle for a 3-4 week injury. A sprained ankle is common and easy to explain and fake. Sprained ankles on average take about 6 weeks to heal, although you should keep your fake sprained ankle for a little less time, 3-4 weeks, so that others don’t get concerned. [4] X Research source You can say that you got the injury while exercising, or that you fell and turned your ankle badly."

      "content": "Pretend to have knee pain if you want a long-lasting fake injury. Faking knee pain can have the advantage of lasting as long as you want, since knee pain can be chronic or can come and go. You can blame it on bad genes or past sporting injuries from sports like Alpine skiing, soccer, or running. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you want it to last for just a set amount of time, say you aggravated your knee by jogging or walking a long distance and that it should settle down soon."

If you’re faking a new injury, tell people that you need to stay off your feet as much as possible for the first 4-5 days. Whether you’re at school, at work, or at home, sit down as much as you can and keep your leg or knee elevated on a chair or box. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Explain that this will help alleviate swelling.

      "content": "Wrap a compression bandage around the injury. Get an elastic bandage, like ACE wrap, and wrap it snugly around your ankle or knee. This is used to compress your injury and keep the swelling down, and will be an obvious sign that you’re injured. Keep your foot or knee bare by wearing shorts or no shoes, as this will let others see your bandage. Say that you have to do this because pants and shoes are too tight over the injury. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure the bandage isn’t tight enough to cut off circulation.

Ice your ankle or knee for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours, for at least the first week of the injury. Ice is a common at-home treatment for pain and inflammation, and is a tell-tale sign of injury. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can use a frozen ice pack, or a bag of frozen peas or corn.

      "content": "Walk with crutches for 1-2 weeks to show the extent of the injury. Hobbling around on crutches for a few weeks will definitely convince others that you’ve been injured. If you’re faking an ankle sprain, keep your foot off the ground and hop forward on your other foot and the crutches. If you’re faking a knee injury, place your foot lightly on the ground but lean most of your weight on your other foot and the crutches. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can buy crutches at most large general stores, or ask to borrow them from a friend or family member who’s been injured.

Lean all of your weight on your good leg and lightly press off of your injured leg to propel yourself forward. Spend more time on the good leg and use your bad leg for only a quick, gentle push. [10] X Research source Make facial expression to show you’re in some pain and walk very slowly. You won’t be able to comfortably limp for longer than a couple days, so if this is your only option, make your fake injury a mild one, like a slightly sprained ankle."

      "content": "Avoid twisting or putting weight on your “injury.” Whether you’re limping, using crutches, or moving around as you sit, make sure to move your injured ankle or knee very carefully. Don’t put any weight on it or twist it, as that would aggravate a real injury. If you do accidentally walk on it or move it suddenly, make a noise like you’re in pain."

Big injuries like broken legs or torn ACLs often require casts, expensive knee braces, and many trips to the doctor, all of which are hard to accurately fake.

      "content": "Do not fake an injury in order to sue someone. Some people fake injuries to gain disability benefits or sue a company they dislike. This is considered fraud, and if caught, you can end up in jail. Faking an injury to get out of work or school is one thing, but doing so for money is illegal."

      "content": "Fake a mild concussion to avoid showing physical symptoms. The advantage of faking a mild concussion is that you won’t have to limp or use crutches or a sling like you would with a leg or arm injury. Instead, you’ll have to show your injury through the way you talk and react to certain things. Faking a concussion will also mean that you’ll be spending a lot of time by yourself as you pretend to go through the recovery process."

Doctors often recommend that people suffering from a concussion take time off from work or school, or that they shorten their school or workdays. Explain this to your employer or your school and ask for some time off. If you can’t take full days off, work for only half a day or take breaks throughout the day.

If you’ve decided that your fake injury will be a sprain or strain to your ankle, knee, wrist, or shoulder, especially one caused by an impact, adding a fake bruise will make the injury even more believable.

Stage makeup will create the most realistic bruise, but you can also use basic makeup in a pinch. Some costume stores offer \"bruise wheels,\" which contain all the eyeshadow colors you'll need to make a convincing bruise. Cream-based eyeshadows work better than powder-based ones, but either can be used."

To ensure it stays put, brush a tiny bit of powder on the bruise. Then, use a setting spray to cement it all in place. [19] X Research source Avoid touching the bruise throughout the day.
