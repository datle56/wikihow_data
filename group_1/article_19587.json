Monitor your symptoms and if you experience any of the following symptoms, see a doctor immediately: Absence of cold or flu symptoms Difficulty swallowing or breathing Fever over 101 °F (38.3 °C) Swollen tonsils Swollen lymph nodes (in your neck) Bright red throat or dark red spots White or yellow film or spots in your throat You may not have strep throat if you have a cough and don't have swollen lymph nodes, a fever, or inflamed tonsils.

If the pus pockets in your throat are affecting the tonsils, and if the infection is severe, or reoccurring too often, surgical intervention may be required. You may be eligible for a tonsillectomy if you've had 7 or more confirmed cases of strep in the past year, at least 5 episodes of strep each of the past 2 years, or 3 documented cases of strep per year for the past 3 years. A tonsillectomy is a relatively simple procedure, but an abscess around the tonsils may also be treated by a simpler surgery to drain the abscess. You will need to discuss your options with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your situation."
