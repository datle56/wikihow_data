      "content": "Choose yellow or browning bananas to stimulate bowel movements. Unripe, green bananas have lots of tannins and resistant starch that bind your waste together and make it harder to pass. As they ripen, the tannins and starch become soluble sugars and fiber, which regulate healthy bowel movements . [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For most people, a banana takes about 30 minutes to fully digest. [2] X Research source Eat unripe, green bananas to help with diarrhea or loose stool."

      "title": "Consume healthy fats or protein along with a banana in the morning.",
      "content": "Consume healthy fats or protein along with a banana in the morning. A breakfast banana on an empty stomach will stimulate a bowel movement, but the influx of sugars and acid can lead to an upset stomach or a sugar crash later. Eat a healthy fat like peanut butter or a light protein like yogurt with your banana to counter these side effects. [3] X Research source The fats and protein slow the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, which leads to more stable energy and blood sugar levels throughout the day. Try eating a crushed banana mixed with honey along with your breakfast to stimulate your digestive system. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Eat a yellow banana after your last meal of the day. The soluble fiber from the banana will accompany your meal while it digests, making it easier to pass that night or in the morning. Plus, the extra banana will make you feel full and prevent nighttime snacking. [5] X Research source Alternatively, eat a banana right before you go to bed to help move your evening meal through your digestive system in the morning."

      "content": "Enjoy a fiber-rich banana smoothie at any time to stimulate your bowels. Smoothies are a quick and tasty way to load up on nutritious foods that aid digestion. Bananas are especially great in smoothies because of their sweet flavor and easy blendability. Whip up a smoothie if you’re feeling backed up: [6] X Research source Chocolate-Banana Protein Smoothie: blend 1 frozen banana, 0.5 cups (64 g) cooked red lentils, 0.5 cups (120 mL) nonfat milk, 2 teaspoons (5.7 g) unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) pure maple syrup until smooth. [7] X Research source Pineapple Green Smoothie: blend 1 frozen banana, 0.5 cups (120 mL) unsweetened almond milk, 0.33 cups (78 mL) nonfat plain Greek yogurt, 1 cup (128 g) baby spinach, 0.5 cups (64 g) frozen pineapple chunks, 1 tablespoon (14.3 g) chia seeds, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) pure maple syrup or honey (optional). [8] X Research source Spinach Avocado Smoothie: blend 1 frozen banana, 1 cup (240 mL) nonfat plain yogurt, 1 cup (128 g) fresh spinach, ¼ avocado, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) water, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) honey.

      "content": "Aim to eat 1-3 bananas every day to improve your overall gut health. Bananas contain prebiotics that nourish the good bacteria in your digestive tract, leading to a healthier microbiome with regular consumption. [10] X Research source When your gut is happy, your bowel movements become more regular and easier to pass. Signs of an unhealthy gut include an upset stomach (bloating, constipation, gas), trouble sleeping, cravings for sugary foods, or frequent mood changes. Regularly eating more than 2-3 bananas a day can cause constipation (if they’re unripe), bloating (if they’re ripe), sleepiness, or a nutrient imbalance. [11] X Research source Bananas are a good source of plant fiber and are low-fat, making them a good food to soothe leaky gut syndrome (so are other fruits and veggies, too). [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Bananas may have some antibacterial qualities and could also absorb acid in the stomach."

      "content": "Drink banana tea to soothe and prevent bloating. The potassium in banana tea helps regulate the sodium levels in your body and reverse salt-induced bloating, making your stomach and bowels feel better. Add a banana (peel on with the ends chopped off) to a pot of 3 cups (710 mL) of boiling water and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes. [13] X Research source Remove the banana and add cinnamon and honey before drinking. Alternatively, simmer a peeled banana for 5-10 minutes. Besides bloating relief , banana tea also promotes good sleep, heart health, and mood improvements."

      "content": "Consume your normal calorie intake’s worth of bananas for one day. Only eat ripe, yellow bananas throughout the day to reboot your digestive tract and flush your bowels. Eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re full to avoid under or over eating. Try not to add spices or other foods if you can help it. [14] X Research source You need a variety of nutrients to stay healthy, so only cleanse for one day (or a weekend at most). An extended \"mono\" diet is bad for your health. [15] X Research source Alternatively, consider an all-banana breakfast followed by your normal diet for the rest of the day. Bananas are a great detox food. The pectin in them binds toxic compounds in your blood and carries them out through urine and waste. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Add optional greens for nutrients and variety. Incorporate lettuce, arugula, celery, or microgreens into your banana diet to help keep you full, supply more nutrients, and break up the monotony of only eating bananas. Plus, the crunch of the greens provides a nice texture contrast to the bananas. [17] X Research source If the bananas-only diet is driving you bananas, consider also adding coconut water or cinnamon to spice things up."

      "content": "Drink lots of water to stay hydrated and support your digestion. On average, men need 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of water per day and women need 11.5 cups (2.7 liters). Drink water with each meal, between meals, and whenever you feel thirsty to make sure you’re properly hydrated while you detox. [18] X Research source The dramatic change in diet can alter how much water you get from the food you eat. Drink more than you think you need to compensate. You’ll know you’re well-hydrated when you don’t feel thirsty often and your urine is clear or pale yellow."
