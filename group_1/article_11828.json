      "title": "Talk to your boss.",
      "content": "Talk to your boss. If your boss doesn’t respond to you, try talking with them again in person. Be upfront in a polite and assertive manner and bring along your written summary of the promise. Keep it factual, thank the boss for letting you have the opportunity, and be genuine about how the experience has readied you for the promised promotion, bonus, job change, etc. Send another follow-up email after this talk summarizing your conversation.

      "title": "Make it about you.",
      "content": "Make it about you. Getting your boss to meet your needs and fulfill his/her promises will be easier when you make it about you, rather than questioning his/her competence or integrity. Be specific about what you need from your boss in order to get the promise fulfilled. Consider if you need more helpful feedback, assistance from another colleague, etc. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, if you were offered a promotion but it hasn’t gone through yet, you can say, “I want to get that promotion we agreed on and I need your help to do that. Give me input on what I’m doing right or what other direction I should head in with this position to get me to that promotion.”"

    {
      "title": "Check in frequently.",
      "content": "Check in frequently. Once you’ve made the promise and you’ve asked for feedback and help from your boss to get it fulfilled, check back in with your boss on a weekly basis. Implement the feedback your boss has given you and update them on the progress you make toward that promotion (or whatever it is) every week. After a month or two has passed and you’ve fulfilled all of your boss’ expectations, it’s time to meet with them again and get them to re-evaluate their promise. You can say, “We’ve been discussing a promotion since March and I feel I’ve been on track for that by meeting and exceeding goals and objectives for the last three months. I’d like to know what else I should do and how we’re going to move forward with the promotion now.” Keep in mind to keep a timeline and record of all your check-ins with your boss, preferably via email in case you need to consult Human Resources later."

[3] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021. While it may be tempting to get mad, shout, and threaten to quit after you’ve worked hard at your job, this could make the situation worse.

[4] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021. This holds them accountable and might make them feel guilty for their actions. You can say, “I feel unhappy that I haven’t been promoted by now. I feel like I’ve worked hard toward that goal and met your expectations.”"

      "title": "Give a reminder in writing.",
      "content": "Give a reminder in writing. Send your boss a gentle reminder of the promise they made you. Be brief and simply request more information, rather than accusing or getting angry. The best way is to send a quick e-mail, but be mindful that your boss may not get back to you right away. [5] X Research source You can say, “I know you’ve been really busy at work the last few months, but I wanted to touch base because I haven’t heard anything about my promised promotion since we talked on March 29, 2016. I’d appreciate an update about it soon.”"

      "content": "Get help. If your boss still doesn’t respond to you or help you, go to his superiors or consult Human Resources for help. However, proceed with caution. Your boss and his superiors could feel threatened. Try to show them the pattern of broken promises that has emerged over time with your boss. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source You can: Schedule a one-on-one meeting with your boss' superior (without your boss present) or the Human Resources department.

If you’ve done everything you can to hold up your end of the bargain and your boss still isn’t following through on his/her promise, consider leaving that position. Evaluate how you’re really feeling about your job at this point and if you can continue to work with your boss, knowing they may not fulfill this promise or others. If this cycle just keeps on continuing and you keep feeling used, it is probably time to move on to a different company where you will get that raise, promotion, etc. [7] X Expert Source Meredith Walters, MBA Certified Career Coach Expert Interview. 22 November 2019."

Get clarification on what they need from you (higher productivity, more work hours, attending more trainings) in order to get that promotion or raise. Clarify with your boss when they expect to be able to fulfill the promise. [8] X Research source Keep in mind it is best to clarify expectations in-person at the time the promise is made.

      "content": "Be careful about reacting too soon. If the promise has not been delivered according to your expectations, be careful before you react. Make sure your reaction is justified by evaluating if you're being impatient. Take a look at your calendar to determine if a reasonable amount of time has passed from when your boss made the promise. [9] X Research source Look back over what you wrote down about the promise and ensure you've fulfilled every requirement your boss asked you to before confronting your boss. Don't avoid reacting and confronting forever! If you're the type of person who always lets things slide or hopes for the best, your boss could take advantage of you by never delivering the promise.

There could be a valid reason outside your control, or even your boss' control, that has left the promise undelivered. Look through your company manual, observe day-to-day practices, or consult with Human Resources for information you might not have received since the promise was first made. Some questions you might ask include: [11] X Research source Has your company been restructured, downsized, or bought out? Has your boss become ill or taken a leave of absence? Has there been in a change in how long it typically takes to get a policy changed, a promotion, or a raise?
