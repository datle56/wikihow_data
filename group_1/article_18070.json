      "content": "\"Foreboding joy\" refers to the anxious feelings that can accompany a happy moment. To illustrate this, researcher Brené Brown describes how she used to feel an intense wave of love and happiness while watching her children sleep. This joy would quickly transform into terror as she started imagining tragedies taking her children from her. [1] X Research source This complicated mix of happiness and fear is foreboding joy."

      "content": "We fear joy because it makes us feel extremely vulnerable. In fact, Brown calls joy “the most terrifying, difficult emotion that we experience as humans.” [2] X Research source Truly experiencing joy means accepting that it is fleeting and precious, highlights times when we haven't had that joy, and reminds us that it’s possible to lose the ones you love. It takes courage and vulnerability to know all of this and lean into joy anyway, which is why joy can be such a scary emotion."

      "content": "Waiting for the other shoe to drop When everything’s going well in your life, it’s common to experience anxiety, rather than gratitude. You might feel like your good luck can’t possibly continue, and the other shoe is bound to drop at some point. [3] X Research source If you find yourself bracing for misfortune, even when everything seems to be going perfectly, you might be experiencing foreboding joy. Here are a few more examples: Worrying that something will go wrong in your personal life because you’re thriving in your career, and it seems unlikely to have good luck in both areas. Feeling low-level anxiety at all times and having an impending sense of doom, even though nothing is wrong with your relationship, career, or personal life."

      "content": "Catastrophizing or imagining the worst-case scenario When you’re falling in love, you imagine your partner leaving or breaking your trust. When you start your dream job, you picture yourself failing or getting fired. When you’re spending time with loved ones, you think about the ways you could lose them. Brown calls this “dress rehearsing tragedy.” [4] X Research source If you can’t stop imagining the worst-case scenarios during joyful moments, you’re likely dealing with foreboding joy."

      "title": "Not letting yourself fully experience happiness",
      "content": "Not letting yourself fully experience happiness Foreboding joy can also cause you to numb yourself because you’re trying to avoid disappointment if things don’t work out. [5] X Research source Instead of leaning into the excitement of spending time with loved ones or doing your favorite things, you dampen your feelings and keep joy at arm’s length. If this sounds like you, you might struggle with foreboding joy. Here are some examples of what this might look like: Being aloof toward your romantic partner because you’re afraid of being hurt if they leave you. Staying distant or disengaged around your children because you’re mentally preparing yourself for the pain of losing them."

This means more than simply feeling grateful or having a thankful attitude. [6] X Research source Instead, it involves incorporating tangible, observable practices into your daily routine. [7] X Research source Here are some ways to actively practice gratitude in your life: Start a gratitude journal . When you plan to write down the things you’re grateful for, you end up looking for these things more in your daily life. [8] X Research source Pick a specific time each day to state one thing you’re grateful for out loud. [9] X Research source Do this each morning when you wake up, each night before bed, or any time throughout the day that works for your schedule! Express gratitude to the people around you. If you live with family or roommates, go around the dinner table each night and have each person share something they’re grateful for.

In fact, Brown calls joy the most vulnerable of all human emotions. [14] X Research source Even though it can be tough to cultivate vulnerability , it's also incredibly rewarding in the end. Rethink what it means to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is not a weakness. In fact, Brown calls it “our most accurate measurement of courage.” [15] X Research source Vulnerability requires opening yourself up to the possibility of pain, which takes great strength.

For example, when Brown starts imagining worst-case scenarios, she says “I am feeling vulnerable” out loud to cut off the anxiety spiral. [18] X Research source You can also try deep breathing to interrupt your fear response and calm anxieties. [19] X Research source Find a quiet place to sit or to lie down, and close your eyes. Then, start to take slow, deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose, letting the air fill your lungs and expand your abdomen. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth. While you breathe deeply, imagine things going well. Picture happy outcomes, rather than tragic ones. Repeat a comforting and grounding phrase, like “Everything is okay,” or “I am grateful for what I have,” in your mind.
