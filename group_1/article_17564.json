      "content": "Position your router antennas upward. If your router has antennas, repositioning them can help create a better signal. Wi-Fi signals mainly emit horizontally out of the sides of the antennas. Position them so that they’re vertical, at a right angle to the ground. If you’re having connection issues on a different floor of your home, try different antenna angles for better coverage."

      "title": "Upgrade your router.",
      "content": "Upgrade your router. Routers with antennas have better range and connectivity, which could resolve slow or inconsistent connections. Make sure to check what speed your router is rated for. This is typically labeled AC####, where the four numbers represent the speed in megabits per second (mbps). Get a router that matches or exceeds your internet plan’s mbps."

      "content": "Try using Ethernet . Connecting your computer or console to your router or modem via an Ethernet cable will both speed up your Internet when it's working and help determine whether the issue is with your Internet or your equipment. If your computer is able to connect to the Internet while connected directly to the router, your computer's wireless reception is most likely the problem. If your computer is able to connect to the Internet while connected directly to the modem, then the issue is likely cause by your router. If you cannot connect to the internet while connected directly to your modem, there is something wrong with the modem or with your internet service in general. You'll need to get in touch with your internet service provider's technical support line to fix modem-related issues."
