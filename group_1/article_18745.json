      "content": "Mining is the most consistent method of getting Diamonds. You can purchase a Mini-Mine on each main island, and each Mini-Mine will produce 1 Diamond every 24 hours—which means you can collect 15 Diamonds per day from Mini-Mines. [1] X Research source If you have any Mirror Islands unlocked, you can place a mine on them too. If you have mines on all Mirror and main islands, you can collect 20 Diamonds per day. Set aside some time each day to collect your Diamonds. As the mines take 24 hours to generate a new Diamond, staying consistent with your Diamond collection time maximizes the amount of Diamonds you can collect. If you've ever made an in-app purchase, you can upgrade your Mini-Mine on Plant Island and Mirror Plant Island to a Maximum Mine. Each Maximum Mine generates 2 Diamonds every 12 hours. If you have Mini-Mines on every island and have upgraded your Plant Island and Mirror Plant Island mines to Maximum Mines, you can collect 26 Diamonds per day, or 182 Diamonds per week."

You will get your 5 Diamonds instantly, and your friend will get their Diamonds in two to three days. Give out your friend code to others and ask that they input you as a referral. Always be honest and let the other user know they will only get 5 Diamonds for putting you as a referral. If you haven't gotten your Diamonds and you know someone used your referral code, go to Options > Claim Rewards . Users share their referral codes on the My Singing Monsters Wiki as well as in friend code megathreads in the My Singing Monsters Reddit. Special codes created by the game can also be filled under this umbrella. Codes can potentially give 5 free diamonds. Only one code can be redeemed per account."

      "content": "Play the Spin Wheel or Memory Game once per day. The Spin Wheel and Memory Game are both mini-games that allow you to win Diamonds. While you can play both games multiple times per day, some users state that these games have a hidden timer that limits the rewards you can get from them. Playing the Spin Wheel is recommended, as you have a higher chance of getting Diamonds (around 5 Diamonds per week unless you watch an ad to spin again, which increases your output to 10 Diamonds per week). If you opt to play the Memory Game, play the first level, collect your rewards, and quit. While you can potentially get 1,000 Diamonds from clearing all 6 levels, your chances of winning this prize are very low compared to how much time you need to invest in playing the game."

Wublins have a chance of generating Diamonds every 6 to 12 hours, and Celestials generate about 0.2 Diamonds per day. Getting Wublins and Celestials are difficult, so farming Diamonds from these monsters is considered advanced and is best done once you're in the late-game. [8] X Research source Wublins can be farmed by placing them on Wublin Island. You can place as many Wublins as you can fit on this island, and with an optimal grid layout and strategy you can collect approximately 240 Diamonds per week from them. You can have a maximum of 60 Celestials, as there are 12 types and you can have 5 of each kind on Celestial Island. You can collect about 84 Diamonds per week from a Celestial farm with all 60 monsters, but getting all of these monsters is difficult due to the fact that you can only purchase them for Diamonds (though you do get a discount if purchasing in their associated month).
