      "content": "Cleanse your skin at least once a day. Use products suitable for your skin type and remember, you may need a different product for the skin on your face and the skin on your body. Use a mild, gentle cleanser and apply moisturizer after washing. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated too. Being well hydrated is good for both the health and appearance of your skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Soap-free facial or body wash and water offer one easy way to cleanse your skin. Alternatively, choose a specially formulated facial cleanser from your favorite brand range. Follow the instructions it provides. Always use a soft sponge or face cloth to avoid harming your delicate facial skin. Apply cleanser with cotton wool, if preferred. If your skin is sensitive, try to limit showering to every other day or every few days. This allows your natural oils nourish your skin. Showering too much with sensitive skin can cause irritation."

Some homemade examples include sugar scrub and honey and sugar scrub but there are many more varieties possible. Purchase exfoliating shower/bath gloves or, an exfoliating scrub sponge. If you want to make your own, see How to handcraft an organic loofah. Run the gloves or scrub sponge up and down your legs gently to lift off dead particles and dirt. Also do your torso and back. Do this under the running water of the shower or in the bath's water. Don't press hard; it should feel pleasant. Do not use this heavy duty scrub on your face (see above instead). Avoid scrubbing sensitive areas such as nipples and genitals.

Use a product aimed at sensitive skin if you suffer from sensitive skin. Even if you do not have sensitive skin, such a product can often help your skin to feel even softer than usual.
