A pardon is a gesture of forgiveness that restores certain rights. Pardons are becoming increasingly rare. In some states like California, individuals with criminal records may apply for a direct pardon. You can get applications for direct pardon’s from their state governor’s office. In other states, like Arkansas, applications are available online."
