If going braless is an everyday affair, consider investing in silicone nipple covers. Much like pasties, these will cover your nipple and stay on with an adhesive. However, rather than tossing these in the trash when you’re done, you can wash and reuse them many times. Silicone covers are a little pricier than pasties, but some brands can be worn up to 100 times. The thicker material of silicon will provide more thorough coverage, but also can be more noticeable under some clothing."
