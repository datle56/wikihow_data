Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft no longer requires that Certificate of Authenticity stickers be placed on PCs that come pre-installed with Windows 8. [1] X Research source However, some PC manufacturers place their own stickers on certain models, and these stickers may contain the 25-character product key. If you have a desktop PC, look for a sticker somewhere on the tower (not the monitor/screen). If you're using a laptop, check the bottom of the unit or underneath the battery cover. If you are able to log in to Windows 8, you can use any of the other methods to quickly pull up your product key. The product key is 5 sets of 5 characters separated by hyphens (e.g, XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX)."
