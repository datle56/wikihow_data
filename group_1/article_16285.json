      "content": "Check to see if the price is significantly higher or lower than retail. Before you decide to buy a PS5, make sure the price is within the range of $400 to $700. If you purchase the PS5 Slim, it should be closer to $400. If you purchase the PS5 Pro, it should be closer to $700. If the PS5 is significantly lower or higher than $400 and $700, respectively, then the console might be fake."

      "content": "Check the box and serial number for misspellings and incorrect info. Look at your PS5’s packaging and examine both the material of the box, the information printed on it, and the included serial number. If the material is durable and consistent and there are no errors in the text on the box, chances are the PS5 is real. However, you should still contact Playstation Support to see if the serial number is valid. If PlayStation Support doesn’t recognize the number, the material is inconsistent, and the console is unusually light with misspelled packaging, chances are it’s fake."

      "content": "Check to see if the console is durable or has hardware differences. If your console is significantly lighter than other consoles you’ve owned, that’s not a good sign. The PS5 weighs 9.9lbs (4.5kg), so if the console you receive is lighter or heavier, chances are the PS5 is fake. [1] X Research source If the console is heavy and its material is durable and consistent all-around, then you’ve got the real deal in your hands. Make sure you’re not getting your hands on the GameStation 5, which is a popular knockoff of the PS5 that's smaller and features hundreds of pre-downloaded games. [2] X Research source"

If your cooling system doesn’t work properly or makes weird noises fresh out of the box, that’s a strong indicator that the console is fake. Real PS5s have smooth, quiet cooling systems. A faulty cooling system can cause overheating, which can lead to poorer performance and frequent shutdowns. [5] X Research source"

Unless it’s from Sony or a retailer like GameStop or Walmart, make sure the seller has sold verified PS5s in the past with customer reviews to back it up. If the price is significantly higher or lower than what PS5s usually go for, you might be looking at a fake console. Depending on who you buy from, the PS5 Slim ranges from $400 to $500 and the PS5 Pro ranges from $500 to $700. [8] X Research source"

Pull up a photo of the official game cover art and compare it with the game you suspect is counterfeit if you’re struggling to figure out whether or not the game is fake. [9] X Research source If you’ve already bought and inserted a game you suspect to be fake into your PS5, listen for loud, clunky noises to determine its authenticity. If your PS5 displays the message “Can’t recognize disk,” take the disk out and clean it. [10] X Research source If it still isn’t recognized and there's no visible damage, the game might be fake. If that’s the case, take it back to where you bought it and ask for a refund."
