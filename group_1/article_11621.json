      "title": "Dattatreya is an ancient Hindu deity.",
      "content": "Dattatreya is an ancient Hindu deity. He’s said to be an incarnation of the 3 major gods of the Hindu trinity—Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. Some traditions say he’s closely associated with Shiva, the destroyer of evil, while others say he’s an avatar of Vishnu, the supreme god. In many traditions, Dattatreya is said to have overcome worldly affairs like desire, and his presence stays on Earth to grant material desires and to offer guidance to his followers. [1] X Research source Dattatreya’s name comes from the words “datta,” meaning “given,” and the name “Atri,” who is Dattatreya’s father. So altogether, his name means “given to Atri.” Dattatreya is mysterious, in that there are many conflicting accounts of his life and status as a god, and these accounts often vary by tradition."

      "content": "Dattatreya is depicted with 3 heads and 6 arms. Each head and set of arms corresponds to one of the gods of the trinity which Dattatreya represents—Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. In each hand, he holds one of the trinity’s tools: the conch and wheel (or discus) of Vishnu, the mace and trident of Shiva, and the water pot and begging bowl of Brahma. [2] X Research source The conch represents the expansion of consciousness, while the wheel represents time. The mace controls pride, while the trident represents 3 energies within the body. The water pot carries life, while the begging bowl encourages us to give up our vices."

Together, the two had 3 sons in total: Dattatreya, Durvasa, and Chandra. [4] X Research source Like most teachings about Dattatreya, there are many different versions of his birth story. Some say he was given in reward for Anasuya’s devotion, others say that he was a reward after Anasuya rescued the 3 gods of the trinity."

In this common version of the story, the 3 gods appeared to Anasuya and asked her to offer them alms immediately, and while naked. Anasuya, being chaste, turned the gods into innocent children before she did as they said, protecting her honor. [5] X Research source When the gods’ wives got worried and asked Anasuya to turn them back, Anasuya agreed, and the gods rewarded her with a son in their image, Dattatreya."

In this version of the story, a leper was cursed to die at sunrise, and his wife, Sandili, warded off the curse by causing the sun to never rise. The trinity then visited Anasuya for help, since she was so pious, and Anasuya spoke with Sandili and bartered a deal in which the sun would rise and the leper would not be harmed. [6] X Research source As thanks, the trinity offered Anasuya a gift. She requested that each of them be born to her, and she received Dattatreya."

Each being is distracted by the material world, but has the potential to realize their true nature and reunite with the supreme being in a state of truth, consciousness, and bliss. [7] X Research source To reunite, each being must become aware that the material world is temporary, and detach themself from it, and also acknowledge that only truth is permanent."
