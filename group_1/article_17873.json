      "content": "Remember to look into the camera, not at the screen. Eye contact is a huge factor in flirting. Whenever you can, try to glance at your webcam or camera so it looks like you’re locking eyes with him. You don’t have to do it the entire video chat— that can be a little exhausting— but a glance here and there can really amp up your conversation. [1] X Research source Try to lock eyes when he’s talking so he knows that you’re really interested in what he has to say."

      "title": "Pay him some compliments.",
      "content": "Pay him some compliments. What’s something you really like about him? It could be about his appearance, his personality, or even something you can spot in the background. Compliments tend to put people at ease, and it’s a nice way to let him know that you might like him as more than just a friend. Keegan suggests complimenting based on his personality and interests, such as: [2] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. “Wow, you speak really eloquently.” “You have excellent style!” “I love how kindly you treat everyone.” “You’re such a good listener.”"

      "title": "Ask follow-up questions.",
      "content": "Ask follow-up questions. When you two start chatting, be really interested in what he says. Practice active listening by making eye contact— looking into the camera,like we discussed— and asking him to elaborate on his stories. For instance, if he told you that he had an important meeting today, you might ask, “How do you think it went?” If he’s explaining that he just finished working on a big project, you could say, “Oh, cool! What’s your project about?” [3] X Research source Not only is this a good flirting technique, it can help you keep the conversation going to avoid any awkward pauses. Keegan says that asking questions is what essential for a positive dating experience: “Dating is about connecting with new people, yes, but you're also learning about them.” [4] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021."

      "content": "Laugh or giggle at his jokes. Let him know you think he’s funny and fun to be around. If he makes a joke, laugh at it if you genuinely think it’s funny. Tell him that he’s hilarious to give him a compliment and keep up your flirty banter. Laughter shows appreciation, which Diamond believes to be one of the best “lubricants of relationships.” She adds, “It's one of the things that really helps a relationship continue in a positive way, allowing the love to keep blossoming.” [5] X Expert Source Maya Diamond, MA Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. . [6] X Research source Since you aren’t there in person with him, make your laugh really apparent. A small chuckle won’t be as noticeable as a belly laugh. However, make sure your laugh is genuine, as a fake laugh could come across a little strange over video chat."

      "title": "Bite your lip.",
      "content": "Bite your lip. Biting your lip is an instant sign that you’re into him. Even if it’s just for a second, make eye contact by looking into the camera and bite down on your lower lip. Give him a little smile and then laugh, like you didn’t even know what you were doing. [7] X Research source This is a good move to pull during any pauses in the conversation. Swiping on some lip balm or lip gloss is a cute way to draw attention to your lips during the video chat."

    {
      "title": "Nod along to what he says.",
      "content": "Nod along to what he says. It’s encouraging and shows you like talking to him. As you two chat, nod your head and say “mhm” or “uh-huh” to keep him talking. It’s a subtle way to flirt, but it’s also just polite! [8] X Research source You don’t have to nod the entire time— that feels excessive— but you can try it when he says something you really agree with."

      "title": "Tilt your head to the side.",
      "content": "Tilt your head to the side. It’s an endearing mannerism that looks super cute, even over video call. When you’re asking a question or confused about something, try tilting your head just slightly. You can bite your lip and smile at the same time for a fun, flirty gesture. [9] X Research source You could also try twirling your hair at the same time. All of these small body language cues will let him know you’re enjoying your virtual date!"

      "content": "Try playing a game. A fun activity can really bring you two closer together, even over video. Head over to an online multiplayer game, like Exploding Kittens , Jackbox Games , or Heads Up . Tell your crush that whoever wins has to buy the other person dinner when you two meet up in person. You can get to know each other with a fun activity that doesn’t require a ton of effort. [10] X Research source If you both have consoles, you could also play a multiplayer video game together.

      "content": "Go for a date night look. Although your date may only see you from the bust up, it’s still important to look your best. Keep your comfy pajama pants on, but put on a flattering top, apply some mascara and lip gloss, and do your hair. Although the true extent of your beauty, style, and charms may be limited by pixels, your date will appreciate the effort no matter what, which should start you two off on the right foot! [11] X Research source Concealer is the original smoothing filter, so feel free to apply as needed to blemishes to achieve a clear complexion. Shower right before your video call so you can look and feel refreshed. Bright colors pop the most on camera, so plan your outfit accordingly!"

      "content": "Find perfect lighting so he can see you clearly. If this is the first time your potential new beau is seeing you outside of photos, make sure you’ve picked the best lit spot possible. This isn’t to say that you should be sitting in the center of a searing spotlight, but try to set up your camera in a well-lit area so all your lovely features can shine. This works even better if there’s natural light! Diamond shares that you can even light candles to set the mood: “Create a romantic setting in your bedroom. Light candles, put on beautiful music, get into a sexy outfit, and create an environment for the romance to evolve.” [12] X Expert Source Maya Diamond, MA Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. If you can’t find great lighting anywhere, consider investing in a ring light."

      "content": "Play around with fun backgrounds. Some features of a video call app can be a little cringey, while others can amp up the fun! Pick a background that says “romance” like Paris or a cozy winter cottage dappled in snow. You can even build a whole theme around it by snacking on French macarons or having a s’mores inspired cup of hot chocolate . Your date will get to see your silly, romantic, and creative side!"

      "content": "Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet are all good options for video calling. Aside from the built-in video calling apps on your smartphones, like Facetime , there are a few other noteworthy options to see your boy toy on the small screen. While some of these apps became household names during the COVID-19 pandemic for work and schooling purposes, who’s to say they can’t provide the perfect platform for you to fall in love? Zoom: The free Zoom app meets all the necessary requirements for a successful video date call: fun backgrounds, interactive settings, and a big red “end” button if the date isn’t going as planned. Hey– you can always blame it on a bad connection! Skype: Zoom’s predecessor, Skype, is mostly known for videoconferencing, but you can download it for free on your Samsung, iPhone , or tablet and use it to virtually date for a more romantic rebrand. Google Meet: Also referred to as G-Meet, this app functions as an added free feature to your Gmail, so you can interact with your handsome man friend on the other side of the screen."

      "content": "Virtually flirt with a guy via compliments and body language. Conveying your interest on a video call can be challenging, as the screen between you limits some key aspects of romance, like playfully touching and the scent of pheromones. However, you can still flirt successfully to let him know you’re interested. Doing things like dressing up for the video call, paying him compliments, asking thoughtful questions, and laughing at his jokes are all good ways to show him how you feel. Body language also plays a huge role, so try to bite your lip, maintain eye contact by looking at the camera, and nod your head to demonstrate active listening. Aside from the built in video call apps on your smartphone, platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet are other good options."
