      "content": "Sometimes, various companies and sites offer a free month of Discord Nitro. These promotions usually involve downloading another program, but sometimes, they require you to have a specific subscription. Sometimes Discord itself will also offer various Nitro promotions."

      "content": "These promotions sometimes have expiration dates. They come and go, so check Google or your favorite search engine often for more promotions. The only promotion we could find that is still available is this one from SteelSeries , which involves downloading the SteelSeries GG app. Some other recent promotions include: Epic Games Store OperaGX Discord YouTube Premium"

      "title": "These promos aren't available if you've recently had Nitro.",
      "content": "These promos aren't available if you've recently had Nitro. For most promotions, you can only redeem them if you have yet to subscribe to Discord Nitro for at least 12 months/1 year. However, read the fine print for each promotion, as each promo will have different terms and requirements. For example, you could get Discord's summer 2024 Nitro BOGO promo if you hadn't subbed to Nitro within the last ten days, or you were upgrading from Nitro Basic or Classic to standard Nitro."

      "content": "Join Discord servers that do Nitro giveaways. Some servers are created specifically for the purpose of giving away free Nitro, while other servers may do Nitro giveaways as a reward to active server members. If a server has done Nitro giveaways for active members in the past, consider joining that server and becoming active in it. However, you should only join a server you actually want to join, because it will likely be more difficult to maintain high activity in a server that talks about things you don't care about. Look for Nitro giveaway servers on sites like DisBoard . DisBoard allows server owners to advertise their servers, and others can even leave reviews. When looking for a Nitro giveaway server, look for servers with a lot of members, and preferably one with positive reviews. Note that Nitro giveaway servers may also have certain requirements to be eligible for the giveaway."

      "content": "Join Discord servers that offer Nitro as a server reward. Some servers offer rewards for \"leveling up\" on that server, which is usually done by chatting, and your level is calculated by a Discord bot. You can also use DisBoard to find servers that offer Nitro as a server reward. Once again, look for servers with a lot of members and ones with good reviews. Note that these servers may have certain requirements to be eligible for leveling up and server rewards."
