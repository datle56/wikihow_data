Face the door, place a towel over the top of it, and reach your hands over the top of the door to so you have a wide grip. [1] X Research source It's very important that the door is strong and has strong hinges or you will end up damaging it. Don't use this method if you have doubts about the strength of the available doors in your house! Increase your difficulty level by wearing a weighted workout belt during your pull-ups (a 5–10 lb (2.3–4.5 kg) belt is good for beginners). Reader Poll: We asked 366 wikiHow readers and 52% of them agreed that the best exercise for building arm strength is weighted pull-ups . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Use bars at a playground in a public park to do pull ups. Monkey bars are just pull up bars for kids! Use the bar of a swingset, or any other type of bar or wooden beam that is part of the playground, to do pull ups if there are no monkey bars. [2] X Research source Some public parks even have dedicated pull up bars set up. Ask around in your area to see if anyone knows where you can find some."

      "content": "Grab a tree branch to do pull ups if you can't find a playground with bars. Look for trees with low, sturdy branches that you can reach to do pull ups. Stand underneath the branch and grab it (jump if you need to!) with a wide overhand grip and start doing pull ups. [3] X Research source Find trees that have branches of different girths to add variation to your pull ups and tone different muscles. Make sure that the branches you use are thick enough and strong enough to support your bodyweight so they don't snap as you do pull ups."

      "content": "Find a fence that is smooth enough to drag your knees along to do pull ups. A strong fence with a top you can grip onto is also a functional way to do pull ups outside. Your knees will most likely drag along the fence while you do them, so make sure it doesn't have a rough wood surface that will give you cuts or slivers. [4] X Research source An advantage of this method is that since your legs will be against the fence you can't swing them to help you do the pull ups. This will force your back muscles to do all the work. Curious what all the hype on hanging pull-ups (with or without a bar) is about?

Place a towel or yoga mat underneath an open door to hold it in place. Wrap a towel around a post or sturdy railing, and use the ends of the towel to pull yourself in towards the edge of the door with a rowing motion. [6] X Research source Squat down in a half sitting position and extend your arms straight while holding the ends of the towel to get into the starting position. Pull your upper body towards the door while keeping your back straight to do a row that works your back muscles. You can also do a similar exercise by wrapping an exercise band around the doorknobs instead of a towel. Pull the ends of the band towards you instead of moving your body towards the door. All types of rowing exercises will work your back and bicep muscles in a similar way to pull ups."

To use an overhand grip, stick your legs and body under the table and keep your head outside. Make sure that the table is heavy enough that you won't flip it over when you pull your bodyweight up."

Lie underneath the broomstick and pull your upper body up towards it to do a row that works your back and biceps like pull ups. [9] X Research source Make sure that the broomstick won't roll around on the chairs while you do the rows. You can place towels on the chairs to give them more traction."

Low hand railings are another way to improvise and do an alternative back exercise. Lie under the railing with your shoulders underneath it and pull your upper body up towards the railing with an overhand or underhand grip. [11] X Research source Try to find a railing that has flat ground underneath it, as opposed to slanted ground. If you can't, then alternate the way your body is facing for each set of rows to work your back evenly. You can also look for outdoor picnic benches to use for doing rows."
