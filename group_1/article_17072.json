      "content": "Call your phone number. The easiest way to find a cell phone is to call your phone number from another phone. You can do this to find any cell phone, regardless of whether it's a smartphone or a feature phone. Just ask someone you know to call your number, or use a free website service like CallMyPhone to dial your number from a computer . You can also use a VoIP service like Google Voice to call your cell phone. If the ringer is turned off or your phone isn't nearby, this won't be helpful. Still, it's worth a try! If you lost your Android, see this method to learn how to play an audible sound even if your ringer is off. If you lost an iPhone, use this method instead."

      "content": "Have someone text your phone. A close second to calling your cell phone is having someone else text your phone. If your phone is truly lost (as in lost at a public place, not misplaced around your apartment), you can have someone text your other contact info to your phone so that anyone who finds it might see the message and know how to reach you. If you can't find anyone to text your phone, there are easy ways to text your phone from a computer . You can also try texting a reward offer to your phone. This may convince someone who finds your cell phone to contact you and arrange a meeting."

      "content": "Retrace your steps. Retracing your steps can help you find any lost or misplaced item, not just cell phones. However, if you had your phone at an earlier location and have realized that you left your cell phone somewhere, retracing your steps can help you locate your mobile phone (as long as it hasn't been taken). Sit down for a moment and think about where you've been and what you've done. Consider when and where you last remember having or using your phone, and work your way forward. If you went to any restaurants or stores before you lost your phone, try asking an employee if anyone found/returned a lost phone. If the phone was left with an employee, you should be able to describe your phone or tell the employee your phone number so he can call it and verify that it's yours. Whatever you do, don't panic . Panicking will only worsen your situation and might make it difficult to concentrate or think clearly . [1] X Research source"

For some, this may be very little, while for others, it could be a huge task. You may also want to cancel any credit/debit cards that were registered to any online stores through that device (like the App Store, for example). If you're worried that the phone is in someone else's hands, the sooner you do this, the better, as identity theft is a serious and widespread issue. It's better to take the time to reset your passwords and logins before physically hunting further for your phone. This will minimize the potential damage someone could do with access to your information, and if you do find your phone, then using new passwords is only a minor inconvenience. Start with your most important passwords. This typically includes email, bank accounts, social media, and online storage. Deal with financial and personal information first. After you have changed your major passwords, you can reset passwords for less important services."

If you tend to lose your phone at home, try to keep it on a nightstand or coffee table whenever it's not on your person. When your phone is on your person, give it a designated pocket and always check that you have everything when you leave. For example, you might tap your pockets to confirm in a particular order that you've got your keys, wallet, and cell phone."
