      "content": "Know that déjà vu feelings are typically harmless. As far as scientists know, there are no harmful effects of experiencing déjà vu, so don't feel that you have to get rid of this feeling because it is harmful. That said, individuals who have a condition called temporal lobe epilepsy, in which they have abnormal electrical activity in a part of the brain, are more likely to experience déjà vu than other individuals. So, if this feeling is very common for you, it may be worth getting checked out by a qualified medical doctor, such as a neurologist.

      "content": "Know that déjà vu might indicate a good memory. Because déjà vu is more commonly experienced among young people compared to older individuals, and because it involves recognizing that a feeling of familiarity is \"off\", or wrong or unjustified, this may indicate that déjà vu is a healthy reaction that might reflect a good memory system. [6] X Research source That said, it may be that déjà vu does not indicate a good memory system necessarily, but it still does not suggest a bad memory system. So, if you are trying to get rid of the feeling because you are worried it means you have a bad memory, don't worry!"

Although it is unclear whether stress causes déjà vu, whether déjà vu causes stress, or whether some third variable causes both stress and déjà vu. Still, if stress does cause déjà vu, at least some of the time, one way to try to prevent feeling déjà vu might be to lower your stress levels. There are a number of ways this can be done: Socialize with others. Studies show that having social support is a great way to reduce the impact of stress. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try a deep breathing technique. Breathe in deeply through your mouth over five seconds. Hold your breath for a few seconds and then exhale slowly over five seconds. Focus only on your body and your breathing. Doing this can help you get your mind off of stressful things and calm your body down. Exercise. Get up and moving to reduce stress. Go for a walk, a jog, or to the gym. Listen to some music while you exercise to really pump yourself up.

You may need between 7-9 hours of sleep a night. Keep track of how many hours of sleep you need each night to feel fully rested and refreshed in the morning and aim to get that amount each night.

      "title": "Cut down on travel.",
      "content": "Cut down on travel. Because déjà vu involves something feeling familiar when it is not, and recognizing this discrepancy, the experience is more likely to occur while traveling somewhere new. After all, you did not see new things, you would not experience déjà vu. That said, you should perform a cost/benefit analysis before making this decision. For example, you should ask yourself whether giving up seeing new things is worth reducing the odds that you will experience déjà vu. What matters is how much traveling/seeing new things matters to you, personally, compared to not experiencing déjà vu."
