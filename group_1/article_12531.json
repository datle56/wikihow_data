Pour the full bottle of descaling solution into the reservoir. Then, refill the bottle with water and add it to the reservoir with the solution. Put the lid back on your reservoir and ensure it’s attached properly to the machine.

However, vinegar is acidic and may damage internal parts of your Keurig machine, so it’s not recommended by the manufacturer."
