      "title": "Choose a turkey that's about 15 pounds (6.8 kg).",
      "content": "Choose a turkey that's about 15 pounds (6.8 kg). Most fryers can handle a bird up to 18 pounds (8.2 kg), but you risk displacing too much oil if you use the largest size that will fit into your fryer. Also, smaller birds tend to cook more evenly. [1] X Research source You can estimate about 1 serving of turkey for every pound (0.4 kg) of bird, so a 15 pounds (6.8 kg) turkey will serve up to 15 people."

      "title": "Defrost your turkey completely before you fry it.",
      "content": "Defrost your turkey completely before you fry it. Leave your turkey in the refrigerator until it's thawed out. It's extremely important that your turkey be completely thawed out before you attempt to fry it. Ice crystals can cause your oil to spatter or even explode, which can cause severe burns to anyone standing nearby. [2] X Research source Allow your turkey to thaw for 24 hours for each 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of weight. For instance, a 15 pounds (6.8 kg) turkey would need to defrost in the refrigerator for 3 days. To make sure the turkey is completely thawed, feel it inside and out to make sure there are no cold or hard spots in the meat. Be sure to check between the ribs inside of the turkey's cavity, since this is often the last place to thaw."

      "content": "Remove the giblets and the neck if your turkey is fresh. Most turkeys you buy from the grocery store already have the neck removed, but if you have a fresh one, it may still be attached. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Open the neck cavity and make a small slit where the turkey legs meet the breast.",
      "content": "Open the neck cavity and make a small slit where the turkey legs meet the breast. This will help ensure that the oil can flow freely through the bird, helping it to cook more evenly. [4] X Research source Most frozen turkeys will already have this done, but fresh turkeys will not."

      "title": "Place the turkey in the fryer and cover it with water to measure the oil you'll need.",
      "content": "Place the turkey in the fryer and cover it with water to measure the oil you'll need. The turkey should be covered by about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of water, and you should have 5 inches (13 cm) between the water level and the top of the fryer. You can either measure the water as you put it into the pot or after you remove the turkey. [5] X Research source If you don't have enough space between the water and your fryer, you run the risk of oil splashing out while your turkey is cooking. Dry the frying pot thoroughly after you pour out the water. Make sure to do this step before you dry and season the turkey."

      "title": "Season the bird with a dry rub.",
      "content": "Season the bird with a dry rub. You can purchase a prepared rub, or you can make your own blend from your favorite seasonings. Carefully separate the skin from the meat of the bird, then place most of the rub beneath the skin. You can use any remaining rub inside of the cavity and on the skin. [7] X Research source Some people prefer to brine their turkey in saltwater or inject it with liquid seasoning. These methods are not recommended, since the extra liquid can cause the oil in your fryer to spatter."

      "content": "Check your fryer to be sure it's in good working order. Your fryer should have a burner, a solid stand, a hanger or basket, and a thermometer. You will also need a propane tank and a fire extinguisher rated for grease fires. [8] X Research source You don't have to have a fryer specifically for turkeys, but it should be big enough to accommodate your bird."

Use a thermometer to keep a close eye on the temperature as you heat the oil to make sure it doesn't get too hot. [12] X Research source If your oil gets too hot, the outside of your turkey will cook faster than the inside, resulting in an undercooked bird. You also increase your risk of a grease fire."

Usually, spitting oil is a result of moisture coming into contact with the hot grease."
