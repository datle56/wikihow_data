      "content": "Learn to spin a pencil over your thumb. Use a smooth pen or pencil to start. Hold the pencil between your thumb and pointer finger, and use your middle finger to push the pencil around your thumb. Be sure to catch it as it spins back around into your palm! [2] X Research source This skill takes some practice, so it's great for killing time in class. Beware that you'll probably drop your pencil frequently when you're first learning how to spin it. It may be best to only try this if you're sitting near the back of the class!"

Entertain yourself by counting how many students are wearing a school sweatshirt or try to guess which color car will drive by the window next. If you're sitting by a friend, quietly make bets on what you think will happen. [3] X Research source You could even keep a tally of how many times your teacher says a certain word and see whose guess was closest. Try to keep your games lighthearted and fun. Remember to be polite and respectful to your classmates, especially if they're paying attention and involved in the lesson."

This will give you something to do and can help keep you awake (studies show chewing gum can even help you pay attention better to things that require your attention!). [4] X Research source You can even make a game by closing your eyes and trying to guess the flavor if you have a few different candy flavors."

If you’ve got some quiet down time to kill (like when you finish a test earlier than other students), there are plenty of lowkey ways to clear your mind and de-stress without any pencils, papers, or computers. One simple breathing exercise you can try is box breathing—just inhale for 4 counts, hold your breath for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, and hold for 4 counts. Then, repeat. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To meditate , just get comfortable at your desk, close your eyes, and let your thoughts wander. Just make sure your teacher doesn’t think you’re asleep! Or, try gazing out a window or at a picture in your textbook and let yourself daydream for a moment. You might picture yourself in the scene you’re looking at, or let the images inspire your future plans."

Print out a few brain teasers like crosswords or Sudoku puzzles at home or buy a cheap puzzle book you can hide behind a larger textbook. Then, when you get bored, grab a page and start working on a mind game. You might even look like you’re poring over a worksheet or assignment! Just be careful to look up occasionally to seem like you’re engaged in the lesson. Otherwise, your puzzles might get confiscated or you could be moved to the front of the class for closer supervision."

You don’t need official origami paper to create a stunning work of art in class (and besides, the bright colors and patterns would catch your teacher’s eye anyway!). Instead, just rip or cut a regular sheet of paper into a square and get started on a design of your choice.

Here are a few discreet stretches you can do to distract yourself and calm down your body until you leave school for the day: [6] X Research source Neck stretch: Gently let your head drop in all directions—to the left, the right, down to your chest, then backward with your chin toward the ceiling. Shoulder roll: Slowly roll your shoulders forward 5 times, using your full range of motion. Repeat 5 times going backward. Finger stretch: Spread your fingers as far apart as you can with your palms facing down. Hold the stretch for about 5 seconds, relax, then repeat several times."

If you feel like you've taken a million notes and just can't pay attention anymore, go back through and review your notes. Highlight important parts, underline information you need to know for a test, and draw pictures of important figures and ideas. When you look back over your notes to study, your doodles and markings can help you remember the information. [7] X Research source This will keep you entertained and engaged with the lesson so you're still doing a bit of studying! You can also draw geometric patterns, circles, or even random shapes in the margins of your notes. Most teachers won't mind a little doodling since it keeps you occupied, and you don't disturb the class."

If your classmates are also bored, write \"Draw something and pass it on\" on a sheet of paper or sticky note and pass it around. Everyone can sketch their own small doodle or illustration, or you can add a new feature to a previous drawing (like adding a huge nose to a smiling stick figure). Just remember to be discreet when you’re passing your note! If your teacher is strict about doodling in class or disrupting the lesson by passing things around, this game might not be the greatest idea."

Write a letter about anything you like for a friend or family member—you could tell a funny story, reminisce on a fond memory you share with them, or even go the sappy route and let that person know how much they mean to you. Or, if you’re more future-oriented, you could write a letter to your future self detailing what you’re experiencing now and what you hope to do or achieve by the time you open your letter. If you’re writing to yourself, save your letter in a safe place when you get home (or type it up and save it somewhere secure) and set a time to open it in the future. You could choose the end of the school year, a full year from now, or as far into the future as you like! Writing a letter to yourself is a great way to organize your thoughts and relieve some stress and anxiety. [8] X Research source"

Grab a pen and paper and jot down a quick list of things that make you grateful. Nothing is too small or silly to include—your answers could range from friends and family to the nice weather outside or the pen your crush let you borrow. If your list includes special people in your life, consider thanking them in person later for their impact on you.

Just grab your pencil and start sketching away! If you need a location to imagine your future self, sketch out a floor plan for your dream house.

During a boring class, pull up social media or open up a simple game, like Minesweeper or Snake , to keep yourself entertained. Remember that the people sitting around you will be able to see your screen, so avoid browsing on questionable sites. [12] X Research source If your school doesn't allow laptops or tablets in class, keep yours out of sight behind a book or under your desk. It's very difficult to hide a tablet or laptop, and if you get caught, your teacher might confiscate it. Remember to turn the sound off on your tablet or laptop so you don't disturb other students.
