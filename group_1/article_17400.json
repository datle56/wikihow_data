      "content": "Reflect on past relationships to see where the avoidant behavior comes from. Your attachment style is believed to be formed through your past relationships, especially those earlier in life. [2] X Research source So, reflect on those relationships and be objective. Consider how you were treated and how other people’s actions made you react to the world. Ask yourself whether you felt comforted or cared for in your past relationships so you can start to figure out what you need to feel secure and overcome your past wounds."

      "content": "Challenge avoidant thoughts when they appear. Logical thinking can halt avoidant tendencies. When you feel yourself feeling the urge to withdraw or experiencing negative emotions about expressing your feelings, try asking yourself a series of questions to see how rational these thoughts are. Getting into the habit of doing this can help you overcome your avoidant attachment style. For example, ask yourself questions like: [3] X Research source “Is it a fact that someone is being too needy, or is it just a thought?” “Does my past bad relationship mean this one is also bound to be bad?” “Am I being too harsh about this person based on a single event?” “Does spending more time with this person really mean that I’m not self-reliant?” “Am I assuming this is just the way I am, and that I can’t change?”"

      "content": "Learn how to regulate your emotions. Regulating your emotions is crucial for overcoming avoidant attachment, as it will allow you to avoid emotional withdrawals. Start by exploring your behaviors, emotional reactions, and impulses to get a better understanding of why you do the things you do. Once you’ve gotten the why, practice mindfulness, label your emotions and let the painful ones go, and dedicate time to calming down and relaxing when you’re emotional. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Think about responding instead of immediately reacting. Don’t react until your emotions are under control. Take deep breaths, count to 10, or take a walk to help you calm down."

      "content": "Keep an emotions journal. Journaling helps you keep track of your progress. Keeping a daily journal of your emotions gives you the chance to understand patterns in your relationships and feelings. This can be a great way to work out your feelings and to provide yourself with insight into how your attachment style functions in your daily life. [5] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source When journaling, ask yourself prompts like, “How did I express myself to other people today?” or “Do I have any fears about my relationships right now? Why?” Be sure to go back and read earlier journal entries every week or so. You might be surprised by your progress. Georgoulis also suggests writing out the things you tend to avoid and would like to do. Set small realistic goals, face them one at a time, and break them down into small, manageable steps."

      "content": "Step out of your comfort zone and do 1 vulnerable action a day. Take your time moving past avoidance. It’s tough to transform your entire attachment style in a day, especially when you aren’t comfortable being open or vulnerable. But by opening yourself up gradually, you can see real changes in how you relate to others. Slow progress leads to solid improvement, so try taking one of these actions each day: Spending time with someone when you’d rather withdraw. Confessing a weakness about yourself. Asking someone else for help."

      "content": "Communicate your needs openly. Open communication keeps expectations clear. In any relationship, it’s important to have a good understanding of what each person’s responsibilities are to one another. In your relationships with others, let them know upfront what needs you have, especially in regards to privacy and personal space. This can prevent resentment from building up over time. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source You might try saying something like, “I really value my relationship with you, but having some personal space is also really important to me. What can I do to make you feel cared for?” When you’re in a conflict with someone, instead of immediately withdrawing, say something like, “I think I need a break from this conversation, but I promise that we can continue it this evening.” If showing vulnerability is difficult for you, say something like, “It’s tough for me to open up on my own. But if you ask me questions, I’m happy to answer them.”"

      "title": "Practice expressing your feelings.",
      "content": "Practice expressing your feelings. Rather than continuing to avoid your feelings, learn to embrace them so you can practice expressing them. You don’t have to immediately accept all of your feelings, as healing takes time, but express them as they come so you can get more comfortable doing so. Avoiding your emotions may have worked well in the past, but it can get in the way of building healthy, nourishing relationships. [7] X Research source If you don’t like the way someone said something to you, kindly express those feelings instead of holding them inside or avoiding them."

      "title": "Use respectful language when asking for space.",
      "content": "Use respectful language when asking for space. Let the other person know personal space is just your preference. Sometimes, people with avoidant attachment styles can confuse their preference for space with other people being needy. By acknowledging that your request for space is about you, not them, you can keep your relationships feeling secure for both you and the other people in your life. Try using “ I-statements ” instead of “you-statements.” For example: [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Instead of saying, “You’re needy,” say, “I really appreciate that you care for me. I feel the same way, but in order to feel comfortable, I also feel like I need space.” Instead of saying, “You’re too demanding,” say, “I find it hard to open up to others. I know you’re a kind and trustworthy person, and I’ll do my best to open up more.” Instead of saying, “You’re too clingy,” say, “I know you want to talk more often. I feel stressed sometimes when there’s pressure to respond immediately, but I promise I’ll get back to you within a few hours.”"

      "content": "Try to put yourself in your partner’s shoes. Work on empathy to see your relationships in a healthier light. Often, people with avoidant attachment styles tend to struggle to understand other people’s emotional cues. By consciously putting yourself in their shoes, you can get a better understanding of how the needs of other people aren’t something scary or to be avoided, but are instead normal and natural. Ask yourself questions like: [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source “How might my partner feel about my behavior?” “What needs does my partner have, and how can I best meet them?” “Are my needs really so different from my partner’s?

      "content": "Show affection in verbal and non-verbal ways. Affection doesn’t have to be planned in advance. Often, people with avoidant attachment styles tend to think of expressing affection as only occurring within certain contexts, like having sex. But by making a conscious effort to express affection in different ways, you can ease yourself into a deeper and more secure relationship without having to think about it as a task to accomplish. For example: Be conscious of your body language in your relationships. Try to sit or stand face-to-face with the people in your life and make eye contact. Offer people in your life compliments and verbal indications that you appreciate them. Licensed psychologist Sarah Schewitz says that if you and the other people in your life feel comfortable with it, casually touch them by making non-sexual physical contact or offering them a hug. Schewitz also says that patting someone on the back and holding hands are other good forms of non-verbal affection."

Think about who in your life you might be able to describe as having a secure attachment style, whether they’re a romantic partner, a platonic friend, or a family member. Just by being around them, you can naturally begin to overcome your avoidant tendencies. Some signs that someone has a secure attachment style include: [10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

If you have an avoidant attachment style, you may have a tendency to avoid getting close or intimate with the people around you.

[14] X Research source Dismissive Attachment: You may be confident that you’re worthy of love, but view those around you unfavorably and resist getting close to them. Fearful Attachment: You may believe you’re not worthy of love, hold a fear of being hurt or vulnerable, and think people can’t be trusted. You may also refuse to ask for help in times of need."

      "content": "Avoidant attachment is caused by a lack of emotional support and comfort in relationships. Psychologists theorize that your attachment style is formed during the early years of your life and influenced by the dynamics of your relationships. If your caregivers were absent or emotionally unsupportive, you may have a tendency to avoid your emotions and do things on your own. [15] X Research source While this may have been a useful coping mechanism in relationships where you didn’t feel safe or comfortable, it can cause you to carry an avoidant attachment style into future relationships.
