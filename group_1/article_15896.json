Otherwise, there’s no problem with a solo viewing—just you, your thoughts, and the movie. Watching a movie with others can be a blast, but it also means that you might need to compromise on a movie selection."

If you want some excitement, go for a thriller or a horror flick. If you’re in a group, go for a more popular genre, like adventure or comedy, but maybe avoid more polarizing genres like documentaries or musicals. Make sure the movie is available, either in your own personal library, on a streaming service, or at a rental outlet. Or, be sure to download it in advance! If you’re watching with a group, have each person propose a movie, then vote on the one you’d like to watch together. Check the critic ratings online if you want to be sure you’re watching something good, and to make sure it’s age-appropriate for any children."

But if you have ample room in a darker area of the house—or even outside—and want a more theatrical experience, consider investing in a projector and set up a big projection screen . [2] X Research source Choose a room with little or no ambient light from outside to really immerse yourself. A basement works great, or pull the curtains closed in your living room or bedroom. To use a projector, pick a room with enough wall space for a 100-inch screen and one that’s large enough to set up the projector at the proper distance from the wall. You don't need a TV or projector to watch a movie! If you’re enjoying a movie alone, you can watch directly from your computer or tablet."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you’re watching solo, a pair of headphones can do wonders. Room size is a major factor when selecting speakers. Large speakers don’t work well in small, closed-in rooms, while small speakers may sound weak in large, open rooms. A soundbar is a good option if you want a significant upgrade in sound quality, aren’t ready to invest in a pricey surround sound speaker system, or want to easily hide your speakers . Consult a professional at your local tech or audio store to determine which speakers would be best for your space and needs."

Aim to sit at least 6–8 ft (1.8–2.4 m) away for the best viewing experience that doesn’t strain your eyes. [4] X Research source It’s usually best to position a sofa in the center, facing the screen directly, with chairs angled toward the screen on either side. If you‘re watching a movie with others, make sure that they can get a decent view from their spots."

The first to grab their phone has to refill everyone's drinks and snacks for the rest of the night. Also, go ahead and get any pressing chores, errands, or important tasks done beforehand, so that you’re not preoccupied or getting up in the middle of the movie."

Also light a candle or two or turn on dim fairy lights for added ambience. If you’re enjoying your movie with others, ask them to bring extra blankets and pillows. You can never have too many!

Pretzels, candy, and chips with dip are other movie-friendly options. Try spicing up regular popcorn. Add seasoning like cayenne pepper or nutritional yeast, or drizzle your popcorn with caramel or chocolate sauce for a sweeter snack. If you’re looking for a healthier finger food option, try a platter of freshly sliced fruits and vegetables. Or, go all out and order some takeout. Just be sure not to spill it on the furniture!"
