      "content": "Think about what effect you want from this lamp. Think about what you want from the pendant light. Is it meant to provide a bright light for working or a soft mood light? A chandelier might overwhelm a small space while a more utilitarian lamp could look too harsh for your living area. Decide if the lamp's purpose and design will match the room's d√©cor. A light fixture made of chrome or stainless steel will look sleek and modern. Blown glass gives an artistic feel. Chandeliers are more romantic and elegant. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider where you want the lamp to hang. [2] X Research source Consider the size of your light. As a general rule of thumb, a larger light can be moved higher while a smaller light can be moved lower. Consider the size of the room. How tall is the ceiling? Rooms with unusually high ceilings require lights that are bigger and hang lower. If you are hanging the light over a table or a kitchen island, think about the size of that as well. If you have a large table, you can get away with hanging your lamp slightly higher up. Also, look at the shape of your table. Is it round, square, or rectangular? If you have a rectangular table, an island, or a counter, you will likely need more than one hanging pendant light."

      "content": "Hang a lamp over a kitchen table or island. Start with 28 to 34 inches (71.1 to 86.4 cm), measuring from the bottom of the hanging light and the surface of your table. This range will be your base measurement. Use it as a rough guideline when planning the placement of your light. [3] X Research source When hanging a light over a table, be sure to plan for the height of the people that may use that space. Nobody wants a light glaring in his or her eyes or knocking them in the head while they are chopping vegetables."

      "content": "Hang a lamp over the floor. [4] X Research source Plan for roughly 84 to 96 inches (213.4 to 243.8 cm) from the bottom of the light to the floor. You should provide at least 1 foot (0.3 m) of clearance for the person walking below. Calculate according to the height of the ceiling. For an 8-foot ceiling, a pendant lamp should hang about 12 to 20 inches (30.5 to 50.8 cm) below. For each additional foot of ceiling height, add 3 inches (7.6 cm)."
