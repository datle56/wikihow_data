      "content": "They might only seem fine, but they’re hurting internally. If you’re not actually interacting with your ex, but you’re seeing their social media posts, you’re likely getting an inaccurate picture of how they’re doing. Remember, social media only shows you the things people want you to see—the highlights, the wins, the fun nights out, etc. Your ex may actually be just as upset as you are, but they aren’t sharing this side on social media. [4] X Research source Whether or not their social media is accurate, the most important thing is to shift your focus to yourself, rather than worrying about what your ex is feeling. This is definitely tough, but it’s necessary to truly heal and move on. So resist the urge to check their Instagram, TikTok, or Snapchat. You got this!"

      "content": "Accept that they’re okay. You might want your ex to be as upset as you are, in order to show that the relationship meant as much to them as it did to you. This is totally natural, but it’s not necessarily productive. It’s important to accept the reality of the situation in order to move on, even if this means accepting the fact that your ex seems to be doing fine after the breakup. Keep in mind that your ex may be more upset than you realize. They may just be acting unaffected on the outside and processing their feelings internally. Regardless, the most important thing is to let go of your desire to know exactly what’s going on with them. Instead, try to shift your focus toward yourself. Rather than obsessing over what your ex might be thinking or feeling, check in with yourself and explore how you’re feeling. [5] X Research source"

[7] X Research source This may mean not communicating or hanging out for a period of time, so that you can truly process and move on. [8] X Research source Don’t call, text, or message your ex unless you have a legitimate reason. For example, calling because you have a child together is a legitimate reason. Calling because you saw your ex’s favorite car on the road isn’t. Try to resist the urge to look at your ex’s social media accounts. [9] X Research source This constant reminder of your ex may make it harder for you to let go and heal. If you need to, consider blocking them or silencing notifications so you aren't tempted."
