Experiment with different cuts, colors, and combinations and start picking out clothes that make you look good and feel comfortable at the same time. If you need inspiration, look in fashion magazines and read style blogs. Decide which outfits speak to you, and work on recreating them in your own wardrobe. [5] X Research source Start with a good set of basics. Fill your closet with dresses, skirts, pants and tops that you know you’ll enjoy wearing. Every item you buy should match at least three items in your closet. Make sure your clothes fit well. Buy clothes in your size, rather than aspirationally sizing down or getting baggy clothes to try to hide something. You’ll look your best if your clothes fit your figure. And don’t be afraid to buy clothes that show off your body, like a cute crop top or a pair of tight-fitting jeans. When you’re trying to decide what to wear, try picking just one item to be your muse, and work from there. For example, maybe you have a beautiful pencil skirt and you’re not sure what to do with it. Add a cotton tee and a set of pearls, and you have the perfect outfit for an afternoon lunch. Switch out the tee for a silk blouse and blazer, and you’re ready for a business meeting. Work with your favorite items in your closet to create amazing outfits. Wear outfits that make you feel confident. Take a look in the mirror and think about the occasion. What is best outfit in your closet to convey confidence for this occasion?"

Be a little bold and pick colors that heighten each other and make your outfit look interesting instead of bland. [7] X Research source Wear colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. For example, try wearing orange and blue together, or purple and yellow. These complementary colors will make your outfit pop. Wear colors that are on trend for the season. Every season, a new palette of colors hits the stores. If you’re not sure what they are, go to the mall and check out the new colors from this season’s clothing and see which colors are styled together. Incorporate a few trendy new colors in your wardrobe. Mix prints with like colors. For example, you could wear a lavender-striped top with a skirt that has a floral pattern including lavender and other colors. Use one print to play up the colors in another print. Go monochrome when you’re feeling bold. Wearing an all-black or all-red outfit will make a bold statement. When you do this, try wearing nude accessories, like camel-colored shoes and a nude lipstick."

But just because you want to dress up like a girl doesn’t mean you have to wear heels! Try wedges or classy flats, which go well with almost any outfit. [8] X Expert Source Tannya Bernadette Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 10 May 2019. Wear shoes that match the season, like close-toed suede pumps for winter and open-toed canvas wedges for summer. Cute wedges go with any outfit, especially if they're denim or floral print or a solid black or white color. If you prefer a more casual look, wear a cute pair of plain white tennis shoes with shorts, skirts and even dresses. Don’t sacrifice comfort for style. Practice walking in new shoes, especially heels, before you wear them out. If you can’t walk around in those four-inch heels, don’t wear them! You won’t look stylish if you’re falling down."

Once you know what you’re going to wear, figure out how to make it look even more stylish by adding a few perfect accessories, like a pair of brilliant earrings or a thin belt around your waist. It’s a chance to show off your personality and have a little fun. [9] X Expert Source Tannya Bernadette Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 10 May 2019. Knowing a few basic rules for accessorizing will help you look your best: Don’t wear too many at once. Choose just a few pretty accessories that really enhance your outfit instead of making it look cluttered. If you're wearing a plain top, try wearing some flashy earrings, a big statement necklace, or bright bangles. Do not wear all three! Wear accessories that accent a color in your outfit. For example, if your dress has flecks of red in the pattern, wear red earrings or a red bracelet. Use accessories to add personality to a plain outfit. You could dress up a plain blouse with an interesting scarf, several loose necklaces, or long beaded earrings and a chunky bracelet. A belt around the midsection has a thinning effect that makes even the tiniest of girls look like they have some curve. Spend your money on classic accessories that never go out of style, like sterling silver hoops. Trendier accessories like cat-eye glasses or wide belts should be purchased on sale, since they might be out of style by next season. Nail polish, tattoos, an umbrella, glasses, bags and other items can all act as unexpected accessories."
