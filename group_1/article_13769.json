      "title": "Raise your larynx to speak in a higher pitch.",
      "content": "Raise your larynx to speak in a higher pitch. Your voice changes pitch depending on the position of your larynx (also known as your Adam’s apple or voice box). Swallow and notice when your larynx reaches the highest point. Try to hold it there for a few seconds before relaxing to train your muscles. As it gets more comfortable to keep your larynx in the raised position, try relaxing your tongue and holding the position for 5–10 minutes."

      "title": "Vocalize sounds near middle C.",
      "content": "Vocalize sounds near middle C. Many girls and women have a vocal range near middle C on a piano. Play the note out loud and try to hum or sing “ee” sounds at the same pitch. Practice inhaling through your nose and sing words that start with an “H” sound. Hold the note for a few seconds at a time. [1] X Research source It’s okay if you can’t hit middle C right away when you’re starting vocal exercise. Raise the pitch as much as you comfortably can and work your way to a higher voice. If you start sounding hoarse or if you feel any pain, get some water and take a break so you don’t hurt your voice. Girls naturally vary the pitch of their voice while they’re speaking. As you get more comfortable saying words at a higher pitch, let your voice waver between slightly higher and lower pitches. Avoid trying to raise your voice really high since it might sound unnatural and someone may easily pick up on it."

      "title": "Use softened consonant sounds.",
      "content": "Use softened consonant sounds. Many women and people with more feminine voices string their words together smoothly and put less stress on hard consonant sounds. Practice saying consonant sounds for a shorter amount of time and with less force so they flow smoothly. [2] X Research source Try saying, “Pull the light switch to turn the light off,” and notice how choppy your voice sounds when you pronounce the Ts in each word. Record yourself and practice saying the sentence in a smooth, even tone. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stretch and emphasize vowel sounds.",
      "content": "Stretch and emphasize vowel sounds. Many people with feminine voices draw out the vowel sounds in the middle of each word. Practice holding your vowel sounds a little longer than normal while you’re speaking to sound more like a girl. Holding out vowel noises helps make up for the natural resonance you have in your chest when you speak in a deeper voice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Breathe from your diaphragm.",
      "content": "Breathe from your diaphragm. Using your diaphragm to breathe helps support your girl voice so it sounds richer and fuller. Practice taking deep breaths in through your nose and pushing your stomach out as you inhale. [4] X Research source Try to avoid breathing with your chest and raising your shoulders because it may make your voice sound breathy or weak."

    {
      "title": "Imitate other feminine voices and mannerisms.",
      "content": "Imitate other feminine voices and mannerisms. Watch newscasts with female anchors because they speak in clear, monotone voices that are easy to mimic. Pay attention to how they articulate each word and any body language they have as they’re speaking. Try repeating a sentence or two, and record it so you can compare your girl voice to theirs. As you get more comfortable mimicking newscasters, try imitating other girl voices from movies, TV shows, or podcasts to try out new inflections and mannerisms."

    {
      "title": "Practice making nonverbal sounds.",
      "content": "Practice making nonverbal sounds. As you’re working on sounding more like a woman, work on making other vocal noises, such as laughing, coughing, or crying. Try to match any nonverbal sounds to the pitch of your girl voice so it sounds more feminine."

      "title": "Keep practicing until you can consistently talk in a girl voice.",
      "content": "Keep practicing until you can consistently talk in a girl voice. It may take around 3–6 months to completely train your voice if you’re practicing every day. Continue doing vocal exercises, mimicking other people, and working on your articulation until you’re happy with the way that your voice sounds. Everybody is unique, and it may take a little longer to speak in a consistent tone if you’re going from a lower pitch to a higher one."
