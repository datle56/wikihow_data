      "content": "Identify if your friend is a copycat. You don’t want to just plain out accuse your friend of being a copycat. The first thing you need to do is think about her actions, your relationship, and the situation in order to properly identify if your friend is really a copycat. Consider the following: Does your friend dress the same way as you? Has your friend incorporated mannerisms like your own? Does your friend talk like you? Has your friend ever stolen your ideas and tried to pass them off as their own? Does your friend like to date the same people as you, or has she tried to steal crushes or romantic interests?"

      "content": "Rule out that this is a normal part of friendship. Perhaps your friend is not simply copying you, but you are also copying your friend. Often times friends sort of feed off of and influence each other. It might be that you have a reciprocal influence where you are both copying each other to an extent. If this is the case, you might be able to stop mimicking your friend and embrace your own style. She might do the same."

      "title": "Get an outside opinion.",
      "content": "Get an outside opinion. Find someone you can confide in, maybe a relative, or a very close friend of your own. Avoid involving a friend you both share—this will just put that person in an undesirable situation. Ask the person to evaluate the situation to see if she agrees that your friend is a copycat. Your confidant might agree with you, or she might disagree with you. This will give you more perspective before you take any further steps to deal with the copycat."

      "content": "Consider current trends and popular culture as an explanation for your friend’s actions. It might be that while you think you’re very cutting edge and hip, that you are following current trends (you might not be trendy, just avant-garde). Your friend could also be taking the same cues from TV, radio, and other forms of media, and trying to stay cool. It could also be that your friend is taking cues about “coolness” and popular culture from you – you are her barometer for what is currently cool."

      "content": "Remember that imitation is the highest form of flattery. You could choose to approach your copycat’s actions as a compliment. After all, you are the best judge of how harmful her actions are. If you think she is just complimenting you, then it might be ok. Consider if her imitation is undermining her own individuality. Consider if her actions are undermining your own individuality. Decide how frustrating your friend’s actions really are for you."

      "content": "Nurture your friend’s individuality. Do what you can to encourage your copycat friend to embrace her own style, taste, and individuality. You can do this several ways: Compliment her on original things she does. Talk about her good features. Ask her about ideas that she comes up with. In a subtle way, discuss how important it is to be an individual. [1] X Research source"

Being sarcastic in order to show your frustration. Telling mutual friends that the person is nothing but a copycat."

If you don’t want to confront her about her overall copycatting, there are some smaller steps you can take to maybe let her know that specific things she does frustrate you or makes you unhappy. If she's copied your style or the way you dress, mention that you were trying to stand out that day. If she's talking the way you talk, tell her that you’re trying to be an individual. If she's trying to steal your ideas in work or school, tell her that you’ve worked really hard and you’d prefer that the work remains your own. Make sure to do it in a polite, and non-offensive way. Remember, she might not even realize what shes doing. If she gets overly defensive, back off and reassess the situation."

If your friend hasn’t really taken any of the cues or suggestions you’ve been dropping along the way, you need to talk to them. When you’re alone, tell her you’d like to talk about something that concerns you. Tell her that you feel that her actions are undermining your individuality.

There are a number of things you can do to avoid this problem. If your copycat is the one who steals your writing and art, sign it and date it. If your friend copies your room styles and belongings, be creative. If you want to, buy stuff and wear stuff they won’t be able to find. But don’t let this go too far, you don’t want to lose your own unique style. Announce ideas or anything you’ve produced on social media so that everyone knows who is responsible for them."

This could lead to a series of problems, including your copycat wanting to date the same people as you or steal your crush. But if you create a social circle independent of your copycat, it will be much harder for her to imitate you and steal your show. Rely on friends and family from different parts of your town or community to introduce you to a different social group. If your copycat and you go to the same school, find some friends at another school. If your copycat tries to steal your crush or wants to date the same people as you, try to find romantic partners from an outside social circle, and avoid introducing them."

If the situation is really bad, and other steps have failed, you should consider distancing yourself and spending less time with your copycat friend. You might even want to cut her out of your life entirely. But consider the following before you take this extreme measure: You’ve tried to nurture them and push them toward her own individuality. You’ve explicitly communicated your frustration with her actions. She's done little or nothing to remedy her copycatting. The person’s copycat actions have turned malicious or harmful.
