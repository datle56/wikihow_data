If you're not sure where your waist is, feel above your hips and below your ribs to find it. Then, write down the measurement. [1] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021. [2] X Research source Ensure that the measuring tape lays flat around your waist. If it's twisted, your waist measurement will be off. The waist is where the top of your 6-piece skirt will sit."

      "content": "Wrap the measuring tape around your hips and write the measurement. Move the measuring tape down so it circles around the widest part of your hips. It's important to write the measurement for the widest part or your skirt won't fit properly. [3] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021.

      "content": "Divide the waist and hip measurements by 4. You'll need to adjust the waist and hip measurements in order to find the width for your skirt. Take each measurement and divide by 4. Then, write down the new measurement. [7] X Research source For example, if the waist was 24 inches (61 cm), it's now 6 inches (15 cm). If your hips measured 34 inches (86 cm), the new measurement will be 8 1 ⁄ 2 inches (22 cm)."

Subtract 3 inches (7.6 cm) and write the new measurement. [8] X Research source For example, if your original measurement was 19 inches (48 cm), subtract 3 inches (7.6 cm) to get 16 inches (41 cm)."

For example, if your length measurement is 34 inches (86 cm), the pattern paper should be at least 34 inches (86 cm) long. Then, place a yardstick down the long side of the paper. [9] X Research source If you don't have pattern paper, use lightweight butcher paper. You'll use the yardstick to mark your measurements on the side of the pattern paper."

Then, make a mark at the quarter measurement for the waist and the hip.

Then, add a few inches to the horizontal length line to give your skirt its flare. [16] X Research source For example, you might add 3 inches (7.6 cm) if you'd like the skirt to have a noticeable flare."

To make smooth curves on your pattern, use a pattern master to draw from the knee line mark through the hip line mark up to the waistline mark. [17] X Research source You can buy the curved pattern master from most craft supply stores. You should now see a curve from the waist to the knee and a diagonal line flaring to the length line."

When you reach the bottom point of the dart, cut a V to remove the dart completely. Repeat this for the other panel.

The paper should connect from the knee line to the length line. Then, draw a diagonal line from the bottom of the extended length line to the point of the knee line.

Then, lay 1 of the panels on the fabric so the straight side matches the fold. [24] X Research source You can readjust the fabric's width once you've laid the pattern piece on it.

Now you'll need to add space for a seam allowance, so use the tailor's chalk to draw an identical pattern that's 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the outline you just made. If you'd like to hem the bottom of the skirt, add a 1 inch (2.5 cm) seam allowance. [26] X Research source"

Remember that you shouldn't cut along the fold. Instead, you'll open up the folded fabric to see the entire piece. Now you can pin the pieces for sewing your skirt. [27] X Research source Since this is a big sewing project, you should use a sewing machine to sew the skirt panels together."
