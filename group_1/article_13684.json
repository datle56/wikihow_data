      "content": "Start with an online search. Many sites provide background searches either cheaply or for free. Keep in mind, though, that internet searches might return inaccurate or outright false information. Make sure to verify all the information you find. When using a search engine, put quotation marks around the name of the person you’re researching. [1] X Research source This ensures that the engine looks for the entire name instead of breaking it up. You want \"John Smith,\" not \"John Brown\" and \"Jim Smith.\" Include extra identifying information to make sure you find the right person: \"Bill Gates\" Microsoft."

      "content": "Search the public records. Information about arrests, convictions, and incarcerations is part of the public record. You can often access relevant documents through governmental websites for courts and police departments. Note that while many counties provide online databases, some still store public records in hard copy. If you can't find records online, contact the county courthouse to find out how to get access the public archives. You may have to pay a small fee to make photocopies of the documents you want to take with you. Remember to search documents in all states where your subject has lived, and to search county and city websites as well."

      "content": "Be willing to put in the work. If you rely on public records for your research, you'll have to invest a great deal of time to get a complete background picture. Even checking the courts in every county where the subject has ever lived isn't enough! You also have to look at every county where he's potentially had a run-in with the law — even if he's never lived there! This can be time consuming and difficult."

      "title": "Ask for information directly from the person.",
      "content": "Ask for information directly from the person. Many records (credit reports, school records, military records, etc. ) are off limits without the subject's permission. To get such information, you might try asking the person you're researching to provide it. While nobody has to give you access to their records, you can take a refusal into consideration when making decisions. For example, if you're considering a potential new roommate, you want to make sure they pay bills on time. Ask for a copy of his or her credit report before making your decision. If the person doesn't provide the information you need, you can choose not to move forward with the arrangement."

      "content": "Hire a professional. Private citizens can hire any legal service to run a background check. Search the internet for “background check service” to find local companies in your area. Research the company well before contracting its services to make sure it's a reliable, reputable firm — not a scam. Read online reviews to see whether customers are generally satisfied with their results. Private companies and citizens can't access all the records law enforcement agencies can. As such, the information gathered by private agencies may not be as reliable. Beware of scam artists! Don't do business with companies that charge too much below or above the industry standard. Compare prices with other companies in the area who provide similar services."

      "content": "Consider screening potential employees. Many government positions or other jobs with a security clearance require background checks. Private sector employers don't have to run a background check on potential hires, but it's a good idea to cover your bases. No matter how honest someone seems in an interview, your new employee's actions may hurt someone. If you didn't perform a background check on that employee, your company might be liable for negligent hiring. A background check can help insulate your company from such risk. Most states demand criminal background checks on people who work with children, the elderly or people with disabilities."

You cannot conduct a background search based on someone's race, sex, nationality, age, disability, or religion. For example, running background checks only on Muslim or African American applicants would violate equal opportunity laws. So, too, would \"people under 30\" or \"men.\" You might run background checks on everyone who applies to work for you.

      "content": "Understand what an official Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) is. If you are an employer using an outside agency to conduct a background check, federal law requires you to use a registered CRA. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a CRA must follow strict standards for data protection and offer dispute resolution. There are many different types of CRAs to fit your needs. For example, a CRA might focus on credit, insurance, employment, or rental history. Research CRAs carefully before contracting services. Because there is such a wide variety, you need to ask about specific services to make sure they fit your needs."

      "content": "Consider hiring an Employment Screening Company. This is a popular category of CRA that provides a special credit report called an “Employment Report.” The document lists everything on a person's actual credit report aside from their credit score. This includes payment history, prior addresses, and prior employers. Normal credit reports affect the subject's credit score. A request for an “Employment Report,” though, has no effect on it. Most CRAs don't list credit scores because asking (without reason) is illegal in some states. A good reason to request an employee's credit score might be if the person would be handling your money."

      "content": "Work within legal time restrictions. Under federal law, CRAs generally won't reveal civil lawsuits or judgments, arrest accounts out for collection, or paid tax liens over 7 years old. You likely won't learn about bankruptcies that occurred over 10 years ago, either. But you can request that history beyond 7 years be included in your report if your state allows it. [4] X Research source A few states have stricter regulations that protect even criminal records older than 7 years. Even though arrest records are public records, some states don't allow them to be used in hiring decisions."

[5] X Trustworthy Source US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission U.S. government agency that enforces civil rights in the workplace Go to source You also can't consider prior bankruptcy in most decisions unless it's relevant to the position. Official criminal records (\"Rap Sheets\") aren't always public records. Some states allow access only for special cases, like law enforcement and childcare facilities.

But, there's often nothing stopping you from directly asking your potential new hire for answers. For instance, \"Have you EVER been arrested?\" is an acceptable question even though CRAs can only report on the past seven years of criminal history. Be aware that asking these questions early in the application process might expose you to liability. You can't exclude every applicant who answers “yes.” Allow them to provide an explanation, and take it into consideration before making your decision."

[6] X Research source At the same time, gather general information like current employment and wages, cars, work hours, past landlords or employment, etc. You might also ask about any arrests, convictions, or incarcerations.

(Some require you pay it as part of your operating costs.) If the applicant pays for the credit check, make sure they understand what you'll be doing with that money. Also make clear that it's not a refundable deposit. You may want to give applicants a discount on the fee so you don’t scare them away from even applying to rent with you."

As a landlord, you're looking for a debt load too high to manage with the applicant’s income. Remember that a credit report will only have information from the past seven years (or, ten years for some things). Some reports will also contain a \"FICO\" Score ranging from 300 to 900. The higher the score, the better. Anything above the mid-600s is usually thought to be low-risk. If you reject an applicant due to information on the Credit Report, you should give an “Adverse Action” notice. This letter should provide contact information for the agency you used to get that report. The tenant can choose to dispute the information the agency provided. Applicants can receive a free copy of the Credit Report from that agency so long as they dispute the information within 60 days."

Note that some states allow a fair housing claim to be filed past the two years, in which case you should keep the reports longer."
