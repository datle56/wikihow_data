This will let them know you are interested in them. [1] X Research source Don’t overdo it by staring.

Smiling shows that you are a cheerful person and that you are happy to see your crush. [2] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Matchmaker & Dating Expert Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. [3] X Research source Make sure your smile is warm and genuine. Don’t force it. This is a great way to start flirting, especially if you are shy and haven’t gotten up the nerve to talk to your crush yet. Even if you are too shy to say hello yet, a smile is a way to say hi without speaking. From there, you can build up the nerve to say hi and eventually start a conversation."

      "content": "Do activities with them to make it obvious that you like being around them. Ask your crush to be your partner in a classroom activity or on a project. Try to be on their team during gym class. It’s ok to make it clear that you want to be near them. This will clue them in to the fact that you like them, and allow them to consider whether they might like you, too. [4] X Research source You can “accidentally” throw the ball near your crush while you are playing sports so that you have to go pick it up near them. This is a perfect opportunity to make eye contact and flash them a smile. If you’re shy and haven’t talked to your crush yet, joining groups or teams that they're in can give them the opportunity to start talking to you first. If you subtly show them that you like being around them, then conversations are more likely to naturally occur."

      "content": "Say hello when you pass your crush in the hallways. A simple hello is the easiest way to start talking to someone. It just takes a few seconds and will at least show your crush that you know they exist. [7] X Research source When you have a crush on someone, your first instinct might be to ignore them or look down at your phone when you pass them in the hallway. Try your best to ignore this instinct. Make eye contact, smile, and say hi! Saying hi is a great first step before having a conversation if you tend to be shy. This way, you will get used to having a verbal interaction with your crush before you try to have a full-on conversation."

Try throwing out one of those lame lines you’ve heard or read before and you will at least get a laugh. [8] X Research source Don’t use lines like this out of the blue on someone you don’t know at all or haven’t even said hi to. This is creepy and will not go the way you want it to! Embrace the awkwardness of using a cheesy line. Your goal is to come off as cute and funny to your crush. However, flirting isn’t a perfect science, and not everyone responds in the same way. How they react will depend on your crushes personality. Always be respectful. If your crush doesn’t seem to think it’s funny, then don’t keep trying. If they seem offended, then it might be a good idea to apologize and say you were just trying to be funny."

I really like that blue shirt you’re wearing, it brings out the blue in your eyes.” or “I really like your painting. You have some serious talent!” Don’t give them a compliment every single time you see them. This could make you come on too strong. Once a day or a couple compliments a week is a good amount to show that you’re interested in them, without being over the top."
