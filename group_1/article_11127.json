      "title": "Brush out your hair to get rid of tangles.",
      "content": "Brush out your hair to get rid of tangles. Start with dry hair, then run a brush through your hair, working from the bottom up. Starting at the bottom helps you detangle your hair without yanking it so much at the scalp. As it comes untangled, move up your hair, always brushing down towards your tips. Try not to brush your hair when it's wet, as it could damage your hair. Similarly, don't use heat tools on wet hair, either. Tangles and knots will make your curls appear uneven. Plus, it will be more difficult to separate and curl your layers if your hair isn't brushed. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a spritz of heat protectant to limit damage from curling irons.",
      "content": "Add a spritz of heat protectant to limit damage from curling irons. Give your hair a light coating of a thermal protecting spray by misting it over your hair and then brushing the spray through it. Once it's on, it will help protect your hair from the heat as you curl. [2] X Research source Some sprays also offer a little bit of hold, which will help keep the curls in place when you're done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a newer curling iron or wand if possible.",
      "content": "Pick a newer curling iron or wand if possible. Older curling irons tend to heat unevenly after a while, so if you're having trouble getting your hair to curl, it may be time to get a new one. [3] X Research source If you can afford it, opt for one that's professional grade, which will heat more evenly. [4] X Research source Look for one that has a ceramic or a tourmaline plate. Clean your curling iron or wand regularly to make it last longer and help it evenly heat your hair."

    {
      "title": "Split your hair in half with a comb.",
      "content": "Split your hair in half with a comb. Part your hair as you normally do, running from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Comb the hair to both sides to form a long part. [5] X Research source It's okay to play around with your part, if you like. However, keep in mind that your layers will look best if you stick to your normal part, which is how your stylist likely parted your hair when they cut your layers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate your hair into 2 parts on each side.",
      "content": "Separate your hair into 2 parts on each side. Run a comb across your hair from your temples to the center of the back of your head, making a horizontal part just above your ear. Try to just catch the bottom layer of hair so it will be mostly the same length. Do the same on the other side. [6] X Research source Sectioning off your hair will make it easier to curl."

    {
      "title": "Tie your hair up with ponytail holders or clips.",
      "content": "Tie your hair up with ponytail holders or clips. Pull the top layer on both sides of your head into tiny buns, then secure them with clips or ponytail holders to keep them out of the way. Gather the bottom layer of hair on one side into a small ponytail holder or clip so that it will be out of the way. [7] X Research source Leave the bottom layer on the other side down. If your hair has multiple layers, it's best to create multiple buns on each side. This will make it easier to curl each layer and will create the best look."

      "title": "Wrap the hair on the iron or wand starting at the roots.",
      "content": "Wrap the hair on the iron or wand starting at the roots. This may seem counter-intuitive, but you want to heat your roots more than your tips. Hold the curling iron vertical up close to your scalp. Next, grab a small section of hair that's about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide from the bottom layer you have loose and tuck it under the clip if yours has one. Then, wind the hair around the iron or wand. When you get to the tips, leave the last 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so out, holding onto the end to keep it in place. [8] X Research source When wrapping the hair, wind it away from your face. Work with just the bottom layer on 1 side first. For this type of curl, it's best to use a curling iron or wand that has a .75 to 1 in (1.9 to 2.5 cm) barrel. To vary your curl sizes, you'll need to use a different sized curling iron or wand. For tighter curls, use a smaller curling iron or wand, such as a .5 in (13 mm) curling wand. If you want really loose curls, choose a larger barrel, such as a 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) iron or wand."

      "content": "Continue curling 1 in (2.5 cm) sections until the bottom layer is done. Work your way from 1 end of the section to the other so that all of your hair is curled. After you curl a section, move it to the side to make it easier to tell which pieces are curled. As you curl your hair, check your work by standing in front of a large mirror and angling a medium-sized mirror behind you. [10] X Research source Finish the entire layer before you move on to another layer. Otherwise, you'll likely miss a piece."

Use a comb to create a horizontal part from your temples to the center of the back of your head, bringing down the next layer of hair that's all about the same length. Clip the rest of the hair back in place. [11] X Research source Curl this hair the same way you did the bottom layer."

Don't try to rush, as the top layers will be the most visible. Take your time to do each section consistently so that your style turns out well. [12] X Research source For thicker hair or hair with multiple levels, you'll likely need to let down your hair several times. Just take your time, as this will ensure your layers are as even as possible."

Working layer by layer makes it easier to curl all of your hair and get a consistent curl.

This will create loose curls rather than a straight style. Go slowly as you get used to the motion so that you do it correctly.

To make this easier, you can twist and release at the top, middle, and end of your hair rather than trying to pull your hair through."

Grab a small section of your hair, maybe 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm), and twist it to make a cord, then wrap it around the band. Loop it over the top and out the bottom multiple times until you have the whole strand wrapped up in the band. Continue sectioning and wrapping your hair until it's all wrapped. [21] X Research source With an elastic headband, just put the band in place around your head and wrap your hair around it in the same way. This works well for long layers. Repeat the process until you have all your hair wrapped around the band. Mist your hair lightly with hairspray, then wear it overnight or for several hours. To take it down, untie the bandana, and slide it out from the loops you've made. Run your fingers through your hair to loosen your curls. For a stronger curl, start with damp, towel-dried hair."

Tie it off and then do the other side. Leave it in for several hours or overnight. [22] X Research source The bandana makes the waves bigger than just braiding your hair, as it creates a bigger braid. However, you can just braid it without a bandana for smaller waves. You can also use smaller strips if you don't have a lot of hair, such as thin strips of towel. Start with damp hair for the best results. You can use this process for short or long layers."

Keep rolling it over and over with your hair, trapping your hair around it, until you have a bun up against your head. Leave the bun in for several hours or overnight, then unroll it to get your curls. [23] X Research source You can also use a sock for this purpose. Cut out the toe and then roll the sock on itself to create the donut shape you need to make a bun."
