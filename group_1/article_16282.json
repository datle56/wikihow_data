      "title": "Before buying, check to see if the colorway is official.",
      "content": "Before buying, check to see if the colorway is official. Colorways on the Zoom Lite QS are pretty limited, and many counterfeit pairs feature colorways that don’t exist. Before you buy a pair, check reputable sneaker websites and retailers and review product photos to make sure the colorway is actually legit. If you can’t find one that matches the pair you’re looking at, they might be fake. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Review the listing for any signs of a scam.",
      "content": "Review the listing for any signs of a scam. If you’re shopping on secondhand online stores like Amazon, Craigslist, or eBay, check the seller’s reviews to see if they have a reputation for selling genuine products. Read the item description for any grammar mistakes or spelling errors. If the wording is confusing or hard to understand, your Zoom Lite QS pair may be fake. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check to see if the packaging is labeled and colored correctly.",
      "content": "Check to see if the packaging is labeled and colored correctly. Nike packaging varies, but it tends to come in red, orange, brown, and black and always features the style, size, serial number and/or SKU number , and barcode. Fake pairs feature similar qualities, but they lack the essential details, like proper serial numbers. The box color on fake pairs also tends to be off, so compare it with a box from authentic Nikes, if you’re able. [3] X Research source If you buy the shoes new and they are shipped without a box, there’s a strong possibility that they’re fake. Check the box for an RFID chip. The chip should be located behind the label on the side of the box of Authentic Nikes. Remove the tag, and if the RFID chip isn’t there, your pair is fake."

      "title": "Check the upper for inaccurate branding and sloppy stitching.",
      "content": "Check the upper for inaccurate branding and sloppy stitching. Check the stitching on the outer layers on the laces, toe cap, and swoosh to make sure it is tight and uniform. If not, your pair may be fake. Check the Nike swoosh on the side and back, too. If the side swoosh is too close to the bottom of the shoe or the back swoosh isn’t centered, that’s another sign that your pair might be fake. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the tongue logo and tag for accurate details.",
      "content": "Check the tongue logo and tag for accurate details. The tongue is one of the telltale signs of fake Zoom Lites. Fake pairs often feature a tongue that has more of a plastic texture. The tongue also has crucial sneaker details, like the serial number, size, and country of manufacture, on the inner tag. If that inner tag is missing or the serial number doesn’t match the one on the box, your pair is likely fake. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure the midsole is glued and has wrinkled Zoom technology.",
      "content": "Make sure the midsole is glued and has wrinkled Zoom technology. Smooth Zoom cushioning on the midsole is a strong sign that your pair of Zoom Lite QSs is fake, as the cushioning on a real pair has small ridges. A stitched midsole is also a sign that your pair is fake, as authentic Nikes have midsoles that are glued and extremely hard to remove. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the material of the outsole, it should be high-quality rubber.",
      "content": "Check the material of the outsole, it should be high-quality rubber. Another telltale sign of fake Zoom Lite QSs is an outsole that is made up of a low-quality plastic texture. Authentic pairs tend to have outsoles that are made up of flexible, high-quality rubber. The outsoles on authentic pairs also have even, uniform ridges, so check your pair and make sure the ridges aren’t uneven. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "For Alphaflys, check the weight and texture of the ZoomX.",
      "content": "For Alphaflys, check the weight and texture of the ZoomX. Fake Nike Alphaflys tend to weigh more than real ones. They also tend to have a smoother texture on the ZoomX than real ones, removable insoles, and plastic plates in place of the carbon Flyplates that exist on real Alphaflys. The knit is also harder to see through on fake pairs. The swoosh at the top of the laces is also larger and has less of a gap on fake pairs. [8] X Research source Research the colorway before you buy, as some fake models have colorways that aren’t available on authentic models. Check the box, too! Fake Nike Alphaflys tend to come in small boxes with faded coloring. Nike Alphafly 3s weigh around 7.97 oz (0.498 lbs). Check the bag that comes with the Alphaflys, too. On fake pairs, it tends to be rougher. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "For Air Force 1s, pay close attention to the color of the insole and upper.",
      "content": "For Air Force 1s, pay close attention to the color of the insole and upper. Real Air Force 1s tend to come in an icy white color, while fake ones are more of a cream or off-white color, especially on the outsoles. Check your heel collar, too. Heel collars on real Air Force 1s have a height of 5 MM all around, while fake ones have a height of 0 MM. The “Air Force 1” text on the insoles tends to be thicker on fake models than real ones, so don’t forget to check there, as well. [10] X Research source The insole mesh of real Air Force 1s tends to be circular, while fake models often have a v-cut insole. For some fake pairs, the paper lining in the box is darker than the lining in authentic boxes."

      "title": "For Dunks, check the logo, texture, and color of the upper.",
      "content": "For Dunks, check the logo, texture, and color of the upper. Fake Dunks , especially pairs with suede lining, tend to be lower quality than real pairs. The color on authentic pairs is often dark, glossier, and more detailed, and the stitching is often tighter. The leather and tongue on replicas tend to have a plastic texture. The tongue’s logos and perforation holes are also sloppier on replicas, as the holes tend to be shallower. [11] X Research source The YCM sticker on real pairs of Dunks has lines coming from the center and a forest green color, while the sticker on fakes is a lighter shade of green and doesn’t contain the same lines. Check your Nike swoosh! On fake pairs, the swoosh tends to be placed higher on the shoe compared to real pairs. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "For Court Zoom Lite models, check the swoosh and midsole.",
      "content": "For Court Zoom Lite models, check the swoosh and midsole. Authentic Zoom Court Lite models have a midsole that is designed to be comfortable during dynamic movement. If you wear a run in your pair and find the push off for your strides to be shallow and uncomfortable, you may be rocking a pair of fake Zoom Court Lites. The swoosh placement is also a telltale sign, as it tends to be closer to the midsole on fake pairs. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Nikes tend to be expensive because of the brand and quality of materials.",
      "content": "Nikes tend to be expensive because of the brand and quality of materials. Nike has always been synonymous with quality. Their innovations to sneaker technology and use of high-grade leather, breathable mesh, and other quality materials have solidified their position as a premium sneaker brand. This position, coupled with the cost of materials, contributes to Nike’s high prices. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Nike Zoom technology is a cushioning system that assists with speed and agility.",
      "content": "Nike Zoom technology is a cushioning system that assists with speed and agility. Nike Zoom technology, better known as Zoom Air, is a cushioning system that uses tensile fibers that compress when stepped on and spring when the wearer lifts off. This creates a push-off effect in the sole of the shoes that assists with speed and agility. [15] X Research source Shoes that have Nike Zoom technology include the Alphafly 3s, the Structure 25s, and the Pegasus models."

      "title": "Avoid very low prices, make sure the seller is legit, and check the listing for errors.",
      "content": "Avoid very low prices, make sure the seller is legit, and check the listing for errors. Try your best to steer clear from buying Nikes that have a ridiculously low price. Check the seller’s page and read their reviews to make sure they sell authentic products. Review the listing for errors. If you notice any spelling errors, grammar mistakes, or questionable elements, avoid buying the shoes. [16] X Research source If you see a pair of Jordan 4s that retail for $400 on sale for $45, there’s a strong chance they’re fake."
