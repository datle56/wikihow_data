      "content": "Gunk and filth stuck in your sink overflow can create a really nasty smell. Slip on a pair of disposable gloves and dig into the central drain of your sink with a long brush or pipe cleaner—this will help you get to the gunk and grime in your sink’s overflow. Rinse off your brush periodically and keep scrubbing out the muck until it’s gone. You can also stick a rubber funnel into your drain and pour boiling water down it to clean out the overflow. If your sink overflow is really smelly, dump 1 cup (230.4 g) of baking soda down the drain, along with 1 c (240 mL) of white vinegar . Let the mixture foam and work its magic in your drain; then, pour boiling water into the drain to clear everything out."

      "title": "Water traps help block off unpleasant odors from the rest of your pipes.",
      "content": "Water traps help block off unpleasant odors from the rest of your pipes. These devices are designed to hold water and block unpleasant sewer smells from floating into your living space. When a bad smell starts filling the air, dump a pitcher or bucket of water down the drain to refill the water trap—with any luck, the foul sewer smell will vanish. [1] X Research source Water traps are the “U”-shaped sections of pipe beneath your sink. This curved pipe creates a water barrier between your sink and the rest of your pipes, which prevents nasty smells from floating through your pipes and into your home."

      "content": "A deteriorated wax ring may be the source of the bad smell. Switch off the water valve connected to your toilet and remove the toilet from the floor. Then, remove the wax seal and install a new one. This can help prevent leaks from the bottom of your toilet, which will definitely reduce the sewage smell in the area. [2] X Research source You’ll need a dry towel or sponge, plastic cup, flathead screwdriver, wrench or pliers, and rubber gloves to complete this project. Wax rings are super cheap—you can find them online, at home improvement shops, or at big retail stores."

      "content": "A clear line of silicone caulk prevents nasty smells and odors from wafting out. Stick multiple strips of painter’s tape along the edge and base of the toilet, leaving 1 ⁄ 2 cm (0.20 in) of space between them. Then, squeeze an even, consistent line of silicone caulk along the front and sides of the toilet, between the strips of tape. Pull away the tape and let the caulk set for a full day. Scrape away any old caulk lines with a razor blade before applying a new line to the bottom of your toilet. Flush the toilet first and see if any water is seeping out from the base. If you notice water pooling, you’ll need to remove your toilet and install a new wax ring first. Don’t apply any caulk along the back edge of the toilet. This way, you can tell if your toilet starts to leak around the base."

      "title": "Clogged, blocked-off pipes can definitely contribute to a gross sewer smell.",
      "content": "Clogged, blocked-off pipes can definitely contribute to a gross sewer smell. Check your toilet, tub, sink, and shower drains to see if they’re draining slowly or completely blocked off. If you notice any slow drainage, take a moment to unclog your toilet , tub , sink , or shower drain . Clearing away the blockages may help clear away any nasty sewage smells, too. [3] X Research source Start by taking off the sink trap in the pipes under the sink. Empty out whatever is blocking the pipe, then replace the trap. This should clear out your pipes easily. A plunger easily removes clogs without damaging your pipes. Try to stick with traditional unclogging methods like plungers and power augers instead of using chemical products. Clog removers are really bad for the environment and may damage your pipes over time. Try using a mixture of baking soda and white vinegar to clear out clogs naturally. Dump ½ cup (115.2 g) of baking soda into the clogged drain, along with 1 c (240 mL) of white vinegar. Wait 5-10 minutes for the mixture to react, and then pour 4 c (950 mL) of boiling water down the drain. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "A drain plug keeps any sewer smells from wafting up. Look for floor drains in your garage, basement, and bathrooms. Remove the cover and measure the width of your drain so you know what size plug you need. Then, head to the hardware store or shop online to find a plug that’ll fit snugly in your drain opening. There are different models to choose from, like: [5] X Research source Test balls Twist plugs Pressure plugs Backflow valves"

Scrub any leftover muck from the splash guard with some dish detergent, and pull out any obvious food scraps from the main disposal with a set of pliers. [6] X Research source Clean out your garbage disposal naturally with a mixture of white vinegar and baking soda. Feel free to grind some lemon peels in the disposal, too. You can also give your garbage disposal a good cleaning by grinding up 2 cups (300 g) of ice and 1 cup (273 g) of salt."

      "content": "Leaking or broken pipes can definitely make a stench in your home. Check your home for water leaks by inspecting your water meter. Then, inspect the surfaces around and beneath your pipes to see if they feel damp. If you notice any drips or puddles, there’s a good chance that your pipe is leaking. Feel free to fix these leaking pipes yourself , or to call a plumber for repairs. [7] X Research source Only repair your own pipes if you feel comfortable working with your own plumbing. If you don’t have a lot of DIY or home repair experience, you’re better off calling a plumber for help."

Sewer odor can be caused by a lot of different factors, and it can be tough to figure out the exact cause of the smell on your own. If basic solutions and quick fixes don’t seem to be helping, call a plumber to figure out what exactly is going on. Don't try to snake a sink by yourself because it's really easy to damage your pipes. Always call in a professional if the clog is bad enough to use a snake."
