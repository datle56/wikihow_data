[1] X Research source Fill out all the required fields, submit the form, and wait to receive an answer. Facebook disables accounts that violate their terms. This may mean you were using a fake name, impersonating someone, or using behavior that goes against Facebook's community standards . If you think Facebook disabled your account by mistake, you can continue with this method to submit an appeal. You can only submit an appeal within the first 180 days of your account being disabled. If your account has been disabled for more than 180 days, it's been permanently purged and can no longer be recovered."

      "content": "Confirm that your friend blocked you . Before you even attempt to contact your friend about the suspected blocking, make sure that they did indeed block you rather than simply deleting or deactivating their account. Here's one way to check: Go to https://facebook.com/messages and click a conversation with the person. It can be a one-on-one or a group conversation. Can you see the person's profile photo at the top of the message? If it's a group convo, do you see their profile photo in the far-right panel under \"Chat members?\" If so, their account is active, which means they haven't deactivated it. If the person has no profile photo and you can't access their profile, they've likely deactivated their account, not blocked you. Click the person's name at the top of the message (if it's a one-on-one chat). If it's a group chat, click the three dots next to their name and select View Profile . If you see their profile, you are not blocked. But if you see \"This content isn't available right now,\" you're blocked."

      "title": "Consider why the person may have blocked you.",
      "content": "Consider why the person may have blocked you. If the block occurred out of the blue, the person may have blocked you because of work- or school-related reasons (for example, newly promoted managers often must block their employees as per their contract). If you recently had an ideological debate or argument with the person, however, there might be a more personal reason for the block."

      "title": "Find a way to contact your friend outside of Facebook.",
      "content": "Find a way to contact your friend outside of Facebook. Try a phone number, an email address, or other social media accounts. Another way to contact someone who blocked you is by creating a new Facebook account , finding their profile, and messaging them from there. This will only work if their security settings allow you to look them up, and your message may not be sent directly to them due to Facebook Messenger's filtering system for people who aren't friends. Warning: Depending on your relationship with the person who blocked you and their reasons for blocking you, contacting them on another platform may seem like harassment and cause a further rift. You should give them some time before trying to contact them. Only contact them if they are a close friend or family member and you really want to mend your relationship with them. Remember that when people block you on social media, they are usually trying to set a boundary. Be respectful of that."

However, if they're open to unblocking you, make sure you listen to their side of the situation. If your friend doesn't respond, don't follow up with additional communications."
