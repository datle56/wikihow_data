Visit the YouTube page on Google Trends to find out which topics viewers are most interested in right now. [2] X Research source If any of the trending topics are relevant to the kind of content you make, consider making a video about it. For instance, if your channel is about pet care, check the trending topics in the “Pets & Animals” category. If you see that “axolotl” is trending, you could make a video about how to set up an axolotl tank. Studies also show that the most successful videos are ones that give viewers a boost of positive emotion. Post something that’s not only relevant, but also cute, fun, or heartwarming to increase the chances that people will share your videos with others.

Select Basic Info , then click the Edit button next to your channel name. Enter the name you want into the text box. [4] X Research source Try to choose a name that’s short, simple, and reflects what your channel is about. For instance, a good name for a cooking channel might be something like “Cooking with Kathleen” or “Omar’s Kitchen”. While you’re at it, fill out the description for your channel, which is also located under the Basic Info tab. Write a few lines explaining what kind of content your viewers can expect. For instance, “My name is Lucy, and I make digital art. Subscribe for tips, tutorials, and livestreams showing my creation process!”"

[5] X Research source To customize the look of your channel, log in to YouTube Studio at https://studio.youtube.com/ . Select Customization from the menu bar on the left side of the page. You can add custom channel art (such as a profile pic, banner, and watermark) in the Branding tab. The Layout tab allows you to add new sections to help organize your content.

Most subscribers are interested in getting a specific type of content—not lots of different videos on a variety of random topics. While it’s okay to experiment with your approach, try to pick a theme and stick with it. You can even choose a popular keyword and build your content off of that. [7] X Research source For example, maybe your research shows that tons of people are looking up ASMR videos right now. Consider creating an ASMR channel, but adding your own, personal twist—such as ASMR videos where you bake, draw, or unbox new merch."

If viewers know they’re going to get a shiny new video from a favorite content creator once a week, they’ll be a lot more likely to subscribe. Set a schedule for yourself and do your best to stick to it. Let your viewers know when they can expect more. For instance, you might say “See you next week with another video!” at the end of every video you post. [8] X Research source One great way to stay consistent is to prepare material ahead of time, then schedule when each video will go live. When you upload a video, select the Visibility tab in the editing menu and click Schedule . This will allow you to set the time, date, and time zone when you want your video to be published.

[10] X Research source It’s also a good idea to include relevant keywords that your audience is likely to search for. There are a few good ways to do this: Look at your competitors’ most popular videos and check out their titles. What kinds of keywords do they tend to use most often? Try typing in a query related to your video in the YouTube search bar. See what other keywords pop up in the autofill results. For example, if you type in “nails,” you’ll see that other users searched for terms like “nails acrylic,” “nails design,” and “nails for beginners.” Use an SEO tool designed for YouTube, such as VidIQ or TubeBuddy, to research possible keywords to include in your titles."

      "content": "An eye-catching thumbnail will entice more viewers. Instead of choosing any old random frame from your video, take advantage of YouTube’s feature that allows you to create your own thumbnail. To add a custom thumbnail to a video, click the Create button at the top of the YouTube Studio page to upload your video. When you’re filling out the information about your video, go to the Thumbnail section and select Upload Thumbnail . [11] X Research source You can also add custom thumbnails to videos that are already uploaded. Sign in to YouTube Studio and select Content from the left-hand menu. Select the video you want by clicking on its thumbnail, then click Upload Thumbnail to add your custom image. In order to use custom thumbnails, you’ll need to verify your YouTube account first. To make a good custom thumbnail, choose images that are fun to look at and accurately reflect what the video is about. For instance, if you’re posting a review of a new game controller, use a clear photo or screenshot of yourself using the controller, or show a closeup image of the controller. You can also include a few words of text in your thumbnail. For example, “Best Controller Ever?!” Just make sure to position them so they won’t be covered by the timestamp in the lower right corner of the thumbnail."

You can also engage your audience by inviting them to leave questions, comments, or suggestions in your video or video description. Or, ask them a question. For instance, “What are some of your favorite cookie recipes? Answer in the comments below!” Show your audience you’re listening by incorporating their suggestions into later videos, or by taking a moment at the beginning of a new video to answer their questions from the last one."

When you make videos together with other YouTubers, their fans are more likely to check out your work—and vice versa. The end result is that both of you are likely to gain new subscribers! [18] X Expert Source Timothy Linetsky Music Producer & Instructor Expert Interview. 13 February 2019. [19] X Research source If possible, choose someone whose work complements your own. For instance, if you run a channel about making beaded jewelry, you might invite another YouTuber who does wire-wrapped jewelry to collab with you. Don’t worry if you don’t quite feel ready to do a collaboration yet. You can also engage with other YouTubers by commenting on their videos or mentioning them in your own videos. This can be a great starting point for building your network."

[20] X Research source While you might be tempted to use a service that allows you to pay for subscribers, it’s best to avoid these. For one thing, it goes against YouTube’s terms of service to artificially inflate your subscription count or pay for subscribers. [21] X Research source You’re also less likely to build a genuinely active and interested fanbase that way."
