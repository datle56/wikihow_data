      "content": "Grab the pull-up bar with one hand. Rest the other hand on one of the vertical sidebars. Keep both arms as straight as so your upper body muscles stay engaged. Upper body strength is of the utmost importance when doing a human flag. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Lift your feet off the ground.",
      "content": "Lift your feet off the ground. Press into the support beam with your bottom hand, then pull your upper body and legs up with your top hand. Avoid bending your elbows, as your form will be much stronger if your arms remain straight."

      "title": "Raise your hips in the air.",
      "content": "Raise your hips in the air. Kick your legs forward to lift your hips further in the air. Pull away from your top arm while pressing your bottom arm into the side pole. Tuck your knees close in to your body to prevent them from dragging your hips downward. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold this pose for as long as you can to strengthen your upper body.",
      "content": "Hold this pose for as long as you can to strengthen your upper body. This is the first phase of a human flag—from here, you can do the vertical or classic human flag pose. If you notice your hips drooping downward, lift them and align them with your shoulders. [3] X Research source Aim to maintain this position for at least 30 seconds before you attempt a vertical or classic human flag."

    {
      "title": "Do a vertical human flag before attempting the classic human flag.",
      "content": "Do a vertical human flag before attempting the classic human flag. The vertical human flag is both an easier version of the position and the second step in doing the classic human flag. It requires less upper body strength to hold. Practice the vertical human flag a few times before transitioning into the full-on human flag."

    {
      "title": "Extend your legs into the air from the tucked position.",
      "content": "Extend your legs into the air from the tucked position. Lift your legs slowly above your shoulders until you're able to reach a diagonal position. Keep your legs straight to maintain the ideal form, as bent legs look crooked. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Lift your legs until they are as vertical as possible.",
      "content": "Lift your legs until they are as vertical as possible. Aim to make your legs parallel to the side pole. Hold this position to achieve the vertical human flag, which you can then lower into a classic human flag from."

    {
      "title": "Bend your knees to ease weight off of your body.",
      "content": "Bend your knees to ease weight off of your body. If you cannot hold the vertical human flag position for long, try bending your knees. This can make your pressure more centered and prevent you from losing your balance. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Lower your legs from the vertical flag position.",
      "content": "Lower your legs from the vertical flag position. Keep one knee bent while straightening out the other and move your hips downward until they and your legs are parallel to the ground. Lower your hips slowly so any more pressure on your body is added gradually. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Straighten out both of your legs.",
      "content": "Straighten out both of your legs. This will increase pressure on your upper body, especially your core. Try to maintain this position as long as possible—if you feel your grip weakening, tuck one leg into your chest again for an easier \"bent\" human flag position."

    {
      "title": "Let go of the bar if you start to fall.",
      "content": "Let go of the bar if you start to fall. If you can feel your grip slipping, let go of both poles. This will allow you to land safely on your feet. Holding onto the pole while you're slipping increases your chance of tearing a shoulder muscle, which can cause long-term damage. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Do an oblique tip to strengthen your biceps. Lie on your side with your legs completely straight. Prop your body up with your bottom arm to put the pressure on your bicep.

      "content": "Try handstand pushups to exercise your shoulders. Lift yourself into a handstand, then bend your arms until your head is almost touching the floor. Lower yourself down as far to the ground as possible without hitting your head, then rise back up to complete one handstand pushup. Keep your neck straight to prevent contorting your spine. If you have a hard time maintaining your balance, practice handstand pushups against a wall."

      "content": "Practice pull-ups to work your arm, shoulder, and back muscles. Grab your pull-up bar and pull your upper body up until your chin is just above the bar line. Then, lower yourself to the ground until your arms are completely extended."
