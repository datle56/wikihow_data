      "content": "Urinate before starting the massage. Be sure to urinate before massaging your uterus. A full bladder will press against the uterus, making it relax and bleed more extensively. Emptying your bladder will also make it easier to concentrate on the massage.

      "content": "Gently massage your lower abdomen. Uterine massage for fertility should be conducted in largely the same way as postnatal uterus massage, if not slightly more intense due to the lack of pain and sensitivity. Use the flat of your hand and fingers to gently press and rub your abdomen in circular motions.

      "content": "Do self uterine massage for 1-3 months. For best results, give yourself regular uterine massages for a period of one to three months. Conducting the massage daily should reposition the uterus and clear any blockages preventing conception within this time frame. Regular massaging will also improve circulation, which will have benefits for your fertility and overall health. During menstrual days, opt for a gentler abdominal massage instead of a uterine massage."
