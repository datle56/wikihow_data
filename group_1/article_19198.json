      "content": "Brush off the excess paint. Use a coarse brush or toothbrush to flake off the dried excess paint. For smaller stains, you may be able to pick off dried chunks with your fingernail. Removing the dried top layer will allow you greater access to the set-in stain underneath. It will also be a more efficient, quicker way of removing the larger part of the stain."

      "title": "Apply a soapy mixture to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply a soapy mixture to the stain. Apply a solution of one part detergent, one part warm water, to a damp cloth and apply it to the stained area of the shoe. Depending on the size and strength of the stain, you may need to apply some nail polish remover to a damp cloth and work that into the stain, as well. Since acrylic paint is water-based, removing it is usually just a matter of moisturizing it to remove it. Do this until the paint softens into the fabric of the shoe. Once the dry paint has softened, it will be easier to dissolve away from the fabric."

      "title": "Scrape off the softened paint.",
      "content": "Scrape off the softened paint. Use a butter knife to scrape off the now soft paint. The paint should rub right off the shoe. There will still be a light layer of paint set into the fabric below. However, the large majority of the paint should now be gone."

Use lots of water and do not be afraid to reapply as needed. Try to keep the canvas as wet as possible. It will be easier to remove the stain if the canvas is wet. The water will keep the fabric flexible and activate the detergent as you work on the stain."

Make sure to use the appropriate type of paint thinner based on which kind of paint the shoes are stained with. Also be sure to read the directions on the paint thinner packaging for details about use. You can also apply the thinner with a cotton ball, but make sure not to rub it against the paint. Dab it gently."
