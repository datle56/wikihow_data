      "content": "Purchase poles with comfortable wrist straps. Wrist straps allow for a release of the pole on your backstroke without dropping the pole, and cause the pole to return to your hand in the right position as you bring your arm back into place. Many professionals believe it is important to be able to let go of the pole after you push, which is only possible through means of a wrist strap. Although wrist straps are not vital to Nordic walking, they are recommended and should be taken into consideration while purchasing poles.

Nordic walking can be done while hiking in the mountains or on other dirt trails, working as an alternative to walking sticks. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you are walking on pavement, use the attachable rubber pads that cover the bottom of the pole. These rubber pads should come with your Nordic walking pole, so double check that they are included before you purchase.

Whether you plan to walk leisurely through your neighborhood or hike on a remote trail, it is important to properly strap the poles to your wrists.

This will help you begin Nordic walking with your normal gait and stop you from changing your natural way of walking.

While walking in the way described above, with your arms moving with your lead foot, begin lightly touching your poles to the ground while keeping them at a 45 degree angle. As this becomes more natural, use your arms to push off the poles, propelling your body forward. This will allow you to engage your upper body and take pressure off of the joints in your legs and back."

      "content": "Engage your entire body, focusing on your torso. As practice, stand still and place your hands around your lower rib cage, just below the chest. Keep your head and hips straight while softly turning the rib cage from right to left while observing this natural motion. Begin walking while keeping this rotation to the walk. Allow your torso to move naturally as you push off with the Nordic poles. If done correctly, this rotation to the left naturally moves the right arm forward, and vice versa.
