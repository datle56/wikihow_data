Comparing yourself to others will not make you feel good about yourself because you are different than any other person. There's no one out there just like you, who has grown up with your experiences and who has your talents. If you try to compare yourself to other people, it will not affect your self esteem well, because you can always find someone who is stronger, smarter, or prettier than you. Instead, focus on being the person that you want to become, not like your neighbor, the \"cool\" people in your school, your job, or your neighborhood. Once you define your own version of success, you'll be able to achieve it. You may feel like everyone around you has it better than you do. However, you probably forget all of your amazing strengths. You may not even realize all of the things you have going for you and that someone else wants to be more like you. [1] X Research source"

You have to remind yourself that you're an amazing person and that you deserve to be confident in yourself. If you think you're worth it, then you are. [2] X Research source To look more confident, perk up your body language. Stand taller, have better posture, and look straight ahead instead of at the ground. Try to sit still or stand with an open demeanor to give off a more positive, approachable vibe. Find something to really excel at or work on excelling in something you already love. If you are already great at something, focus on how amazing you are for being able to do those things. Try to focus on your abilities and how capable you are. You'll feel better about yourself if you're good at something that you love. When you're entering an unknown situation, focus on the best thing that can possibly happen instead of what can go wrong.

You can also add things about your physical appearance that you like as well, as long as they are sincerely important to you. You want to cover every aspect of you in this list. You should also add to the list any time you think of something else you're proud of. Keep this list nearby and consult it often to continue feeling good. You can even fold it up and put it in your wallet. If you are having trouble making this list yourself, consult people who know you well.

Developing a positive attitude is a decision you have to make yourself, and stick to every day. If you have a more positive attitude, then you'll feel better about yourself, as well as your future prospects and all that you can accomplish. You can work on recognizing when your thoughts are overly negative and turn them around to lead yourself to a healthier mindset. For every negative thought that crosses your mind, fight it with at least two or three positive thoughts. For example, if you think, \"I look so tired today,\" you can say, \"But my hair looks pretty great and I still have an amazing smile.\" Be compassionate toward yourself. Talk to yourself like you would the person/animal you most love when you're hurting inside. On a deeper level, if you think something like, \"I am just so awkward in social situations,\" you should say, \"But I usually know how to make people laugh and people seem really comfortable around me.\" Work at it every day. Even if your attitude goes unnoticed, practice your positive attitude. You never know how large a difference it can make, and practice will make it easier to do. Practice talking about yourself positively to your friends. Talk about something you've accomplished or something you're excited about. You'll find that your optimism is contagious, and that you'll feel better about yourself just by talking about it out loud.

Fill a whole page and read it over often, adding to it whenever you think of something else. If it is difficult for you to find things to be grateful for, turn this into a positivity exercise. Think of what you are mad about, and push yourself to find 2 good things about every bad situation. For example, you can counter “I’m mad that the dog barking woke me and the baby up at 5am today.” with “1. I spent some bonding time with my son this morning, calming him down; every moment I have with my son is special; and 2. I got to hear the birds chirp as the sun rose.” If you are still struggling, ask others what they are thankful for. You might have something in common."

But your self-esteem should rely mostly upon your personal qualities and character; not your physical appearance. If you want to feel good about yourself, then your main priority should be who you are; and if it’s related, then what you look like. But do make exercise a regular part of your life. You'll feel stronger physically and emotionally. [10] X Research source Limit your prep time. If you spend all your time wishing you looked perfect, then you will focus on less positive, constructive areas of your life. Determine how much time you will spend doing your hair and makeup and looking in the mirror before you go out. Find a routine that fits into that amount of time. If you spend any more time than that on yourself, you are bound to find flaws where none exist. You have much more self worth aside from your appearance. You should take strength and confidence from your actions and achievements instead of your appearance. For example, you have an amazing day where you get commended for a project you have spent weeks working on. When you get home, you finally get a chance to look in the mirror and realize you had mascara smeared under your eye. Despite the fact that you had a smudge on your face, you still accomplished something great and you should be confident in your abilities.

At the end of the day, you are the only person who has to live with himself or herself, so your opinion should matter the most. [11] X Research source People who insult others usually do it to make themselves feel more powerful. This means that they are probably just as insecure as you are. They are the ones who lack confidence, so try to avoid the comments and avoid jabbing back with an insult. The best thing you can do is to live your life exactly how you want to live it without looking back. This may be easier said than done. Instead of being in denial about caring, ask yourself what is at the heart of wanting to please other people. Ask yourself if the people who hurt you are worth impressing. Soon enough, you'll see that they are only an obstacle to your happiness, not a means toward it. [12] X Research source Know whom to trust, and when. For example, most people will say that they trust their own mother the most. However, few people would blindly trust their mother to, say, fly an airplane or rig the lottery.
