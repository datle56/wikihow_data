      "content": "Use Punnett Squares. Ask your biological parents for their blood type. If both your parents know their blood type, you can input their information into Punnett Squares or a blood type calculator to calculate what your blood type might be. While, in most cases, this method will only be enough to guess, knowing’ your parents’ blood types helps narrow down your options to a few distinct possibilities. [1] X Trustworthy Source Red Cross Blood Donation Services Website run by the Red Cross Organization providing information about how and where to donate blood safely Go to source The calculator isn't always right. Don't just say immediately \"Okay I'm B-\" or \"That's it, I'm AB+\". Punnett squares use alleles to predict the probability of inheriting each of your parents’ blood types. There are 2 types of alleles: the dominant alleles I A and I B , and the recessive allele i. If your blood type is O, you have an ii genotype. If your blood type is A, your phenotype is either I A I A or I A i. If your blood type is B, your phenotype is either I B I B or I B i. And if your blood type is AB, your phenotype is I A I B."

      "content": "Ask a doctor who has drawn your blood before. If your physician already has your blood type on file, then you just need to call and ask for this information. However, they will only have your record on file if you've already had your blood drawn and/or tested. Common reasons why you may have already had your blood type tested include: pregnancy, surgery, organ donations, and previous blood transfusoins. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Knowing your blood type can be extremely helpful in case of an emergency. Should a health crisis happen and you need an immediate blood transfusion, you can save precious time by knowing what blood types are compatible with your own. Our blood types are determined by the sugars and proteins on our bodies called antigens. These antigens determine if we’re type A, B, O, or AB, and they fight off foreign antigens to keep our immune systems healthy. This is why certain blood types are incompatible. The existing blood type’s antigens will create an autoimmune response against them called an ABO incompatibility reaction. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Another type of antigen is called the Rh (Rhesus) protein (named after the Rhesus monkey whose blood was tested). Being “Rh positive” means you have this special type of protein on the surface of your red blood cells. It’s estimated that 35% of the population is type O+, 14% is O-, 30% is A+, 8% is A-, 8% is B+, 2% is B-, 2% is AB+, and 1% is AB-. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a blood typing kit.",
      "content": "Use a blood typing kit. Skip the hassle of a doctor visit and determine your blood type at home by purchasing a blood typing take-home kit online or from your local pharmacy. To figure out your blood type using these kits, dampen various labeled patches on the kit’s special card. Then, prick your finger and add a little blood to each patch. Note which patches (or vials of fluid, in some kits) cause the blood to clump (agglutinate) instead of spreading out. This clumping is a reaction that can be used to determine your blood type. Once you've completed the test with all cards or fluids, look up your blood type using the kit instructions. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you don’t want to draw any blood to determine your blood type, certain websites have kits available that use saliva instead. Keep in mind that any blood test conducted at home is less reliable than a test performed by a professional."

First, call or visit your doctor's office and schedule an appointment for blood work. Check to see if you need to make any preparations for the day of your test (such as avoiding medications or eating/drinking). Then, arrive at your doctor’s office and let the doctor or nurse draw your blood. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source When you call, try saying something like, \"I want to find out what my blood type is.

Find a local donation center or wait until your school, church or community center hosts a blood drive. When you go in, ask the staff if they can tell you your blood type.
