      "content": "Start by drawing horizontal ovals for the head and body. Create a small oval or circle for the stegosaurus’ head. Move over slightly to the right and sketch in a much larger oval for the body. Leave enough space for the neck; make this gap about as wide as your that first circle. If you want your stegosaurus to have more of a hunched spine, you can break the big circle into 2 parts. Draw a smaller circle for the front half and a larger circle for the back half. [1] X Research source Since you’ll be erasing all of the ovals later on, make sure you draw them in pencil. If you’re creating a digital drawing, draw these in a separate layer."

      "content": "Add 1 slanted oval inside the body for the hind leg. Before you start adding the legs, start by drawing a slanted oval inside the big oval. Arrange this shape so the top points to the right and the bottom points to the left. This will eventually become the stegosaurus’ hind limb, so position it towards the far-right side of the body. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make 4 small ovals beneath the body for the front and back legs.",
      "content": "Make 4 small ovals beneath the body for the front and back legs. Sketch 2 ovals near the right side, towards the front of the body, and 2 near the left side, towards the back. Make these ovals vertical so that they’re taller than they are wide. So that your stegosaurus appears to be walking, angle the middle 2 ovals toward each other; these will be its left legs. Then angle the furthest-left and furthest-right ovals away from each other; these will become its right legs. Make sure the furthest-left circle floats away from the body. The other 3 can overlap it. For a dinosaur that’s not walking, just angle these all downward. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Create the feet by drawing 4 more little ovals below the legs.",
      "content": "Create the feet by drawing 4 more little ovals below the legs. Draw 1 vertical oval beneath the front leg. Overlap it slightly so that you create a “knee.” Then draw 2 horizontal ovals beneath the middle 2 legs so that it looks like these feet are standing flat on the ground. [4] X Research source Finally, add 1 more angled oval at the back foot. You may need to add a small oval or rectangle to connect the top of the second leg with the foot. Angle this slightly forward so that it looks like there’s a joint here. Angle the oval at the back so that it looks like just the toe is touching the ground. These 4 ovals can be smaller than the ones you drew for the legs."

      "content": "Extend lines out from the body to create the neck and tail. Join the head with the body using 2 curved lines. Create a U-shaped line for the top of the neck. Add a gently-curving line below for the bottom. Extend this one from the middle of the head to the base of the body. Next, create a long, skinny triangle that extends out from the back of the body. This will be the tail. Keep the head and tail roughly in line with each other; don’t make one too much higher than the other. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Draw a series of plates along the stegosaurus’ spine.",
      "content": "Draw a series of plates along the stegosaurus’ spine. Start by drawing a few straight lines that point upward from the spine. Make the ones on the neck and tail slightly shorter and closer together than the ones along the back of the body. Then, sketch in 1 plate around each point, using the line as the center of the plate. Make each one pentagonal (i.e. 5-sided), with a triangle at the top and 2 lines angling inward that connect the triangle with the body. [6] X Research source Angle your lines so the plates fan out slightly. If you want to, you can add a second row of plates that peek out from behind this row. Just sketch in small triangles for the tops of these plates. If you’re making a digital drawing, create another layer for the outline of the plates."

Outline the head, neck, body, and tail using 1 continuous line. Extend this line up and over the dino’s back, around its tail, under its belly, and up around its head and neck. Then, extend another line around the left and right sides of each leg, adding some small curved lines at the base of each leg for the toes. [7] X Research source If you’re working on a digital drawing, create this outline in the same layer as you did the outlines of the plates."

Make sure that you’re only left with the outlines of the body, legs, and spine plates. Once you see what your outline looks like, you can add details around the face.

Make the lower line just a little bit shorter than the upper line. Think of drawing hands on a clock. Make the big hand point at 9 and the little hand point at 8 on the clock face. Leave a little space between the V and the circles; don’t worry about connecting them at this point. If you want to add more detail at this stage, make these straight lines curved.

Then connect a smaller oval to the left of this one for the forearm. Next, draw a vertical oval within the smaller body circle. Attach a small horizontal oval to the bottom of this one so that it looks like this arm is bent. [15] X Research source Feel free to adjust the angles of these ovals to create different arm poses."

Draw 1 of these toward the left side of the body, overlapping it with the base of the body. Finish it off with a second oval angled downward to create the look of a bent knee. Then make 1 more oval on the right side of the body and add a slightly smaller one below it for the other leg. [16] X Research source Keep the bottoms of both legs even with each other."

Since the T-rex’s right leg (which is on the left side of the page) is positioned on an angle, use 2 lines connecting at a right angle. Use 2 straight lines for the left leg (which appears on the right side of the page). Add 3 lines for the toes, with 1 shorter line at the back of the right leg for a fourth toe.

Add some thickness to the straight lines to create the appearance of toes and claws. Connect the body to the neck and tail, and trace around the boxy shapes to add some definition to the head. To create realistic detail, use some squiggly lines to outline the head and mouth as well as each toe. Use smoother, curving lines as you outline the body and legs. First, focus on sketching in the outline of the T-rex’s body parts. Then, go on to add finer details like teeth, claws, and eyes. Add some wrinkles around the eyes for the eyelids.

Use a small kneaded eraser to get into small spots. [19] X Research source If you accidentally erase some of your main drawing, just pencil those details back in before you keep erasing. At this point, you can lightly sketch in some lines to indicate where you’ll use different colors."

Or have fun using your imagination to add colors and textures to your dino drawing. [20] X Research source Use red inside the mouth to suggest a tongue, and use a darker color toward the back of the mouth to add some dimension. It will look like your T-rex is roaring really loudly!"

Next, add a horizontal line with a slightly more pronounced curve. Orient this line like a U, but make the curve more gentle. Make this second line cross over the first like a plus-sign or cross. These will be the arms. Modify the angles of these curves if you want to show your dinosaur flying at a different angle. [21] X Research source"

      "title": "Make 3 triangles for the legs and tail.",
      "content": "Make 3 triangles for the legs and tail. At the bottom of the body oval you just drew, sketch a narrow triangle for the tail. This should go to the very end of the spine. On either side of the tail, add another, slightly wider triangle. Create the feet by adding 4 straight lines to the end of each leg, then connect them with upside-down U-shaped lines to give the look of webbed feet.

Make this line about the same length as the original arm line. Then use another line to connect the end of the wing to the ankles. Make sure you curve these lines slightly to create a more natural wing shape. Sketch in the base of the wings by drawing a curved line between each ankle and tail. To add definition to the arms, draw another line under the first one you drew to suggest the thickness of the arms. Then use a few tiny ovals to suggest hands and fingers. To get the proportions right, make each wing about as wide as the total length of the body and beak."

Next, create a sideways V-shape with 2 curved lines for the tail. [27] X Research source Start the tail at the left side of the body.

Angle the upper legs to the left and the lower legs to the right so it looks like the raptor is bending its knees.
