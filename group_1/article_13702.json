      "title": "Do simple stretches.",
      "content": "Do simple stretches. It is never a good idea to do a back bend or bridge like pose without properly stretching and warming up first. Make sure you stretch your arms, neck, shoulders, back, hips and legs. Hold each stretch for at least 15 to 20 seconds. Don't overstretch. You can injure yourself by pushing a stretch too far."

      "title": "Perform a Cobra.",
      "content": "Perform a Cobra. This is a position in yoga where you bend your back from lying face down on the mat. Lie face-down in the \"prone position\" with your hands underneath your shoulders (so your thumbs are directly beneath your armpits). Press the upper half of your body off the floor, pushing down with your arms. Your legs and hips should stay on the ground. Take the stretch as far as you can go. Don't try to excessively push yourself, which can lead to lower back pain. A common problem for beginners is not being able to extend the arms the whole way. The only way to be able to gain enough flexibility to do this is to practice this position and regular stretching."

      "title": "Perform a see-saw move.",
      "content": "Perform a see-saw move. This will gently stretch your back. It can be difficult to get into this position, but it will get better with practice. Lay on your stomach with your arms and legs straight. Reach your arms past your sides and towards your feet. Bend your legs at the knee and grab your ankles with your hands. Lift your upper and lower body off of the mat and rock back and forth gently. This can be very hard for people who are not flexible. If you are having trouble getting into the position, try some stretching exercises or yoga to improve flexibility."

    {
      "title": "Go into a bridge.",
      "content": "Go into a bridge. You can do this from standing or from the ground. Lay on the ground with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Your feet should be planted firmly on the mat. Place your hands by your feet at your ears with your fingers pointing at your feet. Your elbows should point up towards the ceiling. Push your back off of the mat with your feet and hands planted firmly on the mat. You are in a complete bridge backbend when your arms and legs are straight. You might not be able to get into a bridge backbend completely at first, but this will improve with practice. A common problem for people who can't seem to master a bridge backbend is the position of the feet. Often times they are too far forward for proper leverage. Make sure your feet are directly underneath your knees as you push your back off of the mat. Also check the position of your hands to make sure they aren't too far away from your head. You can also lower yourself into the same position from a standing backbend. Doing this from a standing backbend will give you more momentum for your kick-over."

    {
      "title": "Walk your hands close to your feet.",
      "content": "Walk your hands close to your feet. This will help you to get enough leverage for the kick-over. Make sure your back is bent and not sagging down towards the floor. Don't overextend your back in this position to avoid injury. Don't stiffen your neck to avoid strain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shift your weight forward.",
      "content": "Shift your weight forward. You will need to have your weight shifted forward to have the momentum to do the kick-over. Make sure your body is in the correct bridge backbend position before you kickover. Correct your posture and hand position if needed. Have your spotter check to make sure there aren't any people or objects in your way before you proceed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick with your good leg.",
      "content": "Kick with your good leg. Remember to push forward. This can be the most challenging part of the backbend because you have to have enough flexibility and momentum to get your leg over your body as it is in a back bend. A common problem as that the weight is not shifted forward enough to provide momentum for the kick-over. If you can't complete the move, then try to shift your weight forwards more and push off the ground firmly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use modifications if you are having trouble.",
      "content": "Use modifications if you are having trouble. A common problem for beginners is they don't have enough strength or flexibility to complete the kick-over part of this move. To help fix this, use the wall to help you practice the kick-over. Get into a bridge with your feet by a wall and use it to walk your feet upwards and push off. This will give you the momentum to complete the full kick-over. You can also use a wedged mat for leverage if you are having the problem of not being able to complete your kick-over. Stand on the thick side of the mat and perform your backbend. The thick side gives you extra height and makes the kick-over easier. Use these modifications until you've mastered the kick-over. Then try again without them."
