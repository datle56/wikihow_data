[1] X Research source Since the advent of Windows 8, users can now choose between creating a recovery flash drive or system repair CD/DVD . Recovery flash drives are recommended because they can not only repair system issues, but also return the computer to its factory settings. The flash drive must be blank and at least 4GB for 32-bit systems and 8gb for 64-bit systems [2] X Research source . All data on the flash drive will be erased in the creation of the recovery drive. A system repair CD/DVD will NOT be able to reset the computer back to factory settings, but it can repair the current operating system and run diagnostic tools. Any blank CD or DVD will do the trick."
