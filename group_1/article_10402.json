      "content": "Hide your camera with invisible tape for a quick cover. Stick a strip of clear tape over your webcam, which provides a good barrier between you and your camera. It's not as dark as some other options, but if you need a quick fix, regular tape can obscure your surroundings enough so peeping toms can't see what you're doing. [2] X Research source This option is great for any person who doesn’t want to make it obvious that they’re covering their camera."

      "content": "Place a cute sticker over the camera for a fun fix. Search online or in a craft store for a sheet of adorable stickers. Peel off the cute design and place it on your webcam as a cute, protective layer. Keep this sticker on for as long as you’d like, or until it starts peeling off. [4] X Research source Look for stickers with a darker base. If your stickers are too light or see-through, they may not obscure everything in your room or workspace. Most stickers will leave behind a residue, so make sure you remove the sticker slowly if you need to take it off."

      "content": "Place a post-it over your camera for a simple fix. If you’re in a rush, a post-it can get the job done as an impromptu webcam cover. [5] X Research source Unfortunately, post-its likely won’t stick to your camera for very long, which will leave you vulnerable again.

      "title": "Stick a strip of duct tape over your webcam to hide the camera.",
      "content": "Stick a strip of duct tape over your webcam to hide the camera. Rip off a small section of tape and center it over your camera. This sturdy, dark-colored tape will block out any peeping eyes from your webcam, and is a very inexpensive to keep yourself safe and secure while you’re on the computer. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that duct tape will leave a gunky residue on your camera for quite a bit, which isn’t ideal if you’re hoping to use your camera again. [7] X Research source It may even damage your webcam, so try a different method before using this one. Painter’s tape is a great alternative if you don’t want to leave a lot of residue on your camera. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Install a sliding webcam cover as an adjustable fix. Search online for webcam slides, which attach directly to the top of your laptop or computer. You can even get cute or customized webcam slides. When you’re using your camera, slide the cover tab away from the camera, so others can see you. If you’re feeling extra cautious, slide the tab over your camera to completely cover your lens. [9] X Research source Double-check the product description to make sure it’ll fit on your exact camera. While these products are created to stick on to your webcam, they may leave a residue once you remove them. Look for a product that says it is removable or doesn't leave a residue. Better yet, look for a slide that is magnetic that will stick to the magnets on your laptop lid."

      "content": "Block off your camera with a square webcam cover. Center this cover over your camera, which will block it off completely. If you need to use your webcam, it removes easily and can be replaced, as it's made out of a material that suctions to your device rather than sticks with adhesive.
