      "content": "Let your ham thaw in the refrigerator if time permits. This is the safest method of thawing ham, but also takes the most time. Put the frozen ham in a rimmed pan or on a baking sheet to catch any drips that occur during the thawing process. Place the ham in its container on the lowest shelf of your fridge. [1] X Research source Thawing ham in the fridge takes about 4 to 6 hours per 1 pound (0.45 kg). If the ham is larger than 10 to 11 pounds (4.5 to 5.0 kg), it could take up to 7 hours per 1 pound (0.45 kg) for it to thaw. Allow 2-3 days to thaw a ham of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in the refrigerator. After your ham has thawed in the fridge, it can remain refrigerated for 3-5 days before you cook it. You can also freeze it again if you don’t cook it in that time frame."

      "title": "Thaw the ham in cold water if you’re more pressed for time.",
      "content": "Thaw the ham in cold water if you’re more pressed for time. Wrap the ham securely in an airtight plastic bag. Plug the sink, and place the ham in it. Then fill the sink with cold water. Drain it every half hour and replace the water to make sure it stays cold enough. [2] X Research source Allow about 30 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of ham to thaw. Make sure the water is cold, not warm or hot. If the water isn’t cold, the outside of the ham could reach temperatures of 40 °F (4 °C) before the inside of the ham is thawed. Temperatures this high can cause bacterial growth and food poisoning. Cook the ham immediately after you’ve thawed it in cold water. It cannot be frozen again with this method."

      "title": "Use the microwave to thaw ham as a last resort.",
      "content": "Use the microwave to thaw ham as a last resort. Put the microwave on its defrost setting. Consult your microwave’s instruction manual for the correct defrosting time based on the weight of your ham. This method is not ideal for larger pieces of meat. The meat will cook unevenly as the outside begins cooking before the inside is thawed. Some parts may become dry and overcooked. [3] X Research source Avoid thawing meat over 2 pounds (0.91 kg) in the microwave. [4] X Research source After thawing in the microwave, ham should be cooked immediately. Do not refreeze it."

      "content": "Skip the thawing altogether to save time. You can cook a frozen ham without thawing it first. Allow extra cooking time. It will take approximately 50% longer to cook a frozen ham than a thawed one, depending on its size. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the oven to 325 °F (163 °C). Whether your ham is pre-cooked or uncooked, it needs to be heated at the same temperature in the oven. Cooked hams should be reheated to an internal temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Uncooked hams need to be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 °F (63 °C).

      "content": "Add about 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of liquid and cover the ham tightly with foil. The liquid will help keep your meat moist. Don’t put excessive amounts, though. Fat will also melt off the ham during the cooking process and moisten it. [9] X Research source For the liquid, you can use water, fruit juice, cider, wine, or even cola. [10] X Research source Don’t be afraid to experiment. Make sure that the foil covering the ham is tightly sealed to lock the moisture in."

Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the ham. [11] X Research source Cook a thawed, whole ham for about 18-20 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg).

[13] X Research source There are many different delicious glaze recipes you can try. The basic components usually include a spicy ingredient, often mustard, with something sweet, like brown sugar, honey, marmalade, juice, sherry, or maple syrup. You can also add other spices and flavors, like cloves, garlic, or ginger. Aim for a thick glaze with the texture of paste so it doesn’t just slide off the ham. Adding a dry ingredient like flour or mustard powder helps thicken the glaze. [14] X Research source"

Let the ham rest for 10-15 minutes. It will continue cooking during this time until it reaches the proper temperature. [16] X Research source Removing the ham before it’s fully heated prevents the meat from overcooking. Before you serve it, double check with a meat thermometer that the internal temperature of your ham is at least 145 °F (63 °C) after the resting period."

Don't try cooking meat that's too thick in the pressure cooker. You'll have to leave it in so long that the outside will be totally overcooked while the inside is barely cooked at all.

Let the pressure release before opening your pressure cooker. Remember that it takes longer to cook frozen meat than thawed meat. These instructions are based on cooking a small frozen ham. Your recipe might assume the ham is thawed, though, so adjust the recipe's time accordingly. Cook frozen meat for about 50% longer than thawed meat."

Put your pressure cooker on saute setting and stir the mixture into the liquid inside. You can also thicken sauce with a slurry of butter and flour instead of cornstarch. Melt 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of butter on a plate in the microwave. Whisk it with about 1.5 tablespoons (22 mL) of flour. Add this to the liquid and stir."
