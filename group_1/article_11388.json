Pull the tape across the back of your shoulders, and stop at your right shoulder. Record the measurement in the \"Shoulder measurement\" section of your chart. [2] X Research source It might be easier to have someone do this for you. Alternatively, you can get a dress form or make a duct tape mannequin .

Next: [3] X Research source Continue pulling the tape down to the narrowest point of your waist. Write the measurement down next to \"waist.\" Pull the tape down to where you want the kurti to end, and record the measurement under \"full length.\" If you're doing this on a dress form, you may have to hold the tape against the waist as you kneel. For the hip, place the tape at your shoulder and measure straight down to your hip's fullest point. This completes the \"Vertical measurements\" category. Always put a finger between your measuring tape and your body—this prevents your measurements from being too snug."
