      "content": "Choose a fertilizer with a balanced NPK ratio. “If you look on the front of a bag of fertilizer,” explains gardener Ben Barkan, “there are three numbers [that represent the NPK ratio]: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. You’re going to want to look for something that has an equal amount of those three, like 10-10-10.” A “balanced” fertilizer means that these 3 numbers are the same, like 10-10-10. [1] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source There isn’t a consistent, one-size-fits-all recommendation for fertilizer. However, many agree that some type of balanced fertilizer, like 16-16-16 or 13-13-13 , is a good choice for your dragon fruit. [2] X Research source You can use fertilizer granules, or spread fertilizer through your irrigation system. [3] X Research source Slow-release fertilizer is also an option."

      "content": "Adjust to a 10-30-20 ratio at the blooming stage. While nitrogen is essential for growth, focus on including more phosphate when your plant is getting ready to flower. [4] X Research source Too much nitrogen can cause the plant to produce too much foliage, which may harm it. Phosphate helps with energy transfer that allows the plant to flower, while potassium regulates water and nutrient movement. A 10-30-20 ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium helps ensure your dragon fruit will blossom beautifully."

      "content": "Determine if you want organic or inorganic fertilizer. Both organic and inorganic fertilizers have their pros and cons. Organic options release nutrients slowly, are less likely to cause a burn, and aren’t likely to harm the microbes in your soil. However, they’re more expensive and often smellier than inorganic options. Inorganic fertilizers, on the other hand, are fast-acting, cheaper, and contain a lot of nutrients. They can burn your plant if you’re heavy-handed. Either will work for dragon fruit plants as long as they’re phosphorus-rich. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply traditional fertilizer with granules or an irrigation system. If you only have a few plants, spread the fertilizer granules around them using your hands. Depending on your set-up, you may have an easier time applying the fertilizer through your irrigation system, especially if it’s a drip system . This efficiently and directly moves the fertilizer to the plant’s roots. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Try adding coffee grounds to the soil. “Coffee grounds are a great form of organic matter that pretty much every plant will benefit from,” explains Barkan. “Apply the coffee grounds as a mulch around plants. As long as you’re being relatively moderate with your application, it’s generally always good for the soil.” Simply sprinkle a handful or so of coffee grounds on top of the soil. You want nothing more than a thin layer. In general, the best way to use coffee grounds is to mix them into your compost pile so that they make up about 10-20% of the mixture. Then, sprinkle them sparingly on top of the soil. [17] X Research source Or, create a liquid fertilizer by mixing a teaspoon of coffee grounds into a gallon of water. Let the mixture steep for a few nights, stirring occasionally, then strain the liquid through a cheesecloth. The remaining liquid can be used to water and fertilize your plants."

If grown from a seed, dragon fruit can take up to 7 years to bear delicious fruit. Keep fertilizing and caring for the plant as you normally would. [18] X Research source If you planted your dragon fruit from a cutting, it may take up to 3 years. You can tell if a dragon fruit is ripe , personal chef Ed Kuoha explains, “when you hold it in your hand [and there’s] a firmness but still softness to it. It won’t be overly soft.” To cut a dragon fruit , Kuoha says, “you could do it like a papaya where you cut off the tips, then cut it in half, and just scoop out of it to eat. Or, just cut off the top and the bottom, stand it up, then just cut little by little around the sides [so] all the peelings are gone.”"

      "content": "Watch for signs of over-fertilization. While fertilizer can help your dragon fruit bloom more brightly, it can also damage your plant if you use too much or if your ratio is off. For example, if your fertilizer contained too much nitrogen, your plant may grow lots of green leaves but no blooms. If you included too many other nutrients, you may notice signs like droopy leaves, discoloration, or a crusty white residue on the soil’s surface. This is a good indication you should ease up on the fertilizer.
