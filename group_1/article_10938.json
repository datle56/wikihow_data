You can find cotton yarn in a craft supply store in a wide range of colors. Choose a medium-weight cotton yarn that you like and get a size J-10 (6.0 mm) crochet hook. [1] X Research source Pick your favorite color or use a variegated yarn for a more colorful bikini top. Variegated yarn contains multiple colors so it will look like you changed yarn while making the bikini."

Hold 1 end of the chain under 1 armpit and the other end of the chain under the other armpit to check. [3] X Research source The chain is finished when it’s long enough to go from 1 armpit to the other while snug against your chest. Keep in mind that the bikini top is attached with adjustable ties, so it’s not necessary to get a specific bust measurement before you begin. However, knowing your cup size or the cup size of the person who will wear the bikini may be helpful for sizing later on."

Determine when it is finished by placing it against your breast or comparing the size to a pre-made bikini top cup. You can also measure the cup for an approximate size. This pattern makes a simple triangle top bikini. Across the widest part of the triangle, an A cup will measure 4–4.5 in (10–11 cm), a B cup will measure 5–5.5 in (13–14 cm), a C cup will measure 6–6.5 in (15–17 cm), and a D cup will measure 7–7.5 in (18–19 cm)."
