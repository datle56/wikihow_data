      "content": "Come up with a realistic gym schedule that you'll be able to stick to. It may be tempting to plan on going to the gym every day of the week for faster results, but this can lead to burnout and you might feel discouraged if you miss days and don't meet your goal. Instead, decide how many days of the week you can realistically make it to the gym and start there. You can always increase the frequency of your workouts later on when going to the gym becomes more of a habit. [1] X Research source If you're new to working out, try setting aside 2 days a week to go to the gym. That way, you can get your feet wet without feeling overwhelmed. You could also try going to the gym every other day of the week so that you have a day off in between your gym sessions. If you think you'd have a hard time going to the gym on the weekends, you could go every day after work or school and then take the weekends off."

      "content": "Wear comfortable clothes and supportive athletic shoes to the gym. You want to wear clothes that will make your workout easier and that won't get in your way while you're exercising. Go with shirts that will wick away sweat and shorts that don't restrict your range of motion. [2] X Research source Shirts and shorts made out of polyester, spandex, nylon, or a cotton-polyester blend are good choices for the gym. [3] X Research source Polyester, in particular, needs to be laundered after every time you sweat in it. Unwashed polyester can quickly develop an unpleasant smell."

      "content": "Bring a water bottle with you to stay hydrated during your workouts. Working out at the gym makes you sweat and lose water, so it's important that you're replenishing your body as you exercise. Aim to drink 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water every 15 minutes during your workouts. [4] X Research source Dehydration can actually negatively affect your workouts by causing cramps and dizziness, as well as making your muscles weaker. If you're going to be working out for longer than 1 hour, it's a good idea to bring a sports drink with you too so you can refuel your body. However, not all sports drinks are the same. Look for an isotonic sports drink that contains carbohydrates and sodium, which will give your body more energy during your workout. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Warm up for 5-10 minutes before your workouts so you don't injure yourself. Make it a habit to do your warm-ups right when you get to the gym. Focus on doing active, dynamic movements that bring your muscles through their full range of motion, like leg swings, high knees , and arm circles. A dynamic warm-up will get your body ready for your workout session. [6] X Research source Not warming up before exercising can leave your body more prone to injury, so make sure you don't skip your warm-ups at the gym."

      "title": "Do both cardio and strength-training exercises.",
      "content": "Do both cardio and strength-training exercises. Try not to limit yourself to just one kind of exercise. Instead, take advantage of the weight machines, cardio machines, and free weights so you're getting a balanced workout. With cardio and strength-training exercises, you'll be burning calories and also toning your muscles and transforming your body . [7] X Research source Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate cardio a week. For strength training, try to get at least 2 workouts comprised of 20 minutes of resistance training each week. You don't need to do cardio and strength training on the same day. Instead, you could spend one workout doing cardio and then your next one doing strength-training. While a balanced workout will help you get fit in the gym, you can adjust what exercises you're doing more of depending on your personal fitness goals. For example, if your goal is to build more muscle, you could spend most of your time doing strength-training exercises. Or, if you're trying to lose weight, you could focus more on cardio exercises. The right ratio of cardio to strength-training exercises will depend on your personal fitness goals, your weight, and the type of exercises you're doing."

If you're trying to lose weight, have a low-calorie snack that's between 150-200 calories. [8] X Research source For example, you could have a banana and some almond butter or a cup of nonfat Greek yogurt with some honey and fruit as a snack after the gym.

Many treadmills let you adjust the speed and incline that you want to work out with, so it's a good choice regardless of your fitness level. [10] X Research source You can burn around 125 calories per 1 mile (1.6 km) walking briskly on a treadmill if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg).

Ellipticals are popular exercise machines, so you shouldn't have a hard time finding one at your gym.

If you're new to exercising, you can start out pedaling on a light intensity setting and then gradually increase your intensity level as you improve."

Weight machines can be intimidating if you don't know how to use them, but they can be an effective way to build muscle if they're used correctly.
