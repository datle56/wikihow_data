That is, you need to take time each night to write about your day and how you feel about it. That way, you can start seeing the things that make you happy. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Start by rating your day on a scale from 1 to 10. Ten is the best, and one is the worst. Don't think too hard. Just think about how happy you were that day. Write down what you did that day. If you can, try to figure out what made the day good or bad, happiness-wise. Try to write down things that go on, even if you're not sure how they affect your happiness yet, such as \"Worked on my novel,\" or \"Went to the movies.\""

These apps will ask you questions throughout the day, generally questioning you about your happiness at a certain point in time. They can help you build up data about how happy you are doing certain things, which in turn can help you figure out what's making you happiest.

These quizzes will provide more general answers than, say, using reflection to figure out what makes you happy, but they may be able to point you in the right direction.

      "content": "Meditate for happiness. Meditation forces you to spend time with you and only you. That means you are left alone with your thoughts and feelings. As you confront those thoughts and feelings, you may start learning things about yourself, such as what is upsetting to you and what makes you the happiest. [5] X Research source In addition to helping you find what makes you happy, meditation can lead you to greater happiness just by doing it because it releases chemicals in your body that make you happier, such as endorphins and serotonin. One option for meditation is just to sit quietly with your eyes closed and practice deep breathing. You can count to four in your head as you breathe in through your nose and hold for four counts. Count to four again as you slowly breathe out. Keeping practice this breathing for several minutes, trying to focus solely on your breath moving in and out. If you don't want to fly solo on meditation, consider using guided meditation. You can find a number of guided meditations online, or you can download a meditation app for your phone."

Therapists are trained to help you find what makes you happy in your life, and they can help you work through any issues that are making you unhappy. [6] X Research source A therapist can help you cut through the cloudiness and see you for who you really are, even when you can't do that by yourself. If you're not sure how to start looking for a therapist, ask your friends for recommendations, especially ones that you know have used a therapist before. If you can't afford a therapist, go to a sliding scale clinic, where you will pay based on what you make."

      "content": "Make a list. Start by doing a little journaling. Take out a piece of paper, and write \"What is most important to me?\" at the top. Now, start listing things that are important. Try not to think too hard about it. Rather, list the things that pop into your head in the order they pop into your head. Identifying your values can help you figure out what will make you the most happy. For instance, if you realize you value your family over your job, you may decide to spend more time at home. For example, maybe you would write \"my family,\" \"my pets,\" and \"my job.\" Also write down things that aren't important to you and things that don't make you happy so you can work to eliminate them from your life.

Rather, you're looking inside yourself to see what is most important to you. Once you've narrowed down to 10, try narrowing down to 5. Next, try to pick your most important value. [10] X Research source You can also try ranking the values you've starred to see which ones feel the most important to you. If you're having a hard time deciding, ask yourself which ones you could live without. For instance, you might find that you can live without adventure as long as your family is happy."

Try looking on psychology-based sites. [11] X Research source An assessment will ask you a series of questions, sometimes scenario-based, to help determine what your values are. However, remember that no assessment is perfect, and if you feel like the values you get back are off, feel free to move them around as needed."

Rearranging your life should make you happier, as it is bringing your life more in line with who you are. [12] X Research source For instance, if you find you value your family more, you may want to consider spending more time at home by cutting back on your hours. Another example is that if you find you value adventure, spend more time seeking it in your life. You don't need to go on glamorous vacations to find adventure. You can do it in your own city by seeking out new places to visit, new things to try, and new restaurants to eat. The point is whatever values you have at the top, especially the top value, should come first in your life. You need to make space for it with your time, energy, and money."

You may need to relearn how you think about problems, approaching them with a new frame of mind. [16] X Research source For instance, instead of looking as setbacks as failures, try looking at them as either flukes or something that you can learn from. In other words, if you have a setback, you may need to take a different approach, not quit altogether. However, optimists do need a sense of realism, too. That is, while you hope for the best, it's fine to take some precautions to ward off certain outcomes."
