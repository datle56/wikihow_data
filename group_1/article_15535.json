Since each app usually has a different setup or slightly different ways to do things, your best bet is to tap around the app and explore the variety of menus it offers. While most of the basic editing tools are free to use, any feature you see with either a lock icon or a dollar sign on it means you'll have to pay to unlock it. Cropping a photo is a good way to add more focus on the subject in the image by cutting out some background. The crop tool usually has an icon that resembles two right angles forming a square. To crop an image, select the crop tool and then drag the corners of the image inward so that the light part of the image is centered around the subject in the image. Then tap the icon that confirms the changes you made. Using the Snapseed app, you'll find this and many other editing features under the Tools tab. Some apps allow you to adjust the saturation, or intensity of color, in a photo. Increasing the saturation of a photo can make the colors pop and make the photo more eye-catching. Too much saturation, though, can make the photo look harsh and almost cartoon-like. You can adjust the saturation to highlight certain areas of an image, so use the sliders available to increase or decrease the saturation levels. In photography, exposure refers to the amount of light that falls on a photo. If the photo is too dark, then you might need to increase the exposure. If you want the photo darker, then lower the exposure. Drag the available sliders to increase or decrease the exposure levels."

Many of the photo editing apps available have a variety of filters or lenses to choose from, which essentially do all of the editing for you.

Most photo editing apps display filters as thumbnail previews at the bottom of the screen. Tap a thumbnail image to see a preview of how it will affect your image. Look for slider bars or an icon with slider bars that you can use to adjust the intensity of the filter. In Snapseed, these are located in the Looks tab."
