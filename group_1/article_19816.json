[1] X Research source A suspicious kill will not upgrade your Saber V1 to Saber V2. There are no mastery or level requirements, the player just must be a similar level to you. Once you complete this step, you'll see a message that says \"Something weird has occurred to your <Saber>.\" This signifies that you correctly upgraded to Saber V2. The sword itself won't change in appearance and the moves will have the same names after you upgrade, but the moves will look different when you use them and they will be more powerful."
