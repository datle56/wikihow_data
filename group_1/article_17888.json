What’d you think about the plot twist? I was SHOOK. That’s literally my favorite spot. Please tell me you ordered the olive oil cake for dessert… Hey, I saw you posting about mahjong. Any recommendations for a beginner trying to get into it? You seem like you know all the cool thrifting spots. Got any hidden gems you’d recommend? You HAVE to check out (local restaurant name). It has the best burgers in the city. Criminally underrated. My dog and I go to that park all the time. Maybe we’ll bump into you one day…I’m always down for a puppy playdate! Looks like my Eagles really crushed your Cowboys last night. Sending you my deepest sympathies…you’ll be in my thoughts tonight. Seems like you’re a pretty competitive bowler.

What’s the catch? Do you like raisins? How about a date? What’s the best lie we could tell about how we met? I was today years old when I realized I need you in my life. What’s the best way to slide into your DMs? Asking for…well, me. I was gonna play it cool, but then I remembered life’s short…so hey. Not to be dramatic, but if we don’t start talking, I might just deactivate. I could’ve just double-tapped, but I felt like you deserved a little more effort. Not saying that Instagram wants us together, but the algorithm clearly has taste. Tell me something fun about you…or just drop your worst pick-up line. I’ll match your energy. Do we tell people we met in the DMs, or do we come up with something more dramatic?"

      "content": "Cut to the chase with these flirty and forward opening lines. If you want to communicate that you like someone, the “best approach is being direct,” says matchmaker and certified life coach Christina Jay, NLP. Let the other person know you find them interesting and attractive, and don’t be afraid to shoot your shot. Chances are, they’ll be flattered that you’re making the first move. Not here to waste your time. Dinner or drinks? I have a theory that we’d get along way too well. Wanna test it? I don’t usually do this, but you seemed worth breaking the rule for. You seem like someone who’d be fun to flirt with. Care to confirm? I feel like you’re going to be my favorite notification. Prove me right? Instagram said we should be mutuals, but I think we should be more than that. I feel like we’d be a solid duo. What’s our vibe…partners in crime or troublemakers? I’m not great with pick-up lines, but I’m definitely good at getting to know cute people. So, do we exchange numbers now, or do I have to pretend to care about the weather first? I was going to hit you with a smooth pick-up line, but let’s be real…your profile already did the heavy lifting."

Here are some clever, non-cringy messages to start a casual conversation: You seem like someone I’d regret not saying hi to, so…hi. Your feed is a whole vibe. You’re not a full-time influencer, are you? Just wanted to let you know that your posts always put a smile on my face! You’re honestly one of the most creative people on this app. Love your style! I just saw your post and thought: “Wow I need to be friends with this person.” I was scrolling through Instagram and realized your feed is basically my vacation. Okay, but seriously, how do you always find the coolest places? Give me your secrets! I’m usually not this forward, but you seem like someone I’d have an epic conversation with. I was gonna leave a comment, but I figured this would be a better way to start a conversation. I was debating whether or not to DM you, but then I saw your post about the MCR reunion and thought “Yep, they’re cool.”"

[3] X Research source Here are some creative openers you can try: What’s your hot take or unpopular opinion? What’s a totally useless but highly impressive skill you have? If you had to give a TED talk on something, what would it be? POV: We can visit any fictional world together. What’s the move? If your life had a soundtrack, what song would be playing right now? What’s the best way to impress you? Asking purely for strategic reasons. You look like you have elite taste. Prove me right—favorite flavor combo? What’s the most interesting DM you’ve ever gotten? Hoping to at least make top 3. If we had to explain how we met in a way that makes us sound cooler, what would our story be? If we were in a heist movie, what role would you play? No pressure, but our getaway depends on your answer."

If you were a taser, you’d be set to stun. If you were a flower, you’d be a damnnn-delion. The doctor says I’m seriously lacking in vitamin U. Do you like Star Wars? Because Yoda one for me! Are you a keyboard? Because you’re just my type. Was your dad a boxer? Because you’re a knockout! Are you a time-traveler? Because I see you in my future. If being sexy were a crime, you’d be on the FBI’s most wanted list. When I text you goodnight later, what phone number should I use?

      "content": "How can I stand out from other guys in her DMs? If you’re replying to a girl’s story or highlights, ask a genuine question about something she’s posted. She has probably received tons of cheesy compliments and pick-up lines before, so being curious and approaching her in a friendly way will instantly set you apart. You should also tailor your opening line to her profile, personality, or interests as best as you can. [7] X Research source For example, if she posts a selfie wearing a band tee, you could ask for her favorite album. If she posts a photo at a restaurant, you could ask for her rating or overall thoughts. Alternatively, you could give a sincere compliment that goes beyond physical appearance. Letting her know that she has a cool personality or aesthetic is a lot more unique than saying she’s “cute” or “has gorgeous eyes.”"

      "title": "What are some things I should avoid when sliding in the DMs?",
      "content": "What are some things I should avoid when sliding in the DMs? Generally, you should avoid using cheesy pick-up lines, unless you think it matches the other person’s sense of humor. If they’re always posting dad jokes or memes, for instance, you could take a risk and go for it. You should also avoid sending multiple DMs, especially if they don’t respond to your message. Doing so can come off as creepy or overbearing. Other things you should avoid when sliding in the DMs include: [8] X Research source Avoid sending emojis: Sending a single emoji, whether it’s the heart eyes or fire emoji, is one of the most basic ways to reply to someone’s story. Since the other person can’t really respond to it (unlike a question or witty comment), it’s the equivalent of saying nothing. Avoid just saying “hey:” This is another generic and boring way to slide into someone’s DMs, and there’s a high chance you’ll be completely ignored. Putting more effort and thought into your message is more likely to elicit a response and start a fun conversation. Avoid putting the other person on a pedestal: It’s okay to give someone a compliment, but raving about their appearance can make them feel uncomfortable, especially if you don’t know them well. There’s a high chance they receive lots of compliments about their looks, so you don’t need to go overboard."

      "content": "How can I ask for someone’s phone number over DM? You should “always give a reason” to get someone’s number, according to dating expert Imad Jbara. If you talked to them about their favorite show, for example, you could say something like, “give me your number so I can text you when season two comes out.” Providing a reason is a natural way to ask for their number and “make them more enticed.” Generally, the best time to ask for someone’s number is after they’ve shown an interest by keeping the conversation going over DM. [9] X Research source You could also make a joke about getting their number for a playful approach. For example, you could say, “I was going to ask for your number, but I realized I’m pretty good at stalking you on here” or “it’s obvious we vibe with each other, so I think it’s only right I have your number to keep the good times rolling!”"
