      "title": "Let your brownies cool for 1-2 hours before you cut them.",
      "content": "Let your brownies cool for 1-2 hours before you cut them. Brownies continue cooking as they sit outside the oven, which helps them firm up and taste extra delicious. Leave your brownies on a wire cooling rack on top of your counter until they are completely cooled. [1] X Research source Avoid leaving your brownies on the stovetop. The heat from your oven will delay the cooling time."

      "content": "Divide each half in half again by making another cut through the middle. After you cut your brownies into 2 sections, make another vertical cut through each section. You will have 4 vertical rows."

      "content": "Make 1-3 horizontal cut to divide the strips down the center. After you make your vertical cuts, make horizontal cuts to divide your brownies into individual servings. You can make 1-3 cuts, based on the desired size of your brownies. [2] X Research source Cut your brownies into small sections if you prefer bite-sized pieces. Space out your cuts for hearty, hand-sized brownies."

      "content": "Use a plastic disposable knife for clean, even cuts. If you want your brownies to all be the same size, or if you want to make clean, perfect cuts, try using a plastic knife. With disposable plastic knives, you can easily cut through your cooled brownies like butter. [3] X Research source Keep a few in your silverware drawer to use in the future!"

      "title": "Trim about 1⁄6–1⁄4 in (0.42–0.64 cm) off the edges of your brownies.",
      "content": "Trim about 1 ⁄ 6 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.42–0.64 cm) off the edges of your brownies. Once the brownies are cooled, cut off the edges on all 4 sides using a plastic knife. This ensures each brownie has a smoothly sliced outer edge."

      "title": "Make notches around the edges of the brownies at 2 in (5.1 cm) intervals.",
      "content": "Make notches around the edges of the brownies at 2 in (5.1 cm) intervals. Using your ruler, measure 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the edge and make a small notch in the brownies with a blade. Continue making notches every 2 inches (5.1 cm) around the entire perimeter of the brownies. [4] X Research source You can change the size based on personal preference. For smaller brownies, try making squares about 1 in (2.5 cm). For larger brownies, go with 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) squares. If you have a larger piece left over at the end, you can trim off the excess so the end row is about 2 in (5.1 cm) as well."

      "content": "Dip your plastic knife in hot water to make smooth, even cuts. Fill a cup with hot water from your faucet, and set it next to your brownies. Before making each cut, dip your plastic knife into the water. [5] X Research source Your knife should not have any brownie crumbs on it when you remove it. The hot water helps smoothly slice between the brownies."

      "content": "Use a 12-cavity brownie bar pan to bake brownies without cutting them. Pour your batter into a greased cavity bar pan, and let your brownies cool after they bake. Then, gently lift the brownies out of the pan with clean hands. To help you remove the brownies, you can insert a plastic knife on 1 side to pry the brownie from the bottom of the pan. [7] X Research source Cavity brownie pans come in either metal or silicone materials. Both work well to cook brownies without cutting, though it can be easier to remove brownies from silicone pans since the material is flexible."

      "title": "Try using a muffin pan if you don't have a brownie bar pan.",
      "content": "Try using a muffin pan if you don't have a brownie bar pan. Either grease the pan or line your pan with cupcake liners. Then, pour the batter directly into each depression of the muffin pan, filling each section about half full with batter. After your brownies cool, take a plastic knife and cut around the edges of each brownie. Then, gently lift up the brownies with your hands to remove them from the pan. Your brownies may be on the larger size, but muffin pans make great substitutions for brownie bar pans."

      "content": "Try a mini silicone brownie mold to easily make bite-sized brownies. Pour your batter into the molds, bake your brownies, and let them cool. Then, place your finger underneath the mold, and lift up so the brownie pops out of the mold. Your brownies will easily slide out of the silicone mold. [8] X Research source Miniature brownie molds produce 24 tiny brownies. If you are having trouble removing the brownies from the mold, try holding the silicone at an angle as you push them from underneath."

      "content": "Use a brownie divider set if you want pre-sliced brownies. Place the brownie divider into the pan after you pour in your batter. Let your brownies cool with the divider still inserted, and remove the divider once the brownies cool down. Then, prop your brownie pan on a small object, like a cup or can. Press down on the pan to separate the brownies from the pan. [9] X Research source 2-piece brownie sets include a collapsing baking pan and a brownie divider. The divider will separate the brownies into 18 even sections. It is helpful to apply cooking spray to the pan and the divider before you bake."
