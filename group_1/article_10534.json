For this project, you will need 24 shells of relatively uniform size, string or fishing line, the inner wood hoop from an embroidery hoop, a power drill with a 1/32 in (0.8 mm) or smaller drill bit, and a pair of scissors. [1] X Research source You can stain or paint your embroidery hoop if you wish to change the color of the wood."

Mix 1 part bleach with 3 parts water in a large bowl and soak your seashells in the mixture for several hours. If necessary, use an old toothbrush to remove grime and calcium buildup from the shells. Rinse them thoroughly with warm water and allow them to dry completely."

Do this by marking 1 point each at the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the hoop. Then add 4 more points at the midpoints between the first 4. Finally, fill each remaining space in with 2 equally spaced points. [2] X Research source"

To help prevent the shell from cracking, you can cover the hole's location with a strip of masking tape before drilling. Remove the tape after making the hole. [4] X Research source The hole can be placed anywhere on the shell, keeping in mind that the position in which the shell hangs will be dictated by the hole's location. It's important to use a very small drill bit so that the string will fit but the shell won't crack. [5] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 29 October 2020. Be sure to drill slowly so the shells don't break. [6] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 29 October 2020.
