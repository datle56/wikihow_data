It may be marked “tampons only” or “sanitary napkins only.” [5] X Research source You should close the lid of the metal bin once you have deposited the tampon. Often these disposal bins are emptied by cleaning staff once a day."

If you are at a friend’s house for a sleepover or a hang out and have to dispose of your tampon, you should place it in their garbage. Never flush it down the toilet, as this can clog the toilet. You should avoid putting the tampon in your bag or in your pocket, even if it is wrapped in toilet paper. Tampons can have a strong smell due to the blood and menstrual material on it so you do not want to find a smelly tampon in your bag or in your pocket later."

If you are camping or you do not have access to a proper washroom for whatever reason, you should try to wrap the tampon in toilet paper, a paper towel or a piece of paper, in a pinch. Then, you should place the tampon in a paper or plastic bag. This will ensure the tampon does not leak blood or get blood everywhere. You should then try to throw the bag away as soon as you can in a proper garbage."

This will make for less mess, with no blood on your underwear or on the floor."

This will ensure you have the necessary protection and are using a tampon that fits your needs. If you have a heavier flow, especially during the first two to three days of your period, you may go for a tampon with higher absorbency. If you have a lighter flow, especially during the last few days of your period, you may opt for a tampon with the lowest absorbency. [12] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. You can also determine your required absorbency by noting how the tampon appears when you remove it. If it appears dry, you may be using a tampon with an absorbency that is too high. If it appears soaked and very wet, you may need to use a tampon with a higher absorbency. You should never use a tampon to soak up discharge that is coming out of your vagina. They are only made for use when you have your period."
