[1] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 29 October 2020. [2] X Research source Read the label on the spray paint to find out how far from the surface you should hold the can. In most cases it is 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm). Turn a triangular pumpkin into a candy corn by painting the bottom orange, the middle yellow, and the top white.
