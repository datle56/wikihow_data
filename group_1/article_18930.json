      "title": "Let the wax set.",
      "content": "Let the wax set. If you've spilled body wax, you probably want to deal with it right away. Don't be in a rush, though—allow the wax to cool until it hardens. For smaller stains, this might only take 10-15 minutes, but big spills might need a couple of hours to fully set. [1] X Research source If the wax is still warm when you start cleaning, you might spread it around, creating a bigger mess. If the wax is really hot, you could even burn yourself!"

    {
      "title": "Speed up the cooling process with ice if you'd like.",
      "content": "Speed up the cooling process with ice if you'd like. If you're treating a small spill, try rubbing an ice cube over the area to quickly harden the wax. If the wax covers a larger area, place some ice in a plastic bag and put that on top of the spill for 20-30 minutes or until the wax is cool. You can also just pop the garment into the freezer if you prefer. [2] X Research source This is a good option if you're working with soft wax, which can be a little harder to scrape off of the fabric. Soft body wax melts between 85–104 °F (29–40 °C), which is lower than hard body wax or candle wax, so it won't be as hard at room temperature. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub small drips with vegetable oil to remove them.",
      "content": "Rub small drips with vegetable oil to remove them. After the wax has cooled, lay your garment out flat. Use your fingers or a paper towel to cover any smaller wax drips with oil, then work the oil into the spill until the wax breaks up and dissolves. Use a cloth or paper towel to wipe away any waxy residue, then blot up the excess oil. [4] X Research source If you only had a few small splatters, this may be all you need to do to get your garment clean. If so, wash the item like you normally would. If any oil is left after the first wash, work some detergent into the area, then wash it again."

    {
      "title": "Scrape off large wax spills with a dull blade.",
      "content": "Scrape off large wax spills with a dull blade. Once the wax has hardened, grab a butter knife, old credit card, spoon, or any other item with a dull edge. Work that edge under the wax and pry it up and away from the fabric. Try to remove as much of the hardened wax as you can this way. [5] X Research source If you're working with a smooth fabric like jersey, the wax might come up easily in one big piece. If it's a textured fabric, like a knit sweater, you might have to chip away at it. Wax tends to leave behind an oily stain, so don't worry if you see some discoloration. It should come out when you wash the item. If there's still wax left behind, keep reading to learn how to melt it with an iron. Otherwise, skip to washing the item."

    {
      "title": "Place an old towel or sheet on your ironing board.",
      "content": "Place an old towel or sheet on your ironing board. When the wax melts, it could seep through the garment and onto your ironing board. It could then transfer to the next item you press. Putting down a towel or sheet first will keep that from happening. [6] X Research source Be sure to use something old so you won't mind if it gets wax on it. Use parchment paper as an alternative to a towel or a sheet."

    {
      "title": "Place the garment on the board and cover it with another towel.",
      "content": "Place the garment on the board and cover it with another towel. Make sure the wax side is facing up. Then, cover the wax with a double layer of paper towels or another old towel. [7] X Research source You could also use a plain brown paper bag. If you're using a bag that's printed, cut it open and place the plain side against the garment. Otherwise, the heat from the iron could cause the ink to transfer to the fabric."

    {
      "title": "Iron over the spot on medium heat.",
      "content": "Iron over the spot on medium heat. Run the iron back and forth over the paper towels or cloth until the wax starts to melt. The towels or cloth should absorb the melted wax. Don't leave the iron in one place too long, though, or it could scorch the fabric. [8] X Research source If you don't have an iron, use your hairdryer instead! Set it to high heat and run the air back and forth over the spill until the wax melts. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep switching to a clean cloth until the wax is gone.",
      "content": "Keep switching to a clean cloth until the wax is gone. Once the wax has melted, lift your cloth and fold it in half, then place it back down so a clean surface is over the wax. If the cloth you're using gets covered in wax, replace it with a new one. If you're using paper towels, keep replacing the paper towels as needed until you've absorbed all of the wax.

      "title": "Rub laundry detergent into the stain for a gentle clean.",
      "content": "Rub laundry detergent into the stain for a gentle clean. If you have liquid detergent, pour it directly onto the stain. If you prefer powdered detergent, sprinkle it onto the area, and add enough water to make a thin paste. Then, work the detergent into the fabric and let it sit for about 2 hours. [11] X Research source You could also use a stain pretreating solution or oxygen bleach."

    {
      "title": "Use a solvent like acetone or alcohol on durable fabrics.",
      "content": "Use a solvent like acetone or alcohol on durable fabrics. Tough fabrics like denim and canvas can hold up if you use a harsher cleaner to get rid of the oil left behind by your body wax. Just dab acetone or isopropyl alcohol onto the stain with a cotton ball. Then, wash the garment with detergent like you normally would. [12] X Research source Do not use acetone on synthetic fabrics like acetate or modacrylic or they'll dissolve."

    {
      "title": "Wash the garment in warm water and hang it up to dry.",
      "content": "Wash the garment in warm water and hang it up to dry. Oily stains dissolve better in warmer water, so check the care label on your garment and wash it on the hottest setting recommended for that fabric. Once it's been washed, air dry the item, then check the spot, If the stain is still there, wash it again until it's gone. Don't put the item into the dryer until you're sure the oil is gone or the stain will get set in, making it harder to remove."
