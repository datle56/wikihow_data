      "content": "Check the weather. The weather forecast for tomorrow won’t always give you an accurate prediction, but it will give you an idea. Check online or dial into your local news station to see tomorrow’s forecast. Look at the percentage prediction of snow. If the forecast calls for over an 80% chance, or shows a weather warning, then the chances are high. You should also take a look at the hourly forecast for tomorrow. See if the precipitation is suppose to increase or decrease as the day progresses. Make sure any snow-related news reports you find are from reliable sources, such as national weather services and trustworthy news sites. Weather reports published in tabloids are often exaggerated and sometimes even fake."

      "content": "Check your school’s hotline. Parents and students may be able to call a number provided by the school to find out information on school delays or cancellations. Since it comes from your school directly, this is the most reliable way to obtain information. Most schools are equipped with such a system, but check to be sure before the next big weather problem hits. You may also check the school's website, if it has one, for a delay/cancellation notice. Many websites will list this information clearly on the front page. If your school has a social media account (such as Twitter or Instagram), check that too. They might have posted updates on whether or not school is cancelled. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Know your school's weather policies.",
      "content": "Know your school's weather policies. The best way to plan ahead is to review your school's policies on inclement weather. Review your school's handbook or website for any information on your school's rules for weather. If a school is prepared, they will have this documented for parents and students. For example, a school might close without question if snow reaches above three feet. School could be cancelled if the power is out in the school or neighboring communities. Another common policy is to cancel or delay school if public transportation is disrupted."

      "content": "Go to bed as you normally would. This means having all your homework done and packed away as it normally would be. You should also mentally expect school to be open the next day. Several snow day predictions have been wrong. You don't want to wake up to disappointment or panic because you haven't studied for your math test! If school is cancelled, then you are in for a surprise! It makes the fun even better. Even if it's not cancelled, you can do your research and be the first to know about the next big snowstorm to hit your town!"

      "content": "Check your local news. As soon as you wake up, check the news affiliate's website for school delays and cancellations. They should have an accurate list that will normally be refreshed every few minutes for updated information. [2] X Research source You could alternatively turn on the local news. Near the bottom of the screen they’ll show school cancellations and delays based off county districts.

      "content": "Check with your school. Many schools will send out an automated phone call or email to all student’s homes. If your school does not do this, you can call the school directly or go to its website. Your school should have a inclement weather hotline you can refer to."

      "content": "Ask your peers. If you’re not able to get a clear answer, call a friend and ask them if they know any information. Do not call them too early in the morning. Make sure you can trust your friend. It’d be unfortunate for you to find out school’s cancelled when it isn’t."

      "content": "Go to school. If all else fails, get ready and go to school like you would on a normal day. If the parking lot is empty, the doors are locked, etc., then school is most likely closed. Even if your school is open, there is always a chance that you will be sent home early due to inclement weather. If you weren’t able to get a clear answer, your school is probably open as usual."
