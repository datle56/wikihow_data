To find the general area where a leak is coming from, place a large piece of cardboard on the ground under the engine block and leave it overnight. [1] X Research source Trace the drip back up to the engine block to see what components may be causing the leak. If the puddle is red, it’s power steering or transmission fluid. If it’s yellowish-green, orange, or pastel blue, it’s antifreeze. If it’s dark brown or black, it’s engine oil.

Use a black light to look for a trail of bright, glowing oil around your engine. [3] X Research source You can also turn on your car, sniff around the engine for burning oil, and look for blue smoke coming from the engine to get a general idea of where the leak might be coming from.

Pull it out again to check your oil level . If the oil is halfway between the two marks or divots, you have enough. [5] X Research source If your oil is overfilled, it can cause a leak. If this is the case, get a fresh oil change . If the level is low, top it up a little with a quart of oil and check the level again. Repeat until the oil is about halfway between the two marks.

      "content": "Examine the engine block components for any signs of wetness. The most common sources of an oil leak are the valve cover gaskets, oil pan seals, oil pan plug, oil pressure sensor, oil filter, oil filler cap, timing cover seal, and engine head gasket. Check your vehicle’s manual if you can’t find where these are located on your vehicle. Oil pan seals and plug: The oil pan looks like a large container underneath your engine. The plug is located on the bottom of one side of the pan. Oil pressure sensor and oil filter: The filter is a labeled metal cylinder attached to the engine block. The sensor is usually located near the filter. Oil filler cap and valve cover gaskets: The cap is on top of the engine and labeled “engine oil.” The valve cover looks like a container under the cap—check for leaks on all sides. [8] X Research source Engine head gasket: The engine gasket is a thin piece of metal between the top of the engine (or the cylinder head) and the engine block. [9] X Research source Timing cover seal: The timing cover is a large metal cover at the front of the engine that’s often buried under other components. [10] X Research source"

Check for loose bolts along the oil pan and tighten them with a torque wrench until the rubber gasket underneath starts to move.

[12] X Research source Check the dipstick to see if you need to add more oil to your car . The oil level should be halfway between the two divots or marks on your dipstick. Start the car to see if this solution solves the problem. If you still have an oil puddle, check the bolts again. Before using a jack, check your owner's manual to find the jack points on your car where the vehicle is designed to be lifted. [13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Warning: Be mindful not to overtighten your bolts—this can make a leak worse, and it's why all fasteners have a torque spec. A large percentage of oil, trans pans, and front covers that come in with leaks require a seal replacement, but then the pan or cover also need to be replaced due to overtightening by the owner."

If you can’t tighten the oil filler cap properly, twist the cap left to take it off completely and replace it. [14] X Research source Most automotive parts stores can order an oil filler cap for your car’s specific make and model. An average oil filler cap costs between $5 and $15.
