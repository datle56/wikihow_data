      "content": "Open the door for a quick and easy way to increase airflow. If you can, prop open a door so the warm air that's building up in your room can flow out. This also helps to balance and regulate the temperature around your house. If the room has multiple doors, prop them all open to increase air flow."

      "content": "Open a window if you want to keep your door closed. Opening the window will help get air moving. If you already have air blowing into the room from your A/C, opening a window will help draw it out, creating airflow and better circulation. You can do this with a closed door, as long as you have air blowing in from the A/C. [1] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. You only need to open the window 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) in order to start drawing the hot air out of the room!"

Use a dehumidifier if the air feels and moist stuffy. [3] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. If you're in the bathroom or kitchen, turn on the exhaust fan to get air moving. In the kitchen, you can also turn on the range hood fan (if you have one)."

An air conditioner can help create airflow even if you don't want to set it to \"cool.\" Just make sure the vent is open and set it to fan mode so air circulates throughout the room. [4] X Research source If you don't have an A/C, consider buying a window A/C unit or a portable A/C unit , especially if you live in a hot climate. Portable A/C units work great in windowless rooms. If you do have an A/C, schedule HVAC maintenance once a year and get your air ducts cleaned every 2-3 years, or as needed.

Jump ducts are u-shaped tunnels that create the same effect as leaving the door open, as they allow air to flow back out of the room when it comes in through the A/C vent. For best results, install jump ducts in the attic. To install: [12] X Research source Cut holes in the ceiling drywall. Place the jump duct above the rooms, and connect the registers on the duct to the beams. Seal the registers to the drywall using caulk. Then, seal the registers to the duct using the approved ties and metal tape. In the rooms, place a ceiling grill under the duct."
