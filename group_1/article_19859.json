      "content": "Baking soda is a great odor eliminator. When you’re doing your laundry, add ½ to 1 cup (115 to 230 g) of baking soda into the load to cut the odor. Another option is to soak the clothes for 3-6 hours in your sink or tub with hot water and ½ to 1 cup (115 to 230 g) of baking soda. [1] X Research source For extra odor-fighting power, add 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 cup (120 to 240 mL) of vinegar during the rinse cycle. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fresh air can carry the smell away naturally. Put your clothes on a clothesline outside or use a hanger to put them on a fence, tree, or awning to let the smoke air out. [3] X Research source If the weather doesn’t allow for outdoor clothes hanging, inside will do! Hang them up in a large room with the windows open. While this may not get rid of the smell completely, it’s a good first step that can be surprisingly effective."

      "title": "White vinegar works well as a deodorizer as well as a disinfectant.",
      "content": "White vinegar works well as a deodorizer as well as a disinfectant. Put your clothes in the laundry normally with your detergent, but add 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 cup (120 to 240 mL) of white vinegar to the machine before the rinse cycle. When you take your clothes out of the laundry, the smell should be gone! [4] X Research source If your clothes are delicate or the smoke smell is still strong, soak your clothes for 3-6 hours in vinegar. Fill a bucket or bathtub with hot water and add 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 cup (120 to 240 mL) of white vinegar. Then soak the clothes until the smoke odor has lessened. [5] X Research source If there is a vinegar smell after washing with vinegar, don’t worry. It will go away quickly as the leftover vinegar dissipates into the air. [6] X Research source Be careful using vinegar on athletic or athleisure wear because vinegar can wear down some elastic fabrics like lycra and spandex. Never mix vinegar with bleach! They combine to create a highly toxic chlorine gas. Check if your detergent has bleach in it before mixing it with vinegar. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Hot water dissolves smelly substances and kills bacteria. Wash your clothes with detergent on the ‘hot’ setting of your washer, or heat water up to 130 °F (54 °C) and wash your clothes by hand. The hot water should break down the odor-causing molecules. [8] X Research source Read your clothes’ tags first to check if you can wash them in hot water without damaging them."

      "content": "Baking soda and dryer sheets will absorb bad odors. Seal your clothes in a plastic bag with 1 dryer sheet or 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda per clothing item. Let your clothes sit in the bag for 1-2 days, and the odors should be gone! [9] X Research source Activated charcoal, [10] X Research source wads of newspaper, bags of coffee grounds, and cedar chips will also help absorb bad odors. [11] X Research source There are also a variety of commercially available odor-absorbing packs that you could use to absorb the smells from your clothes. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Chemical deodorizers (or diluted rubbing alcohol) can help remove smokey smells. Hang up the clothing, then spray it with a commercial deodorizing fabric freshener. Alternatively, use diluted rubbing alcohol or even white vinegar. Once you’ve sprayed your clothing, let it sit for a couple of hours, smell it again, and respray if needed. [13] X Research source Make sure that the commercial spray has a chemical deodorant in it, rather than just scented water. Only the chemical spray will cut the odor. [14] X Research source"

Make sure to talk to someone at the dry cleaners’ to communicate specifically that you want them to get the smoky smell out. [15] X Research source"
