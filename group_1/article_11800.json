[1] X Research source She could get really judgmental, or try to make you look bad in front of other family members. People respond to jealousy in a variety of different ways, so it’s hard to know if she’s jealous or if there’s something else going on. [2] X Research source If you haven’t talked to your sister in law, that may be a good first step. It’s possible she isn’t even jealous, or she has no idea that she’s being rude to you."

If everyone sees you being really nice to your sister in law while she’s being snooty and rude, they may eventually correct her. She’s also more likely to just let it go if she can’t get a response out of you. [4] X Research source Your other option is to enlist the help of your partner. If their sister is acting like a jerk, they should be willing to stand up for you and correct their sibling. [5] X Research source Don’t let your sister in law cross any serious lines. If she violates a boundary or says something demeaning about you in front of others, stand up for yourself. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "This probably has more to do with them than you, so try not to worry about it. Your brother in law’s wife is far enough removed from your relationship with your partner that they shouldn’t have that much energy invested in you unless they’ve got some personal issues they’re dealing with. [7] X Research source Either make an effort to get to know her better so the two of you can start getting along, or leave her alone and let her get over her issues on her own time. Try to be a little self-reflective about how you’ve behaved as well. If you’re putting out cold vibes, or you’re being a little hypercritical of your brother in law’s wife, they may simply be playing off of your energy. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk to your sibling about this, since they’re in the middle here. Your sibling cares about you and their wife, so it’s in their best interest to help put this problem to rest. Don’t force them to pick a side or anything, but see if they can help you get to the root of the issue. [9] X Research source If their wife is seriously crossing a line at family gatherings or they’re violating important boundaries, stand up to them. A zero-tolerance policy towards abuse from your sibling’s wife should put an end to any jealous outbursts. [10] X Research source Realistically, a lot of this going to fall on your sibling. They should be standing up for you if their wife is acting out, and they should be correcting you if you’re being unfair."

      "content": "Think about things from her point of view. She dedicated her life to raising a child and then you just come in out of nowhere and sweep them away from her! Yes, it’s a ridiculous thought, but that could be how it feels to her. It’s also possible that your mother in law sees how happy you and her child are, and now she’s feeling insecure about the way her relationships worked out. She may also be scared she isn’t going to see her child nearly as often as she used to. [11] X Research source It could also be that your mother in law feels like they’re losing their child to someone they don’t know. If this is the case, she may relax over time as she gets to know you better. Try to be kind of empathetic with your mother in law. Your partner’s relationship with their mother is likely important to them, and if you don’t get along with her, it may put some strain on your partner."

Some of this may get better over time as your mother in law warms up to you, but if it doesn’t, fighting with your partner’s mother may not put you on a road to success. [12] X Research source You also can’t ignore your in laws, so this is where your ability to stay in control of your emotions is essential. Feel free to take breaks at family gatherings and just step outside for some fresh air, or hang out with a niece or uncle instead of your mother in law during holiday visits. [13] X Research source Your partner’s relationship with their mother should partially guide how you deal with this. If they love their mother, you’re better off playing it cool and not engaging. If they aren’t the biggest fan of their mother, you may have more wiggle room when it comes to standing up to her. If your mother in law does cross a boundary, stand up for yourself. Just keep it as respectful as possible. If she openly puts you down for something, say, “I do not appreciate you talking to me like that.” Don’t engage or argue—just stop the conversation right there and move on. [14] X Research source Because he is your mother in law, and she presumably going to be part of your life, it's really important that you try and mend the relationship the best you can.
