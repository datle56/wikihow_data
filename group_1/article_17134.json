If you successfully recover both your username and password, you’ll still need to enter the correct birthday to log into your account. Neopets requires this as a security measure for users who haven’t logged in for several months or years. You only get three guesses, so don't guess completely randomly. Start with your real birthday, especially if you were over 18 when your account was created. Enter other dates you might have used, like the birthdays of friends or family members. Try January 1, 1900 (an obvious fake option if you were pretending to be over 18) or the actual day and month of your birthday but with different years."

Sending a new ticket will not speed up the response. Once they respond, here are the most common next steps: If they ask for information about the account, answer their questions as thoroughly as possible. They might ask for the names of items in your safety deposit box, what you spend Neocash on, major trades/auctions, or any warnings you received. These questions are all designed to verify that you are the true account owner. If they're satisfied, they will send you the correct birthday and password. If your account is classified as a “sensitive” account—meaning you had rare items, pets, or a large amount of Neopoints or Neocash—you may have to answer additional security questions. [2] X Research source If the support team says that your old account was frozen, follow their instructions to fill out a new ticket requesting that the account be reactivated. You will need to include as much info about your account as possible."
