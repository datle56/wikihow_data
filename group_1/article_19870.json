      "content": "Check local nursing home admission requirements to see if they qualify. Generally, nursing homes are meant for seniors with serious health issues or conditions that need frequent supervision and round-the-clock care by licensed professionals. [1] X Research source To be admitted, a senior needs to meet the state’s criteria for nursing home care, and any medical conditions they have must be documented and confirmed by a doctor. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requires U.S. states to follow a few general guidelines, however, they can create their own requirements within those rules. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Have your loved one’s medical conditions confirmed by a doctor. To verify that your loved one meets your state or area’s requirements for a nursing home, a physician will perform a medical exam and assess their health care needs. [3] X Research source If your loved one isn’t currently in the hospital, make an appointment with their primary care doctor to assess whether they qualify for a nursing home. If your loved one is in the hospital, staff may complete the assessment during their stay. If the doctor determines that your loved one needs day-to-day care but doesn’t meet nursing home requirements, they might be able to join an assisted living community."

      "title": "Medicaid Pending approach",
      "content": "Medicaid Pending approach Find a nursing home in your area that accepts Medicaid Pending clients, move your loved one in, apply for Medicaid, and wait to be approved. Pros: This option may protect your assets, requires no out-of-pocket cash, and you might not be required to provide an alternate payment if your loved one is rejected by Medicaid. Cons: Few nursing homes accept Medicaid Pending residents without an alternate guarantor of payment and the care quality of these homes tend to be lower. If your loved one is rejected by Medicaid, they will be immediately evicted. Most nursing homes that accept Medicaid won’t accept new residents without a way to pay for their care, and Medicaid won’t accept an applicant until they’ve been admitted. Applying as a Medicaid pending resident is one of the ways to get around this. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Private pay and spend down for Medicaid approach If your loved one’s countable assets (like cash, savings, stocks, etc.) go over your state Medicaid limit, move them into a nursing home and have them pay for care out of pocket until they only have the limit remaining. Pros: You can time the application process and switch to Medicaid when your loved one becomes eligible. Cons: Your loved one has to spend their own money on their care when they could have reserved that money for their spouse or children to use later. Consider working with an elder law attorney or Medicaid Planning Professional to help determine your loved one’s eligibility and guide you through the Medicaid application process. Even if your loved one wasn’t qualified for Medicaid in the past, the income limits for nursing home care are now higher, so they might be eligible now. Your Medicaid application can be rejected and sent back if anything is missing."

      "content": "Family private pay and spend down for Medicaid approach If the above options aren’t available and you’re related to your loved one, find a nursing home that accepts both private pay and Medicaid. Tell the nursing home that the resident is applying for Medicaid and have them agree in writing to refund your payments when funding kicks in. Then, apply for Retroactive Medicaid. Pros: Medicaid can be approved retroactively for up to 3 months before the nursing home Medicaid application. If approved, the nursing home can refund your out-of-pocket money. Cons: If something goes wrong in the Medicaid application process, the money you spend can’t be refunded and you may have to spend more money out-of-pocket for your loved one to stay in the nursing home."

      "title": "Medicare-to-Medicaid approach",
      "content": "Medicare-to-Medicaid approach If your loved one enters a nursing home that accepts Medicare and Medicaid as a Medicare-funded resident, you may be able to apply for Medicaid. Although Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care in a nursing home, it can cover up to 100 days of skilled nursing home care after a stroke, hip fracture, or other health event that requires at least 3 days of medical care. Medicare can also cover hospital care, doctor services, and medical supplies (like prescriptions) for individuals 65 and older. Pros: If your loved one is approved, they will be able to stay in the nursing home for longer than the 100 days provided by Medicare. Cons: 100 days might be a short window to apply to Medicaid and the nursing home. The nursing home might also try to make the candidate or their family responsible for payment if they’re denied by Medicaid."

Does the nursing home have a screening program for vaccinations, like flu and pneumonia? Does the nursing home offer care for people with dementia? If so, kind?
