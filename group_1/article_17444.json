In which case, you can try cleaning the headphone jack. If this doesn't work, you will most likely need to have your device serviced. To clean your headphone jack , power the device off. Dip a cotton swab in some lukewarm water. Squeeze the excess liquid out and roll it into a tight, thin strip. Stick it in the headphone jack as far as it will go, and then twist it to clean out any dirt that got inside. Then repeat with a dry cotton swab to dry out the inside. Wait a few hours and see if this fixes the problem. If you're experiencing problems with the headphone jack on a computer, smartphone, or tablet, it may be caused by a virus. Try running a virus scan. If absolutely necessary, back up your device and reset it to its factory settings."

If it's dirty, you can try cleaning it with a small brush, or a vacuum cleaner hose with a narrow nozzle. You can also dip a cotton swap in some lukewarm water or alcohol-based cleaner, and use it to clean the headphones . Be sure to squeeze out the excess liquid before cleaning. Then use a dry cotton swab to thoroughly dry the headphones before use. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Check for water damage. Headphones are often exposed to sweat, rain, and spilled liquids. This can cause water damage to the headphones. If you suspect your headphones have been damaged by liquid, place them in a window seal or in front of a fan to dry out. If possible, remove the covers from the headphones so that the insides can dry out too. Allow about 72 hours for them to fully dry out. Then try again to see if this fixes the problem.

      "content": "Check the wires for damage. If the wires are tangled, untangle them and straighten them out and see if this fixes the problem. If it does not, connect the headphones and play some audio. Go over the entire section of wires and twist each section while checking for broken or exposed wires. Also, twist and bend the wire at the base where it connects to the headphone jack. IF you hear audio at any point, note which section of the wire you were twisting. [6] X Research source If you find the wire is damaged in a specific area, disconnect the headphones from the device. Then use a pair of wire cutters to carefully remove the outer wire covering and expose the wires inside. Be careful not to cut through the wires. If you find the wires are tangled, you'll need to untangle them. If the wires are broken, twist the wires together to reconnect them. You can also solder the wires . See if this fixes the problem. If the problem is fixed, seal the exposed wire with electrical tape. If the wire is damaged where the wire connects to the headphone jack, you may need to take it to a technician. You could try soldering the broken wire back to the headphone. If you have another cable with a 3mm headphone jack, you could try cutting the wires and then splicing the wires to another cable with a 3mm headphone jack."
