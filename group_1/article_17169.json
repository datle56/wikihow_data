[1] X Research source Instead of \"When is Thanksgiving?,\" for example, you could search, \"When is Thanksgiving 2018?\" For research questions (like, for example, \"Which scientists set the groundwork for quantum physics?\"), try an academic search engine like RefSeek, Google Scholar , or BASE."

I enjoyed reading your research on twentieth-century art history and had a question for you about Salvador Dalí. Would you consider his early work part of the surrealist or dada movement and why? I'm fascinated by surrealism and was curious about how Dalí's work matured into that art form over time. Thanks so much for your help!
