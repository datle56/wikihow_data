[1] X Research source For example, if you want to lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) to look good in your summer clothing, aim to lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week. Losing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) is specific.

For example, in order to meet your weekly weight-loss target, you’ll need to figure out how many calories you need to burn each day based on your height and current weight. If you want to improve your smile, make an appointment with your dentist for a checkup, improved hygiene tips, and a treatment plan, if necessary."

      "content": "Set up a reward system. Every time you meet a goal on your makeover list, treat yourself to something nice. For example, after you’ve lost your first 1 pound (0.45 kg), you might take a few hours of “me” time to watch your favorite movie. After 5 pounds (2.3 kg), maybe a shopping trip is in order. This positive reinforcement will make you less likely to lose interest in your game plan."
