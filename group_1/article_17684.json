      "content": "Trim the frayed edges around the rip with scissors. Pull the torn flaps back gently, then inspect them for any loose threads. Trim them so they look as neat as they possibly can. When you’re done, flatten them against the bag again unless you have some stuffing to put back in first. [1] X Research source You won’t have to take the punching bag down to repair it, but you can if the tears are difficult to reach."

      "title": "Tuck any loose stuffing back inside the bag.",
      "content": "Tuck any loose stuffing back inside the bag. Pull back the torn portion, then push the stuffing back inside. Make sure the bag’s outer surface is level and consistent before making any repairs. If it doesn’t seem right now, then it most likely won’t be too fun to hit later. If you lost some of the stuffing, you can always replace it. They are usually filled with rags, so fill them with something similar, like old clothing. When your punching bag loses stuffing, it won’t be as soft on your hands. The extra stress on your fingers and wrist increases the chance of injury."

      "content": "Clean the bag with soap and water to remove debris. Mix together about 1 cup (240 mL) of hot water and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap. Give the torn part a good scrubbing with a sponge dampened in the soapy water. If you haven’t cleaned it in a while, you can also wipe down the rest of the bag. [2] X Research source Vinegar is also an effective cleaner. Substitute 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of it in place of the dish soap, for instance. If you have a leather bag, you could use a leather cleaner instead to protect it from moisture damage."

      "title": "Wash the bag off with a damp rag to remove the soap.",
      "content": "Wash the bag off with a damp rag to remove the soap. Dampen a cloth or sponge lightly in warm water, then squeeze out the excess moisture before using it on the bag. Make sure you get all of the soap and any remaining debris around the flap. When you’re done, wipe it dry before starting the repair. [3] X Research source The tape won’t stick very well if the bag is dirty or damp, so take plenty of time getting it clean."

      "title": "Place overlapping strips of duct tape vertically over the hole.",
      "content": "Place overlapping strips of duct tape vertically over the hole. Cut the first length of duct tape so it overlaps the hole by 2 in (5.1 cm) on both ends. Fit it along the left or right edges of the tear. Then, place the next strip, overlapping the first one halfway. Keep placing new strips this way until the hole is covered. [4] X Research source Overlapping the strips makes the repair stronger. The tape should create a strong webbing without any gaps in it. That way, it won’t fall right back apart the next time you hit it."

      "content": "Set strips of duct tape horizontally over the edges of the repair. Cut the strips so they are long enough to stretch across the web of tape you made earlier. Fit them along the top and bottom edges of the tear. Position them so they overlap the existing straps halfway. They are meant to lock the repair in place, keeping the vertical webbing stuck to the bag. [5] X Research source"

Fit the first strip over one of the pieces of duct tape you laid horizontally earlier. Then, lay another strip next to it, overlapping it halfway. Keep placing more strips this way until all of the duct tape is covered. [6] X Research source To hide the repair as much as possible, choose a color of athletic tape that most closely matches the color of your punching bag. Athletic tape is available online and at most sporting goods stores. Once the torn part is sealed off with tape, you can safely hit it again. The seal will usually hold for a long time. If the tape comes undone, replace it to reseal the tear."

      "title": "Hit the bag to soften the filling if you don’t want to replace it.",
      "content": "Hit the bag to soften the filling if you don’t want to replace it. Believe it or not, the simplest way to soften up a worn-out punching bag is to punch it some more. You can leave it hanging and then hit or kick it until it reaches the softness you desire. However, try taking it down, sitting on it, stomping on it, and finding other ways to use it. It distributes the filler much more evenly so your bag stays in prime condition for longer. [7] X Research source Punching bags harden when all the filler material sinks to the bottom. If the bag feels hard on the bottom but empty at the top, then the filler is the problem. Whenever your bag needs adjustment, hit it to redistribute the filler. The fix doesn’t last forever, but you can keep doing it indefinitely to avoid having to refill the bag."

      "title": "Replace the stuffing with sand and clothing to keep your punching bag soft.",
      "content": "Replace the stuffing with sand and clothing to keep your punching bag soft. Even if you soften the old filling, it will start to harden again. The only way to fix the bag is to swap out the old stuffing for a new batch. It’s a little messy, but it isn’t very difficult to do. You can make your own stuffing at home instead of buying replacement material from a punching bag manufacturer. [8] X Research source The new stuffing eventually wears out too, but it lasts at least as long as the original stuffing used in the bag. Make sure you pack it well to ensure it lasts as long as possible. If the stuffing starts to solidify, you can always take it down and hit it to soften it up again."

      "title": "Unzip the bag to empty out all of the old filler if you’re replacing it.",
      "content": "Unzip the bag to empty out all of the old filler if you’re replacing it. Take the bag down from where it’s hanging, then find the zipper along its top edge. Unzip it to expose the filling. Have some empty trash bags nearby to collect all of the loose filling. Try to put the punching bag inside the trash bag and then tip it over to spill the filling out. [9] X Research source Punching bags are filled with loose material like sand and shredded fabric. Changing out the filling can get messy, so be prepared for some of it to spill out as soon as you undo the zipper. Some bags have sacks inside of them. They might be filled with water, air, sand, or something else. If they are still in good shape, you could reuse them."

Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut off zippers, buttons, and any other metal parts that could puncture your bag. Don’t worry about cutting the clothing, since you won’t ever see it once it’s inside the bag. [10] X Research source Cut clothing scraps are perfectly fine to use, but make sure you stuff them down around the bag. Using uncut clothing is easier since it fills the space faster with less mess."

Buy some play sand and use it to fill the bags up as much as possible. Then, close the bags and make sure they stay sealed. As long as the sand stays inside the plastic bag, it won’t damage your punching bag. [11] X Research source You can stuff your bag with only clothing. It will be gentler on your body, but you won’t develop as much strength from hitting it. If you don’t have sand available, you could use sawdust, grains, or something similar. Pick something that adds weight to the bag but won’t hurt your hands if you hit it."

      "content": "Wrap duct tape around the plastic bags for additional padding. At the very least, wrap a piece of tape across the resealable end of each bag to prevent it from bursting open when you hit it. For additional protection, cover the entire bag with tape. Keep wrapping the tape around the bag until you are no longer able to see the plastic underneath it, then cut it from the roll. If you see any exposed spots, cover them with another piece of tape. [12] X Research source You can’t really use too much tape, so add more if the bag doesn’t look too protected. More cushioning is better, since a burst bag creates a big mess that could wear down the inner part of your punching bag."

Pack in as much clothing as you can so the punching bag is thick and well-cushioned. Keep the filling centered in the bag so it receives as little impact from your punches and kicks as possible. The clothing is meant to soften the blows, and it won’t work if the sandbags are on the outside or shift around while you’re training."

Press down on the clothing, taking care not to break the sandbag in the center. Afterward, check how cushioned the sandbag is. You will probably see some space around it. Put some more clothing in to protect it. [13] X Research source Get the stuffing nice and tight. You will end up with room to stuff in more clothing to pad the sandbags and hold them in place."

After filling it with 1 ft (0.30 m) of material, place another sandbag in the center. Add another layer of clothing, compressing it with a bat. Continue alternating sandbags and clothing until the entire bag is full. [14] X Research source Once the bag is full, zip it up and hang it to test it out. Make sure it feels full but comfortable to use. With regular use, punching bags tend to last about a year. You can then replace the stuffing or readjust it to make the bag soft enough to comfortably hit again."

Pull the zipper closed, then lift it up, using a small stepladder if you need it. Clip the bag to the hanging hook on its stand or ceiling mount, then give it a test run. [15] X Research source Before hanging the bag, test it out. Try hitting it a few times. Make sure you’re happy with the consistency so you don’t have to take it back down again."

Pull back the latch on the ring to open it, then lower the bag to the floor. [16] X Research source Have a friend help you catch the bag. You can do it on your own, but it’s easier to have someone else support its weight while you climb down the ladder."

Place a bobbin of heavy sewing twine in the awl instead. Slide the end of the twine through the hole in the side, making sure it doesn’t get tangled at all. Then, place the metal cover back on top of the awl. [17] X Research source A sewing awl is a handheld tool that punches through thick straps so you can thread string through them.

If you’re unsure about what size to get, measure the old strap. Make sure the new one is long enough to fold in half. Try to get the kind used camping bags and other accessories, since they are very strong and more than capable of bearing a punching bag’s weight. [18] X Research source You can find straps available online and at many outdoor supply stores. Another option is to repurpose an old seatbelt. If the strap is completely broken, purchase a new length of nylon webbing. It’s available online and at most camping supply stores. You could also repurpose an old seatbelt. If the old strap is fixable, you could put a length of material behind it, like nylon webbing, and then sew them together for reinforcement."

Loop the thread around the metal, keeping the tail end underneath it. Then, slip the thread through the groove above it until it comes out of the top end of the awl. Thread it through the cap, screw the cap clockwise onto the awl, then insert the needle into the cap to move the thread through it.

Loop the end through the ring, tucking it underneath the rest of the strap. Make sure you pull the strap as tightly as you can. [20] X Research source The tail end has to be folded over the rest of the strap by at least 2 in (5.1 cm) in order to effectively sew it together. If the damaged strap is too short for this, consider replacing it. If you’re trying to connect a new strap directly to a punching bag, unzip it so you’re able to reach the awl when it passes through the fabric. It’s easier to do when the stuffing is out of the bag."

Then, measure another 1 in (2.5 cm) back from that and make another line. These lines will help you keep the stitches straight so the new strap not only holds up but looks great. [21] X Research source Use these lines to keep your stitches nice and straight. If you’re going to add additional lines to strengthen the strap, mark them 1 in (2.5 cm) above one another."

Poke it through, then knot the stitch like usual. This time, each hole you make will be opposite from one you made originally. You will end up creating a zigzag pattern that keeps the strap strong so it can’t break apart when you hang the punching bag. [26] X Research source To strengthen the stitching, move up about 1 in (2.5 cm) along the strap and continue stitching. If you’re able to do it 3 to 5 times, the stitching will be really strong. When you reach the last stitch, pull the thread tight, knot the loose ends, and then cut off the excess length."
