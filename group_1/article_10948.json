      "content": "Make 3 chain stitches. Tie a slip knot and place it onto your hook. Hold the yarn tail and wrap the working yarn around your hook 1 time so it catches. Slowly pull the hook back through the slip knot. You'll now see 1 chain on your hook. Repeat this 2 more times so you have a total of 3 chains on the hook. These chain stitches make up your foundation chain, which is the start of your hat."

Wrap the yarn around the hook and pull it through both of the loops on the hook. Once you pull the yarn through, you'll have 1 loop left on the hook. Joining the yarn will secure your foundation row."

To hdc, wrap the yarn over your hook and insert it into the next chain stitch. Pull it through and yarn over again. Then pull it through all 3 loops on the hook to make 1 hdc stitch. To make it easier to keep track of the rounds, consider placing a yarn marker once you've made 10 hdc stitches."

Then insert your hook into the same stitch and make another hdc stitch. Continue to hdc into each stitch for this round. To keep track of where you are in the round, look for the yarn marker that you placed at the start of the round. You'll now have 20 stitches after you've made this increase round."
