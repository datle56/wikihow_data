[16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Semi-stiff bristles are best, but if your skin is sensitive, then you can use a softer type as well. [17] X Research source The bristles should be firm enough to exfoliate the skin effectively, but not so hard that they cause irritation or discomfort. Choose a brush with a slight curve to it. The curve will fit the contours of your body easier than a straight brush will, which will help you apply pressure more evenly."
