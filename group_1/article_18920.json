      "title": "Use smooth peanut butter.",
      "content": "Use smooth peanut butter. Peanut butter is a classic solution, and most people swear by it. It works so effectively because its oil content lubricates the hair, while the natural qualities of the peanuts break down the gum. [1] X Research source You usually want 80 grams (2.8 oz) of fat per 100 grams of peanut butter."

      "content": "Use a rubber band to separate the affected hair. If possible, it’s preferable to separate your hair to keep the mess from spreading. A small piece of foil will also work to keep slippery products from spreading across your head."

      "title": "Apply peanut butter using a toothbrush.",
      "content": "Apply peanut butter using a toothbrush. Begin at the top of the gum, and work it downward with the toothbrush. Use long strokes. As the peanut butter and gum are mixed, the gum will be broken down. After a certain point, you may want to switch over to a comb or your fingers to get larger chunks out of your hair. Use the back of a spoon behind the gum as a hard surface to spread the peanut butter on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a towel to clean your hair.",
      "content": "Use a towel to clean your hair. Once peanut butter breaks the gum down, use a cloth or paper towel to work the gum out of your hair. Although peanut butter and a comb will work the chunks out, there may still be residue that can be picked up by a towel. Peanut butter will require generous shampooing to wash out of your hair."

    {
      "title": "Find a lubricant.",
      "content": "Find a lubricant. Lubricants are found easily around the home, since many cooking and toiletry items contain a lubricant you are certainly familiar with: oil.

      "title": "Apply lubricants with your fingers.",
      "content": "Apply lubricants with your fingers. Most lubricants, like oil, can be poured on or squeezed on. Work it into the area surrounding the gum using your fingers, and then draw your fingers through the entire affected area. [3] X Research source Try not to squeeze the gum too much until the area around it is completely covered in oil. If you move the gum around too soon, you will spread the mess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Finish cleaning your hair.",
      "content": "Finish cleaning your hair. After you work lubricants into your hair, a wide-toothed comb should be able to slide the gum out. Clean the comb frequently, as gum may stick to it. Before shampooing lubricants out of your hair, use a soft cloth to soak up and get rid of any remaining oil or slippery substance."

      "title": "Shampoo your hair.",

Dissolvers include, but are not limited to, eucalyptus oil, rubbing alcohol, adhesive remover, baking soda with water, lemon juice, white vinegar, and mayonnaise. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply dissolvers directly and let them sit for at least a minute.",
      "content": "Apply dissolvers directly and let them sit for at least a minute. After the product has sat for a while, begin breaking the gum apart with your fingers. If the gum does not break apart, apply more and let it sit awhile longer. It should dissolve and break apart in your fingers."

    {
      "title": "Try ice.",
      "content": "Try ice. Ice works by hardening the gum and allowing it to be chipped out of the hair. This method is known to be more painful than other methods, because the cold gum still has to be yanked out of the hair. This method is not very good for people who hate pain. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use an ice wrap to harden the gum.",
      "content": "Use an ice wrap to harden the gum. If your hair is very long, you can close your hair inside the freezer. For those with short hair, apply an ice cube to the affected area and wrap it in a plastic bag. Hold it there for twenty minutes. You can also apply salt water to your hair beforehand to lower the freezing temperature of the ice."

If the gum is too stuck to your hair to pull off, you can add a small amount of cooking oil to it and freeze it again."
