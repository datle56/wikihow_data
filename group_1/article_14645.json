      "content": "Get some tight jeans, studded belts, Converse , Vans , Etnies, hoodies, messengers bags, pin badges and wristbands. Don't buy expensive gadgets or shirts because you think it'll make you look so emo - because it won't. Look for the best bargains and buy things cheaply. eBay and Amazon are good choices to buy cheap items. Also, Hot Topic (USA) and Claire's (UK) have a good selection of clothing and accessories, but avoid the goth and punk clothes. You can also try Gap and a thrift store."

      "content": "Start listening to emo music. Examples of emo bands are: Rites of Spring, Embrace, Moss Icon, Braid, Yage, The Sea, Indian Summer, Thursday, Twelve Hour Turn, Antioch Arrow, Amanda Woodward, Belle Epoque, Framing Hanley, Matchbook Romance, Paramore, Senses Fail, American Football, My Chemical Romance, Black Veil Brides, Pierce the Veil, Sleeping With Sirens, Ghost Town, The Used, Underoath, Fall Out Boy, I Hate Myself, Owls, Sunny Day Real Estate, Texas Is The Reason and Pg 99. Many emo purists will say that all emo must be like its origin. This isn't true. Emo was reinvented in the 90s for a non-punk sound by Sunny Day Real Estate for an alternative, indie or pop punk sound. Some will even say all emo must be obscure, but that isn't true either because otherwise it's a popularity contestant, not a genre of music. It is only the music that counts. Ignore what those purists say."
