Make sure you don't melt the material of the cap as you heat your hair. Once you've covered your whole head, let the shampoo sit on your hair for 15-20 minutes. If you have access to a heated dryer, then you can sit under that instead. If your hair is long enough, you may need to clip up sections so it all fits into the shower cap."

      "content": "Repeat. After the first treatment, your hair should be visibly lighter and not have as much black in it. You may even see some of the color that your hair naturally was before you died it. It is unlikely that all the black hair dye was removed during the first run, so you should repeat the process. Once you get it the color that is light enough, dye it with the brown dye of your choice. Try to give your hair a break of a day or so between treatments. This method will not lighten naturally dark hair. The shampoos only remove added color on your hair."

      "content": "Choose the color removing products. There are a few different color removing products out there. There are some that are for lightening and some for color removal. Choose the one that you like the most or that you think will fit your particular needs. Some color removers use peroxide, such as L'Oreal Color Zap, while others are made with bleach like products in them, such as Effasol. You could also try a color removal kit from a brand like Pravana. Keep in mind that color removers will not turn your hair back to your natural hair color. Once you are done using them, your hair will most likely be an orange or yellow blond color."

Once they are fully mixed, apply the mixture to your hair. Make sure you saturate all of your hair. Put your hair under a shower cap and wait for 15-60 minutes. If you have thick or long hair, you may need more than one box of product. Since it had peroxide in it, it will have an unpleasant smell. Make sure your bathroom is ventilated and that you aren't wearing any clothes that you mind getting messed up. You should always mix the shampoos in accordance to the directions on the box."

Once all of the product is out, use a deep conditioning treatment on it to alleviate any damage the peroxide did to your hair. Rinse out the conditioner and let it dry. The color should be light enough now that you can color it with the brown dye of your choice. If the color doesn't lift after one use, you may have to repeat the steps. Some color removers are safe enough to use up to three times in one day. Just be sure to refer to the instructions that are provided with the kit to make sure that you can use it more than once. Make sure you use this product with care. The chemicals aren't as strong as bleach, but they can have a negative effect on your hair. If you already have brittle or dry hair, make sure you condition before you try this treatment."

Once it is completely dry, condition your hair with a deep conditioning treatment to help put back some of the moisture that was removed during the process. If you still have some black left, redo this process a few days later. Once you get all the black removed, you can dye it the brown shade of your choosing. Make sure you give your hair some time to recuperate before you try it again. The acid in the vitamin C makes your hair susceptible to damage, so waiting will allow your hair time to regain its natural oils before you start again."

      "content": "Visit a salon. If you don't like the idea of messing with your hair at home, you can always consult a professional colorist at a salon. Colorists know much more about hair care and maintenance than you do and will know how to treat any damage that might result from the dying treatment. A salon expert will be able to determine your hair type, any potential problems your hair might face, and a hair treatment that will give you the color you want with minimal damage. This option can get quite pricey, so be aware of the costs involved. They will have to remove the color from your hair and then dye it, so you will have to pay for both processes."

      "content": "Try a beauty school. If you are looking for salon-like treatment on a budget, look for a beauty school in your area. They offer color treatments at a fraction of the cost of a normal salon and typically do a great job with your hair. They are training, however, so be aware of what they are doing to your hair so you can make sure they are sticking to what you want done. Because they are students, be prepared to be used as a model. Clear your day because the process will probably take a few hours."

      "content": "Wait. If none of these methods work or are appealing to you, you can always wait until the black color has faded enough from your hair to dye it brown. This process may take a long time, but it is effective. You can always wash your hair with shampoo not intended for color treated hair to help the dye fade faster. Once it is faded enough, you can color it to the color of brown you want. Depending on if you've used a demi-permanent or a semi-permanent color, the time frame can extend from a few weeks to a couple months."
