      "content": "Coat the wahoo lightly with olive oil. Set the wahoo fillets on a plate or tray and drizzle about 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoon (7.4 ml) of olive oil over both pieces of fish. Use your hands or a kitchen brush to spread the olive oil on all sides of the wahoo so it doesn’t stick to the pan. [1] X Research source Save the rest of your olive oil for coating the pan. You don’t have to remove the skins from your wahoo fillets if they’re still attached. The skins are completely edible after you cook them. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw fish so you don’t spread any bacteria or foodborne illnesses. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Season your wahoo with salt and pepper. Take a pinch of salt and pepper and sprinkle it on your fish. Turn the pieces over and season each side of the fish so it has a consistent flavor throughout. [3] X Research source The amount of salt and pepper you use all depends on your personal preferences. You can use any spices or seasonings you want. Feel free to experiment and try out new flavors, such as paprika, red pepper flakes, or garlic! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil to a non-stick skillet and put it on your stove. Turn the burner onto medium-high heat and let the oil warm up. Once the olive oil starts bubbling and rippling, it’s hot enough to start cooking your fish. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the fish in the skillet and cover the pan.",
      "content": "Lay the fish in the skillet and cover the pan. Slowly place the fillets in the pan with the meat side down if they still have the skin on. Otherwise, you can start cooking them on any side. Make sure the fish are spaced out around the pan so it’s not too overcrowded, or else they won’t cook properly. Put a lid on the pan so the oil doesn’t splatter. [6] X Research source Be careful when putting your wahoo in the pan since hot oil could bubble and land on your skin. Try to lay the skillets away from you so it’s less likely to splatter."

      "title": "Let the wahoo cook for 3–4 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the wahoo cook for 3–4 minutes. Don’t touch or move the fillets at all since the pieces could break apart. Instead, leave them alone so the bottom sides of the fish cook through. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Flip the fish over and let it cook for another 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Flip the fish over and let it cook for another 3 minutes. Carefully slide a spatula underneath the fillet and gently turn it over to the other side. Put the lid back on the pan and leave your fish for another 3 minutes so it cooks through. As a rule of thumb, cook your fish for 3 minutes per side for every 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of thickness.

If the temperature is at least 145 °F (63 °C), then you’re finished cooking your fish. If it’s any lower, cook it for another 1–2 minutes before checking the temperature again.

      "content": "Melt butter over each of the fillets if you want a richer flavor. If you really want to enhance the flavor of your fish, put ¼ tablespoon (3.5 g) of unsalted butter on top of each fillet. Let the butter melt onto the meat so it can absorb the flavor. Wait for the butter to melt completely before serving your fish. [10] X Research source You don’t have to put butter on your fish if you don’t want to."

If you want to bring out some of the other flavors, squeeze a lemon wedge on the fish to add a hint of citrus. You can also use fresh chopped parsley to add some more color to the dish. [11] X Research source Enjoy your fish with a refreshing side, such as a salad. If you have any leftovers, you can keep them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.

Place the slices on top of the fillets so the flavors can absorb into the meat while they cook. Squeeze the juice from whatever you have leftover from the lemon for an added hint of citrus to the meat. If you don’t have enough juice from the leftover piece of lemon, it’s okay to use another lemon or prepackaged lemon juice."

Then take a pinch of salt and pepper for each piece of fish and sprinkle it over the meat for seasoning. [15] X Research source You can use as little or as much salt and pepper you want. It all depends on how strong you want to season the fish. Only use a pinch at a time since it can be really easy to over-season."

Put the foil on top of the tray and fold the edges underneath. Put your tray of fish on the center rack of your oven and leave it alone while it cooks.

Use a kitchen brush to spread the marinade over your fillets. Make sure you coat the pieces evenly and let them sit for about 30 minutes so the flavor absorbs into the meat. [20] X Research source While some sources say to refrigerate the fish right before you cook it, it could cause the fish to cook unevenly or make it dry out.
