If your puppy can walk around in circles in its crate, the crate is too large.

The amount of time that you can safely leave your puppy in its crate depends on how good your puppy is at holding its bladder. The younger the puppy is, the more often it will need to relieve itself. [3] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source If your pup is about 10 weeks old, it should spend no more than 30-60 minutes in its crate. [4] X Research source If your pup is 11-14 weeks old, it won’t be able to spend more than one to three hours in its crate. A puppy aged 15-16 weeks old should not spend more than three to four hours in its cage. When your sweet puppy turns 17 weeks old, it should be able to spend about four to five hours in its crate. Never leave a puppy in its crate all day."
