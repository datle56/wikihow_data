      "content": "Blink your eyes one at a time, leaving them both briefly closed together. Frog blinking is pretty simple as long as you can wink with both of your eyes. The real trick to frog blinking smoothly is keeping the other parts of your face relaxed so they don’t move or twitch while you’re doing it. To frog blink properly, follow these steps: Relax your face so you look expressionless. Close one of your eyes. Close your other eye. Open your first eye. Open your second eye. To see what a frog blink looks like, check out this TikTok from creator @thefinaleliza. Tip: Practice in front of a mirror or record yourself while you practice so you can see if you’re doing a frog blink correctly."

      "content": "Frog blinking shows that you’re losing interest. If someone’s talking about something you don’t particularly care about or if you’re just bored, then a frog blink is a perfect response. The expressionless look and lazily blinking your eyes one at a time really shows that you’re not listening or absorbing what someone is telling you. Frog blinking also appears in popular cartoons like Hazbin Hotel when characters are confused or tuning out a conversation. Tiktok user @okaydudegotripoveraknife shared a video showing that they use frog blinking as a way to scare people away from them."

      "content": "Frog blinking became popular through a viral TikTok trend. Even though it’s not clear exactly which one started the frog blinking trend, videos started appearing on TikTok in the early 2020s where people attempt to frog blink. Since then, it’s only become more of a trend as people try to see if they can frog blink correctly. Many frog blinking TikTok videos use a sound originally posted by @tyler.renee and include the caption “I know the frog blink hates to see me coming.” TikTok user @nirami1 posted a frog blink animation that may have made the trend popular again. One popular TikTok video from @reilly_flowerz shows her frog blinking, and she says she does it when she makes eye contact with strangers."

Instead of opening and closing your eyes, try to squint and flex the muscles in the corners of your eyes. When you do it correctly, your eyelids will move slightly sideways toward your nose. Watch this video from @itss.not.marii on TikTok for an amazing example of the spider blink."

      "content": "Blinking is a way for frogs to attract mates. In recent studies, scientists have found that when female frogs find a potential mate, they either blink or wink at the male frog as a way to “flirt” with them. After doing more experiments, scientists even found that male frogs are more likely to approach females that blink or wink at them. [4] X Research source These studies were mostly done on concave-eared torrent frogs in China, so blinking may mean something different to other species."
