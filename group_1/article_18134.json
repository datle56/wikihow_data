      "content": "Insert your micro SD card into your computer. Some computers will only have a full-sized card slot, so you will need a micro SD card adapter or reader compatible with your micro SD card. For example, if you own a SanDisk micro SD card, you should have a micro SD card adapter that came with it. The adapter looks like a regular SD card with a slot at the bottom where you insert your micro SD card. Formatting to FAT32 is usually your best option, however, FAT32 formatted cards won’t let you transfer or store a file more than 4 GB. You can also purchase a third-party micro SD card adapter if you don’t already have one. Just make sure that it is compatible with your micro SD card. Some third-party adapters also use a USB component on one end and operate like a flash drive. If you are using a micro SD card adapter with your computer, make sure that the lock toggle is up and in the unlocked position. If it is in the locked position your computer may not read the card or let you make any changes. It may be “Read-only”. It’s a good idea to copy the files currently on the card over to your computer to save. This will allow you to keep your data and files for transferring back after you format."
