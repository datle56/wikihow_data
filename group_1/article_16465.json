      "content": "Do chores around the house to be productive as you work up an appetite. Another way to quickly bring up feelings of hunger is to spend 30 to 60 minutes working on chores. This will keep you moving and active without having to work too hard. Shortly after you finish, you may find yourself craving a meal. [2] X Research source You don’t need to spend hours being active to start feeling hungry. Work for a little bit, and then wait for a while to see if you feel hungrier than before."

If taking the stairs or going the long way to get somewhere is an option for you, you can do this throughout your day to help your body work up an appetite on its own.

      "content": "Drink water first thing in the morning. Drinking a glass of water can help your body prepare the digestive system, and feel more hungry for food in an hour or two. By feeling hungry in the morning, you’ll be on track to eat your meals on schedule. [6] X Research source Skipping breakfast can make you less hungry throughout the day, as it can keep your metabolism from “starting” after sleeping. Eating food in the morning is more likely to help you feel hungry during the day than skipping an early meal."

      "title": "Plan your meals around the times of day you feel most hungry.",
      "content": "Plan your meals around the times of day you feel most hungry. Your daily eating habits don’t have to line up with society’s expectations about when you should eat. For example, if you feel hungry around 11 in the morning, 3 in the afternoon, and 7 at night, it’s probably best to fit your eating schedule in with that, rather than forcing your body to feel hungry when it’s “supposed to.” [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source One way to figure out when your eating times should be is to go through your day, writing down feelings of hunger as they start to come up, and eating when they do. This can help you create a natural eating schedule. You can also try rating your fullness on a scale from 1-10 to see if that helps you find a good time of day to eat. When your fullness levels are lowest, that may be a good time to stop and eat a meal."

      "content": "Set an alarm for your preferred eating times. Once you have figured out when you like to eat, try setting alarms for your meal times. If you have a phone, you can set up daily alarms that will remind you when you should eat. You may also be able to program a few alarms into your watch. If you don’t have any devices capable of setting alarms, you can always work on getting in the habit of regularly checking the time and trying to eat when you notice the time for a meal is coming up."

      "content": "Split large meals into smaller snacks. If you sit down to a meal and find that you can’t finish it, or the plate just looks too big to start eating it at all, it’s okay to split each meal into 2 meals. This allows you to eat just a little bit at each meal, 6 times a day. Some nutritionists consider this more natural than eating 3 times a day. [8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

While there are other causes, of course, going for hours without eating deprives your brain of nutrients, and can easily lead to a headache.

      "content": "Listen to your stomach to see if it’s gurgling. One way your body tries to tell you it needs fuel is the sound of gurgling coming from your stomach, which often feels like a slight cramp or a bubbling sensation. Paying attention to your stomach’s signals is an important way to get familiar with feelings of hunger. [11] X Research source Try checking in every few hours to see if you notice any grumbling or pain in your stomach."

      "content": "Wait 10 to 15 minutes if you aren’t sure you feel hungry. If you have trouble noticing your mental and physical state, or if you can’t tell if the symptoms you feel are a result of hunger, you can make a habit of waiting 10 to 15 minutes after noticing a symptom to see if it stays or passes. [12] X Research source If you still feel one or more signs of hunger after around 10 minutes, it’s almost certainly hunger. This is especially true if another symptom of hunger came up as you were waiting."
