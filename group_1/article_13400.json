      "content": "Grab black liquid liner with a fine tip. Liquid eyeliners, which are shaped like pens, will help you get that sharp, sleek wing⁠—they allow you to be precise and create more defined lines than other kinds of eyeliners. [1] X Research source Try a gel liner if you want more control over the outcome⁠: you can pick the brush size, color intensity, and thickness of line. Just be aware that gel liners may not provide as much precision because they’re thicker and creamier⁠. For a softer look, try using a black or dark brown pencil liner⁠. Pencil liners will also be less sharp than liquid liners. Make sure that your skin doesn't react poorly to the eyeliner if you have sensitive skin.

      "title": "Use a guide to achieve even wings.",
      "content": "Use a guide to achieve even wings. Find something straight, like a pen or ruler, to mark down your desired angle before you draw the rest of the wing. Hold your guide against your face so it forms a line that starts from the side of your nose and extends to the outer edge of your eyebrow. At the corner of your eye, follow the guide and make a tiny line with your eyeliner to mark down the angle. Repeat on the other eye. [3] X Research source This step is optional, but makes your wings more likely to match each other."

      "title": "Draw the bottom line of the wing.",
      "content": "Draw the bottom line of the wing. Hold the eyeliner to the corner of your eye and draw a straight line at a shallow angle that slopes upwards. There isn’t an exact angle you need to achieve, but you can try using the downwards angle of your eyebrow as a reference by mirroring the angle upwards. [4] X Research source For a larger wing, try starting the line from slightly under the corner of your eye. Place your elbow on a flat surface if your hand is wobbling. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Extend the line as far as you wish. The farther you draw the line, the bigger and more dramatic your final wing will be. There isn’t an exact guideline⁠, since you should tailor your E-Girl eyeliner wing to your personal preferences⁠⁠. Experiment with different lengths to figure out what’s best for your look!"

      "title": "Complete the wing outline.",
      "content": "Complete the wing outline. Start at the tip of the first line and draw another straight line in the opposite direction, towards your eyelid. Your line should end on the center of your upper eyelid. Repeat on your other eye. [6] X Research source At this point, you should have unfilled triangular outlines extending outwards from both eyes."

      "title": "Fill in the wings with eyeliner.",
      "content": "Fill in the wings with eyeliner. Hold your eyeliner to the tip of the wing and fill in the triangular outline, stroke by stroke, by flicking or sweeping the eyeliner from the tip of the wing inwards towards your eye. Continue until the outline is completely darkened and filled in. Repeat on the other eye. [7] X Research source Keep a light hand so you have maximum control! If you want to erase mistakes more easily, you can sketch the wing outline with a pencil liner first, and then fill it in with the liquid liner after it’s set up perfectly."

      "content": "Clean up the edges of the wings with a rag or wipe. If the bottom lines of your wings are looking a little messy, now’s the time to smooth them out! Grab a rag or makeup wipe and pull it down over your index finger. Hold your index finger under your eye where the bottom of the wing starts. Make dragging motions under the wing, following the wing’s angle outwards and upwards, to clean up the line and make it smooth and sharp. Repeat on the other eye. [8] X Research source This may also extend the tip of your wing a little."

      "content": "Draw on the bottom lashes to intensify the look. Hold the same eyeliner pen to the bottom of your outer eye corner and make a quick downwards and outwards motion to draw a small line. This line serves as your first bottom lash! Then, draw on the rest of the bottom lashes, leaving a small gap between each one. Make each line shorter as you work inward, and keep adding lines until you’ve reached the inner corner of your eye. Repeat on the other eye. [9] X Research source Your lashes don’t have to be perfectly spaced or drawn!"

Hold the pencil to the outside bottom corner of your eye and use your other hand to lightly pull down your eye in order to reveal the waterline. Draw a white line inwards to completely line the waterline. [10] X Research source You don’t need to extend the white line past your eyes or into the wings. Tightlining helps make your eyes look larger and brighter, and white helps them pop even more! [11] X Research source"
