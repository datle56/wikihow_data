      "content": "Sit on the floor with both legs straight out in front of you. Keep your legs in front, and sit up straight to elongate your spine. Consider bracing your back against something like a wall to stabilize yourself during this stretch. [1] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 June 2021.

      "content": "Bring the soles of your feet together. Your knees should bend and point outward. It may be easier to bring one in first, then the other to meet it. Make sure you are sitting upright, with your head above your spine. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring your heels as close to your body as you can.",
      "content": "Bring your heels as close to your body as you can. Hold on to your ankles and pull your feet towards your pelvis. Get as close as possible, but don't force the position beyond your comfort. DO NOT FLAP YOUR LEGS! Moving your legs up in down in a flapping motion can dislocate your joint connecting your leg to the pelvis."

      "title": "Lean forward.",
      "content": "Lean forward. Make sure your back stays straight. You can use your elbows to push gently on your thighs for a deeper stretch. [3] X Research source If you are a beginner, you do not need to lean too far, just enough to feel the stretch. As you get more comfortable doing it, you may be able to lean further forward."

    {
      "title": "Hold the pose for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the pose for 30 seconds. Stay still in this pose and do not bounce up and down, even slightly. If you start to feel extreme pain at any point, then back off the stretch slightly. Try to stay in the stretch for 30-40 seconds. [4] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. You should feel a deep stretch, but it shouldn't be so intense that it changes how you're breathing or makes you tense up.

      "title": "Relax and repeat the stretch.",
      "content": "Relax and repeat the stretch. To really make this effective, you will have to repeat the stretch. Hold the position for 30 seconds two to four times, depending on your tightness, flexibility, and comfort. [6] X Research source"
