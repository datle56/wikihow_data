      "content": "Push back your cuticles with a cuticle pusher. If you’d like to soften your cuticles first, soak your hands in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes. Then gently press a cuticle pusher against the thin layer of cuticle skin to push it back against your nail fold. Expose as much of your natural nail as possible so the gel nails will last longer. You can use either a metal or plastic cuticle pusher or an orangewood stick to push back your cuticles. Trim off any hangnails with a cuticle trimmer if necessary.

Continue buffing your nails until the entire surface is slightly dull. By doing this, you’ll roughen up the smooth, shiny texture to help the gel adhere.

Continue wiping until all of the buffing dust and any remaining natural oils are gone. [5] X Research source Dust and natural oils will interfere with the gel’s ability to bond to your natural nail, so it’s essential to cleanse your nails before applying any nail glue or gel."

      "content": "Choose natural or clear tips in your desired shape and length. Based on the manicure style you’re going for, choose from any of the available nail tip lengths and shapes, making sure to use either clear or natural tips. [6] X Research source Popular nail tip shapes include coffin, almond, stiletto, square, rounded or oval, and squoval . [7] X Research source These typically come in lengths of extra-short, short, medium, long, and extra-long. Avoid using white tips since these require much more preparation to get the gel to bond."

      "title": "Assign 1 nail tip to each of your natural nails, matching the widths.",
      "content": "Assign 1 nail tip to each of your natural nails, matching the widths. Pick up a set of 10 or more tips at a local beauty store or order them online. From the set, assign 1 tip to each of your natural nails. To do this, find a tip that perfectly matches the width of your natural nail. The edges of the tip should line up perfectly with the sidewalls of your natural nail. If you choose a set with more than 10 tips, you’ll have more sizes to choose from. This can be helpful if you’re not sure what widths you’ll need."

[8] X Research source Press the entire well area down onto your natural nail tip, keeping the sides of your nail and the tip in perfect alignment. Hold the tip in place for between 5 to 10 seconds until the bond is secure. Then proceed to apply each of the remaining 9 nail tips to the corresponding natural nails. Make sure the entire well area overlaps with your natural nail for the most secure application. Use a rocking motion as you press on the nail tip to squeeze out any air bubbles from the glue."

Work in gentle strokes to build up a textured, dull surface. [9] X Research source While buffing the surface of the tip, you can also shape up the edges with the file as well, if desired. At this point, the entire surface of your natural nail and nail tip should be dulled down."

Apply it to each nail a thin layer. Place the brush at your cuticle and pull the product across your natural nail and the tip until you reach the free edge (i.e. the very end of the nail tip). [11] X Research source Start with 1 stroke in the center of your nail and then work parallel strokes on either side. Choose a primer gel from the same manufacturer of the gel you’ll be using for the best results. You can pick up a complete gel kit from a beauty supply store or online retailer.

The amount of curing time will depend on what type of gel and nail drying lamp you’re using. Follow the curing times recommended by the gel and lamp manufacturers for the best results. An LED lamp will cure the gel more quickly than a UV lamp. For reference, you may need to wait around 2 minutes for the primer to cure under a UV lamp. Under an LED lamp the curing time may be closer to 30 seconds. [13] X Research source"

Holding the brush parallel to your nail, lay the gel down in the center. Leave a little space between the gel and your cuticle.

Pull the brush in the opposite direction, toward the free edge, to divide the bead of gel in half. [16] X Research source Then distribute the gel on either side of your nail using the brush. Make sure the first coat covers the sidewalls and the free edge. On the left and right sides of the nail shimmy the brush towards the side of your nail. Don’t press down on your nail with the brush as you apply the gel. Instead, think of the gel as a cushion between your nail and the brush; you’re just distributing it lightly with the brush."

Run the lamp for the necessary curing time, based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. For an LED lamp, cure the gel for at least 30 seconds. For a UV lamp, wait at least 3 minutes. To avoid smudging the gel, complete the first coat on 1 hand then cure it under the lamp before moving onto the other hand."

Use the file and gentle pressure to gradually soften and buff away any imperfections. Then wipe away the dust with a gel cleanser-soaked cotton pad and a manicure brush. Note that you shouldn’t try to re-shape the nail tip at this stage; that should be done prior to gel application. This step is just for finishing off the cured gel."

After curing the gel topcoat, feel free to add a coat of standard nail polish or nail art elements if you’d like."
