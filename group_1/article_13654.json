      "content": "Plumbers don’t expect tips but still appreciate it if you give them one. Most plumbers are paid by the hour or day, and don’t rely on tips as part of their income. However, if your plumber did an exceptional job, worked on a long, strenuous project, or responded to an emergency call, then offering them a tip will really show your gratitude and be a nice bonus for them. It’s not necessary to tip for small jobs, like fixing a simple leak or unclogging a drain, but consider tipping for jobs like installing a toilet or running new pipes through your home. Some plumbing companies don’t allow their employees to accept tips. If you try offering a tip and they refuse, they may have a no-tip policy in place. If you’re feeling financially burdened and can’t afford to tip, don’t worry about giving one."

If the job was straightforward and easy, like a simple drain cleaning or leak repair, then it’s okay to tip on the lower end since it wasn’t a lot of work. For larger repairs, like replacing pipes, installing appliances, or running new water lines through your home, then consider the higher end of the range. Some common jobs and the standard tip amounts are: [1] X Research source Drain cleaning: $20–30 USD Leak repairs: $20 USD or more (depending on the leak’s severity) Appliance installations: $20–50 USD Water line installations: $100–200 USD"

Rather than giving extra cash at the end of a plumbing job, offer them coffee, tea, water, or a snack, especially if they’re working all day. They’ll appreciate the refreshments while they’re making repairs so they can stay focused on the job. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Tip contractors if they do provide exceptional service. Most home contractors, like electricians, HVAC installers, painters, and window installers, don’t expect tips since gratuities are usually already worked into the service costs. Still, if you’re really happy with the service and the workers went above and beyond, then it doesn’t hurt to offer a tip that’s less than 20% of the total bill. If you’re tipping a cleaner or yard maintenance worker, give them a larger tip or gift around the holiday season rather than providing one every time they visit.
