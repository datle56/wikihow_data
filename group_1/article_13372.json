If there are any dangers nearby preventing you from getting close to the person, don’t endanger your own life as well as theirs. Call emergency services and wait for help to arrive. [3] X Research source For example, if the person has collapsed due to exposure to smoke and fire or toxic fumes, steer clear of the area. If the person is in a dangerous situation and you’re able to move them safely, do so before trying to give them CPR. For example, if they’ve collapsed in the middle of the street, wait for a moment when there’s no oncoming traffic and then move them out of the road."

If they lose consciousness and are not breathing, however, you should administer rescue breaths if possible, or stick to hands-only CPR if you’re not trained in doing rescue breathing. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If they’re not breathing, have no pulse, and are unresponsive, try to perform some form of CPR even if you are untrained or rusty in your abilities. Shake the victim's shoulders and loudly ask, \"Are you okay?\" If you receive no response, check for signs of breathing, like the person’s chest rising and falling. Check for a pulse by placing your fingers on their carotid artery, next to the windpipe just below the jaw. Hands-only CPR is ideal for those without formal CPR training or for people unsure in their CPR abilities. It does not involve the rescue breathing measures associated with conventional CPR, but instead focuses on chest compressions.

If 2 or more people are available, 1 person should dial for help while the other begins CPR. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If a person is unresponsive because of suffocation (from drowning, for example), then it's recommended to immediately begin CPR for 1 minute and then call your local emergency number. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the victim is a child between the ages of 1 to 8 years, perform 5 cycles of chest compressions and rescue breathing before calling emergency services if you are the only person available. This should take roughly 2 minutes. Calling emergency services will bring paramedics to the location. Typically, the dispatcher will also be able to instruct you on how to perform CPR."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the person is on their side or stomach (prone), then gently roll them onto their back while trying to support their head and neck. Try to make note if the person experienced significant trauma while falling and becoming unconscious. Once on the person is on their back, kneel next to their neck and shoulders so you have better access to their chest and mouth. Keep in mind that you should not move the person if you suspect they may have suffered a significant head, neck, or spinal injury. In this case, moving them is life-threatening and should be avoided, unless emergency help won't be available for a long time (a few hours or more)."

Place one hand directly over the center of the person's chest (between their nipples, generally) and your other hand on top of the first for reinforcement.

[11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you're not sure what 100 compressions a minute really means, try doing your compressions to the beat of the Bee Gee's song \"Stayin' Alive\", or Queen's song '\"Another One Bites the Dust\". Use your upper body weight and strength, not just your arm strength, to push straight down on the chest. Your chest compressions should cause the person's chest to depress at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). Push hard and understand that it is likely you will break the person's ribs. This is extremely common, and you shouldn't stop compressions even if you think this has happened. Chest compressions are hard work and you may have to switch off with other bystanders before emergency personnel arrive. Continue doing this action as until the person becomes responsive or until the emergency medical team arrive and take over."

If performing CPR on a small child between the ages of 1 and 8 years, only use 1 hand to perform chest compressions. The rate of chest compressions is the same for both adults and children (roughly 100 per minute). For children between the ages of 1 and 8 years, you will need to depress the sternum (chest bone) 1/3 to 1/2 of the depth of the child's chest.

Put your palm on their forehead and gently tilt (extend) their head back a little. Then, with your other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open up their airway, making it easier to give them oxygen. Take 5 to 10 seconds to check for normal breathing. Look for chest motion, listen for breathing, and see if you can feel the victim's breath on your cheek or ear. Note that gasping is not considered to be normal breathing. If they are already breathing, no breathing assistance is needed. However, if they are still not breathing, then proceed to the mouth-to-mouth breathing part of CPR. To perform the jaw-thrust technique, sit above the person's head.

You should be aware that mouth-to-mouth CPR can transfer infectious viral and bacterial diseases between the victim and the rescuer.

If it doesn't, then repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver and try again. Don't be too timid or grossed out, because a person's life is in your hands. Although there's carbon dioxide in your breath when you exhale, there's still enough oxygen to benefit a victim during CPR. Again, the purpose isn't always to revive them or continue indefinitely, but to buy some time for them until paramedics arrive. Approximately 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths is considered to be 1 cycle of conventional CPR for both adults and children.

Let the baby continue to cough, as this is the best way to dislodge the blockage. If the baby is not able to cough and begins to turn bright red or blue, the airway is completely blocked.
