      "content": "Drain the oil. Depending on the engine you are using, you may need to use a pair of pliers to disconnect the spark plug wire to remove the oil drain plug. Use a suitable receptacle to drain the oil into, and wipe any spills. It's best to drain the oil from an engine when it's slightly warm, as the heat allows for a faster flow than when cold."

      "content": "Drain the gas. Loosen the fuel hose clamp before you start draining your fuel. You can do so by tracing the route of the fuel hose from the engine to the base of the gas tank. Notice where the hose attaches to your lawn mowers carburetor. [1] X Research source Using your pliers, squeeze the clamp loose and slide it upwards on the hose. Now you can detach the hose and drain your fuel into a bucket."
