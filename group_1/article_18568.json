      "content": "Blot any wet paint off leather with a clean cloth and a cotton swab. Press a clean cloth lightly on top of the paint, so you don’t rub it into the leather. Dab and pick up as much paint as you can without physically rubbing your shoes. Then, roll a clean swab on top of the area, which will pick up any leftover paint. [1] X Research source Rubbing the paint will only spread it around, which you definitely don’t want."
