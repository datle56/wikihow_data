      "title": "Believe that telekinesis is possible.",
      "content": "Believe that telekinesis is possible. You can't expect to achieve the miraculous if you approach it with a closed, skeptical mind. If you tell yourself that nothing will happen, even if on a subconscious level, you’ll prove yourself correct. Your starting point, then, should be to convince yourself that it’s possible to move objects with your mind. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Meditate",
      "content": "Meditate daily to improve your mental discipline. Wear loose clothes, sit in a comfortable position, and close your eyes. Breathe in deeply as you count to 4, hold your breath for a 4 count, then count to 8 as you exhale. Attend to your thoughts as you control your breathing, and imagine that each thought is like a star in the sky. As you exhale, imagine the stars fade away except for a single sun that grows brighter and brighter. Passing, random thoughts quiet as your mind focuses on the one bright star. Continue to control your breathing and, without straining, concentrate on focusing your mind on a single thought. Most people are accustomed to doing 50 things at once, so be patient . It might take time to hone your mental prowess and focus your mind on a single thought."

      "title": "Practice visualizing objects with as much detail as possible.",
      "content": "Practice visualizing objects with as much detail as possible. Start by observing a small object around you, such as an apple or cup. Try to commit each of its features to your memory. When you feel that you know and understand the object, close your eyes and see it in your mind’s eye as clearly as you can. Try to visualize its shape, the color, the feeling (hard/soft), and pretend that you are the object (you can feel it). Practice visualizing as you meditate; control your breathing, clear your mind, and focus on a single object. Most importantly, you should make sure nothing else is on your mind, except the object you want to move. As you practice, try visualizing gradually more complex objects. Work your way up until you can visualize entire scenes, such as your room. See yourself sitting among all of the objects as clearly as possible."

      "title": "Be patient, and keep practicing.",
      "content": "Be patient, and keep practicing. People believe that telekinesis requires you to be fully and truly be in the moment . Your mind can’t wander, and your thoughts can’t stray. It takes time to achieve this degree of mental discipline, so try practicing meditation and visualization every day. With practice, you should notice that it becomes easier to clear your thoughts , focus your attention, and clearly visualize objects. Once you’ve trained your mind, you can try reaching out to objects with your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Concentrate",
      "content": "Concentrate on a small object and nothing else. Place a small object, like a pencil or matchstick, in front of you. Meditate to clear your mind and get in the zone. Quiet the racing, random thoughts, and see the object clearly with your mind’s eye."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on the connection between you and an object.",
      "content": "Focus on the connection between you and an object. Once you’ve learned to control your thoughts and visualize objects, concentrate on the energy that links you and the outside world. Visualize the matter and energy that flows through you, other objects, and the space between. See the boundaries between you and outside objects fade away, and remind yourself that you and the object are one system. This is the idea that forms the basis of telekinesis: you and the object are one. In order to try to move an object, train yourself to see and believe in this connection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Visualize clearly how you want to manipulate the object.",
      "content": "Visualize clearly how you want to manipulate the object . Imagine exactly how you want the object to move. Decide whether you wish to pull, push, crush or spin it. Concentrate on the object, and see it moving as you intended with your mind’s eye. [2] X Research source Visualize a single motion only. Try not to get distracted or imagine it moving in various ways. Just concentrate on one action."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus your intention on the object.",
      "content": "Focus your intention on the object. Stay centered on the object, and send your intention to it as you would your arm or leg. Remember not to let your thoughts stray and to focus on a single action. You’re one with the object, so attempt to move it as you would any other part of your body. Don’t get discouraged if your first attempts are unsuccessful. Keep working on disciplining your mind, and try refining your abilities with telekinetic exercises."

    {
      "title": "Work on feeling the energy that flows through your body.",
      "content": "Work on feeling the energy that flows through your body. Flex every muscle in one of your arms from your shoulder to your fist for 10 or 15 seconds, then completely relax your arm. Notice how it feels to build energy, control it, and release it. Use these feelings to refine your ability to direct force to an object and move it with your intention. [3] X Research source Since the key to telekinesis is that you and the object are one, it's important to feel and understand the energy that forms this connection."

      "title": "Try spinning a psi wheel.",
      "content": "Try spinning a psi wheel . A psi wheel is a pyramid-shaped piece of folded paper that sits on a toothpick connected to a piece of foil. Focus on the object, reach out to it with your thoughts, and spin it with your mind. Trying to simply spin the wheel without knocking it over can help you learn to control your abilities. Place a glass jar or container over the wheel to prevent wind from spinning it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Envision yourself moving objects using psi balls.",
      "content": "Envision yourself moving objects using psi balls . A psi ball is a ball of energy that you can feel and manipulate in your mind. With practice, you can try using a psi ball to manipulate objects, too. With your hands held around your stomach, feel the energy at your core. Hold your hands like they're cupping a ball, and visualize its details. [4] X Research source See the ball with your mind’s eye. How big is it? Is it radiating? What color is it? Once you’ve established its form, move it around and let it morph shape and size. In time, you can try to use this ball to deliver energy into other objects. The same way a baseball would knock over a vase, use a psi ball to affect solid, visible objects."

      "title": "Practice focusing on a candle flame.",
      "content": "Practice focusing on a candle flame. Light a candle, clear your mind, and let the flame fill your thoughts. Watch it flicker and move. Then, as you focus on it, try to move it with your mental energy. Imagine moving it right, moving it left, stretching it up, making it grow in intensity, and dimming it."

    {
      "title": "Switch up your exercises.",
      "content": "Switch up your exercises. To keep things fresh, try working on 2 or 3 exercises per day. Start by meditating and visualizing to get in the zone. Then try spinning a psi wheel, doing flamework, bending a spoon or fork, or rolling a pen or pencil. Practicing a variety of exercises might help make it easier to practice without getting bored or frustrated. Try doing each exercise for around 20 minutes and practice for about an hour a day."

      "title": "Stop when you feel mentally and physically tired.",
      "content": "Stop when you feel mentally and physically tired. Like any other form of exercise, it’s important to take a break when you get tired. Grab a snack, drink some water, and rest for a few hours. Get back to work only once you feel refreshed. [5] X Research source"
