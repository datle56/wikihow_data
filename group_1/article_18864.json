      "content": "Locate your nearest Sephora store. Chances are, there’s a Sephora not too far from you. It may be located inside a mall, a JCPenney, or in your city’s downtown area. You can use the Sephora website’s shop locator to find one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Visit the store as a potential customer.",
      "content": "Visit the store as a potential customer. Try to visit the store at a time when they won’t be busy. If you’re available to visit in the middle of a weekday, that’s best. Most people will be at work, and the store probably won’t be busy. [1] X Research source Asking for free samples when salespeople are very busy can sometimes seem bothersome or rude. When salespeople have downtime, they’re much more likely to be happy to make you plenty of samples."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for samples.",
      "content": "Ask for samples. You can ask for samples of any of the products that you see. Generally, Sephora salespeople are instructed to offer three free samples per customer. You can always try asking for more, but you may not get them. [2] X Research source If the salesperson sees that you’re actually planning to buy something, they’re more likely to offer more than three samples. Some Sephora “cast members” are assigned to certain “worlds” such as perfumes or eye shadows. It’s usually best to ask for the sample from the person working in that “world” rather than the cashier."

    {
      "title": "Thank the cast member.",
      "content": "Thank the cast member. Always express gratitude for the free samples. If you’re friendly and appreciative, you’re more likely to be offered more samples in the future. Let them know you’re excited to try the products at home and report back. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a current deal. Most deals have a promo code that you’ll need to enter at checkout. Many deals are only for “Beauty Insiders”, so you may need to register before you can take advantage of them. Registering as a Beauty Insider is free and easy, so it’s worth it if you want to get the deal. Unlike shopping in the store, you always have to buy something in order to get something for free online. Take note of the deals you want.

If you’ve only registered as a Beauty Insider, you’ll be upgraded to VIB status if you purchase $350 worth of products in a year.
