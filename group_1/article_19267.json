      "content": "Get plenty of notebooks, pens, and pencils for school. If your teachers sent out syllabuses ahead of time, scan each document to find the list of required materials you need to purchase before school starts. You don’t necessarily need to bring everything with you on the first day of school, but you don’t want to end up running around after the first day to purchase all of the supplies you need. [1] X Research source You probably want to purchase one dedicated notebook and folder for each class as well. Beyond that, you may want to get some white-out, a mini-stapler, highlighters, an eraser, and a pencil sharpener. The first year of high school is a great occasion for a new backpack! Get something spacious and comfortable that fits your style."

      "content": "Get your bag ready the night before so you don’t have to rush. If the first day is going to be orientation, you probably don’t need all of your textbooks. However, you should at least pack a notebook and something to write with. [2] X Research source Make sure you bring a spare phone charger in case your phone dies. You may also want to bring lip balm and period products if necessary. [3] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019.

      "content": "Go through your closet and pull out what you’re going to wear . If your school has a set uniform, pull it out and set it aside for the morning. If they don’t, make sure your clothes aren’t in violation of your school’s dress code. You can wear whatever you’d like, but try to choose a top and bottom that are going to be comfortable. [4] X Research source Look up the weather forecast. If it’s supposed to rain, make sure your outfit is appropriate for the weather. Grab an umbrella and rain boots if you need them. Pick something that reflects your personality and sense of style. If you aren’t sure what to wear, some sneakers, jeans, and a basic shirt is a safe, comfortable bet."

      "title": "If you need to pay for lunch, get your money the night before.",
      "content": "If you need to pay for lunch, get your money the night before. If your school wants you to bring your own lunch, pack it and toss it in the fridge before you go to bed. If your school offers free lunches for students, double-check to make sure. Having a plan for lunch will keep you from sitting around the cafeteria with nothing to eat. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you’re packing your own lunch, keep it simple. A sandwich, piece of fruit, and a granola bar is a solid choice."

      "title": "Your high school likely sent out several emails about the first day.",
      "content": "Your high school likely sent out several emails about the first day. Review any communications from your school regarding the dress code, schedule, and requirements for the first day back. [6] X Research source Day one is almost always orientation, so read through their announcements and letters to get a sense for what that’s going to entail. Checking your emails often is a good habit. It's always a good idea to do that... so that way you will know about any important events, grade level information, upcoming assemblies at school, assignment deadlines, or any upcoming tests. [7] X Research source At orientation, you’ll probably tour the school, hear an introduction from your teachers and principal, and go through the key policies and norms. This is especially important for virtual learning. Your school will likely send out instructions for setting up your video conferencing software. Complete these steps well before the first day of school. If your school sent a handbook out with their rules and policies, scan through it. It may keep you from accidentally showing up in inappropriate clothing or something like that. Make sure you join any Google Classrooms that you were either invited to or told to join. Google Classroom is something you might use to get information regarding events, deadlines, assignments, etc., or for that class."

      "content": "If you’ve got your class schedule, review it before the first day. You can even make a cheat sheet listing each class and classroom number. Having a sense for what your class schedule looks like will give you a feeling for what your average day is going to be like. This is especially helpful if you’re a freshman and this is your first time transitioning on your own from class to class. [8] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Some schools give you your schedule on the first day after orientation. If you don’t have your schedule yet, don’t worry about it. Note your lunch period. If it’s a little later in the day and you tend to get hungry mid-day, be sure to eat breakfast. Most high schools won’t let you eat before your lunch period."

      "title": "You may be excited or nervous, but try to get some rest.",
      "content": "You may be excited or nervous, but try to get some rest. If you’re running on fumes the first day, you may end up missing important information or nodding off. Aim to get at least 8 hours of sleep before the first day. This way, you’ll wake up refreshed, excited, and ready to go! Set an alarm for the morning. If you’ve ever slept through an alarm, set 3-5 different alarms to go off relatively close to one another. Plug your phone in before you go to bed so that it charges overnight and doesn’t die. If you know you need to be up at 6:30 am, try to go to bed by 10:30 pm at the absolute latest. The more sleep you can get, the better. Try to avoid staring at your phone, playing video games, or watching TV in the 2-3 hours leading up to bed. Bright screens can trick your brain into thinking it’s daytime, which can make it harder to go to sleep."

      "content": "Rushing to get out the door on time is a rough way to start the day. Give yourself at least 30 extra minutes in the morning to eat, shower, and get ready. A little extra time will keep things relaxed and put you in a better headspace on the first day of school. It’s also important to be a little early if you’re taking a bus, since missing your bus could make you late.

It may be hard to get up early after a long summer of relaxation, but do your best to get up when the alarm goes off. You can shower the night before if you want to save a little time in the morning. Getting to school early will also give you a chance to make some friends or meet your teachers before school starts."

      "content": "Drink a glass of water, shower, and brush your teeth. If you bought yourself some time by getting up early, this should be a relaxing, smooth process. Take a warm shower, have a nice, tall glass of water, and brush or style your hair. Throw on the outfit you set aside the night before and get out the door on time (or a little early)! [10] X Research source If you’re wearing any perfume or cologne, go easy on the stuff. If you showered the night before, go ahead and skip the morning shower.
