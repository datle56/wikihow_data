      "title": "Take a steam.",
      "content": "Take a steam. Like using a humidifier, exposing yourself to a steamy environment brings moisture to dry mucus membranes. Use this as an excuse to take a long, hot, steamy shower from time to time. Another steaming method is to boil a pot of water, remove it from the heat, place a towel over your head, and lean over the steaming pot. Check to make sure the steam isn’t too hot first. You can also buy fairly inexpensively steamers to place in a room or next to your bed. This tends to be more effective than boiling water."

      "title": "Address possible mouth-breathing.",
      "content": "Address possible mouth-breathing. Breathing through an open mouth not only exposes the back of the throat to drier external air, it also means incoming air bypasses the typically moist environment inside the nose. This is one reason why dry throat can occur when you are battling a stuffy nose. If you notice dry throat especially after waking up, it may be the result of mouth-breathing during sleep – a potential sign of sinus adenoid issues."

The backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus can cause various kinds of throat irritation, including a feeling of dryness. Again, if your dry throat happens mostly as you wake up in the morning, this may be the cause. If you suffer from reflux during the night, you might try to limit your intake of acid producing foods in the evening, prop your head up higher with pillows, prop up the headboard side legs of your bed with wood blocks, or consult your pharmacist or doctor regarding the use of over-the-counter or prescription medications."

      "content": "Deal with dry air by using a humidifier. Colder air holds less moisture, so during winter months especially, with the added drying effect of home heaters, your indoor air may become extremely dry. This can lead to a dry throat. The cool mist from the humidifier can soothe a dry throat by adding moisture to the mucus membranes. This may also be your excuse to take a long winter vacation to a warm, tropical climate!"

When caused by a medical condition, dry throat is usually the result of an annoying but generally not severe condition like allergies or the common cold. That said, when a more serious condition is present, dry and/or sore throat can be an early indicator. Dry throat can be an indicator of serious underlying medical conditions. [10] X Research source If you have repeated sore throats, too, consider seeing an ear, nose, and throat doctor. They can assess you to rule out these issues.
