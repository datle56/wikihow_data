      "content": "“Dead eyes look” means having a blank, lifeless expression. When someone has a “dead eyes look,” they seem to lack any warmth or emotion, as if they were no longer living. They might stare with unfocused eyes or an overly intense gaze. [1] X Research source This expression may be unnerving to many people, but others find the “dead eyes look” attractive. In many cases, it comes down to the context or situation the person with “dead eyes” is in and the perception of the person looking at them. For example, someone might be bored and staring off into space in the direction of a person who thinks they’re staring at them with “dead eyes.” When someone says another person is “dead-eyed” it can also mean they’re an expert marksman able to hit something with perfect accuracy, but this is less common. The idea that people with “dead eyes” are attractive has recently appeared in TikTok videos featuring “dead eye” tutorials . There’s also been a backlash with some users posting videos pointing out that having “dead eyes” can mean they’re experiencing mental health issues."

      "title": "This look is characterized by blank eyes and relaxed facial muscles.",
      "content": "This look is characterized by blank eyes and relaxed facial muscles. The main characteristic of the “dead eyes look” is a blank, emotionless stare. This stare is usually combined with slack facial muscles, so there’s no sign of a smile—or any other emotion—around the eyes or mouth. To some, a blank stare means a gaze that’s unfocused, like the person is looking through you. Others see it as an intense, unblinking stare. Another possible trait of a “dead eyes look” is dilated pupils that make eyes seem black. Some people also associate droopy or hooded eyelids and dark undereye circles with a “dead eyes look.”"

      "content": "Age and bone structure can contribute to a “dead eyes look.” As you age, your eyelid muscle (also called the levator muscle) stretches and weakens. This causes your upper eyelid to droop, which makes you look sleepy and less alert. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Getting older may also cause your eye muscles to get weaker and cause changes in the bone around your eye, which leads to having sunken eyes with dark circles. Lower fat levels—also caused by aging—in the space around the eye can make it look sunken. The natural shape of your eye socket can also make your eyes appear sunken and tired."

      "content": "Emotional trauma or pain may cause a “dead eyes look.” Depression is one of the most common psychological issues associated with empty, lifeless eyes . People often disconnect when they have strong emotions or experience traumatic events. When a person feels depressed or disconnected, it can show up in their facial expressions. [6] X Research source There’s also some thought that traumatic experiences can cause someone to use a vacant stare to hide their emotions and seem less vulnerable, which might help them protect themselves from more emotional pain."

If you want to give someone a “dead eye” stare, look directly at them but focus on their chin or forehead instead of on their eyes. Completely relax your face, especially the muscles around your eyebrows and mouth. Tilt your chin down and narrow your eyes slightly. Hold this look for at least 5 seconds."

Add a mauve, pinkish-brown, or reddish matte lipstick under your eyes in an upside-down triangle. Then, blend it out with your fingertip. [11] X Research source If you use lipstick, set it with a light dusting of an eyeshadow in a similar color. [12] X Research source Add more layers or use darker shades for a more dramatic look. Apply a neutral matte eyeshadow all over your upper lid. Or, for a stronger effect, apply a mauve eyeshadow and blend it past the crease of your eye.

[14] X Research source When you’re inside, position yourself near a light source, like a window during daylight hours or a lamp at night. Make sure there’s nothing between you and the light. You don’t have to look directly into the light, just make sure it’s reflecting on your eyes. The closer you are to the light, the larger the catch light will be."
