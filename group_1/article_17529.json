You'll see the light turn on in front of your remote, letting you know it's connected. [4] X Research source If resetting your controller does not fix stick drift, it's most likely not a software issue. Cleaning your PS4 controller should resolve the stick drift."

Press the sticks down and rotate them 360 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise for about 10 seconds each way. [7] X Research source This is also a good way to remedy your R3 and L3 buttons not working. Shake the can well before you use it, and don't spray the can too close to the sticks or they can freeze. Once you're done, let the controller sit for about 10-15 minutes so it can dry. After that time has passed, turn on your console to test your controller ."

Afterward, place the rubber cradles on top of them and firmly press the analog sticks into the holes on the circuit board. Insert the analog sticks through the holes in the front piece and set the circuit board back in place by reattaching the black cable that held it there. Next, press the black battery holder piece back on top of the circuit board, screw it back in place, and put the battery on top of it. Reattach the battery connecter to the motherboard as well as the blue ribbon that holds the two halves of the controller together. Now you can snap the back controller piece back on and screw it into place with the four remaining screws. Reattach any ribbon cables as you reassemble the controller. Keep the front controller piece facing down as you reattach its buttons so they don't fall out. Once you're done, let the controller sit for about 10-15 minutes so it can dry. After that time has passed, turn on your console to test your controller to see if stick drift is resolved."
