      "title": "Don’t get defensive.",
      "content": "Don’t get defensive. Stay calm, and be aware that you will never win in an argument with an impossible person—they are referred to as \"impossible\" for a reason. In the impossible person's mind, you are the problem, and nothing you say can convince the person to see your side of the story. They feel that your opinion doesn’t matter because you are guilty, regardless. Think about what you are going to say before you say it and what your goal for the conversation is. Don’t just react impulsively because the other person offended you. You don’t have to defend yourself to this person. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. For example, don’t say, “You are wrong.” Try something like, “I feel like that statement may not be the whole truth.” This helps you speak your mind without putting them on the defensive."

      "title": "Detach, disassociate and defuse.",
      "content": "Detach, disassociate and defuse. Staying calm in the heat of the moment is paramount to your personal preservation. Spitting angry words, reacting with extreme emotions such as crying, will only stimulate impossible people to do more of the difficult behavior. Don’t take the reactions of impossible people personally, and don’t allow yourself to become emotionally charged in reaction to him or her. Remove yourself emotionally from the situation, and treat it with indifference. The goal is to not allow yourself to get emotionally involved in the conversation, keep the person at a distance and not let the words make you feel bad. Redirect the situation or conversation to something positive by focusing on something other than what the argument started about. Talk about the weather, fishing, the impossible person's family—really anything that will distract from the argument and is not likely to cause further conflict. Consider the fact that anything you do or say while angry can be used against you. Unless you don’t mind hearing about an angry comment years from now, then let it go. Impossible people want you to say something to prove that you’re the bad guy. Do not judge this person as right or wrong even if they seem irrational. Judging is likely to only make you feel worse."

      "content": "Avoid arguing with them. If possible, don't disagree with impossible people. Find ways to be agreeable or ignore them. Arguing will only get you emotionally invested in the situation and trigger your fight or flight responses. This will make it harder for you to think clearly and respond appropriately. [1] X Research source Impossible people are looking for a fight, so when you agree with them or some truth in their statement, you are no longer giving them what they want. If you are called a \"jerk,\" for example, go ahead and acknowledge a time when you acted badly. This corrects an overgeneralization. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Realize you probably can’t have a reasonable conversation. Having a civilized conversation with the impossible person is unlikely—at least with you. Recall every time you tried in the past to have a civilized discussion about your relationship with the person. You were probably blamed for everything instead. Use silence or try to humor the person whenever you can. Know that you cannot \"fix\" impossible people. These people cannot and do not listen to reason. Avoid getting cornered into an argument. Don’t deal with the person one-on-one. Always suggest that a third party be brought in. If the person refuses, demand it."

      "content": "Ignore them . Impossible people want attention, so once they realize you won’t give them what they want, they will move onto someone else who will react to them. Stay out of their business, out of their way and avoid talking to or about them. Impossible peoples’ outbursts are like a child's tantrum. Pay them no mind unless the outbursts becomes disruptive, dangerous or threatening. Do your best to avoid angering impossible people or giving them a reason to lose their temper. It's better to just stay away from toxic people, if you can. [3] X Expert Source Julia Lyubchenko, MS, MA Adult Counselor & Certified Hypnotherapist Expert Interview. 29 April 2020."

Asking the impossible individual or the group you are dealing with a question regarding the issue, such as, \"What is the problem?\" or \"Why do you feel this way?\" can be helpful. It shows that you are engaged in the conversation and willing to find the source of the disagreement. Rephrasing the impossible person's position to illuminate irrationality can encourage an individual to come to a better conclusion. Know that the impossible individual may respond to the question by attempting to complicate everything with name-calling, blaming, changing the subject or other behaviors."

      "content": "Take a breather. If the person you're talking with is getting on your last nerve, then you need to step away from the immediate situation. They might just want to get a rise out of you, so show them that they have no effect on you. Walking away or handling another task so you can calm down is a good idea. Count to ten silently if you need to. If the person is still being impossible, then just ignore him. That person will eventually back down if he notices that he's not aggravating you."

      "content": "Be confident. State your views with confidence and look the person in the eye when communicating with them. You do not want to appear weak to one of these people.

      "content": "Adjust your strategy. Sometimes you can’t leave the situation, so treat it like a game. Learn the impossible person’s strategy, and develop counter strategies ahead of time. Eventually you'll find what works and what doesn't, plus you'll probably feel better as you realize you're three steps ahead, outwitting them at every turn. Just remember your ultimate goal is to help free yourself mentally, not become the person's master. If the impossible person comes up to you and whispers something negative around others thinking you won’t want to respond and create a scene, then say out loud, “Do you really want to talk about this here?” This may surprise them and discourage them from showing negativity to an entire group. Always consider the possible consequences of your actions if your plan doesn’t go as expected so you can prepare for those, too. If the impossible person still finds a way to get to you, then don't feel bad. Just make a note of what happened and devise new strategies for next time. Impossible people aren't so impossible when you can predict what the person is going to say or do next."

      "content": "Check your body language. Become aware of your positioning, how you move and your facial expressions when around these people. We reveal a lot of our emotions non-verbally. You don't want to reveal your own feelings unknowingly. Also, this will help you maintain your own sense of calm, and may have a calming effect on the impossible person in the process. You can use mindfulness to become more aware of your body, which will allow you to monitor your body language more easily. Speak softly, and move as calmly as possible. Try a technique called \"slow talk.\" By reducing your talking speed by 1/3, you will sound clearer and calmer. You can practice slow talk by reading aloud at a deliberately slow pace. Avoid confrontational body language, such as eye contact for long periods of time, aggressive gestures, pointing or standing directly in front of the person face-to-face. Keep a neutral expression on your face, don’t shake your head and stay out of the person’s personal space. [4] X Research source"

Some people simply clash or don’t get along together well. There may be nothing wrong with either of you but together you just bring out the worst in each other. When an impossible person makes a statement like, \"Everyone else likes me,\" they are trying to shift the blame onto you. How they interact with others is irrelevant, since there is a problem with the way the two of you interact. Remember that blaming does not alter facts."

      "content": "Be prepared for emotional mood swings. If you successfully convince an impossible person that they made a mistake, then they may suddenly have an emotional meltdown. Instead of believing they are right all the time, they will decide that if they can't be right now, then they will always be wrong. This is a coping mechanism to elicit sympathy from others. Some impossible people will use erratic behavior in order to surprise and confuse. It's possible they didn't even expect it either. Resist the urge to let this kind of unpredictable behavior intimidate you. [5] X Research source Don't let these people confuse you by acting like they are being persecuted.

They will probably understand you, and it will definitely help you feel better. It is best if the listener doesn't know the impossible person personally and is not involved in the same situations (for example, not a co-worker). Vent in a journal or online community if you need to. Sharing your feelings, whether to another person or in a journal, will help you avoid ruminating on negative emotions."

Instead of listening to what the impossible person says, focus on the people who validate you and make you feel good. Realize that the impossible person wants to hurt you to make themself feel better. Understand that the impossible person is the problem—not you. This may be difficult because impossible people are good at shifting the blame and making you feel like it is your fault. But if you accept responsibility for your mistakes and flaws and try to improve yourself, there’s a very good chance that you are not the impossible person. When they makes a statement designed to hurt you, realize that all they want is for others to say that they're awesome. Know that you don't require validation like that. If the insults have no basis in fact, just dismiss them. You are not as bad as the impossible person would like you and everyone else to believe."

They can fabricate entire stories and paint you as being an awful person based on a simple comment you made. As specialists in manipulation, impossible people are also very good at getting you to open up and tell them things. Don’t tell impossible people anything personal, even if they seem normal or act like a friend to you at times.

Consider all sides of the story before coming to conclusions. Just as bad behavior can influence us negatively, behaving like a tolerant, patient and kind person can sometimes influence another for the better. Recognize that you aren’t perfect. You don't have to do everything right all the time, but do try your best. Be respectful, and if you don’t receive respect in return, then understand that it’s the impossible person's problem and not yours.

Remember that stressing about the person all the time is the same as giving them your precious time when they don't even care about you. Do other activities and make new friends; that way you aren't wasting time by thinking about what the person said or did constantly. Turn your thoughts to what you do want in your life, rather than what you don't want. This helps you stay focused on the positive instead of the negative."

They use tactics such as humiliation, negating, criticizing, domination, blaming, demanding and emotional distancing to make you codependent on them. Never let what emotional abusers say define who you are. Know that the things they say and do are from unresolved childhood or past issues that they are projecting onto you. [6] X Research source The best thing to do is to be kind and friendly even though the impossible person may act like a jerk to receive negative attention. If the person is lonely but doesn't know how to get attention, then they will appreciate what you are doing and change. If the person is just a natural jerk who loves to make others mad, then what you are doing will enrage the person because they can't figure out how to make you mad. Eventually the person will leave you alone. In some cases, a person who exhibits these behaviors is a sociopath. A sociopath may initially seem very charming, but they soon become controlling, abusive, and egocentric. Since they lack empathy, they don't care about you. [7] X Research source"

It may be beneficial to sit down with the impossible person, and let them know what is and is not okay and what will happen if boundaries are crossed. Allow them to make the choice to follow the rules or not. Write down some thoughts, and get your wants and needs right in your head. Sit down with the person and start talking. If they interrupt, stop them and continue your talk until you are done. Be honest. Give ultimatums if you must, but focus on the benefits of staying and changing the bad behavior. If you decide to stay in a personal relationship with an impossible person, then keep to yourself as often as possible. Find and focus on a hobby , join a support group or focus on your religion. [9] X Research source Make sure to follow up with consequences if boundaries are crossed. Don’t let anything slide. If you said you’d be out the door, then out you go."

A long-term relationship with an impossible person is not healthy. Remove the person from your life as soon as you can. Stay away after you leave the impossible person. No matter how much you love the person or if they try to convince you they have changed, don’t go back. If you can't leave or make the impossible person leave right now, then leave the relationship mentally until you can do it physically.

If you can describe what it is about the impossible person's personality that clashes with yours, you may be able to pinpoint specific ways to deal with him. [10] X Research source Clinging types are insecure and can be desperate for affection and love because they feel weak and idolize stronger people. [11] X Research source Controlling types are often critical perfectionists who need to be right and often blame others for their behavior. [12] X Research source Competitive types always want to win and often use any type of relationship, conversation or activity as a contest to prove they're better at something. [13] X Research source Passive-aggressive people express their hostilities indirectly by subtly pushing other people’s buttons.

They always have to be right no matter what, and doing a better job won’t help get critical perfectionists off your back.
