      "content": "Place the mouth of a 2-liter bottle where you want the hickey to be and squeeze the bottle. Keep the bottle’s mouth flush with your skin to create suction. [1] X Research source The more you squeeze the bottle, the more suction there will be. More suction creates a faster-forming and more intense-looking hickey. Hold it in place for approximately 15 seconds. After 15 seconds, pull the bottle to remove it from your skin. Most hickeys tend to be around the neck area, but hickeys also appear on the chest and other parts of the body. If you place the hickey on your neck, put it on the sides of the neck to make it more believable. Avoid the area underneath your chin and directly in the middle of your neck to prevent injuring your esophagus. As you make your hickey, it helps to stand in front of a mirror so you can see what you’re doing."

      "title": "Consider widening the hickey by creating a second one next to the first.",
      "content": "Consider widening the hickey by creating a second one next to the first. Since the mouth of the bottle is a perfect circle, consider moving the bottle over a centimeter or two, and making another hickey. This second hickey doesn’t need to be as intense as the first one. Try squeezing the bottle less or holding it on your skin for a shorter amount of time. Since human mouths have more of an oval shape, widening the hickey makes it look more realistic. This method is generally safe, but a hickey is a type of bruise. Too much suction can cause damage to your skin. Bruises take from 3 days to 2 weeks to heal. Hickeys are usually a more superficial bruise, so they take less time to fade than a deeper bruise.

      "content": "Use a large eye shadow palette that has dark pinks, purples, and blues. If you have a darker skin tone, use more pigmented eye shadow formulations that pop against your skin. [3] X Research source Or apply them more heavily to make the hickey mark show up better."

      "content": "Apply the pink eye shadow with a small eye shadow brush. Gently tap your eye shadow brush once or twice into the pink eye shadow. Stand in front of a mirror and sweep the brush over your skin in small, ½ - 1 inch-sized ovals. [4] X Research source Build up the color for the hickey slowly and gradually, working in layers."

      "content": "Place the purple eye shadow at the center of the pink shadow. Tap a corner of your makeup brush once in the purple eye shadow. Dab the shadow onto the middle of the fake hickey. Use the brush to make small ovals and lightly blend the purple shadow into the pink to create your hickey. [5] X Research source When in doubt, use less of the darker eye shadow colors. You can also add more, but it’s harder to take off the color once it’s added. Another option is to use a darker pink option that gives the look of a “fresh” hickey. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Add the blue eye shadow to the very center of the hickey. Again, tap a small corner of your makeup brush into the blue eye shadow. Dab the brush into the center of the hickey. Move the brush in small ovals to blend the blue shadow out toward the edges of the hickey. [7] X Research source Only add a tiny bit of blue to the middle of the fake hickey. Consider tapping the brush on the side of your finger or the edge of a surface to knock off any excess blue shadow. If you use 2 shades of pink to make a “fresh” hickey, use a dark red or purple for the center instead of blue."

      "content": "Set the eye shadow with hairspray or makeup setting spray. Spray a thin layer of hairspray or matte makeup setting spray to make the hickey last longer and avoid coming off on your clothes. This fake hickey will last until you wash it off. If you don’t have hairspray or a setting spray, set the hickey with translucent setting powder . Setting powder can also help you tone down the color if your hickey turned out too bright or dark."

      "content": "Add a small amount of alcohol onto a paint plate. Open a bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol and apply a cotton ball to the open top. Tip the bottle upside down for one second, then flip it back, right-side up. Squeeze the soaked cotton ball over the middle of a paint plate to create a small puddle of alcohol. This small pool of alcohol will be what you dip your makeup applicator sponges in to moisten them and activate the paint. Create your hickey on any part of your body, but they’re usually found on the neck and chest areas."

      "content": "Tap a makeup applicator sponge into the alcohol. Tap the stippled edge of the applicator sponge in the alcohol. Then, squeeze the stippled edge of the sponge to distribute the alcohol. Dab the stippled edge of the sponge on a paper towel to absorb any excess alcohol. Alcohol activated paint is commonly used for film and theatre because it’s sweat-resistant and lasts a long time. [8] X Research source Grease paints are another option, but they have a tendency not to last as long and melt a bit, due to body heat."

      "content": "Tap the moistened sponge into red alcohol-activated paint and apply it to your skin. Lightly dab or stipple a corner of the sponge on your skin to create a small oval approximately ½ inch long (1.25 cm) and ¼ inch (0.6 cm) wide. [9] X Research source Stippling makes the hickey look natural and more realistic. Stand in front of a mirror so you’re able to see the area where you want the hickey clearly."

      "content": "Apply blue alcohol-activated paint to make a purplish bruise. With the same sponge applicator, dab the sponge into the dark blue color. The red from the previous application mixed with the blue will create a very bruise-like purple color. Or use a darker red with the blue to create a stronger purple color. [10] X Research source Dab the sponge into the center of the hickey very lightly to give the appearance of broken blood vessels. To help blend the colors together, tap the sponge into the alcohol, tap a paper towel to remove excess alcohol, and dab the hickey, allowing the colors to blend into each other."
