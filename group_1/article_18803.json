You can also look for an FMLA notice in your workplace. Your employer is required by law to post this notice prominently if they're covered. [2] X Trustworthy Source USA.GOV Official website for the United States federal government Go to source Generally, all public agencies, including federal, state, and local government agencies and schools, are covered by FMLA. Private companies are covered if they have at least 50 employees. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Labor Federal department responsible for promoting the wellbeing of workers Go to source Even if your employer recently had massive layoffs, they're still covered by the law if they had at least 50 employees for at least 20 workweeks of this year or last year. Employees at all of a private company's locations within 75 miles of your workplace count towards the 50 total required, not just the people who work with you."

You don't become eligible for FMLA leave until you've been working for your employer for at least a year. However, the 12 required months don't need to be consecutive. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Labor Federal department responsible for promoting the wellbeing of workers Go to source For example, if you work for your employer for 4 months, are laid off for 2 months, then come back to work for another 8 months, you would be eligible for FMLA leave."

      "content": "Clock in for at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months before your leave. This basically equates to working about 24 hours a week for each of those 12 months. Keep in mind that those 12 months don't have to be consecutive. [5] X Trustworthy Source USA.GOV Official website for the United States federal government Go to source For example, if you worked 35 hours a week for 4 months, then were laid off for 2 months, then came back to work and worked 30 hours a week for another 8 months, you'd have 1,520. That would be enough to qualify you for FMLA leave. Your most recent paystub will show the total hours you've worked over the past calendar year. If it's early in the year, you'll need previous paystubs to confirm a total if you're not sure. You can also check with your company's payroll or human resources department. Only hours that you actually work count—not hours that you were paid for but didn't actually work, such as sick or vacation paid time off.

If you're getting any specific treatment, you can get FMLA leave for that treatment as long as your doctor would identify your anxiety or depression as a serious health condition . If your doctor classifies your anxiety or depression as a chronic condition, you can get time off based on limitations that condition gives you. [7] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Labor Federal department responsible for promoting the wellbeing of workers Go to source For example, if you need to go to intensive therapy for 2 hours every day, you could get FMLA to cover that time off of work so you could attend those sessions. If you only have the energy to work part-time due to your chronic depression, you could potentially take FMLA leave for the other hours that you're supposed to work without being penalized by your employer. Don't let the phrase \"serious health condition\" scare you—in the context of the FMLA, it just means a physical or mental condition that requires continuous treatment by a healthcare provider.

You can lose FMLA protection if you violate your employer's policy, even if you do everything else right, so make sure you understand it. Ask your supervisor or someone in human resources if you have any questions. [9] X Research source For example, if your employer requires you to notify your direct supervisor of any requests for time off, you would need to submit your request to them, not to the human resources department. Your employee handbook might also include information specifically about FMLA. Read this carefully to make sure there aren't any significant differences in how your employer handles FMLA requests as opposed to regular sick leave requests."

[10] X Research source As soon as you know that you're going to need to take leave, tell your supervisor or someone in human resources (whatever your employer's policy requires). You don't necessarily have to say specifically that you're using FMLA, but it's a good idea to do so. For example, you might say, \"I need to take FMLA leave starting February 1st.\""

They don't have to go into detail about your condition, give your diagnosis, or describe it in any way. [12] X Research source Your doctor chooses the option on the form to indicate that your absence is required for treatment, or for limitations caused by a chronic medical condition. They don't have to specify the medical condition or provide your diagnosis. For example, if you have to see a therapist for treatment during work hours, those hours would be covered under FMLA. However, the doctor or therapist who certifies your absence does not need to describe the type of treatment you're getting or what that treatment is for. As far as limitations, FMLA only helps you with those that would require you to be off work. If you need accommodations at work so you can effectively do your job, your right to those accommodations would be covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
