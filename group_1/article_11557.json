      "content": "Go for it. If you're a girl, you might need to make the first move instead of waiting for him to do it. If you're a guy, be aware that she might have to take more time than normal before she is ready to kiss you. This doesn't mean they're not into you, it just means they need to be drawn out of their shell! [4] X Research source Never ask them out in public, as this will make them feel nervous. Ask them out in private. Invite them on a casual, yet fun, date. Nothing with too much pressure or too many stigmas. Just because someone is a Cancer doesn't mean they can't have fun. Try taking them to the beach or swimming pool, since this is a water sign."

      "content": "Don't bother with games. Cancers are super intuitive when it comes to people and their motivations, so don't waste your time playing hard to get, cat and mouse, or any other variety of mind game. They'll see right through you and know you're not being genuine. [5] X Research source Cancers, if they feel comfortable, will be direct with you. They need you to be direct with them, too! If you're presenting an image around them or trying to be mysterious, they will not be having it. They're super good at reading people, so don't even think about hiding your emotions!"

Let them know they are a part of your home and have free reign over the territory, too. Talk to them about your family. Let him or her know that you value yours and are a family man/woman. They'll take solace in knowing that you two are of like minds. Family is very important to them and nothing will ever change that.

Nothing wrong with that! [6] X Research source When it comes to getting them in bed, they may be a bit vanilla. More romantic and sensual than spicy and exotic.

They want to trust others, they just find it hard. Especially with their great memories and their ability to hold grudges because of it. However, they love to love others, so it's very much so a give and take. [7] X Research source This is probably Cancer's main drawback. It can be hard to crack their shell. But if you're willing to put in the work, it can be totally worth it. You'll find a soft, sensitive core that will put you above everyone and everything else."
