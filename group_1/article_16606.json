      "content": "Hammer in any nails that are protruding from the trim with a nail set. You can find a nail set at your local hardware store if you don’t have one. Hold the pointed end of the nail set on the head of the nail. Hammer the nail set so the nail goes into the trim. If the trim is held on with staples, use a flat-head screwdriver approximately the same size as the staples to tap them into the trim. Use a putty knife or painter’s 5-in-1 tool to pry up any staples or nails that are bent into the wood. Then, use needle-nose pliers to remove the staple or nail from the trim."

      "content": "Use a putty knife to scrape off any raised fragments around the holes. Sometimes nail holes in trim can form a raised edge. It’s important to get rid of these edges on the trim or they’ll show after you fill the holes . Scrape the putty knife across the surface of the nail hole a few times to smooth out the area around the hole. Be gentle when you’re using the putty knife. You don’t want to cause damage to the trim around the nail holes. If the trim has ridges or raised edges, use a butter knife to remove the fragments so you don’t damage the details."

      "content": "Smooth down the nail holes with fine-grit sandpaper. Any sandpaper with a grade between 120 and 220 will work. The sandpaper should be able to get off any raised fragments on the trim that the putty knife couldn’t. Brush the sandpaper across the surface of the nail holes a few times until they feel smooth."

Avoid spackling that shrinks or you could end up with dips in the holes you fill in. You can find shrink-free spackling online or at your local hardware store. [1] X Research source You can use water-based wood filler or even painter's caulk as alternatives. The wood filler can be sanded down smooth, and you can paint over it for a seamless finish. The caulk will be more noticeable, however."

Scrape the knife across the surface of the hole to the other side. Press firmly down on the knife so the spackling completely fills in the nail hole. Scrape across the surface of the hole two or three times to make sure the spackling is flat. [3] X Research source To smooth out the spackling and/or fill the holes, you can also use your finger."
