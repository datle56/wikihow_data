      "content": "A coy smile is a shy, modest smile that only shows the lips (no teeth). A coy smile can be slightly mysterious, bashful, or even flirty, and it typically means the person is interested in you in some way. With a coy smile, the lips slightly perk upward to bring out the cheeks without showing the teeth.

Depending on the situation, people may coyly smile to express kindness and break the ice, show interest in you, or to hide their intentions.

      "content": "A coy smile is generally a sign of interest, albeit subtle and ambiguous. When someone smiles coyly at you, it typically means they’re interested in you, whether it be romantically or as a friend. Some people smile coyly to deliberately evade or withhold the fact that they like you, even if it means faking shyness. On the other hand, some people can’t help but coyly smile, whether it’s because they’re shy or because they find you funny, interesting, or attractive. [2] X Research source A coy smile doesn’t always mean someone is romantically interested in you. They may just be shy and friendly. When babies give coy smiles, it typically indicates that they’re emotionally reactive and socially aware, which is an important social function. [3] X Research source"
