      "content": "Decide how often you want your home to be cleaned. You might just want to hire a one-time service to refresh your space or prep your home before a big move. Or, you may want a housekeeper who can come on a regularly scheduled basis to maintain the cleanliness of your home. For bigger cleaning needs, you could choose to hire a live-in housekeeper who works for you full-time and resides on your property. Start by determining your exact household needs (e.g., deep cleaning, preparing guest rooms, picking up groceries, cooking meals) and how often they need to be completed, then decide on which type of cleaner best fits those needs. Here’s a quick breakdown: [1] X Research source One-time house cleaners are hired for a single occasion, e.g., before moving, for a deep clean before hiring a regular housekeeper, for an annual deep clean to refresh your space, etc. Regularly scheduled housekeepers come on a habitual basis (i.e., daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly). They do light cleanings that may include dusting, tidying, dishwashing, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, and laundry. [2] X Research source Live-in housekeepers work full-time and live in the home or in a separate building on your property. They typically assume the vast majority (if not all) of the cleaning and cooking duties for the household. Live-in housekeepers may also have nannying duties in households with children."

      "content": "Determine if you want an independent cleaner or cleaning company. You can hire an individual housekeeper who operates their own business, or you can work with a larger house-cleaning company that employs or contracts multiple housekeepers to provide services. Both of these options have pros and cons, so you should choose the option that best works for you, your home, and your family. [3] X Research source Pros of Independent Cleaners: Often more budget-friendly. More customizable and flexible services. More conducive to a close, personal relationship. Cons of Independent Cleaners: May not be bonded or insured, meaning minimal liability for damage or injury. You may have to order your own background check for the cleaner. Services may be reduced if your cleaner is ill or on vacation. Often relies on word of mouth, making it challenging to find a good cleaner. Pros of Cleaning Companies: Services may be more consistent and efficient. Service won’t be affected by illness or time off. Background-checked staff with certification and insurance. Access to customer service support. Cons of Cleaning Companies: May be less affordable. Less room to negotiate add-ons or rescheduled services. Different cleaners each week means you’ll need to continually walk through your home layout and cleaning preferences. Cleaners may never get accustomed to your space."

      "title": "Decide how much you’re willing to spend on a house cleaner.",
      "content": "Decide how much you’re willing to spend on a house cleaner. Once you’ve decided which level of service you’re looking for (i.e., one-time, weekly, full-time), determine what your budget is for contracting these services. While cleaning services used to be very expensive, nowadays it’s a lot easier and more affordable to book them once or on a regular basis, so don’t worry if you don’t have a huge budget. Once you’ve determined your budget, look into different housekeepers and house cleaning services to see whose price best fits your financial situation. [4] X Research source When determining your budget, factor in how much time you will save by hiring a house cleaner. Ask several local professionals and companies for their cost estimates. Ask if they offer a fixed rate or if they’ll charge per hour. You may also want to inquire about seasonal discounts or packages, which may be offered by house cleaning companies to help you save money and stick to your budget. For instance, Homeaglow offers a ForeverClean membership that saves you $30 per hour on all cleanings during your membership. The ForeverClean membership plan is a great option if you’re new to using house cleaning services. Forty-three percent of Homeaglow’s surveyed ForeverClean members had never hired a house cleaner before signing up for the membership. If you find a house cleaner or housekeeper that you really like but that offers rates out of your budget, you might try to get by with fewer hours rather than trying to find another cleaner that you don’t like as much."

When you search for housekeepers through Homeaglow’s database, you’ll be able to see their full profile as well as ratings and reviews from past clients. Remember that your housekeeper will have full access to your home, so it’s vital to work with someone whom you can trust.

      "content": "Interview the service or cleaner with a list of relevant questions. Depending on whether you’re hiring a housekeeper directly or through a house cleaning company, it’s a good idea to chat with the cleaner themselves or with their company representative. Schedule a virtual call with them or invite them over for a consultation so that they also get a chance to meet you and evaluate the space. Be prepared for them to ask questions of you, but also come prepared with a list of your own questions related to your preferences and needs. Here are some questions you may want to consider asking: [6] X Research source How many years of experience do you have cleaning homes? Will you provide your own cleaning supplies? If so, which types do you use? Do you offer any guarantees? Are you insured? What dates and times do you have available in your schedule? What are your terms for changing or canceling services? Do you have past clients whom I could contact for references? Does your service provide one cleaner consistently or different ones each time? Do you offer one-off services like deep cleaning in the spring or before a special event? What does your payment process look like, and which methods do you accept? What’s your tipping policy? What will be our main method of contact? Do you prefer that there’s no one in the home while you’re cleaning? Do you charge hourly, or do you offer a fixed rate for each service? If hourly, how much can you get done in 2-3 hours?"

      "title": "Ask for relevant background checks, certifications, and liability insurance policies.",
      "content": "Ask for relevant background checks, certifications, and liability insurance policies. Because your house cleaner will be in your personal space and around your family, it’s crucial to ensure that this person is a trustworthy and responsible individual. If you’re working with a cleaning company, ask if they do background checks and if they provide liability insurance. For instance, if an item is damaged or a house cleaner is injured on site, who will be liable? If possible, get this agreement in writing. [7] X Research source All of Homeaglow’s cleaners are background checked and come with a happiness guarantee. If you’re working with an individual housekeeper, ask if they have any special certifications (although these are not required for the job), complete a background check, and make sure that they’re insured and bonded against accidents."

It’s important that both you and your house cleaner are clear on what exact services you’re paying for and expecting from them. You may wish to define these cleaning requirements in a contract or informal written agreement before hiring anyone. Specifically, you may want to include mutually agreed-upon details about: [8] X Research source The frequency of cleaning. Which specific cleaning and household services will be provided. Which rooms, floors, and items in the home will be cleaned. If any childcare, household management, or cooking services will be provided. The price (either flat rate or by the hour).

      "content": "Offer a paid trial period with your top candidate. Once you’re pretty sure you’ve decided on a candidate, ask if they’re willing to complete a paid trial period of 2-4 weeks. This way, both you and your housekeeper can get to know each other’s expectations and figure out if you’re a good fit before committing. Keep in mind that it may also take some time to hash out any complexities or mismatched expectations, so don’t expect your housekeeper to be perfect from the start. However, if you’re still not happy with the cleaner’s work after multiple visits with clear expectations, you may want to continue your search. [10] X Research source If you hire a house cleaner through a service like Homeaglow , you’re able to get a discounted first home cleaning to see if your chosen housekeeper is the right fit for you. You can get an initial two-hour cleaning for $9, a three-hour cleaning for $19, or a four-hour cleaning for $39. If you like your housekeeper, you can get subsequent cleanings starting at $20 per hour with a monthly subscription. You can continue to hire the same housekeeper or book other cleaners through the Homeaglow platform."

It’s likely that this visit will require more time and involvement on your part to get them used to your home and area. Here are some tips to prepare for your first house cleaning: [11] X Research source Train your housekeeper on how to use and disable your alarm system. Leave your contact info and emergency contact info for your housekeeper. Show your housekeeper where cleaning supplies are stored in case they need extra. Let your neighbors know that you’re hiring a cleaner to avoid arousing suspicions. Tell your housekeeper where they can park in your neighborhood or at your home. Let the housekeeper know precisely how to get to your home (e.g., which door, which elevator, etc.). Keep your pets secured unless your housekeeper tells you that they’re comfortable with the animal being loose. Hide any personal and valuable belongings (e.g., electronic equipment, large valuables) in a locked closet or “do not clean” room. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Focus on building a positive and professional relationship with your cleaners. Your new housekeeper will be spending a lot of time in your home and around your loved ones. A good housekeeper will also put a lot of time, energy, and knowledge into caring for your home and your family, so do as much as you can to return the favor with kindness and fair treatment! Be sure to make them feel welcome: show them where you keep water and refreshments, set the home thermostat to a cool and comfortable temperature, and give them the space they need to do their job. [13] X Research source Consider tipping your housekeeper and/or providing verbal gratitude if they’ve done an excellent job. If your housekeeper has a digital site or profile, leave them a kind and honest review. If any friends or colleagues are looking for a housekeeper, refer yours to them so that they can continue to grow their business and clientele."

      "title": "House cleaners can cost $120 - $235 per visit, on average.",
      "content": "House cleaners can cost $120 - $235 per visit, on average. However, this number can vary widely based on your location, the size of your home, and the price you’ve negotiated with your cleaner. Most housekeepers cost between $30 to $50 per hour, and it usually takes about 2-4 hours to clean an entire home. If you’re willing to eliminate some services and shave off some time, however, you may end up with a cheaper total price. [14] X Research source The number of people and pets in your home may also increase the price of cleaning costs, so be sure to include these factors in your initial estimate."

      "title": "A new cleaner will assess your space, ask about your needs, and adjust their work over time.",
      "content": "A new cleaner will assess your space, ask about your needs, and adjust their work over time. Once you choose to hire a housekeeper, you can expect them to come to your home and do an initial assessment of your space and cleaning needs. They may also ask you about your focus areas for cleaning, what services you require, and what cleaning products you’d like them to use. Feel free to mention any other preferences or special situations you may have. Once your cleaner has completed their first few sessions, you can communicate together on what’s working and what’s not. It’s important for both of you to communicate openly and consider how you can best work together to maximize their services and provide you with a cleaner home. Keep in mind that it may take time for both of you to find your groove in this relationship, so don’t worry if the first few cleaning sessions need some adjustments. That’s normal! It’s only a cause for concern if you clearly communicate issues to your cleaner and these issues go unresolved or unchanged."

      "title": "How many rooms should a housekeeper clean per day?",
      "content": "How many rooms should a housekeeper clean per day? In general, a house cleaner can clean 3-5 rooms per day. That said, some homes (and the rooms in them) are larger than others, so the cleaning time may be longer. Similarly, a deep clean in fewer rooms will take the same amount of time as a light clean in more rooms. As a homeowner, be sure to set expectations with your cleaner ahead of time and allow them to negotiate if they think your requirements or timing are unrealistic for them. If you hire a housekeeper through a service like Homeaglow , you can expect that your cleaning can include all of the rooms in your home, if specified ahead of time. Homeaglow also lets you add on services at the same hourly rate, including laundering or fridge- and oven-cleaning."

      "content": "What do housekeepers not clean? Every housekeeper and housekeeping company is different. However, housekeepers typically aren’t expected to complete any task that requires specialized equipment or training. For example, you shouldn’t automatically expect a housekeeper to deep clean a carpet, wash a non-ground-floor window, or clean your yard and outdoor spaces. Typically, most housekeepers will dust, vacuum, mop, wash dishes, clean household surfaces, and wash linens. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "What is the difference between a housekeeper and a cleaning lady? “Housekeeper” and “cleaning lady” or “maid” are all terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to someone who cleans a home for money. However, a “housekeeper” is actually more focused on the overall management of the home. This may include cleaning, but they may also handle laundry, errands, organization, scheduling, and cooking. “Cleaning ladies” or “household cleaners,” on the other hand, focus exclusively on cleaning tasks unless other arrangements are made.
