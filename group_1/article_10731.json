      "content": "Avoid making a weak password. Before figuring out what you want to put in your password, here are a few things that you shouldn't put in your password: The name of your pet, family member, or friend Single words that appear in the dictionary (e.g., \"c@stl3\" is fine, while \"castle\" is not) Predictable passwords (e.g., \"password\" or \"12345\") Personal information (e.g., your phone number or birthday) The same password across all of your accounts Repeated letters or numbers"

      "content": "Understand the components of a strong password. There are a number of things you can do to create a password that is unpredictable and difficult to guess—or crack with brute force hacking methods. [1] X Research source Many websites require you to include a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. You should still use these tactics, but here are some others to help you create even more secure passwords: Length: Create a long password. The longer the password is, the harder it is to figure out. Uniqueness: Make a password that is unique enough for you to remember, but is difficult for others to figure out. Randomness: If a password is a random assortment of words (i.e., \"VanillaScrunchieXylophoneApple\"), it's much harder for hacking programs to crack it."

      "content": "Pick a compound word or phrase that stands out to you. You most likely have several words, a phrase, a title (e.g., an album or a song), or something similar that stands out to you for some reason. Such words/phrases make great password bases because they're emotionally relevant to you, but not anyone else. For example, you might pick the name of your favorite song from a specific album, or your favorite phrase from a specific book. Make sure that you don't pick a word or phrase that people know you like."

      "content": "Remove the vowels from a phrase. Following the theme of using a favorite quote, lyric, line from a poem, or other favorite phrase, you can make your password even more secure if you remove the vowels from the phrase. If the line includes a number, type the digit instead of removing the vowels from the word. For example, if your phrase is \"this one's for the girls,\" your password could be ths1sfrthgrls."

      "content": "Use only the first letter of each word in a phrase. Another option for using a phrase is to only use the first letter of your favorite phrase. This works best if you have a longer quote or lyric that you want to use as your password. To make the password even more secure, include punctuation as well. For example, if you wanted to use the lyric \"it's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll,\" your password could be \"ialwttt,iywrnr.\""

This will create a nonsensical string of letters that is easy to remember, but is very hard to guess. For example, if you wanted your password to be \"fluffypenguins,\" shift your hands up and write \"ro8rr7-3ht89jw.\""

      "content": "Double your password. Another way to make a strong but memorable password is to type it twice, separating the words with a different character (such as a hyphen or underscore, but you could use any character). If the word has an alternate spelling, spell it two different ways (or purposely misspell the word once). An example of this would be \"favoritecandy_favouritecandie.\" The term \"favorite candy\" is repeated, but favorite is spelled with the British English spelling (favourite) and candy is misspelled (candie). To make this type of password even more secure, combine it with some of the other tips in this article. \"Favoritecandy_favouritecandie\" could be \"FavoriteC4ndy_FavouriteCand!e\" instead."

      "content": "Substitute your favorite numbers or letters. If you have a favorite number or letter, try replacing some of the letters of your password with that character. An easy way to remember which characters were replaced is to replace the vowels of your password. For example, if you want your password to be \"NeedleInAHayStack\" but your favorite numbers are 2 and 7, you could create the password \"N27dl27n2H2ySt7ck,\" alternating the 2 and 7 to replace each vowel."

If you want to make a password longer but you're worried a super lengthy password will be hard to remember, pad out your password with extra characters. Make sure these characters don't have some sort of significance to you (such as your initials). For example, if your password is \"HorsePlantLamp\" but you want a longer password, you can add some extra letters behind it to make it \"HorsePlantLampqmqmqm\"."

      "content": "Add an abbreviation for your password's service. This way, you can use the same base password for most services without repeating the exact password anywhere. It's incredibly important to not reuse the same abbreviation if you go this route. Make sure the abbreviation for the service isn't super easy to guess, and don't always put the abbreviation at the front of your password. For example, if your password is \"N!nja7C0cocnut\", your work email password could be \"wkmlN!nja7C0cocnut\" (with \"wkml\" being your \"work email\" abbreviation) and your Facebook password could be \"N!nja7C0cocnutfcbo\" (with \"fcbo\" being your \"Facebook\" abbreviation)."

While adding an abbreviation to the end of your password will help you remember a specific service's password, you'll eventually need to change your passwords altogether. If you're happy with your current password, try typing the password while holding down the ⇧ Shift key, or capitalize random letters. If you replaced any letters with numbers, you might switch back to using letters and use numbers for different letters in the password. Change your password more often if you end up going this route."
