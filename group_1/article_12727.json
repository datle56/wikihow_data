      "content": "Look at the size of their wing feathers. While baby chicks are covered in down, the ends of their wings will have a light feather fringe. To view the wing feathers, grasp the chick firmly in one hand. Use your other hand to extend the wing out until the feathers are somewhat separated and visible. A male (cockerel) chick will have wing feathers of roughly the same length. A female (pullet) chick will have wing feathers featuring two varied lengths. [1] X Research source Performing wing sexing 1 to 2 days after hatching will usually yield accurate results. If you wait longer than this, the wing feather development will accelerate too much to read. In some cases, females also grow tail feathers earlier than males. Males often sprout feathers faster in general, though. Feather growth rate varies from chick to chick and from breed to breed, so it isn’t the most accurate way to determine the sex of a chicken."

      "content": "Look for differences in behavior. In some cases, male and female chicks behave differently even when they’re very young. Pay attention to which birds display dominant or submissive tendencies as they socialize together. Male chicks will act less skittish and are more likely to bully their peers. Female chicks are more easily frightened by loud noises and will run in response. [2] X Research source Another way to observe the fight-or-flight response is to approach the chicks while clapping your hands. The male chicks will issue warning chirps, while the females will usually stay silent. Pick the chick up and let its legs dangle. Some say a female chick will thrash around and try to escape while males are more likely to extend their legs toward the ground."

      "title": "Compare their size, stance, and legs.",
      "content": "Compare their size, stance, and legs. Male chickens tend to grow larger and faster than females, which is often apparent when they’re 3-4 weeks old. In addition to having larger bodies and heads, males often stand up taller and puff out their chests, while females appear a bit more petite. Males also tend to have thicker legs and feet than females. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at the down color of auto-sexing breeds.",
      "content": "Look at the down color of auto-sexing breeds. Auto-sexing, or sex-link, breeds are breeds in which the sex of the chickens is distinguished by different physical features and markings, even when they’re still covered in down. For example, in some breeds, male chicks usually have light-colored heads, whereas females have dark brown ones. If a female has down spots or stripes, they’re typically brown or black, while a male’s accent marks are generally white or yellow. Determine what breed your chicks are to find out what colors to look for. [4] X Research source For example, male Rhode Island Red or New Hampshire chicks will have almost golden down coloring. Similarly, Red Stars are a sex-linked breed, so the male and female are different colors. Males hatch buttery gold, while females hatch reddish-gold. [5] X Research source Male Barred Plymouth Rocks chicks will have yellow spots on their heads. In some situations, you can estimate the sex of a day-old chick using down color reading."

      "title": "Have your chicks vent sexed by a professional.",
      "content": "Have your chicks vent sexed by a professional. Vent sexing is the most accurate way to determine the sex of a chick, though it can hurt or damage the chick if done incorrectly, which is why it’s best to hire a professional to perform the procedure. If you’ve had professional training, however, gently hold the chick in your hand and apply light pressure to its abdomen until it defecates. Look into the now clear anal vent. If there’s a bump, the chick is likely male. No bump indicates a female. [6] X Research source In some breeds, both males and females will have what looks like a series of small beads in their anal vent. In these cases, the male will have a larger, round center bead. The female center bead will be flat in appearance. The vent sex training process is long and difficult, so it’s usually only performed by large commercial hatcheries. Do not attempt it if you have not had proper training. If you’re not sure where to have your chicks professionally sexed, ask around with your local farm supplier or other poultry farmers. Professional chicken sexers will generally charge you a flat fee for accurately sexing a certain number of chicks."

      "content": "Have your chicks DNA tested to be sure. If you’re serious about breeding or showing , having your chicks genetically tested is the most certain way to determine their sex. For example, if your chicks haven’t been born yet, consider laser spectroscopy. This is a new technique that involves a lab shooting a small laser beam inside of an egg about 3 days after incubation. The technicians then use the DNA contents of the egg to determine the future sex of the chick. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Monitor comb and wattle development at 6 weeks. By this point, male chicks will have fully developing combs, the fleshy extensions on the facial areas. The comb skin will turn red and it will extend directly above the chicken’s head. In contrast, the female chick’s facial skin will stay yellow and unextended until about 10 weeks. The wattle, or the loose skin beneath the beak area, will develop similarly. [8] X Research source"

Hold the chicken firmly in your hand and look where its back meets its tail. Male chicks will have jagged and pointed saddle feathers, whereas the feathers on females look more rounded and soft. [9] X Research source While both male and female chickens technically have saddle feathers, they’re usually only referred to as saddle feathers on a rooster."

This can happen anywhere from 12 to 30 weeks of age, though on average it happens when they’re 18-22 weeks old. [10] X Research source A rooster (male) cannot lay an egg, but may start crowing loudly around this same timeframe."

One is that a long, narrow egg shape means that the chicken will be male and a rounder shape means it will be female. The shape of an egg has nothing to do with the chicken’s sex.

According to legend, if the weight swings in a circular motion, the chick is female. If it swings back and forth, it’s a male. [13] X Research source While this isn’t an accurate sexing method, it could be fun to try it out as a game and see if it ends up being right!"

      "content": "Sex differences usually become apparent after 4-10 weeks. The sex of most chicken breeds cannot be determined at hatching. While some sexing methods are more accurate than others, none are foolproof. However, if you wait until the chicks are at least 6 weeks old, your odds of success increase quite a bit. The physical changes, such as wattle development, will be easier to see, and the behavioral changes, like the startle response, will be more clear and consistent. Additionally, if you wait a few months, the males will likely start crowing. [14] X Research source"

Roosters are very protective, so they can help keep the flock safe from predators. Having a rooster will also keep you in supply of laying hens, so you won’t have to buy more chicks in the future. [17] X Research source Be aware that roosters can be mean and they will fight any other roosters you already have. Take this into consideration when determining whether you should keep the new rooster. It is possible to neuter a rooster, though it’s often difficult to find a vet to do the procedure."
