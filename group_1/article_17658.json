      "content": "Turn off the water to your faucet. Look underneath your sink for the water supply lines that run up to the handles. Locate the valves where those pipes feed into the wall and turn them counterclockwise all the way. This will shut the water off and help you avoid making a mess.

Nothing will ruin your day faster than watching a screw or washer you need slide down the drain when you accidentally drop it.

      "title": "Figure out what type of faucet you have.",
      "content": "Figure out what type of faucet you have. There are tons of different styles out there, but there are really only 4 types of faucet assemblies. How you repair your faucet depends on the type of faucet, so figure this out first before proceeding. You may need to take your faucet apart before you can sort this out. [3] X Research source A compression faucet is the most basic type. It relies on a small stem that raises up or down to control the flow of water. Most “cheap” faucets are compression-style. A ball faucet contains a ball bearing. The faucets with a single handle where you move it left or right to make the water hot or cold are ball faucets. A cartridge faucet contains a cartridge that rotates to allow the flow of water. The materials of the cartridge will vary, but the handle often has a decorative cap. Most “fancy” faucets have cartridges. A ceramic-disk faucet contains 1-2 ceramic cylinders that spin to allow water to flow. The high-end faucets with the single handle on the side (not the back!) are usually ceramic-disk faucets."

      "content": "Remove each handle with a screwdriver and gentle force. Pry off the decorative cap if there is one. If there are screw slot openings, grab a screwdriver and remove the fasteners. Then, take the handles off. [4] X Research source If you’re only adjusting one leaky faucet handle, you don’t need to remove both of the handles. The decorative cap might be a label for “hot” or “cold,” or it may be a little circular piece covering up a screw slot. Cheaper compression faucets are unlikely to have these pieces."

      "title": "Use a wrench to remove the nut.",
      "content": "Use a wrench to remove the nut. There is a stem under the handle that sits on top of the O-ring, which sits on top of a seat washer. The seat washer is usually made of rubber, which can get worn out after a while. If your faucet is dripping, this is mostly likely the culprit. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull out the stem using a wrench or your hands.",
      "content": "Pull out the stem using a wrench or your hands. If the stem won’t come out when you twist it or pull on it, use a wrench to pry it out or unscrew it. This will expose the O-ring, which will be thinner, and the seat washer, which will be thicker. If the handles are leaky replace the O-ring. Take the old one to the hardware store and use it to find a replacement. [6] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021.

If you can’t find a replacement, contact your faucet’s manufacturer to order one directly from them. Coat the replacement in plumber’s grease before installing it back in the valve. [8] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. You can use petroleum jelly instead of plumber’s grease if you prefer."

Then, turn the water on and let it run for a few minutes to wash out any debris. Any minor leaks should now be fixed. If you do find any leaks, confirm that you installed the O-ring and seat washer correctly. If there’s still a leak, you likely have to replace the entire faucet."

You won't need to replace the entire faucet, just the faucet cam assembly. All of the stuff you'll need, including the tools, should be included in this type of kit that runs about $20. [9] X Research source Look for a kit that specifically mentions your specific faucet brand and model as compatible."

There is a specific tool in your replacement kit for this purpose, so follow the instructions that came with your kit. Remove the faucet cam, washer, and ball. [11] X Research source This will look like a \"ball and socket\" joint in your body—a movable (usually white) rubber ball plugs the socket, which stops the water and releases it."
