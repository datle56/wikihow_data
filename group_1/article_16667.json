      "content": "Finish the “A New Day is Dawning” song in Atlantica. The Atlantica area of the game requires you to finish several musical episodes, with the last one being “A New Day is Dawning.” You’ll need to get a score of at least 30,000 points across thirty events to be successful, with events involving Ariel typically being worth more points. Once you finish this minigame, you’ll get an Orichalcum+ as a reward. [1] X Research source It may also be helpful to keep in mind that the events before and during King Triton’s appearance are worth the most points in the minigame (15,000 each for an “Excellent” score). Since the HD remake of Kingdom Hearts 2 is virtually identical to the original PS2 version, the Orichalcum＋ locations have not changed. Don’t worry about the differences between the original and the 2.5 ReMIX versions. [2] X Research source"

Each page matches a different location in the 100 Acre Wood, but they’ve been ripped out of the book and are hidden across various worlds. You can find each page in the following places: [3] X Research source Disney Castle - Go to the Library and open a treasure chest to find this page. Pride Lands - Find a treasure chest at the Oasis and open it to get this page. Hollow Bastion - Get to the treasure chest in the Crystal Fissure (before the Battle of the 1,000 Heartless) to find this page. The Land of Dragons - Open the Throne room treasure chest after meeting Xigbar to get a page. Agrabah - During Sora’s second visit, find a treasure chest in the Ruins and open it to get the page."

When you collect at least one of every synthesis item in the game and give each one to a Moogle, you’ll get one Orichalcum+ as a reward. You’ll most likely have to farm enemies for a few hours to collect one of each synthesis item, although having Lucky Lucky equipped can make this much easier! [4] X Research source You’ll also find many synthesis items simply by progressing forward in the game. All Moogle shops in the game are linked, so your progress will carry over from shop to shop; you don’t have to worry about bringing your materials to a specific shop. For the Orichalcum＋ to appear in your list of materials, you’ll have to exit and then re-enter the Moogle's shop to turn it in as well. Check the Moogle's Item list often so you can see what items you're missing. This also helps with farming the other materials required by the Ultimate Recipe!"

You might not think there’s much value in going to the Sunset Terrace (beyond reminiscing about the six Wonders that Roxas had to search for in the prologue episode), but there’s a big reason to visit! You’ll find a treasure chest containing Orichalcum+ on top of a building there. [5] X Research source To reach the building's rooftop, find the tram car moving back and forth and jump onto it. From there, jump onto the roof containing the chest."

Open the chest on this ledge to find the Orichalcum+ there!

Complete the 10-round tournament, and the final Orichalcum+ is yours. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that the Cups will open up periodically as you progress through the game. You can only use Sora during the Goddess of Fate Cup—there are no summons allowed. Once you complete the steps in this guide, you should have seven pieces of Orichalcum+. Congratulations!"

The Ultima recipe calls for 13 Orichalcum+, but don’t get confused: there are only seven pieces found throughout the game! To get the rest, you’ll need to apply an Energy Crystal to each piece of Orichalcum+. [9] X Research source Energy Crystals essentially cut materials in half when applied; that’s how you can get 13 Orichalcum+ out of seven pieces!"

[10] X Research source The complete Ultima Weapon recipe is: 13 Orichalcum+ 1 Orichalcum 1 Mythril Crystal 1 Dense Crystal 1 Twilight Crystal 7 Serenity Crystal You’ll need to pick up the “Ultimate Recipe” (as Sora) to make the Ultima Weapon in the first place. It’s in a chest at the Mansion: Basement Corridor."
