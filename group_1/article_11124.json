      "content": "Create your curls after applying smoothing products to damp hair. For best results, make your curls when your hair is damp. This will help set your curls and make them last longer. If you usually apply products like leave-in conditioner or silking serums, apply a dime or quarter-size amount of your products to damp hair before you make your curls. [1] X Research source For instance, make your curls as soon as you get out of the shower."

      "content": "Place one finger at the end of a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) wide section of hair. When you are first learning this technique, start at the top so you can easily see your curls as you make them. Grab a section of hair towards the top of your head, and brush through the section from root to tip using either your fingers or a comb. Then, pull your hair taut and place your index finger on your dominant hand at the end of your hair. [2] X Research source If you want to create larger curls, use bigger sections of hair. If you want to make tighter, smaller curls, use smaller sections of hair. Use your dominant hand to create your curls, and use your non-dominant hand to help guide your hair."

      "title": "Wrap your hair around your finger until you reach the roots.",
      "content": "Wrap your hair around your finger until you reach the roots. To start your curl, grab a section of hair and twirl it hair around your finger 2-3 times to secure the ends. Pinch the end of your hair between your thumb and index finger. Then, hold your hair 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) from the bottom with your non-dominant hand, and spin your finger clockwise so your hair tightly twists around it. Adjust your non-dominant hand as you go so it remains about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) from the end of your hair. [3] X Research source Be sure there is no space in between your finger and your hair. Your non-dominant hand acts as an anchor to keep your hair straight and taut as you spin your hair. If you are having trouble wrapping short hair around your finger, use a pen, marker, or mascara tube instead! This still creates the same basic curl shape, though it may be easier to wrap your hair around another object rather than your finger. Use an object that you can wrap your hair around at least 2 times. [4] X Research source The length of your hair will determine how many times you're able to wrap it. The shorter your hair, the fewer wraps you'll be able to accomplish."

      "content": "Slide your finger out and secure your curl at your roots with a bobby pin. Hold your curl at your scalp with your non-dominant hand, and carefully slide your finger out of your curl. Once your finger is free from your curl, grab a bobby pin with your dominant hand, and slide it through your hair as close to your roots as you can get. Position your bobby pin around your curl and the hair at your roots to secure it to your scalp. [5] X Research source This creates soft, ringlet curls over all of your head."

To do this, slide off your curl, and pin your hair across the middle of your curl so it lays flat. [6] X Research source Instead of voluminous curls, you will get a subtle, vintage wave hairstyle."

Locate another section of hair about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) wide directly under your first pinned curl, and make your next curl directly underneath. Continue twisting small sections of hair around your finger and pinning them in place until all of your hair is styled. Make your next section immediately underneath the one before it. [7] X Research source Once you finish the top section on one side, move to the top section on the other side. Then, repeat on the bottom sections on both sides until all your hair is pinned in place."

      "content": "Wrap your hair in silk and let your curls set for 12-15 hours. For best results, let your curls set overnight. Place a silk cap over your head to protect your curls. Secure the cap around the back of your head, then pull it over the top of your head until you reach your hairline. This is an easy way to keep your hair protected as it air dries. Let your hair set for 12-15 hours before you take out your pins. [9] X Research source Alternatively, you can wrap your hair in a silk scarf if you do not have a cap. Simply place a silk scarf across the top of your head. Gather the ends of the scarf at the back of your head, and secure the scarf with 2 knots to keep it in place. Pull the ends of the scarf across your forehead and tuck them underneath the scarf near your eyebrow. [10] X Research source Make sure the scarf is secure, but avoid tying it too tight. A tight scarf could flatten your curls."

To remove the bobby pin, simply slide it away from your curl and remove it with your fingers. Continue removing your pins from the back, sides, and top of your head until they are all out. Starting from the back also helps you keep track of how many pins you still have left so you don’t get overwhelmed."

Once your bobby pins are all removed, put your hands in your hair at your scalp, and wiggle them back and forth to shake out your curls. This creates a natural look and lets your curls take their shape. In addition, you can separate larger sections of curls to create multiple, smaller curls. Simply lift your curl up and divide it in half."

This helps smooth out your hair while still keeping the curls at the end. [11] X Research source This is a great option if you want a vintage, wavy style, rather than a kinky, curly look. You can use either a medium- or wide-tooth comb."

[12] X Research source Additionally, tease your hair about half way from the ends to give a full-bodied look, or tease your roots if you want a little extra lift.
