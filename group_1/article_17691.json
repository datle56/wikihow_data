      "content": "Jiggle the handle a bit to see if the water stops running. Sometimes, the water just keeps running because the chain connecting your handle to the flapper gets caught or knots up. If this is only a once-in-a-while kind of problem, try jiggling the handle after the water has filled the tank. If the water stops running, you’re good to go. [1] X Research source If this happens regularly, it’s a sign that your chain might be the wrong length. Open the tank and check how long the chain is running from the flapper to the handle."

      "content": "Turn off the water and drain the toilet . Before you can check the flapper for problems, turn off the water to the toilet by twisting the supply line valve counterclockwise as far as it will go. Then, flush the toilet to drain excess water from the tank. [2] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. The flapper is a round rubber seal that stops water from draining from the tank and into the toilet bowl. When you flush the toilet, the chain pulls the flapper up so fresh water can fill the bowl. Problems with the flapper are among the most common causes of a running toilet. It’s almost positively the flapper’s fault if the water occasionally stops running and/or the water doesn’t overflow into the overflow valve (the hollow pipe in the middle)."

      "title": "Adjust the chain length if it’s too long or too short.",
      "content": "Adjust the chain length if it’s too long or too short. The chain that pulls the flapper up can allow leaks if it’s too long or too short—the goal is to have a chain that looks like a J when the flapper is closed, but pulls taut and opens the flapper when you raise the handle fully. For too much tension, remove the hook on the handle and move the chain up 1-2 links. If the chain is too long too long, trim a few links with wire cutters and reattach it. [3] X Research source When the chain is too short, it will pull up on the valve when it shouldn’t, allowing water to drain constantly. When the chain is too long, it can get caught underneath the flapper and prevent a seal."

Inspect the flapper for mineral deposits, warping, discoloration, disintegration, and other signs of trouble. [4] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. You can clean a dirty flapper that’s got mineral buildup on it. A flapper that shows other wear-related problems should be replaced."

Add soap as needed to wear away any gunk. You can even soak the flapper in vinegar if you still can’t clean the flapper off. [5] X Research source When the flapper is clean, put it back in place. Attach the hooks on the side to the pins on the overflow tube. Turn the water back on and let the toilet tank fill. Listen for the sound of water running to see if that fixed the problem."

Take the worn flapper to the hardware store and purchase a new flapper in the same style and with the same dimensions. You can also buy a universal flapper that will fit any kind of toilet. [6] X Research source To attach the new flapper , fit in into place and attach the hooks on the side to the pins on the overflow tube. Turn the water back on and test the flapper to see that it’s functioning properly, and that the toilet isn't running."

      "content": "Try adjusting the spline on the fill valve before doing anything else. Your fill valve may simply need to be adjusted. If you pull up on the spline and the water stops flowing, the valve is just out of whack. Grab a screwdriver and turn the screw on top of the spline counterclockwise to lower the fill valve’s sensitivity. [7] X Research source Your fill valve is the tall pipe structure on the left side of your tank. The spline is the vertical piece that sticks out towards the handle and moves up and down when you raise it. This process is identical regardless of whether you have a ball float-style valve or one of the newer floatless valves."

Close the valve that feeds into the wall and drain your tank by flushing it. [8] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. Put a bucket under the fill valve where your supply line feeds into the tank. You may end up spilling a little bit of water while you carry this repair out."

Use a wrench or channel locks to gently unscrew the locknut securing the line in place. Once it’s loose, turn the screw counterclockwise by hand and remove it. [9] X Research source If that nut happens to be plastic, don’t use a wrench or channel locks. Just twist it off by hand."

Once the supply line has been disconnected, you'll see a safety lock nut attaching the fill valve assembly to the toilet on the outside of the tank. Remove this by using an adjustable wrench (or your hand) to turn the lock nut to the left (counterclockwise). Once the lock nut is off, lift the old fill valve assembly out from the toilet tank. [10] X Research source Take the old assembly to the hardware store when you purchase the replacement. That way, you can be sure to get the right size and style fill valve for your toilet. You can replace older ball float fill valves with more modern float cup style ones if you’d like. The float fill valves and the non-float fill valves are functionally identical—the non-floats are just easier to adjust."

Fit the valve into the hole in the tank where the water supply line comes in. Hook up the water supply line and tighten the nut in a clockwise direction to tighten it. [11] X Research source Don’t overtighten the nut so hard that you end up cracking or damaging the bottom of the valve. So long as the supply line is tight and leak-free, you’re good to go."
