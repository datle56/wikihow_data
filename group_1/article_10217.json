      "content": "Avoid sweet foods and drinks between meals. The sugar in sweet foods and drinks, like candy or juice, can damage your teeth. Since you should brush after each meal, it is alright to eat sweet foods during meals. You should also avoid sticky treats, like toffee or chewing gum, which can damage the twin blocks."

      "content": "Avoid hard foods at first. When you first receive your twin block braces, your mouth and jaw will be sore. This discomfort will likely last for a few days and can be aggravated by eating hard or crunchy foods like apples. Stick to soft foods, like mashed potatoes or yogurt, until your discomfort goes away. Colder drinks, like a smoothie or chilled juice, may help to soothe pain. [1] X Research source Hard or crunchy foods, like popcorn, pretzels, or chips, can break and become lodged under your block braces. You can either avoid these foods or only eat them when your block braces are taken out."

      "content": "Keep your braces in while eating, if possible. Ideally, you will feel comfortable eating and drinking with your braces in at all times. The longer you are able to wear your braces for each day, the shorter your treatment time will be. When you just receive your twin block braces, you can take them out to eat meals. Over time, as you get more comfortable wearing the braces, try to keep them in while you eat meals. Keep them in a plastic box for safekeeping while you are eating if you need to take the braces out."

      "title": "Practice speaking with your braces.",
      "content": "Practice speaking with your braces. It is fairly common to notice differences in your speech while you're wearing twin block braces. Often, your speech patterns will go back to normal after a few weeks but you can speed up this process by practicing speaking with the braces in. You may also produce more saliva than normal, though this will stop after a few days. Read aloud while you're at home and practice tongue twisters to get used to forming words with your braces in. “S” sounds tend to be the most affected, so practice tongue twisters like “She sells sea shells down the sea shore.”"

      "content": "Treat canker sores. Canker sores tend to appear near the metal parts of the twin block braces where they irritate the skin. These are the most common type of mouth ulcer and it's very likely that you'll get one at some point during your orthodontic treatment. They typically last 10 to 14 days and can be treated with over the counter remedies. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Look for products that temporarily numb the area to bring some short-term relief. You can also rinse your mouth with warm salt water, which helps to ease oral irritations. Be sure not to swallow the salt water after rinsing. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can look for products at drug stores that are specifically intended for mouth ulcers, or for products that contain oral antiseptics, like carbamide peroxide, that will kill bacteria. If you frequently get canker sores, talk to your orthodontist about whether a prescription-strength product is right for you."

      "content": "Alleviate pain. You may experience pain or discomfort after your braces have been adjusted. With most block braces, your orthodontist will either instruct you to turn a key on the top brace or they will do it for you during an appointment. This key expands the top brace and will be adjusted as your jaw moves into the correct alignment. This can be uncomfortable, or even painful. Depending on your specific treatment, your bottom brace could be adjusted periodically. [5] X Research source After your top or bottom brace has been adjusted, eat soft foods and avoid any hard foods. An ice pack can help alleviate jaw pain, or you can take an over the counter pain medication."

If you're the only person you know with block braces, just remember that down the line the people who don't have braces now will likely have them in the future. You probably know other people who have braces, which can also help you stop feeling embarrassed by knowing others are going through the same thing. Keep in mind that others aren't nearly as focused on your braces as you are. If you're feeling self-conscious, remember that the majority of people are so wrapped up in their own lives and problems that they won't notice your braces."
