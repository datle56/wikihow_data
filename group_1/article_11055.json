      "content": "Recognize symptoms of labyrinthitis. The inner parts of your ear are crucial for both your sense of hearing and balance. Swelling due to the condition can lead to an impairment of both, which then has other cascading effects. The most common effect by which to recognize labyrinthitis include: [4] X Research source Vertigo (a spinning feeling when standing still) Difficulty focusing due to your eyes moving on their own Dizziness Hearing loss Imbalance Nausea and vomiting Tinnitus (ringing or other noises in your ears)"

Recent viral illnesses (colds and flus), as well as respiratory and ear infections, significantly increase your risk for labyrinthitis.

OTC antihistamines are used to treat allergies, and they can help reduce the congestion from a recent infection, which may be what's causing the swelling leading to the labyrinthitis.

      "content": "Take an OTC medication to treat dizziness. Since labyrinthitis is most often caused by a viral infection, you must often wait for your immune system to do its job and beat the virus. During this time you can help reduce any associated dizziness with an OTC medication. [11] X Research source The most common OTC medicine for dizziness is meclizine (Bonine, Dramamine, or Antivert).

When you have an attack of vertigo due to the condition, you can take several steps to help reduce the effects. You should: [13] X Research source Rest as best as you can and try to stay still without moving your head Avoid changing positions or making sudden movements Resume activities slowly Get help walking so you don't injure yourself in a fall Avoid bright lights, television (and other electronic screens), and reading during attacks"

[14] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source This maneuver can help to reposition the small particles in the canals of your inner ear called otoliths. These particles, when knocked out of place, can induce vertigo. To perform the maneuver: [15] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Sit in the middle of your bed at the edge with your head turned 45° toward the direction that induces the vertigo. Quickly lay down backward with your head still toward the direction that produces the vertigo. This will likely lead to a strong vertiginous response. Stay in this position for thirty seconds. Turn your head 90° to the opposite direction and hold for another thirty seconds. Rotate both your head and your body in the same direction (you will now be on your side with your head over the edge of the bed pointed 45° toward the ground). Hold for another thirty seconds before sitting back up. Repeat this five or six times until you no longer experience a response of vertigo to the maneuver."

While the most severe symptoms of labyrinthitis usually last about a week, you can still have milder symptoms for three weeks (on average). Sudden dizzy spells while driving, climbing, or operating heavy machinery can all prove dangerous as you recover.

If your symptoms do not subside with the use of medication and become chronic, then you should ask your doctor about VRT. VRT is a physical therapy that can help you adapt to and correct for the symptoms of labyrinthitis. Some of the strategies most commonly used in this therapy include: Gaze-stabilization exercises: These exercises help your brain adapt to the new signaling from your affected vestibular system (the system that helps you with orientation). A common exercise includes fixing your gaze on a specific target while moving your head. Canal-retraining exercises: Chronic symptoms of labyrinthitis can lead to changes related to nerve signaling for balance and walking. These exercises improve coordination by helping you adapt to the affected sensory information you receive from your eyes and vestibular system. Expect to see a physical therapist once or twice a week for four to six weeks for your VRT sessions."
