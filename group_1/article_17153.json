      "content": "Gather information about the person you’re looking for. The more information you have, the easier it’ll be to find out if that person is (or has been) in jail. At a minimum, have the individual's full name on hand. Other identifying characteristics, like their birth date, age, gender, race, and hair color, can also help a search, especially if they have a common name. If you don’t have a full name, you may be able to track the person down with a nickname and date of arrest. However, this information alone isn’t useful with online resources or databases."

      "content": "Determine if the person is likely in jail or prison. Typically, those housed in jails have been arrested but haven’t been arraigned, are awaiting trial but haven’t been released on bail, or are serving sentences less than 1 year in length. If someone’s serving a sentence longer than 1 year, they’re usually in prison. [1] X Research source For instance, if you just saw this person a few days ago, chances are they haven’t been arraigned yet and are in a jail."

      "content": "Figure out where they're being held if they were recently arrested. If you know the status of the person you believe is (or has been) in jail, finding accurate records can be easier if you know what jail or prison they’re in. If the individual was recently arrested, they'd likely go to the jail of the county they were arrested in. Additionally, if someone is awaiting trial or arraignment, they’ll most likely be held in jail in their home county or whichever county they were arrested in. However, sometimes jails will transfer the inmates during their sentence."

If you don’t know where they were arrested but you know their address, search for their home county's website instead. Find the county’s website by searching “[county] law enforcement website” online. Scour the website for tabs associated with “inmate care,” or use the website’s search bar (if there’s one available) to search “find an inmate.”"

      "content": "Search the county website’s law enforcement databases (if available). Some county jail websites have searchable databases of the people being held there. Usually, you don’t need anything more than a person's name to search the database. [2] X Research source Look for key terms like “county sheriff,” “police department,” and “municipal court of the county” to find the prisoner or arrest database. Keep in mind that not every county has an online resource that can locate inmates. Not all online databases are updated often, and their information could be outdated. If you find the person you’re searching for through a database, confirm that the individual is still there by calling the jail directly."

      "content": "Check the websites of neighboring counties. If there is any chance the individual might be held elsewhere, it’d likely be in a neighboring county. Determine the counties surrounding their home county and search those websites as well, or try using a state’s inmate locator. Find a state’s inmate locator database by searching “[state] inmate search” online. Remember, these resources may only list counties with an online inmate locator and not list neighboring counties that can only be contacted by phone."

      "content": "Search the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) inmate locator to find federal jail inmates. If you’re trying to locate someone who could be in federal jail instead of a county jail, then the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ website is the best place to look. Type the name of the person you’re looking for in the website to pull up all available records on any possible arrests. The Federal Bureau of Prisons’ website only has records for inmates that were incarcerated from 1982 to the present. To use this website, you need to know the person’s first and last name and their proper spelling. Keep in mind that the Federal Bureau of Prisons' website only applies to people held in federal custody, as opposed to state crimes. In most circumstances, garden variety crimes are punished under state law, while crimes that take place in multiple states or violate a federal statute are punished under federal law. For example, a DUI would likely be punished under state law, while violations of the Securities and Exchange Commission rules would be punished under federal law."

In an online search engine, search “find an inmate” to pull up various inmate locator databases. Opt for sites like The Inmate Locator that don’t have ads or cost anything. Websites with lots of pop-ups or fees are most likely scams."

Once you call, there may be a specific phone number or extension used for inmate inquiries. The automated message or receptionist can transfer your call to the correct department. Keep in mind that you may not be able to obtain detailed information about an inmate without proper documentation or information. For instance, legitimate family members of an inmate may be able to obtain more than a friend."
