      "content": "If your AirPods battery is low, the microphone might cut out. This is because your AirPods might be trying to use the microphone in one of the AirPods that's already too low on battery power. If people can't hear you at all while you're trying to speak on the phone, or if your voice is going in and out, place your AirPods in their charging case and charge them for at least 30 minutes before trying again. To check your battery level , place the AirPods into the charging case (if using AirPods original or Pro), open the lid, and hold the case close to your iPhone or iPad. In a few seconds, you'll see the charging status. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "By default, your AirPods automatically choose which microphone to use. If you're having problems with your microphone cutting out some of the words you say, try disabling the automatic mic selection so your AirPods stop switching between microphones while you're speaking. Here's how: [2] X Research source Open Settings on an iPhone or iPad. Tap Bluetooth . Tap the \"i\" in a circle next to your AirPods. Tap the Microphone option at the bottom. Choose either Always Left or Always Right . [3] X Research source Try chatting with someone on the phone or taking a voice memo to test. If this doesn't improve your microphone quality, try switching to the other (left or right) microphone. If you stick with using just one microphone, you could run into problems if the battery in the microphone-enabled AirPod runs too low. If the microphone isn't working while you're using just one microphone, give your AirPods a charge and try again."

If the problem is that people hear the sounds in the background louder than your voice, disabling all special modes while you're on the phone may resolve the problem. You can always switch back to your preferred noise cancellation mode when listening to music or podcasts. [4] X Research source Open Settings on your iPhone or iPad. Tap Bluetooth .

      "content": "Swab away dust and debris with a dry cotton swab. AirPods can collect all sorts of dirt and grime, especially the recessed areas in which your microphones and speakers are located. If anything is blocking your microphone, your voice will sound muffled or distorted on the phone and in recordings. Using a completely dry cotton swab, gently brush away debris from all recessed areas, taking care not to press too hard into the speaker mesh. [6] X Research source Also clean the case of your AirPods or AirPods Pro with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth. Don't use anything sharp, abrasive, or wet to clean your AirPods. Alternatively, take your AirPods to an Apple store to get them professionally cleaned."

      "content": "Did any liquids get into your AirPods? While AirPods Pro and 3rd generation AirPods are water resistant and sweatproof, no other AirPods models are water-safe. [7] X Research source Even if your AirPods are water resistant, they aren't waterproof , which means you should never bring them into the shower or sauna, run them through the washer, or submerge them. If water gets into your AirPods, they can make your microphone (and every other feature of your AirPods) stop working entirely. If your AirPods got wet, dry them out completely in a dry room for at least a full day before trying to use them again. If you have AppleCare+, you can replace water damaged AirPods for a very small fee."

While this will erase any custom settings you've created for your AirPods, such as button configurations, it can clear up microphone problems like cutting out, distortion, and static. [8] X Research source Place your AirPods or AirPods Pro into their charging case and close the lid. Wait 30 seconds and then open the lid. Leave the lid open. Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. Tap Bluetooth . Tap the \"i\" in a circle next to your AirPods. Tap Forget This Device and then confirm. Press and hold the button on the back of the charging case for 15 seconds until the light flashes amber and then white. Pair your AirPods again by bringing them close to your phone or tablet and following the on-screen instructions. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Opting for Transparency Mode over Active Noise Cancelation (ANC) might help.",
      "content": "Opting for Transparency Mode over Active Noise Cancelation (ANC) might help. Transparency Mode allows more noise in from the outside ANC, which, in theory, should be more about what you hear than what others hear. Still, many AirPods Pro and Max users on Apple's forums report that people can hear them more clearly in Transparency Mode than when ANC is enabled. [10] X Research source To switch to Transparency Mode on AirPods Pro, squeeze and hold one of your AirPod stems until you hear a tone. To switch on AirPods Max, just press the noise control button on the top of the earpiece next to the Digital Crown dial."
