[1] X Research source For example, your cardio goal may be to run 2 miles (3.2 km) in 15 minutes. Interval training, using sprints and moderate exertion can help you reach your goal, by running 3 or 4 times per week. For example, your strength goals may be to do 10 push ups in 2 months. These goals will differ greatly between men and women for the most part. Men may want to build more muscle mass, while women may want to build lean muscle mass. The difference is in the execution of your Weightlifting. Include weight loss goals, if they apply to you. You can still get buff and gain muscle mass while losing weight. While Weightlifting speeds up your metabolism, you will need to spend an equal amount of time doing aerobic exercise to burn more fat off your body. [2] X Research source"
