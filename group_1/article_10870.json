If you want to adjust the font face, size, style, or color of this entry in your index, you can do so here. Just highlight the word or phrase in \"Main entry,\" right-click the highlighted area, and then select Font . Make any changes you want to the font and then click OK ."

It might be helpful to go through your document and create main entries first, and then go back and add subentries. For example, if you selected the word surnames and plan to index all surnames in your document, you may want to add mark each surname in the document with the \"Surnames\" main entry, and then list the surname itself as the subentry. You could also add a third-level entry, which would appear below a subentry in the index. To do this, just type a colon after the subentry and then type the third-level entry."

For example, if you highlighted the word \"Surnames\" on page 2, the index will list \"page 2\" as the location of the Surnames entry. This is because \"Current page\" is the default selection in the \"Options\" section. If you'd rather the selected entry reference a different entry (think of when you see \"See also\" in an index), select \"Cross-reference,\" and then type the name of the other entry next to \"See.\" If you want the entry to point to a range of pages rather than a single page, you'll need to create a bookmark for that page range .

After customizing this entry to your liking, click Mark to save it and move to the next. After marking your main entries, go through and mark any subentries or third-level entries. It's kind of awkward to do: Highlight the word or phrase you want to list as a subentry. Using our surname example, let's say you created a main entry for Surnames and want to add the surname \"Williams\" to the list of surnames in the index. Start by highlighting the first instance of \"Williams\" in your document. Next, click the Mark Index Entry window. This adds \"Williams\" to the \"Main entry\" field (for now). Type or paste the subentry (Williams, in our example) into the subentry field. Replace the text in the \"Main entry\" field with the name of the main entry (Surnames, in our example). Edit any details and click Mark (or Mark all )."
