Teens deal with all sorts of pressures and stresses in their school life and personal life. So, it is important that you take care of your mental health as well as your physical health. Carve out time in your schedule to relax. Even if it's just 30 minutes before bedtime, you should have enough time to do things you enjoy on the weekdays. Having barely any time left when you get home can be stressful, since you're not engaging with your hobbies or stress-relieving activities. Talk to someone if you are struggling. Whether that's a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher, you should have a source of support when you're struggling."

Females can start puberty at ages 8-14, and males at 9-15 years old. But, if you haven't started puberty at 15, you should go see a doctor. Not starting puberty at 15-16 years old could indicate a hormonal issue.

But, it's nearly the same; it's just that people are more mature in high school. Additionally, don't believe the high school stereotypes portrayed in pop culture. No, not everyone dates in high school. Fights don't break out all the time, and people don't know what's going on everywhere all the time (especially if it's a large school). It's helpful to talk to an older adult, like an older friend, sibling, or parent about their high school experience to feel reassured."

Set up a table with the days Monday to Friday (or Sunday to Saturday), and write down what subjects you have every day for that week. You can do this with a planner or a calendar too. Then, write down important tests coming up, and how many minutes you'll study for for each subject. If you don't set up your study habits now, you may be prone to procrastination and inefficient study habits in your late high school years, which isn't beneficial to boosting your grades.

Colleges aren't likely to accept someone who is late constantly. Plus, you are showing respect to the class you are attending, as well as the teacher. It's best to do this early on. If you are late in 9th and 10th grade, your teachers may comment on your tardiness to future teachers that may teach you in your later years, which gives them a bad image of you."

You don't have to forget about them. In your freshman year, try making friends with other freshmen, as well as maintain some of your old friends. During high school orientation, talk to some people sitting next to you.

So, if you're tired of taking piano, try quitting piano and taking up something else. Your parents may not agree.

Think about it; what memories will you have if you scroll and watch videos for hours every day? You won't have many interesting memories of your teenage years in the future. Doing the same thing for hours is pretty boring. Also, you are wasting a lot of time. Instead, use this time for mostly engaging in hobbies, exercising, or relaxing offline.

You may regret being estranged from your parents when you are an adult. Your parents may not understand what they did to make you unhappy. Additionally, some parents may be clingy because they are apprehensive about you growing up. If you sit down and explain how you are feeling and why you are feeling this way to your parents, you may find a way to solve the problem. Use \"I\" language when explaining your emotions. Find a way to compromise if your parents have strong feelings for something. Sometimes, you may have to give into your parents. Your parents may be doing what is best for you. You may have to wait until you are an adult to get a piercing, and that's ok. It's not the end of the world, and you can wait a few months and check again to see if they will allow you."

Understand that having a relationship is a commitment, and you will get into arguments with your significant other at one point. Every day won't be a beautiful fairytale. You will need to be mature enough and learn how to handle conflicts, as well as talk about difficult subjects sometimes. Don't date someone solely because of their looks. Most people develop crushes based on physical appearance, but you shouldn't be intentionally dating people because they look good. Know that you have your rights. You can always say no if you are uncomfortable with something. Talk thoroughly about whether or not you are ready to have sex . Both people need to be consenting for this to occur. Stay safe if you are dating on the internet . Don't reveal your personal information to someone you are dating online unless you have seen their face."

When you have free time outside of school, try doing other activities offline. Depending on social media for boredom isn't healthy. Having healthy boredom that requires you to do something creative (instead of giving your brain easy dopamine by scrolling) is better. Actually take the time to find something you enjoy."

It could even be someone famous and with truly good qualities you can look up to. [14] X Research source If you decide to have a famous person as a role model, you should find someone near you that you can actually talk to about any concerns. These mentors can help you if you have any questions about high school. They may be able to help you with homework if they took a class you shared. They can help you throughout your teenage years and possibly help discover yourself. Avoid bad influences. The teenage years often determine part of your habits and your personality in your adult years, so be careful. If your friend encourages you to vandalize, smoke, do drugs, bully others, get into fights, then stay away from them."

      "content": "Stop trying to fit in a mold. We all experience surface pressure and peer pressure from time to time. You might be scared that doing something different may make you the target of bullying. Friends you have may have taught you to cringe at someone liking an underrated hobby (e.g. knitting). If you truly like it, you don't have to follow what others say. Break the surface pressure by freely expressing what you believe. You can stand up for what you believe in because you have a voice. You may be part of the minority, but that's not a bad thing. It's great to try something new too; if there's a new course offered in school, you may be one of the first ones to try it out. Maybe it's an interesting class you want to take again, or maybe it's not the right fit for you. The teenage years are hotspots for intense peer pressure, since everyone is self-conscious and/or judging each other. However, you don't have to be like this. Be yourself; it makes you happier in the long-term, and you may share opinions that help people."

High school is very stressful for many people, because of the pressures of school, applying to college, and becoming an adult. But a way to enjoy it is to express yourself. In adulthood, you may not have the freedom of expressing yourself in the workforce due to high standards and expectations of being professional. Middle school and high school are good times to figure out your fashion sense, what music you like, what friends you look for, etc. Even if your school requires uniforms, you can still express yourself. Don't be forced into liking a certain type of style. Discover what you like on your own. Some fashion styles include the preppy, goth, emo, skater, punk, scene, VSCO, and fashionista styles. You also don't have to fit into one category; you can use accessories from multiple styles of fashion. Find out what artists you like listening to. You don't have to listen to pop that's overplayed on the radio. You may find out cooler underrated artists. Or, you may find musicians from earlier decades, like the 2000s, 90s, 80s, and 70s that you enjoy a lot."

They are encouraging you to change your bad habits to good ones. But bad pressure is something that you shouldn't give into. If someone is forcing you to do things that are dangerous, wrong, or unwanted, don't give in. You can make up an excuse, but keep in mind that this won't work all the time.

Because of peer pressure, you may be tempted to adopt a party and carefree lifestyle, going to parties and hanging out at people's houses until late at night. But you shouldn't do this. High school is an influential time for teenagers, and it shapes who you are going to be in your adulthood. You may adopt bad habits and keep them through adulthood, making you struggle through your working years. You don't need to go to every party to have a social life. You can make friends that aren't party animals. You don't need to become popular in high school. Peaking in high school in terms of social life can be detrimental to your future, especially if you used bad ways to become on top of the social ladder. Colleges will see what you did in high school, and they won't accept you if your reputation was bad. In stricter schools, this probably won't happen. But be very cautious when dating. Additionally, wait until you are mature enough to get sexually active. Having sex is a very serious thing, and you should wait until you are emotionally ready and mature enough to do so."

You graduate middle school, go through puberty, enter high school, and immediately need to start thinking about your future. Even two years, from 13 to 15, may be a large change for you. It is normal for people to change. People change all the time, and everyone is always learning from until they die. No matter how old you are, you will still be different than what you were in the past. If you still have hobbies that are traditionally reserved for younger people, you can still follow them! As long as it doesn't harm anyone else or disrupt your own life, you can do it! If you're sad about growing up, reframe your thinking in a positive way. Growing up means you can become financially independent. Plus, you may get a job you really like. You may learn new skills. Getting a job and being happy during these times may be difficult, but you will make it through."
