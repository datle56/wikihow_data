      "content": "Stop getting haircuts to grow dreadlocks. As your hair grows longer, it will start locking naturally on its own. But this is the least advisable method for growing dreadlocks, as it may take at least 6 months for those with naturally curly or kinky hair. While you’ll have to do less preparatory work, growing your hair out will result in uneven locks that look worse than dreadlocks developed using other methods. [1] X Research source As your hair starts to lock on its own, you may need to find a professional hair stylist to help shape them."

      "content": "Shape your growing clusters of hair. Palm roll your locks in a uniform direction – clockwise – once they begin to lock on their own. You can also shape your locks by applying rubber bands from the individual clusters of hair. Use one at the root of the cluster and one at the tip for the best results. [2] X Research source If your locks are of widely uneven size and don’t look good, you may need a professional stylist to help comb out and then backcomb your hair from scratch. Make sure that your hair is dry before you twist your locks. Your hair is more fragile when it's wet.

      "content": "Wash your hair once a week with regular shampoo. Avoid massaging your hair or other motions that may shape your hair and interfere with the locking process. Just let the shampoo and soap flow naturally through the hair, and then rinse it out. [4] X Research source As your hair starts to lock, you'll want to wash the still-forming locks every couple of days. Keep your hair free of extra moisture by wrapping it in a bandana when it’s raining or when before you plan to exercise."

Roll individual locks that are becoming frayed or loose every day, rather than every other day. [5] X Research source If your locks are still growing very unevenly, or are fraying after at least 3 months of palm rolling, schedule an appointment with a stylist."

      "content": "Avoid using conditioners for a week before backcombing your hair. Conditioner makes it more difficult for your hair to lock naturally. Continue to wash your hair as frequently as possible, but make sure your shampoo contains no relaxing agents. [6] X Research source If doubtful about whether you’re using a shampoo that will hurt your dreadlocking efforts, wash your hair with just regular soap and water. You can bleach or color your hair during this time if you want. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Braid your hair for 2 days. Untangle your hair with a long brush and divide your hair in 3 sections. Cross the left section over the middle, then the right section over the middle. Continue to alternate crossing sections over the middle until your hair is completely braided, then secure the braid with a ponytail holder or an elastic cinch. [8] X Research source Use a ponytail holder that’s translucent or an elastic cinch the same color of your hair."

Pull the comb downwards gently to begin to separate the braid. Repeat this process, about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) inch each time until the braid is completely loose.

Excess oil can make backcombing significantly more challenging. Scrub your hair vigorously with shampoo then rinse it. [10] X Research source Also, remember – no conditioner. Conditioner will make it more difficult to backcomb your hair."

Start from the front of your head and move the hair dryer slowly towards the back. Make sure your hair is not damp in the slightest before proceeding to the next step. [11] X Research source You can dry your hair with a towel, but hair with even a small bit of moisture in it will be extremely difficult to backcomb."

Secure each one with rubber bands such that your head resembles a series of squares from which clusters of hair extend. The large the squares, the thicker your locks will be. [12] X Research source To section the hair on the back of your head easily, stand in front of a wall mirror and hold a hand mirror at an angle behind you so that you can see the back of your head.

Hold it by the tip and comb the cluster from the tip to the root with a fine-toothed metal comb. Your hair will begin to tangle up. Continue to comb your hair until the entire cluster of hair is knotted together. [13] X Research source Plastic combs are liable to break during this process so they are not recommended. [14] X Research source Secure the tip of each cluster with a rubber band. The rubber band will help the dreadlock keep its shape. [15] X Research source"

This should take 3 to 6 hours. [16] X Research source Twist each cluster of hair clockwise from the root to the tip. This will ensure that your dreadlocks are all growing in the same direction and will make maintenance easier. While back-combing you can add more texture to the hair by squeezing lemon juice onto the section and letting it dry. Citrus will de-grease the hair and damage it very slightly on the outside, which will make it more textured."

Wrap a bandana around your head when you exercise or when you go out into the rain or excessively humid weather. Moisture will prevent your hair from locking up. If your hair does get wet, air dry it for about 10 minutes, then use a blow dryer to remove all moisture. Palm roll any individual locks that have started to fray."

Your hair will begin to knot at the roots and then, over the next 3 to 6 months, lock naturally farther away from the root. As they begin to lock on their own, you can remove the rubber bands. If your hair is not locking uniformly, you can remove the rubber bands from the ones that are and keep the ones in that are not."

But if your hair is regularly kept short, stop getting your hair cut for at least 4 to 6 weeks. If your hair naturally grows slowly, it may take longer for it to grow long enough for twists. [19] X Research source As your hair grows closer to the 3 in (7.6 cm) mark, avoid the use of conditioner or other hair care products to wash your hair.

Using your thumb and forefinger, you’ll want to twist this cluster from the root to the tip. Twisting in a single direction will make maintenance easier. Repeat this process until all of your hair is in twists. This should take between 3 and 6 hours. It’s difficult but not impossible to do this by yourself.

Salons and stylists can be costly and time-consuming, so you need to find someone with real experience. [25] X Research source Find someone professionally licensed as a hair stylist.

Also, whether the stylist backcombs your hair or twists it, you'll need to block out at least 6 hours of free time max.
