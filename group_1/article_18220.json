The squash should be able to stand flat on its end. Use a sharp chef's knife with a smooth blade to shave off the outer peel. Cut the butternut squash into cubes. For most purposes, 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes work best, but you can make the cubes larger or smaller as desired. Remove the seeds and pulp as you cube the squash."

Freeze the pieces for several hours or until completely frozen solid. Make sure that the pieces are spread out in a single layer and are not touching each other. The pieces of raw butternut squash should be frozen separately, but if they are stacked or touching, they will freeze together instead. If you do not have parchment paper, wax paper will also work well."

Leave 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) empty headspace at the top of the container. As food freezes, it expands. The extra space allows the squash extra room to expand.

If desired, you could also use resealable plastic bags as long as they are freezer safe.

You can cook the squash in boiling water for 4-5 minutes or until it becomes tender. Then drain as much excess moisture from the squash pieces as possible. Put them in airtight containers.
