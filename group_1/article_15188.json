      "title": "Purchase dye made for dyeing synthetic fibers.",
      "content": "Purchase dye made for dyeing synthetic fibers. Many companies manufacture different kinds of dye based on the fabric you will be coloring. For best results, choose a dye formulated for synthetic fabrics. Regular dye may not absorb into the synthetic fibers, or may result in patchy coloring. You can find synthetic dye in craft and fabric stores as well as online. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Protect yourself and your workspace. Dye can easily stain your skin and the surfaces in your home. To avoid this, lay plastic sheeting or several layers of newspaper over your workspace. Keep paper towels handy to clean up any drips or spills, and wear old clothes or an apron as well as rubber gloves to protect your hands. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a bucket with hot water and the recommended amount of dye. Choose a bucket or basin large enough for the faux fur to fit loosely in. Read the directions on the package of dye to determine how much water and how much dye to use. Use the hottest water available from your faucet. Use a stainless steel spoon, dowel rod, or similar instrument to thoroughly combine the dye and water. [3] X Research source Avoid using a porcelain sink or tub, as the dye may stain in. Opt for plastic or stainless steel, instead. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak the faux fur in hot water for 1 hour. In order to help the dye absorb into the fibers, you’ll need to wet the fur before dyeing it. Submerge it in a tub, sink, bucket, or basin full of the hottest water available from your faucet for 1 hour to ensure all the fibers are thoroughly soaked. Then, remove the fur and wring out the excess water. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow it to soak for up to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Stir the dye bath and flip the fur over every 15 to 30 minutes to ensure the fabric evenly absorbs the color. When you flip the fur, check the color to see if you’ve reached the desired shade. [8] X Research source Keep in mind the color will fade a bit when rinsed and dried, so allow it to soak until it is a shade or two darker than you want."

Carefully take the fur out of the dye bath, then hold it over the bucket or basin for a few minutes to allow for dripping. Then, transfer the fur to a stainless steel sink or move it outside so you can use the hose to rinse it. [9] X Research source"

Ensure no other clothing items are in the dryer, even though the dye shouldn’t transfer to other items if it was rinsed thoroughly. Use a medium heat setting and run the dryer through one complete cycle. The heat will set the dye and prevent it from rubbing off.
