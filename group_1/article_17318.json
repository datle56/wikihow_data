      "content": "Fire the rubber band off your thumb.

To fire a rubber band off your thumb: Hook the rubber band around the tip of your thumb, pointing your thumb in the direction you want the rubber band to go. Point the tip of your thumb forward so it will slip off the end of your thumb easily. Grab the other end of the rubber band with your other hand, pulling it back as far as it will go. Release the rubber band with your other hand to let it fire."

      "content": "Use what you've got. If you want to get creative, use rulers, the corners of books, and other objects to fling your rubber band. Think outside the box. The tip of your glue bottle? Perfect rubber band launcher. The head of a WWE wrestling action figure? Now you're thinking. Ideally, you want to use something firm enough to stay steady when you pull the rubber band back on it, but you could also experiment with bendable objects if you want. See what works."

      "content": "Don’t aim hard objects at anyone’s face. Bummer alert: Be very careful any time you fire rubber bands or other things and make sure that you don't aim them at anyone's face. It's better not to aim rubber bands at someone at all, especially if you're in class. Firing things around the classroom in general can get you into a lot of trouble with the teacher, so be careful."

      "content": "Find a solid stick, preferably with a curve. If you want to build a simple rubber band gun, you'll need to find a great stick to do it. The best sticks will be hefty and gun-shaped, with a slight curve that you can hold like a handle. So, look around for a good stick about 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) long in total, and about an inch wide, if possible. If it looks gun-shaped, you've got a good one."

Whittle it away so you've got the clean wood underneath and spend some time sanding it down with some sandpaper. If you're going to go to the trouble to make a gun, you might as well make it look awesome."

To attach the clothes pin: Set the clothes pin on the side, so the flat side of the pinchers will be flat against the top of the barrel. Use wood glue to run a long line of glue along that side of the clothes pin. Secure it in place and hold it while the glue dries."

      "content": "Hook a rubber band between the notch and the clothes pin. To fire the gun, you'll hook the rubber band on the front of the barrel, then catch it in the clothes pin on the top of the gun. When you're ready to fire, aim the gun where you want it to go, and push the top lever on the clothes pin down. The rubber band should come loose and go flying. While it might be cool to paint your rubber band gun, you need to be extremely careful to make sure it doesn't look like a real-enough gun to get you into trouble. The last thing you need is someone to call the cops about a kid running around with a gun. Have fun, but be safe. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source"
