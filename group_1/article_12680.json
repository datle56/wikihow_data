This preference is not so much about how social you are (which is what these terms are often associated with), as much as it deals with your tendency to act. When solving a problem , do you look inward first to solve the problem or outside? [1] X Research source Extroverts find social activity energizing. They tend to enjoy socializing in groups and enjoy the excitement of parties. While they can enjoy some alone time, too much time in a calm environment can bore them. Introverts find quiet time energizing. While they can enjoy socializing (even in groups), spending time alone or one-on-one with someone special helps them recharge. They prefer quiet, peaceful environments."

Sensors are more concerned with questions of \"what,\" while Intuitives often wonder \"why.\" [2] X Research source Sensors prefer concrete detail and facts. Their focus is on facts of the present. They're more likely to say, \"I won't believe it 'til I see it.\" They tend to distrust hunches or guesses when not rooted in logic, observation, or facts. They also are better at details. They are also very conscious of their own needs. Intuitives enjoy abstract ideas and theories. They tend to have more active imaginations and like to think about future possibilities. Their thoughts revolve around patterns, connections, and flashes of insights. They may tend to daydream and be forgetful when it comes to practical details (such as remembering to eat lunch when focused on a project)."

[4] X Research source Feeling types try to look at problems from the perspective of everyone involved in an attempt to find the most balanced, harmonious solution (e.g. reach a consensus). Conflict can be very stressful to them. Thinking types tend to look for the most logical and consistent solution, perhaps measuring it up against a set of rules or assumptions."

This helps determine how you process and perceive the world around you. [5] X Research source Judging types tend to be decision-oriented and organized. They like to find resolutions and are happy to explain why. They tend to be planners who make to-do lists and enjoy getting things done ahead of deadlines. Perceiving types are more hesitant to make decisions, preferring to leave things open and keep making observations. They're slow to make choices, especially when things seem to be important. They'd rather keep things \"penciled in\" in case they find a reason to make a change. They may mix work and play and are more likely to struggle with procrastination ."

If you're close to the borderline in one or more areas, you could get different results based on how the test is worded or what your mood is that day. So, what do you do? If you get conflicting results, read up on each type and ask yourself, “Which feels more like me?” The type you resonate with most is likely your true result. Can your MBTI type change? No, your MBTI type doesn’t necessarily change overtime. Your personality or your characteristics may change, but who you are at your core and your preferences don’t. [7] X Research source"
