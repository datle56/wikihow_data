      "content": "Focus on fit. If clothes fit poorly, no matter how attractive or fashionable you will not look well-dressed. [1] X Expert Source Christina Santelli Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 22 April 2019. Tight clothes look cheap and make you look heavy. Clothes that are too large will make you look sloppy. [2] X Research source Just because you can get into the clothing does not mean it necessarily fits properly. How an item is supposed to fit depends also on styling. For instance, urban style clothing for men in the United States are often very loose fitting compared to a pair of conservative khakis. Dresses can be difficult to fit properly because most women wear different sizes in tops and bottoms. A dress fits well if the neckline lies flat whether you are sitting or standing. All seams should lay flat and straight (unless perhaps the styling is purposefully not in that way). The material shouldn't pull or pucker around the chest or hips. The garment should fit snug but not tight. [3] X Research source If you’ve gained or lost weight recently, evaluate your wardrobe. Discard or alter clothes that no longer fit correctly."

      "content": "Each individual is different, but most women fall into the apple, pear, banana, or hourglass categories. [4] X Research source Apple-shaped women carry weight around their middles. These women look best in A-line dresses and clothing that emphasize the bust and legs while de-emphasizing the waist. Pear-shaped women are smaller on top and larger in the hips and thighs. They look best in A-line dresses, layered tops, and simple, darker-colored bottoms. Banana-shaped women are slim all over. These women look good in most clothing. They can highlight their shape by wearing clothes that create curves: Flared pants, cinched waistlines, and tapered jackets accomplish this feat. Hourglass-shaped women have slim waists and full hips and breasts. They look great in tailored pieces and wrap dresses."

      "content": "Learn which colors look best on you. Look at the veins inside your wrist. Do they look green or more blue? [5] X Research source If they look green, you have a skin tone with a yellow base. Warm colors will look better on you. Try off-white, red, yellow, orange, and brown, as well as yellow-tinted greens and blues. Avoid pastels. If they look blue, you have a skin tone with a pink base. Cooler colors will look better on you. Try white, pastels, and jewel tones. When in doubt, stick to mostly neutral colors. Black, gray, and brown look fabulous on nearly everyone. Add pops of brighter color here and there – a bright blue necklace or a deep red belt, for example – to make outfits look interesting."

      "content": "Dress your problem areas appropriately. Many women have areas that they do not really like to show off--even fashion models have this issue! Also, if you are following a modest dress code or prefer to do so, buy items that do not bring focus to areas that you would rather not. For example, if you are uncomfortable showing your legs, avoid buying mini-skirts."

      "title": "Focus on classic, rather than trendy, styles.",
      "content": "Focus on classic, rather than trendy, styles. Dress your body in attractive, flattering clothes that work for your figure. Sometimes today's trends will do this, and sometimes it is wiser to not do so. Forcing yourself into certain colors, cuts, and styles because the fashion magazines are featuring them will not make you well dressed. Wear what suits you best. But be willing to experiment! You may be surprised by how a new style may flatter your appearance. Be careful about taking fashion magazines at face value. Very often, they are trying to \"sell\" you on certain styles, brands, and so on more than they are actually reporting on what is fashion. Fashion can also be very regional. What is in style in the US may not be what is cool in Brazil."

[8] X Research source If you like bright colors, wear them! Wear your charcoal skirt and cream-colored top that looks fabulous and work-appropriate, and add red kitten heels or a multi-colored bracelet. If you like bold jewelry, wear something amazing every day! Big hoop earrings can add interest to jeans and a t-shirt. A statement necklace can quickly make a basic work outfit fabulous."

It’s to compare the tremendous variety that is available, and to discover inspiring looks.

      "content": "Take calculated risks. Don't mix all kinds of crazy patterns and colors into a single outfit. But remember, it’s fine to try something new and different. The key to dressing well is to wear your clothes with confidence. Try, for example, combining neutral colors with one animal-print item -- something like a bright leopard-print blouse under a black cardigan. Alternatively, you can try wearing a risky-seeming, fashion-forward item, but keeping the rest of your look comparatively understated. If you're in love with the enormous shoulder pads you saw featured at fashion week, try them! Just pair them with something slim and neutral on the bottom, and stay away from bold accessories."

      "content": "Spend your money wisely. If your budget is smaller, start browsing at lower-priced retailers. There’s no reason to spend too much – as long as a garment is well made and fits properly, you will look fantastic. That said, you don’t necessarily want the cheapest clothing available. If it wears out after two weeks or falls apart in the washing machine, it’s no bargain. [11] X Research source Do some additional research online and try to hit stores when they are having sales. This can allow you to pick up higher-end items for bargain-basement prices. Invest in a few key pieces that you will get a lot of mileage from – like a sublime pencil skirt for work or a classic black dress. Spend less on trendier items that you won’t wear for long. Don’t be afraid to comparison shop. Before you buy something, see if an online retailer has the same item for a lower price."
