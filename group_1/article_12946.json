[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Exercise can prevent constipation and increase the speed of digestion by decreasing the amount of time food stays in the large intestine, thereby limiting the amount of water absorbed from the stool back into the body. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Movement also helps stimulate the natural contractions of the smooth muscle in the digestive tract, expediting the breakdown of food. Wait at least an hour or so after you eat before exercising in order to allow your body's natural blood supply to concentrate in the digestive system rather than fueling the heart and other active muscles."

Fiber-rich foods aid digestion in a variety of ways. Eating these foods can speed digestion by reducing constipation and maintaining general bowel health. By adding bulk to your stool, fiber-rich foods regulate digestion. They can also help reduce gas, bloating, and diarrhea. [11] X Research source Fiber works by absorbing water, adding weight and mass to your stool. For this to work, adequate (and sometimes increased) water consumption is also needed. Otherwise, constipation can occur. Some high-fiber foods include whole-grain products, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds. As a rule of thumb, an adult should eat around 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day. [12] X Expert Source Muhammad Khan, MD, MPH Board-Certified Gastroenterologist Expert Interview. 24 August 2021."
