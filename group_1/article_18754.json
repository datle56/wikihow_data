      "content": "Dog hair clings to rubber gloves like a magnet. Throw on any pair of clean rubber gloves you have at home and gently run your hands over your blanket. According to cleaning expert Jon Gholian, \"this trick attracts fur and hair\" - the hair will come off the blanket and stick to the rubber in the glove. When you’re finished cleaning, just dip the gloves in a bowl of water so the hair comes loose and floats to the surface. [3] X Research source Avoid rinsing dog hair down the drain since it could create a clog. If you rinse your hands in the sink, use a stopper and skim the hair out before draining it."
