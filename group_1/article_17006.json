      "content": "Kill your character . If your house has a bed in which you slept at least once without sleeping in any other beds since then, the easiest way for you to get back to your house is by jumping off a cliff in order to die and respawn at the house. You will have to enable Survival Mode temporarily if you're currently playing in Creative Mode . This absolutely will not work if you haven't yet slept in a bed, or if the last bed you slept in wasn't the bed in your house. If you're carrying valuable resources which you don't want to lose upon death, you can build a chest to store them and then check your coordinates by pressing F3 (desktop) or by consulting a map (console and pocket/PE editions). Upon respawning, you can travel back to the coordinates to claim your items. If you're using Java Edition and your world is set to Hardcore Mode, you can't kill your character, otherwise, you'd have to delete your world."

Unfortunately, the best bet for finding your house in most circumstances will involve retracing your steps back to a recognizable landmark and then working your way over to your house from that point. Common landmarks which may help you do this include the following: Mountains Specific biomes (e.g., Jungles) Presence of water (or lack thereof) Game-generated structures (e.g., villages)"

If your house is close to the initial spawn point, this will help you track down the house from there. Also, if you magnetize a compass to some lodestone, it will always point to that lodestone. Even if your house is nowhere near your initial spawn point, you might still benefit from using a compass since you may be able to recognize some landmarks. If you have acquired and used a lodestone on your compass, it will lead you to the lodestone's location. This is useful if your base is far from the original spawn point."

This will help find your house if the other player is near it. You can teleport in Singleplayer mode as well, but doing so requires you either to know your house's coordinates or to guess (which is unlikely to help find your house)."
