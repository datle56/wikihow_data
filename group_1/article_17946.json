Fold the bottom up and tuck the ends of the legs into the waistband. Keep inserting the fabric until the waistband forms the bottom line of the boxer briefs. Now you have a nice, flat square that’s great for packing and is unlikely to come unfolded. [4] X Research source Alternative: If you’re in a hurry, just fold the bottom edge up to the top edge of the underwear without tucking it into the waistband. It’ll still look neat and take up the same amount of space, but is more likely to come unraveled. [5] X Research source Press down on the underwear one more time to flatten them out and make sure there are no more wrinkles. You can lay these squares flat and stack them, or you can stand them up on their narrow side next to each other to see all your options at once."

Lay the underwear out flat and fold them in half from side-to-side. Then, grab the bottom edge and fold it up to the center of the underwear. Grab the waistband and fold it down so it overlaps the previous fold. This basic fold saves a bit more space than just folding in half twice, but is still fast and easy. Use this fold if the legs of your underwear are on the longer side, since the trifold will shorten them more than a bifold. [20] X Research source What is this fold good for?
