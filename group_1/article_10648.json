When you create a new project in Adobe Animate or Flash, you will see the following items on your screen: Toolbar: The toolbar contains all the drawing tools you can use to create and manipulate objects. The selection tool is used to select and move objects. The shape tool is used to create basic shapes. The brush and pencil tools are used to draw shapes free-hand. The pen tool can be used to create precision vector objects. The eraser tool is used to erase drawings you have made, and the text tool is used to add text to your animation. The toolbar also contains the Stroke and Fill color boxes, which are used to select the color of your objects. The Stroke color is the color of the outline around your shapes, and the Fill color is the color inside your shapes. The Toolbar is to the left by default. If you do not see the toolbar, click Windows in the menu bar at the top and then click Tools . Stage: The stage is the white area in the center of the screen. This is the area that will be viewable when you publish your animation. You can have objects on the stage or to the side of the stage. Objects to the side of the stage will not be viewable when you publish your animation. Timeline: The timeline is the horizontal bars at the bottom of the screen. This is where you create changes in your animation. This contains a series of rectangles that represent each frame. Every fifth frame is numbered at the top of the timeline. The timeline can have multiple layers, each containing different objects that can move independently. You will also see a red or blue vertical line. This is the playhead. You can click and drag the playhead to move forward and backward through the timeline. You can click the Play triangle at the bottom of the Timeline to preview your animation. Panels: You will see a variety of tabs and panels on the left side of Adobe Animate or Flash. This contains panels, such as the Library or the Properties panel. There are also panels for color swatches, motion presets, components and more."

      "content": "Understand the basics of tweening . Flash/Animate uses a function called tweening, which allows you to set start and end points for an object. Each starting and endpoint is called a keyframe. Flash/Animate will move and transform the object automatically from one keyframe to another. This is much simpler than the traditional method of animating objects, which requires you to move an object by hand in each frame. [1] X Research source Tweening can be used to move an object from one position to another in a straight line, rotate an object, grow or shrink an object, or a combination of these types of movements. You can use tweening and traditional frame-by-frame animation in conjunction with each other."

[2] X Research source If you want, you can draw a background image on a separate layer in the timeline. You can also import an image into Animate or Flash to use as a background. Animate and Flash are vector-based graphics programs. It is highly recommended that you use Flash/Animates's built-in drawing tools in the toolbar or import an image from a vector-drawing program, like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. Vectors can scale easily without distortion, while traditional raster images will get fuzzy and pixilated if you try to enlarge them. You can only tween one object per timeline layer at a time. So if you want to create an object with multiple moving parts, you will need to draw each moving part separately and put them on their own layer."

[3] X Research source To convert an image to a symbol, right-click the object and click Convert to Symbol . Use the drop-down menu next to \"Type\" to select Movie Clip . Then click Ok . To edit an object after it's been converted to a symbol, simply double-click on it. You will see a blank timeline at the bottom of the screen that is specific to the symbol you have selected.

This will automatically create a new keyframe on the frame you moved the object. Flash or Animate will automatically calculate the movement between the first and second keyframes. This is the basics of motion tweening in Flash and Animate. You will need to create a separate motion tween for each object that moves and for any change in the animation. Alternatively, in addition to using motion tweens to move an object, you can use the Free Transform tool to rotate an object or change its size. The Free Transform tool resembles a mouse cursor over a box. Click this option in the toolbar or press \"Q\" to select the free transform tool. You will see a bounding box around your object with a white dot in the middle. The white dot is the pivot point that your object will rotate around. You can click and drag the white dot to move the pivot point. Click and drag the small dots in the corner or side of the bounding box to adjust the size of your object. Hold Shift while dragging to keep the object shape proportional. Click and drag outside of one of the dots in the corner of the bounding box to rotate an object. Use the Properties menu to the right to adjust the ease of a motion tween. Easing in will make the motion start slow and gradually speed up. Easing out will start fast and gradually slow down. On Animate, select \"Ease In\" or \"Ease Out\" from the drop-down menu and then use the graph to adjust the ease. On Flash locate \"Ease\" in the Properties panel and enter a number between -100 and -1 to ease in and 1 to 100 to ease out. You can also use a shape tween to make an object change shape in Flash and Animate."

      "title": "Understand the basics of frame-by-frame animation.",
      "content": "Understand the basics of frame-by-frame animation. This is considered the \"traditional\" method of animation, in that each frame has the same picture but is slightly altered. When the frames are played in quick secession, the images appear to move. This is the same basic technique used in traditional hand-drawn animations and is more time-consuming than tweening. [7] X Research source By default, Flash and Animate will produce animations at 24 frames per second (FPS). That means one second of animation will have 24 frames, but not every frame has to be different. You can adjust this if you'd like, and many Flash animations use 12 FPS, but 24 will produce a much \"smoother\"-looking animation. You can use frame-by-frame animation in conjunction with motion tweening. For example, you may want to use frame-by-frame animation to animate the movement of a character's legs. But you may want to use motion tweening to make them move from one side of the stage to the other."

      "title": "Create your assets.",
      "content": "Create your assets. Because frame-by-frame animation requires multiple images with slight differences, you will need to create all of these assets by hand. You can create them all before you begin, or make them as you go using the tools in the toolbar. While creating your assets, consider all the parts that will be moving in your animation. Create a separate image for all the moving parts so that they can be placed on a separate layer in the timeline. For example, if you want to animate a character talking, it's much easier to create the character's blank face, and then create the eyes and mouth as separate assets. That way, you only have to redraw a new mouth and eyes for each frame, instead of having to draw an entirely new character for each frame."
