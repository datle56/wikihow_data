The only way to evolve a Doublade in Pokémon Sword/Shield, X/Y, or Sun/Moon is to give it a Dusk Stone; leveling it up does not evolve it into Aegislash. Just give the Dusk Stone to Doublade to begin the evolution sequence—you now have an Aegislash! [6] X Research source Giving Doublade the Dusk Stone consumes it, so you can’t use the same Dusk Stone twice. There are certain moves Doublade can learn through leveling up that Aegislash can’t. Consult a list of Doublade’s moves to figure out when you want to evolve it."
