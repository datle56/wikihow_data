      "content": "Emotional neglect is when one person in a relationship doesn’t recognize or react properly to someone else’s emotions. When it comes to romantic relationships, sharing emotions is what provides feelings of connection, love, and warmth between partners. So when one or both people in the relationship aren’t able to properly acknowledge and respond to each other’s emotions, the relationship becomes strained and distant. But emotional neglect can be hard to spot since you have to know what’s missing in order to pinpoint the problem. [1] X Research source Emotional neglect in marriage can stem from emotional neglect that occurred during a person’s childhood. [2] X Research source For instance, if your parents were neglectful of your emotions while you were growing up, you might find yourself unconsciously repeating those behaviors in your marriage, especially if you haven’t found a healthy way to cope with your past. In many cases, a person who suffered from emotional neglect as a child will have a hard time forming emotional connections with their future partner. They may unintentionally emotionally neglect their partner because they might not know how to deal with someone else’s emotions."

      "title": "Your spouse often doesn’t know how to comfort you.",
      "content": "Your spouse often doesn’t know how to comfort you. When you’re upset, frustrated, or sad, it’s natural to want to turn to your partner for support and comfort. However, a partner who’s emotionally neglectful often won’t know how to comfort you. Or, they might not be present at all and leave you to deal with the problem yourself. More often than not, they end up saying the wrong thing and leave you feeling worse. [3] X Research source For example, your partner might totally disregard your feelings and start talking about a great promotion they got when you try to vent to them about trouble you’re having at work. Or, instead of listening to you when you’re upset, they might instantly jump in and try to find a solution when you just want to talk."

      "title": "Your partner often misreads your emotions.",
      "content": "Your partner often misreads your emotions. One of the biggest signs of emotional neglect is when a partner can’t read your emotions and give you the comfort or reassurance you need. You might notice that miscommunication happens a lot between you and your partner. They may not understand your reasons for doing something, or they might misinterpret your intentions and react inappropriately. [4] X Research source For example, you might be angry at your partner for missing an important anniversary, but they might just think that you’re stressed about work and not address the issue. Or, you might be trying to hint to your partner that you want to spend more time with them, but they react inappropriately by getting annoyed at you for being “clingy.” You might feel like you can’t be yourself around your spouse because you think they’ll just misunderstand you."

      "content": "You feel lonely within your relationship. Even though your partner is right there, you might feel like there’s a huge distance separating the two of you. People in healthy relationships often feel like they can turn to their partner whenever things get tough, but you don’t feel that way. In fact, when something’s troubling you, you might be more likely to go to a friend or family member rather than your spouse since you know they won’t be able to give you the support you need. [5] X Research source You may not feel like you and your partner are a team who have each other’s backs. Instead, you might feel like you have to solve all of your problems on your own. For example, if you run into trouble at work, your instinct might be to hide that information from your spouse right up until you absolutely need to tell them. You might even prefer being alone than with your partner since being with them can be frustrating and unfulfilling."

      "content": "Your spouse tends to avoid conflict. Your partner might avoid bringing up issues and topics that can lead to a big, emotional argument. Instead, they’re more likely to give you the silent treatment and ignore the problem (and you) until you eventually drop the issue. [6] X Research source If you do end up arguing, it may not be the most productive, and they still might not fully address your feelings. [7] X Research source For example, they might just simply walk out of the room when you say “We need to talk.” If you do get into an argument, your partner still might not understand why you’re frustrated. They may end up getting defensive and say things like “Why are you even angry at me?” or “I didn’t even do anything. You’re being ridiculous.”"

      "title": "Your partner avoids intimate and emotional conversations.",
      "content": "Your partner avoids intimate and emotional conversations. Your spouse might find it hard to have these deeper conversations with you. When they try and talk about their emotions, you might notice that they don’t possess a very extensive vocabulary to describe their feelings. You might also notice that they appear awkward or uncomfortable when you express positive emotions toward them. For example: [8] X Research source They might use very basic words to describe their own emotions, like “good,” “bad,” or “nice.” When your partner senses things are about to get emotional, they might duck out with an excuse, such as having work to do or wanting to sleep. They might look uncomfortable when you tell them “I love you.”"

      "content": "Conversations between you and your spouse tend to be very surface-level. If your partner isn’t willing to delve into deeper and more emotional topics, that might leave you with very little to talk about during the day. For example, when you sit down for dinner, you might spend most of your time eating in silence or talking about small things like the weather or how your day went, but nothing beyond that. [9] X Research source You might realize that you know very little about your spouse, such as things about their childhood, their relationship with their parents, or what their dreams are for the future."

      "title": "Talk to your partner about your honest feelings.",
      "content": "Talk to your partner about your honest feelings. While directly confronting your spouse and having a serious conversation about their neglect can be a scary thought, it’s one of the most effective ways to avoid any misunderstandings and get your feelings off your chest. Wait until you’re feeling calm and collected and take time to plan out what you want to say. When you do talk, be clear and concise with what you want, such as by saying things like “When I’m upset, I just want you to listen to what I have to say” or “I want us to check in with each other every day.” [10] X Research source What to do: Be compassionate towards your partner when you talk to them. Even though they may be neglecting your emotions, still take their emotions and personal struggles into account when you tell them about how you’re feeling. For example, say something like “I know things can get overwhelming for you and that you don’t mean to hurt me. But when you leave in the middle of a conversation, it’s frustrating for me.”"

      "content": "Step away from the victim role with \"I\" statements. In any given conversation, \"you\" statements (\"You make me feel unwanted when you don't respond to my texts\") tend to put people on the defensive and aren't very productive. Instead, use \"I\" statements to communicate your feelings without playing the blame game. Instead of being the victim, you're simply communicating your thoughts in a respectful way. [11] X Research source What to do: Center your thoughts on your experiences alone rather than the role your spouse played in them, like \"I feel as though I am unwanted when I send messages that receive no replies.\""

      "content": "Listen to what your spouse has to say. It’s just as important to listen to your partner’s side of the story as it is to tell them your honest feelings. There’s always a possibility that there’s a reason why they act the way they do. For example, to them, you might give off signs that you want to be alone when you’re upset, so they think they’re respecting your wishes when they leave you alone. [12] X Research source What to do: Do your best to listen without judging or jumping to conclusions. Hear them out until the end, and then gently correct any misunderstandings if there are any."

      "content": "Childhood emotional neglect If a person is emotionally neglected by their parents throughout their childhood, they might unintentionally repeat these behaviors and emotionally neglect their partner. Childhood emotional neglect may cause a person to become overly self-reliant and make it hard for them to respond to and recognize others’ emotions. Because of this, they may end up being emotionally distant from their partner.

Go to source Childhood emotional neglect can also cause a person to experience symptoms of depression or anxiety, or it might lead them to feel very insecure in their future relationships.

For example, they may cheat on their partner with someone else and give all of their time and attention to this new person."
