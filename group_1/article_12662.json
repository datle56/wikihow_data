Use algebra to rearrange the equation in the form of y = k x {\\displaystyle y=kx} . If you can’t rewrite the equation in this form, the variables are not directly proportional. If you can, it proves that they are directly proportional. [2] X Research source For example, if you multiply both sides of the equation y x = 3 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {y}{x}}={\\frac {3}{2}}} by x {\\displaystyle x} , the equation becomes y = 3 2 x {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {3}{2}}x} , which is in the form of y = k x {\\displaystyle y=kx} , with 3 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{2}}} being the constant."
