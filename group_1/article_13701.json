Position the middle of your calves on top of the ball so you’re bending at the hips. Make sure you keep your lower back flat against the floor. Leave some room between your thighs and the ball so you can properly perform the exercise. [3] X Research source The exercise ball adds more resistance to the exercise so you develop better body control. [4] X Expert Source Landis Owens Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 8 June 2021. If you want to work your core even harder, only rest your feet on top of the exercise ball instead. Get an exercise ball that’s the proper size for your body. If you’re between 5’1”–5’7” (155–170 cm), get a 21 in (53 cm) ball. If you’re 5’8”–6’1” (173–185 cm), then get a ball that’s 25.5 in (65 cm). For people 6’1” (188 cm) or taller, get a 29.5 in (75 cm) ball. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"
