      "title": "The 🤦 (facepalm) emoji can mean someone feels embarrassed.",
      "content": "The 🤦 (facepalm) emoji can mean someone feels embarrassed. When you feel embarrassed about something, one natural reaction is to hide your face in your hands, like you’re cringing away from the situation. Thus, the 🤦 (facepalm) emoji symbolizes embarrassment when used in text messages, whether it’s your embarrassment or secondhand on behalf of someone else. [1] X Research source “Oh shoot, my bad! Meant to send that last text to my mom. 🤦” “Got to watch Tom spill his drink ALL over himself in public today. 🤦”"

      "title": "The 🤦 (facepalm) emoji also symbolizes frustration or exasperation.",
      "content": "The 🤦 (facepalm) emoji also symbolizes frustration or exasperation. Ever feel the urge to shake your head or facepalm when you see someone else's astonishing incompetence? The 🤦 emoji can convey that feeling of frustration in messages, whether you’re talking about a person or situation that was particularly vexing. [2] X Research source “Nobody in my office gets stuff done but me, I swear! 🤦” “Sheesh. We’ve done like 10 video calls, and Riley still doesn’t know how Skype works. 🤦”"

      "title": "🤦‍♀️ (Woman facepalming) and 🤦‍♂️ (man facepalming) mean the same thing.",
      "content": "🤦‍♀️ (Woman facepalming) and 🤦‍♂️ (man facepalming) mean the same thing. You may also see the 🤦‍♀️ and 🤦‍♂️ emojis in place of the regular 🤦 (facepalm) emoji in texts, but the only difference between them is their depiction of gender. The 🤦‍♀️ emoji is designed to look feminine, and the 🤦‍♂️ emoji is meant to look masculine, while the 🤦 emoji is more gender-neutral. [3] X Research source “Can’t believe I actually bought my sister’s dumb lie. 🤦‍♀️” “Wait, am I the only one who didn’t know we had a club meeting today? 🤦‍♂️” Use any of the emojis interchangeably since they all mean the same thing! You could choose one on your gender identity or just use the one that you prefer at the moment. The 3 different emojis also have a series of different color options, which you can select based on your own skin and hair color (🤦🏻🤦🏼🤦🏽🤦🏾🤦🏿) or use the default yellow."

      "title": "Be supportive (or laugh) when someone tells their embarrassing story.",
      "content": "Be supportive (or laugh) when someone tells their embarrassing story. Depending on the tone of their text, they might be feeling seriously embarrassed and in need of some sympathy, or they might be able to laugh at their bumble. In most cases, offering some friendly support is the best way to respond! Alternatively, if their message has a “LOL” or a 😂 (laughing) emoji in it, laugh along with them. Them: “Did that thing where I didn’t hear someone, so I asked her to repeat herself, and when she did I STILL didn’t hear. So I just smiled and nodded like a fool. 🤦” You: “Aw, I hate when that happens! I bet she didn’t notice, though.”"

      "title": "React to an embarrassing story with a 🤦 (facepalm) of your own.",
      "content": "React to an embarrassing story with a 🤦 (facepalm) of your own. After hearing an embarrassing story about someone, your knee-jerk reaction might be to send a 🤦 emoji in response—and that’s totally fine! Alternatively, you could write “SMH” (shaking my head), which has a similar meaning, or send a facepalm meme (like the infamous Star Trek facepalm meme) if you want to get a little creative. [4] X Research source Them: “So, Mark and Alex just broke up in the middle of a busy restaurant—and a bunch of us were WITH them. 🤦” You: “Yikes! That sounds suuuper uncomfortable! SMH. 🤦”"

      "title": "Sympathize with someone who expresses their frustration to you.",
      "content": "Sympathize with someone who expresses their frustration to you. When it’s clear that someone else is feeling frustrated about something, a bit of sympathy can go a long way! You might also be able to offer some advice, but make sure you only offer if they ask for it first. Otherwise, be their supportive sounding board. Them: “Listening to my dad talk is SO frustrating sometimes. 🤦” You: “I’m sorry to hear that! 😕 Is anything in particular bothering you right now?”"

      "title": "Use it with the 😳 (flushed face) emoji to convey embarrassment.",
      "content": "Use it with the 😳 (flushed face) emoji to convey embarrassment. Sure, the 🤦 emoji already evokes a feeling of embarrassment, but you can always tack on the 😳 emoji to really emphasize how you’re feeling. [5] X Research source Since the 😳 emoji also communicates surprise, you could pair it with the 🤦 emoji when something super surprising (and a bit embarrassing) happens. “My family got the restaurant to sing “Happy Birthday” for me. It was fun but a little embarrassing seeing everyone stare at us! 🤦‍♀️😳” “I totally spaced at my meeting today! I’ve never felt so embarrassed! 😳🤦‍♂️”"

      "title": "Pair a 🤦 with any emoji that depicts your embarrassing situation.",
      "content": "Pair a 🤦 with any emoji that depicts your embarrassing situation. There’s a pretty big emoji library at your disposal these days! So, for any embarrassing moment that might come up, there’s probably an emoji that could help you describe it. For example, if you felt embarrassed about trying to push a door when you were supposed to pull it, you could always add a 🚪 (door) emoji to your text. “Definitely got stuck in a revolving door today, like a pro. 🤦🚪” “That’s the last time I eat beans on a date! I may have had some gas. 🫘🤦💨”"
