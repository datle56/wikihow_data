      "title": "Smash the olive with the flat side of a knife if you’re at home.",
      "content": "Smash the olive with the flat side of a knife if you’re at home. Similar to crushing a clove of garlic, set your olive on a cutting board and use the flat side of a broad knife to smash the olive until you feel the pit resisting the knife. Then simply use your fingers to pull the pit away from the meat of the olive. Discard the pit and enjoy the olive. [1] X Research source If you’re out at a restaurant or party, avoid this trick as the oils might squirt onto someone nearby, or the olive might go flying if you smash it at a weird angle."

      "title": "Eat around the pit of the olive if you’re at a party or restaurant.",
      "content": "Eat around the pit of the olive if you’re at a party or restaurant. Even if the olive is large and it seems like it might be easier to bite into it and remove the pit before eating the rest of it, resist doing so. Instead, put the entire olive into your mouth and chew around the pit. [2] X Research source Etiquette coaches discourage nibbling on olives."

    {
      "title": "Push the pit between the tines of your fork if you have one.",
      "content": "Push the pit between the tines of your fork if you have one. After you’ve chewed around the pit, put the tip of your fork into your mouth and use your tongue to push the pit between the tines. Remove the fork from your mouth and place the pit on the side of your plate. [3] X Research source Putting the pit between the tines keeps it secure while you’re taking it out of your mouth. Simply resting the pit on top of the tines could be problematic because the pit could easily fall off of the fork."

    {
      "title": "Take the pit from your mouth with your fingers if you don’t have a fork.",
      "content": "Take the pit from your mouth with your fingers if you don’t have a fork. Either pluck the pit from your mouth with your thumb and forefinger, or cover your mouth with one hand and remove the pit discreetly. [4] X Research source Avoid spitting your pit directly into a cocktail napkin or your hand—there is a good chance that the pit might go bouncing somewhere it shouldn’t be. After you’ve finished snacking, it’s a good idea to wash your hands before touching anything else."

      "title": "Place the pit in a cocktail napkin, on your plate, or in a pit bowl.",
      "content": "Place the pit in a cocktail napkin, on your plate, or in a pit bowl. Regardless of the method you used to remove the pit, make sure it ends up in an appropriate place. Avoid holding pits in your hand or dropping them on the floor. [5] X Research source If you’re at a party and there isn’t a pit bowl, forks, or napkins, look around to see what others are doing with their disposables, like olive pits and toothpicks, and follow their lead."

      "content": "Pick deep-purple kalamata olives for a salty, vinegar-heavy option. Kalamata olives are usually preserved in vinegar and oil, which is what gives them their bitter, biting taste. They’re often used in different dips and in mediterranean dishes, like couscous and hummus. [6] X Research source Kalamata olives are also almost always served with the traditional Greek salad."

      "content": "Choose the manzanilla for a green olive usually stuffed with pimentos. These green olives are generally very bitter with a slightly smoky flavor, so the pimento (a type of sweet, red pepper) is added to curb that bitterness. Manzanilla olives stuffed with pimentos are often used to make tapenade. [8] X Research source The manzanilla comes from Spain and is cured with brine rather than oil."
