      "content": "Mix sambuca, whiskey, and bitters to make a Sambuca Sazerac. Pour ice into a mixing glass and add 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of overproof bourbon whiskey and 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of sambuca. Then add 4 dashes of bitters and stir the ingredients together. Finally, use a strainer to strain the cocktail into a small rocks glass with ice. [1] X Research source Add 2 twists of lemon peel to the top of the drink for a zesty garnish. You can use other forms of whiskey besides bourbon for this drink, though you should make sure that the drink you use has a relatively high proof so that its flavor isn’t totally masked by that of the sambuca."

      "title": "Add sparkling wine to sambuca, lemon juice, and simple syrup.",
      "content": "Add sparkling wine to sambuca, lemon juice, and simple syrup. Place ice inside a cocktail shaker and add 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of sambuca, 0.5 fluid ounces (15 mL) of lemon juice, and 0.25 fluid ounces (7.4 mL) of simple syrup. Shake the ingredients together and then use a strainer to strain them into a champagne flute. Finally, add a long, skinny lemon peel to the cocktail and then top the whole thing off with 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) of sparkling wine. [3] X Research source Make sure you add the lemon peel before you add the sparkling wine, as pouring in the wine without the lemon peel already in the cocktail will cause it to bubble up too fast. You can also add a brandied cherry to the drink as a final garnish. You may see this drink referred to as a “Sambuca 75,” as it’s a variation of an established cocktail known as the “French 75.”"
