Setting up a profile on apps like Tinder , Bumble , or Hinge is a great way to showcase your personality in a low-stakes virtual setting. Getting to know your matches via a screen may lessen your nerves and allow you to figure out who you’re attracted to, who you’re most compatible with, and what you’d like your relationship to look like. No matter which dating app you use, be sure to adjust your preferences accordingly. Make an effort not to focus too much on looks. Instead, try to be realistic, open-minded, and kind in your search. Since you’ve never had a girlfriend before, you may not even have a “type.” So, while physical attraction is important, challenge yourself not to rule anyone out based on looks if it seems like you have tons in common!"

      "content": "Present yourself in the best light. Dating coach Lisa Shield notes how important it is for you to promote yourself in the most favorable way when finding your first girlfriend. She recommends that your photos are recent and represent your interests well. Shield says that “your pictures are a good 75-80% of the equation. A lot of people post party pictures of them out drinking, which isn’t the best.” Additionally, Shield encourages you to make a profile that is conversational and full of opportunities for a potential match to chime in with comments and questions. Shield shares an exercise that she asks her clients to do: “Start out by writing 10 adjectives that you think would best describe you [and] that would make you attractive to others.” Then, she asks you to explain why those adjectives are important to you and how you embody them. This is a fun and creative way to describe yourself on your dating profile."

Dating coach Maria Avgitidis believes dating apps are a great way to meet people, as long as you actually meet the people. She says, “When you're online dating, you should be only using it as a tool to get offline. Your conversation should not turn into a pen pal conversation.” Avgitidis suggests 2-3 days of chatting before meeting in real life and suggests leaving the more in-depth conversations for then. Avgitidis also recommends you ask questions that come up naturally, like, “What are you doing this weekend? What did you do last summer?” “Let it be organic more than anything,” Avgitidis advises. Dating coach Connell Barrett offers a template for asking for a girl’s phone number and taking your convo off the app: “Say, ‘I really enjoyed messaging you, you're funny, and you love Bill Murray movies just like me, let's get off this app and grab a drink—what's your number?’”"

Dating coach Joshua Pompey has a few suggestions to help enhance your sense of self: “No matter who you are in life, there's always room for improvement,” he begins. “Something as simple as getting some new clothes, looking a little bit more stylish, getting the right haircut, doing whatever it takes to feel your most physically attractive— that's really important.” Stand tall, look her in the eye, and talk about all of the things you love in your life to show her that you’re a confident guy who is worth knowing. [1] X Research source Another way to develop your confidence is to make sure to spend time with people who actually make you feel good about yourself. If your friends are always putting you down, then it’s time to consider finding a new group of more supportive people. Pompey adds that having conversations with random people is a huge step toward building confidence. He says, “If I go get a cup of coffee in the morning, and I have a two-second conversation with someone, or I ask a stranger what time it is, it helps to get in the habit of initiating little conversations with people, which in turn makes you realize that people aren't that scary when you approach them nicely.” Pompey divulges that once you get comfortable talking to strangers, the act of talking to women will slowly start to feel more natural. The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll get."

If you can think of a hobby, there’s usually a Facebook group for it! [2] X Research source If you see someone you like out in the wild, don’t be shy. Just say hi, introduce yourself, and start a nice, easy conversation. You don’t need to ask her a million questions about herself right away. Instead, work on starting a light, easy conversation on simple topics like weekend plans, movies, or current events. The most important thing is that you make eye contact and care about what she has to say. If and when the moment feels right, ask her out on a date!

Open body language, like mirroring your gestures, is a good sign that she’s into you. If you feel comfortable asking your crush out on a date without a preliminary hangout, go for it!

The first date doesn’t have to be expensive or extravagant, but it should be thoughtful. [4] X Research source If she’s into animals, you can plan a date to a petting zoo or animal sanctuary.

If you’ve noticed really cool artwork at her place, you can compliment her eye for art and strike up a conversation about that, too. [5] X Research source According to Barrett, a good compliment is all about authenticity and depth. For instance, telling her that she has a great sense of style might be better than telling her how great her body looks in a certain dress.

Take the time to get to know her by asking her questions about her interests and her opinions, showing her that you value what she has to say.

Here are a few ways to get her to chuckle: [6] X Research source Flirt with her. Be playful, give her a gentle push on the arm or shoulder, and tease her in a friendly way.

While having a girlfriend may involve merging your lives a bit more, you’re not there yet, so make sure you have your own hobbies and friends so that she isn’t your main source of company or entertainment. If you’re in a group setting, it’s nice to give her some extra attention, but that doesn’t mean you have to single her out too much, either. Try to socialize with other people, as well. When it comes to calling and texting, let her put in the effort and initiative from time to time.

[7] X Research source There’s no specific amount of time that you need to spend with her before you ask her to be your girlfriend. If you want to ask her after spending just a few weeks together, that’s fine, too, as long as you’ve had some time to get to know each other and you see potential.

I'm having such a great time, and I don't want to be dating anybody else right now. I want to find out if you feel the same.’” If she’s on the same page as you, think of a thoughtful and creative way to make it official. Set up a date in a nice, quiet place where you’re not likely to be interrupted. [8] X Research source Consider writing her a card or bringing her flowers or chocolates. Try to make the experience as romantic as possible. This is your first girlfriend, so you want it to be special for you both! Ask her to be your girlfriend.

Hug her, smooch her, and let her see how excited you are about your future together. However, if she says she’d just like to keep it casual or simply be friends, there’s no need to be rude or mean. Instead, just be polite and respectful, making sure to part on good terms. This will leave her with a good impression of you, and you can be proud of yourself for responding in a dignified manner. When dealing with rejection, Shield remarks on the importance of having a good support system. If she says no to being your girlfriend, it’s normal to feel down and out about it. Try to lean on family and friends who have your back and lead with positivity. Other ways of dealing with rejection include allowing yourself time to grieve, reframing the rejection as an opportunity for growth, and focusing on hobbies you enjoy. Remember: there’s plenty of fish in the sea. Just because this one girl wasn’t ready to be your first girlfriend, it doesn't mean that the next one won’t be! According to Avgitidis, you can’t make someone love you or choose you. What you can do is keep trying to find your right match by being a great listener, asking good questions, and making whoever you’re with feel good when they're around you."
