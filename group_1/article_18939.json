      "content": "Loot Heavy cores can be obtained from ominous vaults in trial chambers. There's a 7.25% chance that an ominous vault will have a heavy core inside of it, so you might not find one on your first try. [1] X Research source To open an ominous vault, you must obtain an ominous trial key from the trial chamber as well. The trial ominous spawner inside the trial chamber has a 30% chance of giving an ominous trial key. [2] X Research source Note: the items cycling inside the vault do not affect what item drops when you open it. Trial chambers are found underground in the overworld. The starting room of a trial chamber is generated between Y=-40 and -20, but the entire structure usually exists between Y=-20 and 0. [3] X Research source If you're not sure where the nearest trial chamber is, you can enter your world seed in Chunkbase's seed map viewer to see where the trial chambers are located in your world. If you don't know how to find the seed of your world, check out this wikiHow article. Besides heavy cores, ominous vaults can also give you the following items: [4] X Research source Emeralds (56.2% chance) Wind charge (47.4% chance) Arrow of Slowness IV (37.5% chance) Diamond (26.4% chance) Nothing (25% chance) Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template (22.5% chance) Enchanted Golden Apple (22.5% chance) Flow Banner Pattern (15% chance) Ominous Bottle III - V (13.9% chance) Block of Emerald (13.8% chance) Enchanted Crossbow (11% chance) Block of Iron (11% chance) Golden Apple (8.3% chance) Enchanted Diamond Axe (8.3% chance) Enchanted Diamond Chestplate (8.3% chance) Music Disc (Creator) (7.5% chance) Enchanted Book (5.5% chance) Block of Diamond (2.8% chance) On average, you'll need to loot about 13 ominous vaults before you find one heavy core (though you may have to open less or more to actually find one, depending on RNG)."

      "title": "Mining",
      "content": "Mining If you find a heavy core block outside of a trial chamber, you can mine it. Any tool works (even by hand), but a pickaxe is recommended as it's the fastest. A heavy core block will always drop itself when it's broken. Without any Efficiency or Haste enchantments, refer to the following list to see how long it will take to break a heavy core block with your pickaxe: Wooden Pickaxe: 7.5 seconds Stone Pickaxe: 3.75 seconds Iron Pickaxe: 2.5 seconds Diamond Pickaxe: 1.9 seconds Netherite Pickaxe: 1.7 seconds Golden Pickaxe: 1.25 seconds Heavy cores don't naturally generate, so you won't find one just wandering around in the wild. However, you can always take one that you've already placed (or steal one from another player)."

      "title": "Mace",
      "content": "Mace The main use of a heavy block is for crafting a mace. To craft a mace, you'll need one heavy core and one breeze rod. Place the heavy core in the top middle square in the crafting grid, then place the breeze rod in the center square in the crafting grid to craft a mace. [5] X Research source Breeze rods are dropped by Breeze mobs. [6] X Research source There is a 100% chance that a Breeze will drop at least one breeze rod when killed. Breezes are found in trial chambers, so you'll likely gather plenty of breeze rods before you find a heavy core. [7] X Research source You can use any extra breeze rods to craft wind charges, or you can hold onto them to repair your mace. The mace is a powerful weapon in Minecraft. When wielding the mace, you'll do more damage if you fall a long distance before hitting your enemy. [8] X Research source This pairs perfectly with the Density enchantment . To repair a mace, you can either combine two damaged maces together to add their remaining durability together, or you can use the anvil to combine a damaged mace and a breeze rod. [9] X Research source One breeze rod will restore 25% of the mace's durability."

      "content": "Note block If you place a heavy core under a note block, it will create a snare drum sound. Note blocks can be mined from ancient cities, or you can craft one with 8 planks and 1 redstone dust. [10] X Research source Note blocks play a sound when they are attacked, used, or activated by redstone components ."

      "title": "Decoration",
      "content": "Decoration The most practical use of the heavy core block is for making maces, but you can always use them as decoration around your base. If you want to pick up a heavy core block after placing it, simply mine it with any tool (though a pickaxe is preferred). Silk touch is not required to mine heavy core blocks."
