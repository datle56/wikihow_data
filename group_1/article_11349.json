      "content": "Mark the tile where it needs to be cut. Measure the space you need to fit a tile into using a tape measure. Mark the places you need to cut the tile with a pencil. You only need a small marking, as you’ll use another tile as your straight edge for cutting. If you cannot see the pencil marks, try using a washable pen or marker."

      "title": "Score the vinyl tile with a utility knife.",
      "content": "Score the vinyl tile with a utility knife. Use a piece of ceramic tile to weight down the vinyl tiles and use as a straightedge. Make an “X” on it in permanent marker so that you don’t accidentally install it, as it may get nicked or banged up. Line up the edge of the extra tile with the mark on the other tile where you need to make a cut. Firmly run your knife down the edge of the extra tile to score the piece that needs trimming. [1] X Research source If you don’t cut all the way through the tile the first time, repeat the process taking care to make the second score line directly over top of the first. You can also soften the tile with a heat gun to make precise cuts. Wear work gloves while working with a utility knife and cut slowly away from your hand."

      "content": "Adjust the depth of the blade by turning the screws. Twist the screws on either side of the top of the cutter to raise or lower the blade so that the tile will fit neatly under it. The blade doesn’t need to touch the tile at this point, as moving the handle will lower the blade. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Press the handle down. Firmly move the handle from the upright position down toward the base of the cutter. You can do this step quickly or slowly, just make sure to press the handle all the way to the lowered position so that the blade cuts through the entire tile.
