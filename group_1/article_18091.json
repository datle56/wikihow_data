It might be tempting to try to deny your pain, or to hold onto hope that you and your ex will get back together. Go easy on yourself for wanting to delay an onslaught of grief, but try to accept that the relationship is over , and that it really, really hurts. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A large part of this acceptance is forgiveness. Forgive your partner or yourself for the problems that led to the split. You are both only human. Consider working a journaling or meditating practice into your morning. They can be really helpful ways to mentally process your breakup and practice sitting with your grief. They're also both proven methods for alleviating stress and making you feel calmer.

But at this point, being reminded of your time together can lead to intense nostalgia, sadness, and regret. Get rid of things in your life that remind you of your relationship, at least temporarily. [4] X Research source Items that remind you of your ex might include any of their possessions that they left with you, gifts they gave you, music or mixtapes they made for you, and pictures, drawings, or artwork that reminds you of your ex. If there are items you can't stand to throw away, try packing them into boxes and keeping them somewhere out of the way for the near future. You might even give the items to a close friend and ask them to tuck them away for safekeeping."

It could also tempt you to fall into old habits of flirting and relying on your ex for emotional support. Unless you're 100% certain that you can stay \"just friends\" with your ex (and they are also 100% sure), avoid seeing your ex as much as you can for at least a month or 2. When you are forced to see this person, keep your conversations as short and polite as possible. [5] X Research source This advice applies to your technological connections as well. Consider unfriending or blocking them on social media (at least for the time being), and remove their number from your phone to reduce the temptation to text.

After a breakup, it's easy to fall into negative thought patterns and become overly critical of yourself, or to just struggle with loneliness.

Coming to terms with this can be difficult — some people are deathly afraid of letting go. However, you can't truly move on with your life until you start thinking more about today than about when you were with the person you used to love. Realize your past, including your relationship, doesn't define you.

Mindfulness involves becoming aware of your thoughts—that is, acknowledging them as you experience them—and accepting them—in other words, not judging yourself for having them.

Your happiness isn't determined by what happened in the past — it's determined by what you have in store for the future.

After a difficult breakup, it's usually wise to swear off romance for a few months to avoid the emotional problems that can often come with \"rebound\" flings. So do not jump into a new relationship right away if you haven't let yourself grieve and heal yet.However, once you've taken some time off, it's okay to look at, talk to, and like someone new. It might even be fun and a boost to your self-esteem! [14] X Research source Considering new romantic prospects may feel a little painful or awkward at first. This is totally normal, but it'll fade in time. Remember, you're essentially going through a kind of withdrawal from the person that you constantly talked to and saw before.

You'll basically \"forget\" to be sad. When this happens, take it as a major accomplishment. You did it! The rest of your life awaits. This isn't to say that you need to stop thinking about this person altogether. You can hold memories of this person dear in your heart.

[16] X Research source Time may gradually heal the wound , but that doesn’t mean a licensed therapist can’t help you unpack the trauma of the breakup. Reach out to a counselor if you’re having trouble managing your grief on your own. Lots of people struggle to find the time to add a therapy session into their week, but lots of therapist do remote therapy as well, including counselors on Better Help . Find a therapist that works for you, and don’t be afraid to switch therapists if you try one and they aren’t a good fit. Breakups are often deeper than the actual relationships and can work as a trigger, bringing up issues from your past. A therapist will help you understand what the relationship actually meant for you and put the breakup in perspective."
