If you’re currently rocking a crew cut, we’ve got bad news: fluffy hair isn’t in your immediate future unless you want to use a wig. The good news is it probably won’t take too long to get your hair to the right length, and if you’ve already got longer hair, awesome! You can skip this step, obviously. On the other hand, if your hair is a lot longer than this, you can still get fluffy hair—it just won’t be the fluffy hair: the fluffy hair trend focuses primarily on hair that’s a couple of inches long, so you’ll need to get a trim.

Once you’ve cut or grown out your hair to be about 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm), or had your stylist give you the look, you’ll still need to style it every day or so. Start by washing your hair and patting it with a microfiber towel so that it’s damp, but not soaking wet. [5] X Research source A terry cloth towel will do, but be careful not to rub your hair aggressively with the towel—this is how you damage your hair and take it from fluffy to frizzy."

Just wrap a few ringlets of your hair around the iron at a time for 10 to 30 seconds.

Apply a coin-sized amount to your fingertip, rub it in between your hands, and then scrunch up your hair using your hands. Once you’ve gotten your hair how you want it, you’re good to go. A coin-sized amount is a guesstimate—you can use more or less as needed.

Whether you’re going for the fluffy hair look that’s all over social media or you just want to add some volume to your hair, it’s easy to do on your own. After you wash your hair, bend over and use a blow-dryer to dry your hair. Drying it upside-down will lift your roots and give your hair more volume and movement. As you dry, run your fingers or a detangling brush through your hair to eliminate any knots and frizz. Before adding any type of heat, use a blow-dry spray to lock in moisture and ensure your hair has a smooth finish when you’re done."

Start with the locks on the top of your head: wrap a small section of hair around a roller, and lock it in place with a hair pin. [9] X Research source Leave the rollers in for about 15 to 20 minutes. If your hair is thicker or silkier, you may need to leave the curlers in a little longer. Once your hair is curled, run your fingers through it a few times and then apply hairspray to preserve your curls."

You can leave your top layer of hair un-teased to ensure your hair has plenty of volume, but still looks smooth on top. Your hair may look pretty wild when you're done teasing it. If it does, you can tame it by gently re-combing the top layer of your hair to make your hairdo look more cohesive and intentional.
