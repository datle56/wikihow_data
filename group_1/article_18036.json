      "title": "Write on the envelope",
      "content": "Write on the envelope . If you are handwriting the recipient’s information on the envelope, do this before you insert the letter so that you don’t leave dents in the paper. If you want your letter to look more professional, you can use your printer to print out the address on the envelope. You should write the recipient’s address on the front of the envelope in the center (e.g. if you are in the US: name, address, city, state, and zip code), as well as the return address (your name, address, city, state, and zip code) in the top left hand corner."

      "title": "Place the letter face up on a table.",
      "content": "Place the letter face up on a table. Before you fold the letter, check that the address on the letter and the address on the envelope correspond. Double check that you have signed the letter. The text should be facing up towards you as though you were reading it."

      "title": "Fold the bottom part of the letter up.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom part of the letter up. Take the bottom edge of the page. Fold it up and over so that the bottom edge lines up about one third the way up the page. [1] X Research source If you aren’t sure how much this is, take your envelope and place it underneath the middle of your letter to use as a guide."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check that the edges are lined up.",
      "content": "Check that the edges are lined up. Before you crease the fold, make sure that the outside edges of the letter all line up perfectly to avoid crooked creases. If the edges aren’t lined up properly, your fold will be crooked and your letter may not fit into the envelope. Once you are sure they are lined up, use your finger to crease the fold carefully."

      "title": "Fold the top part down.",
      "content": "Fold the top part down. Now take the top part of the letter and fold it downwards so that there is about half an inch (about 1 cm) of space between the bottom crease and the top (folded down) edge of the letter. [2] X Research source Again, use your envelope as a guide if you aren’t sure. When your envelope is lying underneath the letter you can check to make sure that it will fit inside by lining up the top and bottom creases of the letter with the top and bottom of the envelope."

    {
      "title": "Crease the top fold.",
      "content": "Crease the top fold. Don’t forget to line up the top part of the fold with the edges of the page. This will give you a nice clean and straight fold. You can hold a ruler sideways between your fingers and slide the thin edge of the ruler along the paper to create a flat and crisp crease if you want to."

[3] X Research source Hold the envelope so that the flap of the envelope faces you, and opens towards you. Place the letter carefully into the envelope so as not to dent the page. The recipient should be able to remove the letter and open it without having to turn it right-side up to read it."

If you are using an envelope that has a see-through “window\" where the recipient’s name and address will show through, it is very important that you have the letter formatted so that this information lines up correctly. [4] X Research source To format a business letter, you should first ensure that your margins are set at 1 inch (2.5 cm) on all sides in your word processor. Make sure that you have the text aligned to the left hand side of the page while you are typing the date and the recipient’s address. The letter should be single spaced except for in-between paragraphs. Between paragraphs there should be two spaces. The entire letter should be left aligned. There should be approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) of blank space from the top of the page to the place where you type the first line of text (the date). Type the date out in full (e.g. April 1, 2016 instead of 4/1/16). Hit enter two times so that you have a blank space between the date and where you will type the recipient’s information. Type the full name of the recipient (e.g. Mr. John Doe), hit enter and type the address of the recipient, hit enter again and type the city, state, and zip code of the recipient. Be sure to include a space between the recipient’s contact information and the salutation ."

[5] X Research source This version of folding doesn’t afford the same privacy as folding the letter inwards, but it must be folded this way if you want the name and address to show through the window. If the letter contains sensitive information, it may be best to use a standard envelope with no window."
