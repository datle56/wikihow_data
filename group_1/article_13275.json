You can also get a feel of where the jeans would wear down naturally, like around your knees. [1] X Research source Any pair of denim jeans will work, as long as you don't mind altering them!"

      "content": "Use a washable marker to mark where you want to distress. Draw lines to mark where you want the top and bottom of the holes you want to make. Focus on areas that would wear down naturally, like the knees, over the front and back pockets, and the upper thigh. [2] X Research source The size of the holes you make is completely up to you."

      "content": "Take off your jeans and place them on a flat surface. This will be your workstation. You can use any kind of sturdy surface, like a shoebox, a small footstool, or a table.

      "title": "Put a thick magazine inside the jeans under where you’ll be distressing.",
      "content": "Put a thick magazine inside the jeans under where you’ll be distressing. A thick magazine will help prevent you from accidentally cutting other areas of your jeans where you don’t want slits or holes. The magazine will also help keep the denim taut, making it easier for you to cut. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a magazine lying around, a thick notebook or a piece of cardboard should also do the trick."

      "title": "Use a razor blade to carefully make slits where you’re distressing.",
      "content": "Use a razor blade to carefully make slits where you’re distressing. Add the first slit where you want the bottom of your hole to be. Then add horizontal slits at 0.5 in (1.3 cm) increments until you reach the top of where you want the hole to be. Make the slits as long as you want the holes to be. Do this for every area you want to distress. [5] X Research source Be very careful when using a razor blade so you don't cut yourself. You might want to wear a pair of thick gloves for extra protection."

      "title": "Pull the threads of the slits apart to create natural-looking holes.",
      "content": "Pull the threads of the slits apart to create natural-looking holes. Once you’ve made slits with your razor blade, use some tweezers or a bobby pin to open the slits wider. Use your fingers to pull apart threads that become exposed. Keep pulling the threads apart until you get holes that are the size and shape you want. [6] X Research source"
