      "title": "Tilt the pan to a 30-degree angle with the far edge tilted down.",
      "content": "Tilt the pan to a 30-degree angle with the far edge tilted down. This will allow you to snap your wrist and flip the omelet in one smooth motion. Tilting the pan more than 30 degrees could cause the omelet to slip out, and less will not give you good leverage for the flipping motion."
    },

      "title": "Shake the pan gently to ensure the bottom of the omelet is loose.",
      "content": "Shake the pan gently to ensure the bottom of the omelet is loose. Make sure the bottom is solidified and does not stick to the pan, which can be done by gently shaking the pan to allow the omelet to slide around. [1] X Research source Flipping an omelet that is stuck to the pan will make a mess, as some of it will stick in the pan and some of it will fly out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw the pan forward, upward, and back in a sharp motion.",
      "content": "Throw the pan forward, upward, and back in a sharp motion. Thrust forward to about the halfway point in the omelet, then flick your wrist upward slightly to lift half the omelet up. Then, sharply draw the pan slightly back towards you, lifting the far edge to fold the omelet in half. [2] X Research source If you flick too hard you could end up flipping the entire thing over, but flick too soft and you won't get a proper fold. This takes practice!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab a plate and tip the pan to allow the omelet to fall halfway onto the plate.",
      "content": "Grab a plate and tip the pan to allow the omelet to fall halfway onto the plate. With the bottom of the omelet solidified, you will be able to slide it off without breaking it. [3] X Research source Make sure the pan and the plate are touching so the omelet does not fall from a height - you want to slide it out, not drop it out. Use a plate that is about 2 in (5.1 cm) larger than your pan on each side. Don't use a plate the same size as your pan or smaller or your omelet will not fit and could spill over the side of the plate. Don't tip the whole omelet onto the plate, as you will need to use the pan's edge to flip it in half."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the other half with the edge of the pan.",
      "content": "Fold the other half with the edge of the pan. With half of the omelet in the pan and half on the plate, carefully move the pan forward over the plate to allow the other half to slide onto itself. Don't raise the pan high or you may accidentally drop the omelet by dragging it off the plate. Instead, use a slow forward motion to push the omelet onto itself. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow the eggs to turn white on the edges of the omelet.",
      "content": "Allow the eggs to turn white on the edges of the omelet. Timing is everything in omelet flipping, and a good rule of thumb is to look for solidified eggs on the edges. Once they have begun to turn white, you have a short amount of time before they become too hard. Use medium heat and allow the center to solidify slightly. [5] X Research source Flipping an omelet when the sides have started to turn brown will sometimes result in an omelet that is well-done on the outside, but runny inside."

    {
      "title": "Insert the spatula underneath your omelet.",
      "content": "Insert the spatula underneath your omelet. Look for which side has the most cooked-through eggs, and insert the spatula about 1/3 of the way in. Don't insert it all the way to the center, or you may end up splitting the omelet in half. If you can't get the spatula underneath the eggs cleanly, you may not have used enough oil or butter, or you may need to let the omelet cook longer to solidify more."

    {
      "title": "Lift the side of the omelet slightly, looking for breaks.",
      "content": "Lift the side of the omelet slightly, looking for breaks. Make sure the side that you plan to fold stays together before committing to the flip. You don't need to insert the spatula any further than 1/3 of the way. [6] X Research source If the eggs seem to start breaking apart, either try to flip it from another side or wait a few seconds longer to let the eggs cook through more."

    {
      "title": "Flip and fold the omelet.",
      "content": "Flip and fold the omelet. If your eggs are white on the sides and have begun to solidify in the center, the omelet is ready to be flipped. Gently lift one side with the spatula to fold it in half, and press down on the top to allow the center to stick together. Allow the side still on the pan to cook to a golden brown, then flip it again, and allow the other side to cook to a golden brown too."
