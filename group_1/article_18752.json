      "content": "Defeat the gym leader. Once you have reached Mossdeep City, you need to defeat the gym leader first, if you haven't done that yet. Gym leaders Tate and Liza uses psychic-type Pokémon, so make sure to use Pokémon that are great against psychics. The best option to defeat the double gym leader is to use Absol. You can find this wild Pokémon on Route 120, though you only have a 7–10% chance of finding one. Needless to say, this Pokémon learns Bite at level 28, which is very much effective against psychics. Another Pokémon to use in this fight would be a dark type such as Mightyena; this Pokémon can be found on the route west of Lilycove City. You will obtain a badge, and this will trigger an event in the Space Center."
