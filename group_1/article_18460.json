Everyone else will then ask a series of 20 yes or no questions to attempt to figure out the answer. [1] X Research source If the group can’t figure out the answer within 20 questions, the other player wins and gets to keep their role for the next round. If the group does figure it out, someone else will think of an object for the next round. This game can also be played in pairs. It also works well online or through text. Another version of 20 questions involves a pair taking turns to ask each other a series of 20 questions about themselves. This version is often used as a way to flirt with the other player, but it can be just for fun, as well."

Come up with two truths and one lie about yourself or things you’ve done, then take turns sharing them with the group. Everyone will then try to guess which is the lie. Keep going until everyone has had a turn to share. [2] X Research source This game can also be played online or through text. Try to come up with interesting facts about yourself. If possible, avoid basic facts like your favorite color or your favorite animal."

The person throwing the party will start the game by saying, “Never have I ever…” followed by something they’ve never done, like going skydiving, for instance. [3] X Research source Anyone who has gone skydiving would then put a finger down, and then the next person would ask a question. The game continues until only one person is still holding up at least one finger. If you want to add a dare element, think of a dare for everyone who has done the thing to complete. If you’re of age, make the game more fun by having people take a shot for each thing they’ve done. If you’re playing as a couple, throw in some suggestive questions to make the game more flirty."

Take turns asking each other “Would you rather…?” questions, like “Would you rather explore the ocean or space?” or “Would you rather never be able to eat or never be able to sleep again?” The more outlandish the questions, the funnier the game will be! [4] X Research source For some extra fun, have everyone explain their answers. Their explanations could lead to some hilarious and heated debates! If you’re playing as a couple, feel free to make the game flirty rather than funny."

Grab a group of friends (the more the merrier), write down a bunch of silly dances (like the Robot or the Chicken Dance), and put them in a bowl. Start some music and have everyone dance. Someone will then call out the name of a player, and that person will draw a dare from the bowl. After doing the silly dance, they’ll pick someone else, and the game will continue until everyone has been chosen. Each person gets one pass per game. This game is a great option for kids and teenagers, though it can be played at any age. For extra fun, set up a stage or dance floor for the person doing the dare. Turn on some colorful, flashing lights so it really feels like you’re at a dance club."

Gather a group of friends and have them each write down a dare and put it in a bowl. Someone will then spin the bottle, and the person on whom it lands must draw a dare from the bowl. [5] X Research source After performing the dare, they’ll return it to the bowl and spin the bottle so it lands on someone else. The game continues until everyone has performed at least one dare. Be sure to choose dares that are appropriate for your age range. If you don’t want to put all the dares in a bowl, have the person who spun the bottle come up with a dare for the person it lands on."

[6] X Research source The player in the hot seat will then read all the answers, and everyone else must guess which answer they think was submitted by the person in the hot seat. Anyone who gets it right gets a point. If you don’t want to come up with questions on your own, consider buying the Hot Seat party game ."

One person will then whisper a “who’s most likely to…” question into the next player’s ear. That person will say the name of another player out loud and flip a coin to determine whether or not they reveal the question. If it lands on heads, they have to say the question out loud, and if it lands on tails, the game moves on and the question is never revealed. [8] X Research source Keep playing until everyone in the circle has had a chance to answer a question. For example, a question could be “Who’s most likely to end up in jail?” or “Who’s most likely to become a billionaire?” If you’re of legal drinking age, the person who answered can avoid revealing the question by taking a shot."

[10] X Research source For example, have your friends choose between Shrek, Darth Vader, and Sonic the Hedgehog. It’s possible to play this game using people you know in real life, but be careful not to hurt someone’s feelings. It’s probably better to stick with fictional characters or people you’ll never meet.

Then, turn the music back on and continue passing the bowl around until it has made two rotations through the circle. Make sure you have a designated person to start and stop the music.

Grab some friends and some strips of paper—you’ll need one fewer strip than there are players (ex: if you have 8 players, tear 7 strips of paper). On all strips but one, write “lie,” and on the other, write “truth.” Put all the strips in a bowl and choose one player to be the guesser. Everyone else will then draw a piece of paper. If it says “lie,” they’ll tell a lie about themselves, and if it says “truth,” they’ll say something true. The guesser must then figure out which player is telling the truth. The person telling the truth will be the next person to guess. The game will continue until everyone has been the guesser.

That player will then whisper what they heard into the next player’s ear, and so on, until you make your way back to the beginning of the circle.

[12] X Research source If the person laughs, it will then be their team’s turn to perform. If they keep a straight face, their team earns a point. It’s up to you to decide what counts as a laugh. Generally, though, the rule is if you show your teeth, it counts as a laugh. Keep things lighthearted. Don’t do anything mean or make fun of anyone in an attempt to make the player laugh. Don’t touch anyone from the opposing team, either."

[13] X Research source This game works best if you have a set number of rounds, like 10, so it’s easy to keep up with who has the most points.

[14] X Research source When someone gets winked at, they must slump over and pretend to be dead. If someone successfully catches the assassin winking, the game is over. If no one catches the assassin, the assassin wins. If someone falsely accuses someone of being the assassin, the accuser is immediately out of the game. There are many versions of this game, so you might know it by a different name like Werewolf , Mafia , or simply Assassin ."

Subtly clear your throat, tap the object in a certain pattern, and say “I can tap this stick/pen/etc. just right.” Then, pass the stick to the next person and see if they can tap the stick correctly. [15] X Research source Here’s the trick—it doesn’t matter if they follow the pattern correctly; they also have to clear their throat before they do so. See how long you can keep the game going before everyone catches on. This game is fun because everyone will be watching the position of your fingers or how hard you tap the stick. Unless they’ve played the game before, it’ll probably take a while before they realize they have to clear their throat. When it gets down to just a few people who haven’t caught on, start clearing your throat more obviously."
