      "content": "Turn off the water supply and empty the toilet. The water supply valve will either be located behind the toilet or in the crawlspace or basement space directly beneath the toilet. Turn the valve clockwise to turn off the water supply, then remove the toilet lid and flush the toilet to drain it . Remove any water left in the bowl with a sponge or force it down the drain with a plunger. [1] X Research source You can also use a plastic cup to scoop out water in the bowl, then dry the last drops of moisture with a towel or dry sponge. Or, use a water solidifier to temporarily solidify the remaining water. Jones says, “If it’s an older style gate valve, it will require several turns before it closes. If it’s a quarter-turn ball valve, it [will] only require turning the valve one quarter of a 360-degree turn.” When you remove the tank lid, Jones recommends “[Placing] it in a safe spot where it won’t be broken or tripped over.”"

      "content": "Disconnect the water supply line. Detach the water supply line hose from the toilet fill valve and the 3/8 compression nut by turning the compression nut in a counterclockwise direction. This can usually be done by hand, but if you’re unable to loosen the connection, use a wrench or pair of pliers. Disconnecting the water supply line will help when resetting the toilet after the wax seal is placed. [2] X Research source Consider replacing the water supply line hose whenever you replace the wax seal to keep your toilet in good working condition."

      "title": "Remove the nuts and washers from the bolts.",
      "content": "Remove the nuts and washers from the bolts. Insert a flathead screwdriver under the caps of the bolts and washers and gently pry them upwards. Use an adjustable wrench to loosen the bolts, being careful not to use too much pressure, then remove the nuts and washers from the bolts at the toilet base. If the bolt spins as you turn the nut, hold the bolt with a pair of pliers in your non-dominant hand. [3] X Research source Some covers just twist off, so try turning the caps counterclockwise first. If you use too much pressure when loosening the bolts, you could bend or break the toilet flange or chip or crack the china. If the bolts have corroded, apply penetrating oil and let it sit for a few minutes before loosening the bolts. If you aren’t planning on installing new bolts, nuts, and washers, store them in a safe place so they don’t get lost while you’re working. If the toilet is caulked to the finished floor of your bathroom, score the caulking with a utility knife as well."

      "title": "Break the wax seal and lift the toilet.",
      "content": "Break the wax seal and lift the toilet. Toilets are heavy, so it’s a good idea to have someone to help you. Hold the toilet under the bowl and gently rock it back and forth to break the old wax seal. Then, carefully lift the toilet up, keeping the base parallel to the floor. Gently set it down on a piece of cardboard or in the bathtub to protect your floors. [4] X Research source The bottom of the toilet will likely have wax from the seal, so don’t set it on cloth or anything you wouldn’t want to throw away. If you’re working in an awkward space or the toilet is too heavy to lift, consider removing the bolts that attach the tank to the bowl and move each piece separately. To lift the toilet safely, Jones says, “Stand up and grasp the front of the bowl and the back of the tank while keeping your back straight. Begin lifting the toilet straight upward, using your legs to lift. The toilet should come free of the bolts and the old wax ring that sealed it to the toilet flange at the floor.”"

      "title": "Scrape the old wax seal off the base of the toilet.",
      "content": "Scrape the old wax seal off the base of the toilet. Put on a pair of waterproof cleaning gloves and use a putty knife to scrape the wax seal off the base of the toilet and the toilet flange. Remove any caulk from the base and finished flooring, as well. [5] X Research source After removing the old seal, it’s a good idea to stuff the drain with old rags or a towel, as an unplugged drain can release noxious sewer gas into your home. Jones says to “clean the toilet flange using an effective household cleaner and an old rag. If the flange is bent or damaged, you will need to replace it before installing the new toilet.”"

    {
      "title": "Replace the toilet flange bolts (optional).",
      "content": "Replace the toilet flange bolts (optional). If you’re installing new toilet bolts, now is the time to do so. Ensure the bolts are centered with the toilet flange opening and parallel with the wall behind the toilet tank. Install any repair parts or spacers as needed before inserting the bolts. [6] X Research source If you aren’t replacing the bolts, make sure the existing ones are in good condition before placing the new seal. If you’ve noticed any leaks or wobbles with your toilet, it’s a good idea to install a toilet flange repair kit . If your flange is broken, your toilet won’t be anchored down and could fall over. Jones says, “The flange should not come up from the floor when you remove the toilet. It is meant to stay in place unless it was damaged or bent during the removal of the last toilet.”"

    {
      "title": "Attach a new wax seal.",
      "content": "Attach a new wax seal. Make sure your new seal is the right size for your toilet by measuring the opening on the bottom of your toilet bowl. The wax ring should be the same size as the width of the opening. Place the new seal on top of the flange and make sure it’s perfectly centered. [7] X Research source Jones says to “follow directions on the package so that it is installed properly.” If the wax seal isn’t the right size, you could experience leaks. If you plugged the drain with towels, remember to remove them before reinstalling the toilet."

      "title": "Put the toilet back into place.",
      "content": "Put the toilet back into place. With someone to help you, lift the toilet and set it back on top of the flange so that the bolts fit through the holes on the base of the toilet. Keep the toilet tank parallel to the wall behind it and apply firm downward pressure on the bowl as you lower the toilet. The wax ring should mold to the base to form a good seal and prevent sewer gases from escaping. [8] X Research source Don’t rock the toilet as you set it on the seal. Instead, use a slight side-to-side twisting motion until the bowl is resting on the floor."

    {
      "title": "Bolt the toilet into place.",
      "content": "Bolt the toilet into place. Put the washers over the bolts and thread the nuts onto the bolts. Tighten the nuts until the toilet is secure, then press down hard on the toilet and tighten some more. Continue this process until the toilet is tightly secured to the flange. Be careful not to over-tighten the nuts, however, as this could crack the base of the bowl. Replace the caps over the bolts. Jones recommends that you “go back and forth between the two bolts, tightening them in equal measure until the toilet is secure on its flange and isn’t rocking or moving.”"

      "title": "Reconnect the water supply and test the toilet.",
      "content": "Reconnect the water supply and test the toilet. Reattach the water supply line hose to the water supply valve and turn the compression nut clockwise. Turn the valve on and flush the toilet several times to make sure it’s secure. If you notice a leak beneath the base of the toilet, seat the toilet more firmly toward the floor by applying firm, even pressure on both sides of the rim. Tighten the bolts, then flush again. Your repair is complete if there are no leaks. If there is still a leak after tightening the bolts, there may be a problem with the wax seal. In this case, remove the toilet and repeat the installation process with a new seal. Even if you don’t see any leaks at first, check the base again an hour after flushing the toilet and again the next day to make sure it’s properly sealed. When you’re sure there are no leaks, recaulk your toilet . If you want to replace the water supply line with a new one, Jones says, “Choose a flexible, braided stainless steel water supply line. These come in various lengths and can be purchased at [a] hardware store. Choose the length that most effectively fits the distance.”"

      "title": "The toilet is leaking.",
      "content": "The toilet is leaking. When a wax ring breaks or wears down over time, it loses its waterproof seal. The seal then allows water to leak out onto the floor whenever you flush the toilet. If you’re not sure if the toilet is leaking , place some paper towels around the base and check periodically to see if they’re wet. If they are, it’s often a sign the seal needs to be replaced.

      "title": "The toilet is unstable.",
      "content": "The toilet is unstable. Wax seals typically don’t return to their original shape after being compressed, so when a toilet moves, it often breaks the seal. [10] X Research source If you notice your toilet has been rocking when you use it, it’s probably time to replace the seal and tighten the toilet."

      "title": "Mold is growing around your toilet.",
      "content": "Mold is growing around your toilet. Mold grows in damp areas, so if your toilet isn’t sealed properly, moisture could pool around the base and lead to mold. Look for black spots around the edge of your toilet. If you spot mold, replace the wax seal and clean up the mold as soon as possible to avoid further damage and health risks. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "The toilet smells like sewage.",
      "content": "The toilet smells like sewage. While it’s normal to smell odors around the toilet now and then, they shouldn’t linger. If the air around your toilet consistently and strongly smells of sewage, the wax ring may have lost its seal. When this happens, sewer gas can come up through your system and into the bathroom. This can be dangerous, so address the issue as soon as possible. [12] X Research source In addition to having a foul odor, sewage gas can cause health issues and is often flammable."

      "title": "The floor feels damp or spongy.",
      "content": "The floor feels damp or spongy. Sometimes, a toilet can leak without water pooling on the bathroom floor. The water may stay under the base of the toilet, seep under the floor, and cause hidden damage. [13] X Research source If your floor feels damp or soft around the base of your toilet, or appears discolored, it could be a sign of a wax seal problem."

      "title": "How often should I replace the seal on a toilet?",
      "content": "How often should I replace the seal on a toilet? Replace the wax seal on your toilet any time you have to remove or replace the toilet. The wax ring gets compressed and loses its shape when you place the toilet on top of it, so the old one won’t seal the toilet properly once you remove and reinstall the toilet. If your toilet is leaking around the base, it’s often a sign to replace the seal. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Why should I use a wax ring?",
      "content": "Why should I use a wax ring? Wax resists mold and bacteria and retains its sealing ability for years. Wax ring seals are easy to install, inexpensive, and can shape themselves to fit almost any toilet or floor drain. They help prevent your toilet from leaking and sewage gas from seeping into your bathroom. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Can you replace a wax ring without replacing the toilet?",
      "content": "Can you replace a wax ring without replacing the toilet? You do not have to install a brand new toilet to replace a wax ring. Simply remove your old toilet, set it in a safe area while you install the seal, then reinstall it. [16] X Research source Just make sure there are no structural damages to the toilet. It isn’t possible, however, to replace a wax ring without disconnecting and moving the toilet."

      "title": "Do all toilets use the same wax ring?",
      "content": "Do all toilets use the same wax ring? No, wax rings come in different sizes to fit different toilets. [17] X Research source The rings come in two diameters: 3 inches (7.6 cm) and 4 inches (10.16 cm). To determine which size you need, uninstall your toilet and measure the opening at the bottom of your toilet bowl. The seal you choose should be the same size as the width of the opening. If you choose the wrong size, the wax ring won’t seal properly and will likely lead to leaks."

      "content": "How long does it take for a wax ring to seal? Wax rings seal as soon as you place the toilet on top of them. Press down on the toilet and secure it to the floor with bolts. To make sure it’s sealed properly, flush it several times. If you notice leaks around the base, the wax ring likely didn’t seal properly and needs to be replaced again. [18] X Research source"
