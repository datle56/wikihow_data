      "content": "Download and install software to copy your DVD. You will need software that is capable of copying the exact format of the DVD so that the content can be burned onto another DVD. This software may have come with your computer or can be downloaded for free or purchased from the internet. Copying software will create an image archive of the DVD called an ISO which is a file that contains content sourced from an optical disc that can also be used to replicate the image onto another DVD. Use caution when looking for software online by searching for review sites and forums when looking for trustworthy software. [1] X Research source While the ISO file format is commonly used, some burning software can create an image archive in it's own proprietary format. You will either need conversion software to convert into an ISO file format or set the software to save in ISO format."
