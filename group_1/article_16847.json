      "content": "Prolonged eye contact is a sign that he's into you. The next time you see him, catch his gaze and see if he stares back or looks away. Most people only make eye contact for about 4 to 5 seconds at a time while chatting. So, if he holds your gaze longer than that, he might like you! [1] X Research source Conversely, some people are uncomfortable with eye contact. If you know he's shy, don't be discouraged; there are other signs that he might like you. If you're nervous, ask him a question so you have an excuse to make eye contact . You could say, \"How far are you on last week's assignment?\" or \"Do you know what the cafeteria is serving today?\" Reader Poll: We asked 1332 wikiHow readers, and 58% of them agreed that the strongest indicator that a guy likes you is if he makes frequent eye contact .

      "content": "It’s natural for people to smile when they see someone they like. So, if your guy likes you, it'll be obvious that he's super excited to see you. Watch his face when you walk into the room to see if he smiles. A big, joyful grin is a sign that he likes you, and he'll probably smile and laugh his way through whole conversations with you. [2] X Research source Look at how he smiles at other people, too. Does he act that way with everyone, or does he seem especially happy to see you?"

      "content": "Guys with a crush spend a lot of time looking at the person they like. He might not even realize how obviously he’s admiring you! Try to catch him in the act by looking over at him suddenly. If you see him staring and he looks away quickly while blushing or smiling, it means he likes you. [3] X Research source Only check once or twice each time you're around him. If you glance at him often, he may think you're staring at him. Alternatively, ask a friend you trust to check and see if he's looking at you. They can steal a glance and report back to you."

      "title": "Guys tend to mirror people they like unconsciously.",
      "content": "Guys tend to mirror people they like unconsciously. Mirroring is when someone subtly copies you, adapting a similar tone of voice and making the same movements with their body. Is he mimicking your posture? After you make a small gesture, does he do the same thing seconds later? If so, he might like you! [5] X Research source Try turning your head to look at a window or an object in the room. Does he do the same? A guy with a crush might also look where you look because he's hyperaware of your movements."

Notice if he touches your arm, bumps into you, or moves to stand next to you. Hugs are also a solid sign he likes you. [6] X Research source He also won't pull away when you enter his personal space. He'll encourage small touches and even lean into them if he likes you! If a guy ever touches you in a way you don't like, remember that you can always tell him to stop because it makes you uncomfortable. Get someone you trust to help if he won't listen."

      "content": "He's trying to make a good impression but getting nervous about it. Talking to a crush can be nerve-wracking! A normally smooth-talking guy might stumble over his words or mess up a sentence. If he has trouble stringing a sentence together with you but seems at ease around others, he's likely crushing on you. [7] X Research source For instance, he might suddenly give short or yes/no answers when he normally likes to talk. Similarly, he might stutter or forget what he wanted to say. Look for other nervous ticks, too. He might crack his knuckles, scratch his head, or fidget as a sign of nerves while talking to you."

      "content": "A guy who likes you won't wait around to hear from you. As a result, he won't hesitate to reach out and chat you up at every opportunity. Think about how often he initiates contact by walking up to you, making plans, or sending a quick text. If he does it at least as often as you (if not more), he might like you. [8] X Research source For example, he might sit next to you in class and say, \"How's it going?\" or \"How did you do on the last test?\" Alternatively, he may text you out of the blue on a Saturday night and say, \"What are you up to?\" or \"You busy tomorrow? I thought we could do something!\""

He'll always stick close to your side, whether you spend time together alone or in a group. He might even spontaneously show up places he knows you'll be just so he can see you. For example, he might show up at your favorite cafe or arcade because he knows you like it there. If you're both at a party, he'll be there as long as you are—even if other friends leave first. He might even offer to walk or drive you home. He'll also try getting to know your friends. Since he likes you, he wants your friends to like him too!"

      "content": "When a guy is into you, he'll want to learn about your life. Open-ended questions require more than a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, allowing you to give an in-depth explanation. Take note if he asks you many personal questions about anything and everything, including your likes, dislikes, and background. It means he's trying to get to know you better—down to the tiniest details. [9] X Research source He might ask questions like, \"What do you do in your free time?\" \"What are your favorite bands?\" \"Do you have any pets?\" or \"How many siblings do you have?\" Ask him questions, too! If he's showing interest, exchanging questions is a great way to learn more about one another and strengthen your bond."

If you're a girl, he probably won't talk about other girls often, and the same goes if you're a guy. He wants you to know you're the only one he's interested in! [10] X Research source In fact, your guy might even drop hints that he's single. Comments about his relationship status like, \"I'm still looking for the right person,\" or \"I'm still flying solo\" signal his availability."

Then, listen for compliments that he gives to other people. He's likely crushing on you if he compliments you frequently compared to others and admires the smaller details that other people miss. [11] X Research source For example, if you change your hairstyle, your guy will be the first to notice and say, \"Wow, you're looking amazing today!\" Try complimenting him, too ! He might give other compliments about your looks, like, \"Those glasses look cool!\" or \"I like that band t-shirt. Where'd you get it?\" He'll also compliment deeper things like intellect and talents. He might say, \"You're so smart!

Telling someone outright that you like them can be scary, so instead, a guy might show you that he likes you by offering encouragement, showing interest in your passions, standing up for you, and giving help when you need it. He's trying to say that he's got your back no matter what because he likes you. [12] X Research source For example, he might help you with your homework, offer to carry your stuff, or offer to fix your car.

A guy who likes you won’t play on his phone or get distracted while you talk; instead, he’ll want to hear everything you say. Be on the lookout for signs that he’s actively listening to you. If he never interrupts and makes encouraging sounds like “Mhm” and “Go on,” it means he’s totally focused on you. [13] X Research source You'll also notice that he remembers your answers. He might buy your favorite snack for you out of the blue or ask to borrow a book you mentioned liking to prove that he listens to you. Does he remember something you told him long after you forget mentioning it? It's a big sign that he likes you when he does that."

[14] X Research source He might ask, \"Who's Matt?\" \"How long have you known Matt?\" \"What does Matt do?\" or \"Do you and Matt hang out often?\" If you're interested in dating this guy, handle the jealousy and tell him that your friend is just a friend, not someone you're interested in dating. Otherwise, he might think you're dating someone else."

Notice if your guy is always quick to reply and offers excuses when he goes quiet for a while. If he likes you, this could be a sign of his crush. [15] X Research source For instance, he might respond to a text immediately (or within a few minutes). If his reply takes longer than 10 minutes, he might add, \"Sorry for the delay. I'm working right now!\" Remember that it's normal to encounter a delay in responses during work and school hours. He'll also send texts casually checking in and asking you how you're doing; it's his way of staying closely in touch with you."
