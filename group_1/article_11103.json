Starches don't sit in your stomach for a long period of time and they don't stimulate acid reflux, which can make your stomach feel worse. Try eating a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of rice, or grits. This can help sooth your stomach and hopefully make your stomach ache go away. You can also try dry toast. Avoid eating jams, jellies, or butter on the toast. Those things may cause your stomach to react and make your ache much worse. If you are feeling extremely nauseous, you can try saltine crackers. They are really basic and there isn't much to them. Eating them helps absorb stomach acid and relieve aches."
