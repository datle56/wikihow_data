Febreeze is a popular variety that can work well, particularly on carpeting and furniture. Always read the manufacturer's instructions before using any product. Some products may come with warnings or should not be used on a particular type of fabric or carpeting. It's a good idea to spray a small corner of carpeting or fabric first to test out the product. Make sure the spray does not cause any discoloration or other problems before spritzing it all over your carpeting or furniture."
