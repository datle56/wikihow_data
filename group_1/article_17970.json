Arrange the bill so that you’re looking at the top half of the backside—you’ll see the words \"The United States of America\" flanked by two \"20\"s; beneath this, you'll find the words \"In God We Trust\" and the top of the White House.

The back bottom-left-hand corner of the bill will rise perpendicular to the top of the bill; make sure that there is a large \"20\" in the corner. [2] X Research source"

The eaves of the White House have become the towers, and the trees that flank the White House have become the smoke from the ruined buildings.

The current $20 bill was the product of a redesign implemented by the U.S. Treasury in 1998—3 years before the September 11 attacks. [5] X Research source There’s no evidence to suggest any of this is true.
