      "content": "You can only pay with cash on DoorDash Drive. You cannot pay with cash on any orders made within the DoorDash app. DoorDash briefly accepted cash prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but that feature has not since returned. Still, cash payments are available via DoorDash Drive, the company's service for merchants to use on their own sites. So, if you're ordering directly through a restaurant's website and they use DoorDash as their courier, you may see a Cash On Delivery optionâ€”just not in the DoorDash app or on DoorDash's website. Merchants that use DoorDash Drive must enable the \"Cash On Delivery\" option in order for customers to see it available as an option. [1] X Research source Although all DoorDash Drive merchants can enable cash, this feature is mostly used by pizza restaurants."

      "content": "Select \"Cash\" when checking out via DoorDash Drive. If cash is accepted, this option will appear in the list of payment methods. It can be difficult to know when you are going to come across a website that uses DoorDash Drive. If you are ordering pizza or another food item from a restaurant's website and you see the DoorDash interface, look for \"Cash\" as a payment method. Once you check out, make sure you have the necessary amount of cash and wait for your Dasher to arrive. Your order must be $7 or more to qualify for a cash payment. If your aren't spending as least $7, you will have to pay with a card or other electronic payment. [2] X Research source"
