      "title": "Avoid hiding from people because of the incident.",
      "content": "Avoid hiding from people because of the incident. Feeling humiliated can make you want to disappear or run away, but this won’t help you feel any better. Additionally, it might make people more aware that you’re feeling embarrassed. As soon as you’re feeling calm, rejoin your classmates and try to act like nothing happened. If you do, people will probably forget the incident soon. [6] X Research source Try to remember that everyone is focused on what they’re doing, so it’s likely that no one realizes how embarrassed you are. If and when someone brings up the incident, you should not only try to ignore them, but also learn to laugh at yourself. People who are able to handle humiliation with stride seem more mature, elegant, and nonchalant. It'll not only do wonders for your popularity, but it'll help yourself recover from the awkwardness faster."

      "content": "Let yourself feel your emotions without judging yourself. It’s okay if you’re feeling upset, hurt, angry, or sad. You have every right to feel that way. Don’t try to force your feelings to go away. Instead, acknowledge how you feel because it will help you feel better faster. Say to yourself, “I’m feeling really angry because Amy is supposed to be my friend,” or “I’m feeling sad because I’m worried Alex won’t like me now.”"

    {
      "title": "Tell yourself what you'd say to a friend.",
      "content": "Tell yourself what you'd say to a friend. You’re likely much harder on yourself than you are on others, so it helps to consider what you’d say to a friend. Imagine that your friend was just humiliated like you were. Then, think about how you would feel about it and how you’d comfort them. [9] X Research source You’d probably say something like, “I can’t believe that just happened to you! Trust me, we’re all on your side,” or “I’m sorry that just happened.

      "content": "Think about how important this will be in 5 years. Chances are, whatever happened won't matter in 5 years. Picture yourself in the future living your best life.

      "content": "Recognize the motivation of the person who humiliated you. If someone else humiliated you, it helps to consider why they did it. Most likely, they did it for a personal reason that has nothing to do with you. Think about what was going on at the time of the incident and how this person typically treats others. Additionally, consider what’s happened between you in the past. [15] X Research source Try to remember that their decision to hurt you shows who they are, not who you are. Don’t let their bad decision to humiliate you weigh you down."

      "content": "Forgive yourself if you feel like you made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes, and that’s a good thing.

      "title": "Don't be afraid to face the same situation again.",
      "content": "Don't be afraid to face the same situation again. After you humiliate yourself, you might feel nervous about facing the same situation over again. This is especially true if people are laughing about it. However, facing your fear can help you feel better and will eventually make people forget what happened.

      "content": "Talk to the person who humiliated you if you think it will help. You might decide to talk to the person if you’re close to the person or they’ve hurt you more than once. Ask them to talk at a time when you’re feeling calm. Tell them how you feel about what happened and what you hope will change in the future. Then, listen to their side of the story because it’s possible they don’t know they hurt you. You might say, “I consider you a close friend, so I was really hurt when you embarrassed me yesterday. I don’t want our friendship to be ruined, so it’s important to me that you not share my secrets.”"
