Then with your right hand, pinch a point in middle of the shirt horizontally across from where you left hand is. To reiterate, you should have your left hand pinching near the collar, and your right hand pinching the middle of the shirt, halfway between the top and bottom, a few inches away from the side seam."

Once you've got it down, do each movement swiftly, and you'll be folding fast in no time. This type of folding comes handy when you want to fold T-shirts for travel as it keeps the garment flat when folded and allows you to fold quite a few shirts in a very short time."
