      "content": "Start with an undercut . This is where your hair is cut short on the sides and/or back, and left long on the top and/or sides. If your hair is very thick, it would be a good idea to add some layers to the top to help reduce weight. You may also want to ask the stylist to texturize your hair when you are getting an undercut. This helps to reduce bulk."
