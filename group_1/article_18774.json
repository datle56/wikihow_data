      "content": "Purchase some rubbing alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol can be found in the medical section at any drug or general store. It can be used on all clothes, including ones that aren’t colorfast and bleed a lot in the wash. You can check for colorfastness by spraying part of the clothing with water, then pressing a white towel to it. [1] X Research source Other products with a high alcohol content, such as hair spray or hand sanitizer, can also treat a dye stain. For leather clothing, use saddle soap."

      "content": "Dab the alcohol onto the dye stain. You’ll need something absorbent, such as an old rag, paper towel, or cotton ball. Lightly moisten it with the rubbing alcohol, then dab it onto the stain. Eventually, you’ll see the dye spread to the absorbent material. Removing the stain takes several applications of rubbing alcohol."

Check the clothing’s label or search the type of fabric online to find out the proper maximum temperature for the water. You may put the clothing through a washing machine cycle instead of washing by hand."
