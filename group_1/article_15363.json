      "content": "Fillet and de-bone whole fish before eating it. If the fish is being served whole, you'll want to cut the head off first, just behind the gills. Next, hold the body with your fork, and use your knife to the belly open, starting at the head and ending at the tail. Pull open the body, and remove the backbone. You can do this by placing the tip of your knife under the spine, then lifting it out with your fork. [1] X Research source If you can't remove the bones, simply eat around them. Don't flip the fish over to eat the flesh from the other side of the bones. This is bad etiquette. Instead, use your fork to lift the bone up and pull the flesh away."

Be sure to pull out the black thread along the back and discard it before eating the shrimp or prawn. To eat a peeled and headless prawn or shrimp: grip it by the tail, bite the body off, and discard the tail. When peeling shrimp, it is easiest to start from the underside of the body, where the legs are."
