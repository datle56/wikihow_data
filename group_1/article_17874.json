[2] X Research source If your guy forgets a date or shows up a few minutes late, that doesn’t mean he’s not into you! When you make plans, send him a reminder a few hours before to make sure he shows up. Opt for low-stakes activities like going to the farmers’ market or picnicking in the park rather than dates where you’ll need to be right on time. Plan to meet up with your Pisces before heading out on a date. That way, you’ll be able to help them get out the door. Add in 15 minutes buffer time when you’re making plans with a Pisces."
