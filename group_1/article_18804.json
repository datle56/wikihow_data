      "content": "Facial forward growth aims to bring the upper and lower jaws forward. The goal of facial forward growth is to create the appearance of a stronger jawline. If alignment issues are corrected, forward facial growth may also make the maxilla—the area around your cheekbones and nose—more prominent. It’s important to note that many popular techniques for getting facial forward growth won’t actually change the shape of the underlying bone structure. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Forward facial growth is a popular topic in online looksmaxxing communities. Techniques for obtaining forward facial growth have been popularized by looksmaxxing influencers like Jordan Wood, Baby Stickley, and Oscar Patel. While many of the techniques for forward facial growth are unproven, medical interventions like dental appliances or orthognathic surgery can be effective at correcting an underdeveloped jaw. This might move your lower jaw forward, although it won’t actually “grow” unless your body is still growing.

      "content": "Mewing Mewing is one of the most popular techniques in online looksmaxxing communities. To do it, close your mouth, then flatten your tongue and press it against the roof of your mouth. Keep your tongue pushed firmly into the roof of your mouth for 2–3 minutes, then repeat with moderate pressure for another 2–3 minutes. Do this several times a day. [3] X Research source Does it work? Mewing can make your jaw look more defined in pictures, but there’s no scientific evidence that proves it can actually lead to facial forward growth. [4] X Research source Are there any risks? In some cases, it could lead to more serious problems like crooked teeth, speech issues, and jaw pain."

      "title": "Chewing",
      "content": "Chewing Some looksmaxxing influencers claim that chewing hard items like carrots or facial fitness gum can help with facial forward growth. According to the claim, this gives you a facial workout that can make your jaw look wider and more defined. [5] X Research source Does it work? Chewing hard gum or other objects could help build up your masseter muscles—the muscles on the outside of your jaw—which might make your jaw look wider or sharper. But it’s unlikely to actually cause your facial bones to grow forward. Are there any risks? Excessive chewing can lead to jaw pain or swelling, and some facial fitness gums may contain ingredients like caffeine."

      "title": "Thumb Pulling/Thumb Pushing",
      "content": "Thumb Pulling/Thumb Pushing Looksmaxxing influencers often recommend techniques like thumb-pulling and thumb-pushing. To thumb-pull, place your thumbs on the front part of your palate, behind your front teeth, and pull forward and upward for 10–60 minutes. To thumb-push, place your thumbs on the back part of your palate, near your molars, and apply upward and outward pressure for the same amount of time. [6] X Research source Does it work? These motions try to recreate the pressure created by orthodontic devices, but there’s no evidence that thumb-pulling or thumb-pushing actually works to create forward facial growth. [7] X Research source Are there any risks? Thumb-pulling and thumb-pushing may risk moving your teeth out of place or causing damage to the tissue of your upper mouth."

      "title": "Improving Forward Head Posture",
      "content": "Improving Forward Head Posture Forward head posture (FHP), also called text neck, is when your head rests too far forward. It’s the result of chronic poor posture, often from spending too much time bent over a device or sitting slouched in front of a computer. This posture can lead to backwards pressure on the lower jaw, making it look retracted. [8] X Research source To improve your forward head posture , practice sitting or standing with your back straight and shoulders back, rather than hunched or curled forward. Does it work? If your lower jaw and chin appear to be receding because of forward head posture, intentionally correcting your posture may help the jaw look more defined. Are there any risks? Improving your posture doesn’t have any health risks. And fortunately, there’s no evidence that poor posture leads to permanent physical changes—even in growing children. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Does it work? This exercise can help you correct forward head posture, which could decrease tension on your lower jaw that causes it to look recessed. However, it will not lead to growth in your facial bones. Are there any risks? This is a gentle stretch that’s unlikely to carry risks, but to be safe, talk to your doctor if you have a history of neck pain or injuries."

Repeat this several times a day. Does it work? Like mewing and other jawline exercises, there’s no evidence that this will lead to facial forward growth. Are there any risks? If you’re only doing this for a few seconds at a time, you’re probably not going to see any difference—positive or negative. But holding this pose for a prolonged period could cause teeth alignment or speech issues."

There’s no evidence that massaging your face will lead to facial forward growth. Are there any risks? While this probably isn’t very effective, there’s no risk in massaging your face, and it will probably feel nice."

[21] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Orthognathic surgery is usually done after you’re finished growing—usually after the age of 18 for females and 21 for males. This is a fairly serious surgery, so it will likely only be recommended if your jaw alignment has a significant impact on your appearance or causes issues with things like biting, chewing, breathing, swallowing, closing your mouth, or speaking. You may need to wear braces or another orthodontic device for a year or more to prepare for the surgery."
