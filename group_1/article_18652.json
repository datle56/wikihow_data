      "content": "Don't overwork your muscles. Many people make the mistake of lifting weights every single day, thinking that the more they work out, the bigger their muscles will get. This is actually detrimental to muscle growth; your muscles get bigger on the rest days in between workouts, when the tissues repair themselves. To make sure you're not overworking your muscles, follow these tips: Work out your chest muscles no more than once or twice per week. On the days when you aren't working out your chest, work other muscle groups, like your legs, arms, and back.

Challenge yourself to lift as much weight as you can without risking muscle, tendon, ligament, or joint damage. To find out how much weight you should be lifting, try doing reps with different weights. You should be able to do 8 - 10 reps without having to put the weights down, but you should be sweating and panting by the end of the set. If you can't do more than 5 or so reps without stopping, you're lifting too much weight. Scale back. As you get stronger, you can start lifting more weight. [7] X Research source If you can do 10 reps without feeling a burn, add more weight. You need to challenge yourself if you want to get bigger."

      "content": "Use the right form. Have a personal trainer or instructor show you how to do your exercises using the right form. You should generally start with your arms fully extended, and use your muscles, not momentum, to complete each motion. Using the wrong form can cause muscle, tendon, joint, and ligament damage, so make sure you know what you're doing. If you can't complete a motion with a particular weight, it might be too heavy for you. For example, if you can't straighten your arms while you're bench pressing, ease off on the weight."

      "content": "Don't eat too many calories. People often believe that to get big muscles, you need to eat a lot of calories. You do need to be eating enough calories to give you energy through training, but not so many that your body has to work on burning fat instead of building muscle. Being lean helps the muscles you're working so hard to build look more visible. Stay away from empty carbohydrates like pasta, white bread, cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. Choose foods with more whole grain instead. Don't eat too many foods that are processed or fried, and limit fast food and snacks."

      "content": "Consider taking supplements. Many people who are working on building muscles take creatine , a powdered amino acid that is mixed with water and ingested three or more times daily.

You may also consider taking a protein shake supplement it is one of the most beneficial supplements to gaining muscle and leading an overall healthy life."
