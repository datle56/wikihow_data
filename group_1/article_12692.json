      "content": "See if you're taller than most of the girls you know. If you're standing around a group of your friends and you're towering over them, then yeah, you're tall. Check out a photo of you and your friends and see where you stack up -- if you're a head above the rest of your friends, then yep, you're probably tall. But remember that it also depends on who you hang out with -- you won't look so tall if you're hanging out with members of the volleyball team instead of regular girls."

      "content": "See if you have a hard time finding clothes that fit you. If you regularly have a hard time finding pants that fit you because they are always too short, then yeah, you're tall. You may even hear your girlfriends complaining about always having to hem their pants because they are too long and may wonder what the heck they are talking about. You may also have a hard time finding shirts that don't look like belly shirts when you put them on. [1] X Research source As for shorts, if you're tall, then it may be hard for you to find shorts that cover much of your legs; if your school has a dress code where your fingertips have to reach the bottom of your shorts, it may be nearly impossible for you to find a pair of shorts that is long enough."

      "content": "See if everyone around you asks if you play basketball or volleyball. If everyone around you asks if you play these \"tall girl\" sports, then it may be a sign that you are taller than average. This can be annoying if you don't actually play those sports -- or any sports at all! People love to assume things about others because of their looks, and you shouldn't get too discouraged by this."

      "content": "See if you're 5'9\" or taller. Though this measurement can change depending on your age and what country you're from. For example in Baltic countries, this is only a few inches above the average, whereas, in countries like Mexico, where people are shorter, this is quite a tall height for a woman.

      "content": "See if you're just hitting puberty earlier than other people. In general, girls hit puberty between the ages of 8-13, and boys hit puberty between the ages of 9-15. This means that, if you feel tall but you're only 11, you may just be developing faster than a lot of your girl friends, and may be taller than the boys around you, who will take a bit longer to catch up. If you're still in the midst of puberty and many of your friends haven't hit puberty yet, then don't worry -- in a year or two, you'll be surprised by how quickly you stop feeling like \"the tall girl.\""

      "content": "See if you can never blend in when you're in a crowd. If you're in a room full of people, and your friends can spot you right away from across the crowded space, then yeah, it may be because you're so tall that you stand out easily. There's nothing wrong with that -- who says that standing out is a bad thing?"

      "content": "See if you never have enough legroom. Whether you're sitting on a plane or in the passenger seat of your friend's car, if you always feel like you have to move your legs to one side, recline the seat, or just contort your body to get your feet on the ground, then you may be a tall girl."

      "content": "See if you tower over most of the guys your age. If those middle school or high school dances are awkward because any guy you dance with is just short enough to be eye-level with your chest when it's time to sway to a slow song, then yeah, you're a tall girl. But don't be discouraged -- there's a good chance that a lot of the guys you know haven't stopped growing yet."

      "content": "See if you feel guilty for always blocking everyone's view when you go to a concert or the movies. You can't help being tall. But still, you find yourself feeling guilty whenever you go to a concert or the movies, because you just know that the person behind you can't see a thing. There's not much you can do about it -- except slouch in your seat. If this sounds like you, then you're probably a tall girl."

      "content": "Remember that tall is beautiful. And hey, so is being short. Don't think that being tall means you have to be gangly, awkward, or unappealing. Plenty of beautiful women are tall, and they know how to own their tall look by not shying away from attention. Don't think that being tall makes you somehow inadequate or unappealing to guys. Here are some tall female celebrities, just to show you that you're not alone: Gwyneth Paltrow (5'9\"), Jordin Sparks (5'9\"), Charlize Theron (5'10\"), Taylor Swift (5'10\"), Famke Janssen (6'), and Maria Sharapova (6'2\")."

      "content": "Don't slouch. You may think that slouching will make you look shorter, and while this is literally true, it will actually call more attention to the fact that you're not happy with your height. So stand tall and proud and don't worry about towering over the people around you -- they should be the ones wishing they were as tall as you!"

      "content": "Don't worry about being taller than the guys. Sure, guys may be intimidated by you because you're so tall, but that doesn't mean you can't talk to them or show them how awesome you are. Don't think that you have no chance with a guy just because he's shorter than you. If you find a guy you like, get to know him and you'll see that height is just a number."

You may be feeling miserable because you feel like you're taller than all of your friends and that all of your shorts are too short, but your short friend may hate having to stand on her tip-toes to talk to people or having to hem all of her jeans by half a foot so that they'll fit her. You may not want to be tall, but plenty of girls would die to be in your shoes! Whether you're tall or short, it's all about embracing who you are instead of wishing you were someone else."
