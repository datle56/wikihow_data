Then, add 2 minced cloves of garlic and 2 teaspoons (1.5 g) of minced fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of dried thyme. Press out the air and seal the bag tightly.

Seal the bag and then turn the bag over a few times so the tuna steaks are coated. [2] X Research source Avoid marinating the tuna steaks for more than 30 minutes or the acidic lemon juice could make them become mushy."

If you're using a charcoal grill, fill a chimney with briquettes and light them. Dump the briquettes onto 1 side of the grill once they're hot and lightly covered with ash. [3] X Research source If you're using a broiler, preheat it for at least 5 minutes before cooking the tuna steaks."

Put the lid back on and finish cooking the tuna steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes. The tuna should be a little flaky near the edges, but slightly pink in the center. [6] X Research source Plan on grilling the tuna steaks for around 8 minutes total if you'd like medium-rare fish. If you want them cooked medium, add an extra 1 to 2 minutes to the grilling time. Avoid cooking the tuna steaks beyond medium since the steaks will become dry and crumbly if they're overcooked."
