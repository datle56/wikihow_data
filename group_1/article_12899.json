      "title": "Purchase a diamond painting kit.",
      "content": "Purchase a diamond painting kit. You can find these online although some well-stocked craft stores may also carry them. Each brand will be a little different, but most kits will contain the following: a pre-printed canvas, flat-backed diamonds also known as drills, a tray, a pen-like tool, and a packet of gel or wax."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understand how to read the canvas.",
      "content": "Understand how to read the canvas. The canvas is composed of tiny boxes that are colored and labeled with numbers, letters and/or symbols, much like a cross-stitch canvas. Each symbol corresponds to a diamond color. The symbols are written on a chart, with the corresponding bag and drill color written below or next to it. The chart is typically printed on the side of the canvas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unroll the canvas and tape it down onto a flat surface.",
      "content": "Unroll the canvas and tape it down onto a flat surface. If the canvas won't lay flat, roll it back the other way, then unroll it. Spread it down onto a flat surface, then secure the edges with masking tape. This project can be time consuming. Consider taping the canvas to a board, which you can move out of the way easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel back part of the plastic covering on the canvas.",
      "content": "Peel back part of the plastic covering on the canvas. Do not peel all of the plastic away; 1 to 2 inches(2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) will be plenty. Run your fingernail along the plastic to crease it so that it doesn't roll forwards. Some kits come with pre-cut plastic strips. In this case, simply peel off a short section of the first strip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour out your first drill color into the tray.",
      "content": "Pour out your first drill color into the tray. Shake the tray gently to distribute the diamonds and set them in the right direction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the part of canvas you just exposed.",
      "content": "Look at the part of canvas you just exposed. Choose a box to start with and note the symbol in it. Match the symbol on the canvas with the chart, then find the bag with the same symbol."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open up the bag, and pour out some of the diamonds onto the tray that came with your kit.",
      "content": "Open up the bag, and pour out some of the diamonds onto the tray that came with your kit. Gently shake the tray to settle the drills and set them upright. Some kits come with multiple trays. You can use the other trays for the other colors in that section."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip your pen tool into the gel or wax that came with your kit.",
      "content": "Dip your pen tool into the gel or wax that came with your kit. Open up the packet of gel/wax that came with your kit and dip the metal end of the pen into the gel/wax to pick some up. This will make it possible for the pen to pick up the drills. Some kits come with a special wax pencil that you have to sharpen instead. In this case, sharpen the pencil using a pencil sharpener. Some pens will have a wide end too, which you can use to pick up to three drills at one time. This will also need to be dipped in the gel/wax first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the pen to pick up a diamond.",
      "content": "Use the pen to pick up a diamond. Gently press the tip of the pen against the top, faceted part of the drill. Lift the pen away from the tray; the drill should be stuck to it. Keep the tray just below the edge of your canvas; this will make it easier to access. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Gently press the drill onto the corresponding square.",
      "content": "Gently press the drill onto the corresponding square. Pull the pen away; the crystal should be stuck against the canvas. If you are just starting out, it might be a good idea to press lightly at first. This way, if the drill is off-set, you can nudge it back into place, then press down on it to secure it. This is exactly like painting by number, except that you are using drills instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the rest of the squares in that section.",
      "content": "Fill the rest of the squares in that section. Work one color at a time and refill the pen with wax as needed. When you finish filling in all the squares with the same symbols, move onto the next color. This will help you work faster and stay organized. [2] X Research source Avoid resting your hand against the canvas; the more you touch the sticky surface, the less tacky it will become."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel away more of the plastic covering, and fill in more squares.",
      "content": "Peel away more of the plastic covering, and fill in more squares. Continue filling in the canvas using the same technique as before. Work in 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) wide sections, one color at a time. When you completely fill in a section, move on to the next one. Do not peel the entire plastic covering away, or the adhesive on the canvas will get dirty and lose its tack. Always replace the covering when youâ€™ve finished for the day to protect the still open sections."

      "title": "Cover the canvas with the plastic sheet that it came with.",
      "content": "Cover the canvas with the plastic sheet that it came with. If you discarded the sheet, you can cover it with a piece of parchment paper; avoid using any kind of paper especially wax paper on the open canvas."

      "title": "Go over the canvas with a rolling pin.",
      "content": "Go over the canvas with a rolling pin. This will press down any loose diamonds and secure them. If you don't have a rolling pin, you can use a can or jar instead. You can also gently rub the canvas with your hands instead."

      "title": "Stack some heavy books on top of the canvas overnight.",
      "content": "Stack some heavy books on top of the canvas overnight. This will help further adhere the diamonds to the canvas and ensure that they bond properly. If you don't have any books large enough to cover the canvas, you can use another flat, heavy object, such as a box or cutting board."

      "title": "Peel the tape away.",
      "content": "Peel the tape away. Lift the books off first, then peel the plastic covering off. Peel the tape from the corners of the canvas."

      "content": "Frame the canvas. Remove the glass from the frame first, then insert the canvas into the frame. Fold the excess edges down, then place the backing into place. For a fancier touch, place the canvas behind a mat first; this will give the canvas an additional border within the frame. Choose a color that complements the diamonds."
