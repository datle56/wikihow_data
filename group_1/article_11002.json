This type of music also puts you in the right headspace to properly address what’s upsetting you, and gives you the freedom and space to cry your heart out. [1] X Research source Did You Know? Emotional crying releases feel-good hormones and also helps get rid of stress-related hormones. It’s different from the physical types of tears the body generates in response to eye irritation."

For a more potent and cathartic cry, try tapping into your own emotions and experiences while watching a tear-jerking movie. Your crying session may leave you feeling more refreshed and rejuvenated if you connect your feelings about the movie with your real-life experiences.

Reading a notoriously sad, punch-in-the-gut book can help put you in the proper headspace for a good cry—especially if the book covers themes similar to your own grief and sadness. For example, reading Marley and Me by John Grogan can hit hard if you’re coping with the loss of a pet, while My Sister’s Keeper by Jodi Picoult might pull at your heartstrings if you’re struggling with a cancer diagnosis in your family."

Go through an old photo album or pull up pictures online and allow yourself to gaze at each one for as long as you want. Remember the good times you had with the people in the pictures, or how much you loved a particular place. Looking at old texts and social media posts can also be a way to stir up emotions about a deceased loved one or a place you aren’t able to visit anymore."

If you’re having trouble invoking a sad moment from your own life, try inventing a sad scenario for yourself, like how you would feel if your loved ones were no longer around. Really try to capture this headspace—if you feel emotional enough, the tears might start falling."

Let’s say you have a sibling who survived a severe car accident, or a relative who beat a difficult medical diagnosis—thinking about what they went through and appreciating how they’re still with you could lead to an emotional, tear-filled moment.

Force your eyes open for an extended period of time (at least 20 seconds) until tears start to build up. Then, see if you can connect that teary sensation to a recent emotional experience, so you can enjoy a more cathartic, emotional cry. For instance, you might think about a recent break-up after staring at the wall for 30 seconds. With your eyes already teary, it might be easier to start crying as you think about how upset you are. Keep in mind that the act of staring without blinking won’t yield an emotional cry. You’ll have to do some extra legwork to yield all the benefits of a good cry.

Once your eyes start to water and tear up, focus on a sad or upsetting event to help get some emotional tears flowing. Yawning multiple times won’t create the emotional cry you’re looking for. It may help to do other sad activities (like listening to sad music) to help those tears flow."

Many people find the shower to be an ideal spot to let out their emotions—it’s private, and the sound of the water can help muffle the sounds of your crying (if you’re concerned about someone overhearing you). Some other great spots to cry could include your bedroom, your car, or any other place where you can be alone with your feelings. Make sure that you’re in a spot where you feel truly safe and comfortable. Crying in your bedroom, for example, might feel more cathartic than crying in a public bathroom.
