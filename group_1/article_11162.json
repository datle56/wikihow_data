As a free-style option, use different colors of fabric paint and a thin paintbrush to create a picture or design, such as a dog, flower, or piece of fruit, on a pocket of a shirt. You can also use bottled fabric paints that come in a squeezable form."

[17] X Research source For example, trace a symbol like a star or heart onto the back of your shirt. Cut out the star using scissors and then replace the shirt material you just removed with lace. Choosing a lace that’s a different color than the shirt will help the lace pop. Choose a shirt made of fabric that will hold together when cut into, such as cotton, flannel, or linen."

Sew a section of lace onto each side, adding width to the shirt and making the sides partially transparent. [18] X Research source For the arms, cut off the sleeves to create a sleeveless shirt and then use lace to create wider arm holes, if desired. If you'd rather the sides not be transparent, you can use a different type of material that goes with the shirt, such as flannel, cotton, or fleece. This process should work with most fabrics, but you may need to fold over and sew fabrics that fray easily."

[19] X Research source Make sure you space the lines evenly beforehand. Using a pencil to sketch out the lines before cutting is a good idea. To make sure the lace or ribbons stay in place, you can sew a few stitches into each section."

After shaking up a bleach pen, use the pen to write wording on shirts, draw symbols on pants, or decorate any other piece of clothing that isn’t a white or light color. Rinse the article of clothing in cold water after the bleach sets. [20] X Research source How long you let the bleach sit on the clothing will depend on the color of the shirt and how bright you want your design. Read the bleach instructions to get a more accurate idea of how long you should wait. Place a piece of paper or cardboard in the middle of the article of clothing to keep the bleach from bleeding through to the other side. It'll be harder to see a bleach design on a light color such as yellow, pink, or a pastel color, meaning you'll need to leave the bleach on longer than you would a dark color such as navy or black. Check your piece of clothing while it's bleaching to see if it's light enough."
