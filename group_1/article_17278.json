The formula is s u r f a c e a r e a = 6 x 2 {\\displaystyle surfacearea=6x^{2}} , where x {\\displaystyle x} equals the length of one edge of the cube. [1] X Research source To find the volume of a cube, you need to multiply its three dimensions (length, width, height) together. [2] X Research source These dimensions correspond to the length of the edges of the cube. Since all the dimensions (edges) of a cube are the same, in order to find the volume of the cube, you first have to determine the length of one of its edges. Since finding the surface area of a cube also requires the length of one edge, if you know the surface area, you can work backwards to find the length of one edge, then use the edge length to work forward to find the volume."

If you already know the length of one edge of the cube, you can skip the following steps and plug in that value for x {\\displaystyle x} into the volume of a cube formula: v o l u m e = x 3 {\\displaystyle volume=x^{3}} . For example, if the surface area of your cube is 96 square centimeters, your formula will look like this: 96 c m 2 = 6 x 2 {\\displaystyle 96cm^{2}=6x^{2}}"
