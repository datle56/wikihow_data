      "content": "Give each lovebird 1.5 to 2 ounces (45-60 g) of pellet food a day. Pellet food is the ideal food for lovebirds, as it is formulated to give your birds the nutrients they need. Ensure about 70 to 80% of your birds’ diet comes from pellet food to keep them healthy. [1] X Research source Make sure the pellet food contains natural ingredients and no additives or preservatives. Note : Pick pellet food based on the age of your lovebirds. Baby lovebirds need different pellet food than mature lovebirds (which are 10 months or older).
