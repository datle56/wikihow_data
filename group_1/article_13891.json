    {
      "title": "Write the title about one third of the way down the page.",
      "content": "Write the title about one third of the way down the page. The title should follow normal title capitalization standards: the first letter of each word should be capitalized with the exception of very short words such as articles or prepositions (e.g. the, and, of, or, a, an, in, to, for). Note that the very first word of the title should be capitalized, regardless of what kind of word it is. Do not punctuate your title. It does not need to have quotation marks around it, it should not be underlined, and it should not be in italics. If, however, there is a quotation or a reference to a longer work in your title, that should be punctuated accordingly. For example, \"To Be or Not to Be:\" An Analysis of Hamlet's Soliloquy contains a quote, while An Analysis of Inaction in Shakespeare's Hamlet contains the title of the play, which should be italicized."
