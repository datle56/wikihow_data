Place a brush or comb at your crown and drag it forward to section off the hair for your bangs. Only brush the hair on top of your head for this! The sides should hang down like they normally do.

Then, comb the sectioned hair forward to smooth it out and get rid of any knots. [6] X Research source If you have any hair clips within reach, clip the lengths of your hair back instead of tucking them behind your ear."

      "content": "Slide your fingers down and stop where you want your bangs to end. The length is up to you, but if you have a long face or big forehead, go with longer bangs. The shorter your bangs are, the more length you add to your face. Once you reach your desired length, gather all of the hair in the center of your face. Don’t forget to keep your length marked and your fingers horizontal! [8] X Research source This is the length at the center of your bangs. The sides will be about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) longer. [9] X Research source For example, if you want bangs that graze the top of your eyebrows, stop there. Your bangs will gently round out to about temple length on each side, creating a soft, inverted U. This is a pretty standard length and tends to flatter most faces. If you want face-framing curtain bangs, stop at the bridge of your nose. If you want long bangs that blend in with your first layer, stop at cheekbone-level. [10] X Research source"

[14] X Research source This technique creates bangs with a gentle, inverted U-shape. If the length looks slightly off at any point along the U, hold the scissors horizontally and make tiny snips to take off the extra length."
