      "content": "Talk to your doctor. It's crucial to talk to your doctor (possibly an allergist) if you suspect you have a food allergy. They will be able to guide you on what's appropriate as far as diet, diagnostic tests and treatment. Tell your doctor about your symptoms. While a food allergy can cause some of the same symptoms an intolerance or sensitivity, other symptoms include: rash, hives, itchy skin, shortness of breath, chest pain, or even a sudden drop in blood pressure. A food allergy usually comes on suddenly after exposure and can be life-threatening. [1] X Research source Never start a restrictive or elimination diet prior to talking to your doctor or a allergy certified registered dietitian. Do not eat any foods that you think could cause life threatening allergic responses unless under the care of a physician. If symptoms do not resolve after eliminating the suspected offending food, go back to the doctor for further evaluation."

      "content": "Start a food/symptom journal. Logging all your meals, snacks and beverages along with any symptoms you may experience can help you figure out what type of sensitivity you have and to what food. It will be difficult to determine what food is causing you symptoms without a journal. It might be wise to do your journal by hand. Start with a notebook and jot down everything you consume (including any supplements or medications) and symptoms you experience. Many food journaling apps are not detailed enough for what you should be tracking. Make sure to note the time you ate and the time you experience symptoms (if at all). Typical food sensitivities symptoms may include: nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, diarrhea, fatigue, rashes, and gas.

For example, some individuals have an extreme lactose intolerance (meaning they cannot tolerate any lactose), but others may have a mild lactose intolerance (and can tolerate small doses of lactose). By logging how much you eat, you can gauge the amount of your body will tolerate without adverse symptoms."

      "content": "Eat a regular diet for two weeks. To help you decide what food is giving you trouble, you actually need to consume that food. You'll need to trigger the symptoms to be able to associate those symptoms with a specific food and then avoid them to see if symptoms disappear. Continuing with a regular, non-restrictive diet may not be comfortable, but producing symptoms will help point the finger at the suspected food. Only upon elimination of the food and resolution of symptoms will you have an accurate answer. You may only have one symptom or you may experience multiple symptoms. They usually begin between 30 minutes and two hours after the food is consumed.

      "content": "Eliminate lactose-containing products. Identify foods containing lactose and eliminate all of them from your diet. If you are lactose intolerant, symptoms you were experiencing during the non-restrictive diet should be alleviated and discontinue. Milk and milk products contain the sugar lactose. Foods that are mainly dairy or have been made with dairy will contain lactose in varying amounts. Check ingredient lists on all products. Some lesser known dairy products that contain lactose are whey, caseinate, malted milk, milk derivative and milk solids. The lesser known dairy products are usually used as an ingredient in another type of food. Avoid antacids. Many antacids contain lactose and will make the symptoms worse. Discuss medication options for other alternatives to acid reducers with your doctor if you feel it is necessary. If symptoms continue after two weeks of a lactose-free diet, you most likely have a different food sensitivity. Dairy and other lactose containing products can be added back into the diet. If you add lactose back to your diet and your symptoms worsen, you may have dual sensitivities and lactose is only part of the problem. Continue to keep lactose out of your diet."

If you have a gluten sensitivity any symptoms should resolve after you discontinue eating gluten containing foods. Wheat and wheat products contain gluten. Also, other grains, such as barley and rye contain gluten. Gluten is in a wide range of foods and can be very hard to avoid. It is found in most breads, beer, other baked goods and pasta.

Gluten may be added to foods for its functional properties, and may be on the ingredient statement as vital wheat gluten, wheat gluten or just gluten. Also, malt contains gluten and is often added as a flavoring to many processed foods (like soy sauce). Some other lesser known ingredients containing gluten are Atta flour, bulgur, couscous, farina, graham, wheat bran, wheat germ, wheat starch, triticale and matzoh.

      "content": "Take a lactose tolerance test. If you feel compelled or a doctor recommends a concrete diagnosis, you can take one of the three tests used by medical professionals to determine lactose intolerance. The blood lactose tolerance test will measure how well your body digests lactose. It is done by drinking a lactose solution and then having several blood samples drawn over a period of time. This test is mainly used for adults. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The hydrogen breath test measures amount of hydrogen during respiration. The more hydrogen that is breathed out, the better the body is digesting the lactose. This test is non-invasive and used for adults. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stool acidity test. The stool acidity test measures the acidity of stool after consumption of lactose. The more acidic the stool, the less the body is able to digest lactose. This test is mainly used for children."

      "content": "Talk to a registered dietitian. Living with food allergies or sensitivities can be difficult. This is especially true if you have an issue with more than one food. Restrictive diets or fear of foods may cause you not to eat a balanced diet. A dietitian can help you find a diet that's appropriate for you. Cutting out or eliminating the offending food is one of the only ways to deal with sensitivities. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, an overly restrictive diet may not provide your body with the recommended amount of a variety of essential nutrients. Review your medical history, thoughts on what your offending foods are and your food and symptom journal with your dietitian. They are nutrition experts and will be able to provide you with a meal plan and food substitutes that will not cause a reaction."

This will help other health professionals and yourself as you continue to modify and change your diet. Food and symptom journals are also incredibly helpful to allergists, dietitians and other health professionals. They may see patterns or trends in your journal that you do not. If you have a flare up of symptoms again, you'll be able to return to your journal to see what the offending food was and how to replace that or avoid it in the future."

Avoiding most or all foods with lactose will be the primary way you will avoid symptoms long-term. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, it's important to replace nutrients commonly found in lactose containing foods. Lactose containing foods are generally high in calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus. You can get these nutrients from other foods like: broccoli, canned salmon, fortified juices, pinto beans and spinach. There are many lactose free and lactose reduced milks, yogurt and cheese. These types of products may not be easy to find and have a slightly different taste than the original, but work great as substitutes. All vegan products, like vegan cheese, will also not contain any lactose. These are a safe bet when purchasing dairy alternatives. Take a lactase enzyme supplement. These are pills that can be taken before the consumption of lactose to help digest the lactose. They are sold at most pharmacies and health food stores.

Again, it's important to replace any nutrients that were found in gluten containing foods. The biggest and most common source of gluten is wheat (followed by barley and rye). Common nutrients found in these grains are folate, thiamin, riboflavin and other B vitamins.
