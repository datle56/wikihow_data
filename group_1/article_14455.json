[2] X Research source You may draw arrows on the ends of the line to indicate it is a number line that continues past your data sample. Put the label \"X\" to the right of the line to indicate the x axis. Mark the center of the line with a vertical tick mark and label it 0. This is the origin of the graph. Make equally spaced tick marks on the rest of the x axis. For this example you should label the tick marks from 1 to 10 on the right side of the 0."

For every possible value on the x axis there will be a corresponding value on the y axis. [4] X Research source To calculate the value of y, plug a number into x. If x= 3 then f(x) = 6. Only positive values will be used in this example. Set x = 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. The corresponding y values are 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. The result is a set of ordered pairs represented with the x, or abscissa, first and the y, or ordinate, second. For our example we will have five ordered pairs: (0,0), (2,4), (4,8), (6,12), and (8,16)."
