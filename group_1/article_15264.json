      "title": "F3 E1 means your machine isn’t detecting the water level.",
      "content": "F3 E1 means your machine isn’t detecting the water level. All F#/E# errors are system error codes, which means a sensor is detecting bad data. [1] X Research source In the case of F3 E1, the water level isn’t being detected. Your machine won’t fill or run when this happens since the machine cannot determine if the water is about to overflow. This will often happen at the beginning of cycles when the drum is filling with water, or at the end of a cycle when the drum starts emptying for the rinse cycle. The water level is usually perfectly fine whenever the F3 E1 pops on. This error will trigger the exact moment the water level isn’t accurately being tracked, so it shouldn’t cause flooding to run your machine most of the time."
    },
    {
      "title": "The water pressure sensor is bad.",
      "content": "The water pressure sensor is bad. This is the most common cause of F3 E1 errors. The pressure sensor is the electronic component that interprets the data being fed from the hose. If the sensor goes bad, your machine won’t know where the water level is and it will shut off. [2] X Research source There are three components to your washer’s water detection system: the sensor, hose, and switch. In most cases, the sensor is to blame for F3 E1 errors."
    },
    {
      "title": "The pressure switch hose is blocked or loose.",
      "content": "The pressure switch hose is blocked or loose. The switch hose is an empty hose that runs from the top of the machine to the pressure sensor and switch. All it does is carry air from the top of the machine to the switch and sensor. But if that hose gets blocked somehow or becomes loose, the sensor and switch won’t be able to interpret the air pressure at the top of the drum. [3] X Research source The hose is tucked inside the machine's housing, so you can’t check it without disassembling the washer."
    },
    {
      "title": "The water pressure switch is bad.",
      "content": "The water pressure switch is bad. If your machine overflowed or it won’t fill at all, it’s probably the pressure switch. This component flips on or off automatically whenever the hose and sensor determine whether the machine needs water or finally has enough. If the switch isn’t working, the water won’t turn off or turn on at all. [4] X Research source This is a pretty rare failure since the switch is a pretty rudimentary component compared to the sensor."
    },
    {
      "title": "The control unit for the washer is bad.",
      "content": "The control unit for the washer is bad. The control panel is the big panel on the top of your machine with all the wash settings for your cycles. That panel is controlled by a central control unit. If that unit has failed in the middle of a rinse or fill cycle, you may get the F3 E1 error on accident. [5] X Research source This is a pretty fringe problem. If the control unit is bad, you won’t be able to operate your machine at all after clearing the F3 E1 error."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reset your machine to clear the error code.",
      "content": "Reset your machine to clear the error code. In most cases, a single E1 F3 error indicates a meaningless bug. Your sensor probably just briefly lost track of the water level, and the code flipped on. Unplug your machine, wait at least 1 minute, then plug the machine back in. If there’s water in the drum, run a drain-only cycle. Then, re-run your wash cycle. [6] X Research source If the code never comes back, your washing machine is just fine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Contact Whirlpool if the problem occurs again.",
      "content": "Contact Whirlpool if the problem occurs again. If this problem happens again or your machine overflowed, close off the water valves and unplug the machines. Call 1-866-698-2538 in the US, or 1-800-807-6777 if you’re in Canada. Whirlpool also has a live chat feature if you don’t want to talk to anyone on the phone. If you are extremely handy and don’t care about the warranty on your machine, you can try replacing the switch, hose, and sensor yourself by unplugging the machine, removing the two back panels, and swapping each piece out for replacements. [7] X Research source Whirlpool explicitly advises against this, though, and fiddling with the sensor may void your warranty. [8] X Research source"
