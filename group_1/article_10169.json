      "content": "If you had a big blow-up, it is probably best that you take a break from each other for a few days to calm down and reduce your anger levels. This will also give you both a chance to reflect on the situation, your motives, and your emotions. You’ll be able to talk to each other much better when you are both less upset. [1] X Research source If you hang out in the same circle of friends, continue spending time with them, but only when your friend will not be there. Even if you have calmed down, there will still be some tension between the two of you until the matter is resolved, which may make your other friends uncomfortable. Don’t text or communicate through social media. If it is upsetting to you, consider hiding your friend’s posts from your feeds until the two of you have cleared the air. Reader Poll: We asked 546 wikiHow readers how they would apologize to a friend, and only 5% said take them out to their favorite restaurant or activity. [Take Poll] So, if that doesn’t work, give yourself time to cool down before engaging in conversation."

Did you exhibit behavior that routinely causes you problems? If you see a pattern of behavior in your life that contributed to the fight with your friend, consider examining that behavior more closely and taking steps to change it. For example, perhaps you contributed to the fight by blurting out some hurtful words before you really thought them through. If you have a history of speaking before thinking, you might want to look into ways you could address that problem and prevent future, similar situations from happening. You could spend some time writing in a journal about your thoughts and feelings. Talk to another friend or someone you trust about how you are feeling. Maybe that person can offer their own perspective on your situation. [2] X Research source"

This will help you both stay calm, making you both better able to listen to each other without getting defensive. If you find yourself getting angry again, take a few deep breaths. If you feel unable to control your anger, you could say, “I’m sorry, I thought I was ready to talk about this. I guess I need a few more days.”"

      "content": "Shoulder your share of the blame and apologize for your role in the fight. Most likely, you are not blameless, and have something you can apologize for. Apologies can be difficult, but don't ignore the fact that you did something that hurt someone you care about, even if it seems small. You could say, “I’m really sorry we got into that fight the other day. I realize that I said things that really hurt your feelings. I was angry, but that doesn’t give me the right to be hurtful. I’m so sorry I upset you.” When you apologize, make sure you take responsibility for how your behavior hurt your friend. For example, “I’m sorry that I hurt your feelings,” acknowledges responsibility, but “I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings,” makes it sound like you don’t acknowledge that your behavior was wrong. [3] X Research source Tell your friend how you will change your behavior, so your friend doesn’t need to be concerned you will do it again. For example, “I didn’t realize how making fun of you like that would really hurt your feelings, but now I understand why it did. I promise I won’t joke about that again.” [4] X Research source"

You could write, “I wanted to write you a letter to let you know how sorry I am about what happened. I want to explain my side, but I also understand why you are angry with me.”"

You could try to talk to the friend about it, but if they refuse, you may need to let it go. Losing a friend can be painful. It’s okay to be sad and grieve the loss of your friendship. Spend time with your other friends, and talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling. You could also take up a new activity with new opportunities to meet people, to help yourself stay busy. Remain polite to your friend and say hello to them when you see them. Respect your friend’s need for distance, and don’t try to force your way back into your friend’s life. The close nature of your relationship may change, but you may find that in time you can talk to one another again. You may even be able to rekindle your friendship at some point down the road. Friendships grow and change with age and life, just like people do. [8] X Research source"

It can feel awkward, but you don’t have to put your whole social life on hold because one person is upset with you. If your friend has turned others against you, you may be feeling isolated. Stand up for yourself without trying to turn others against your friend. You could find a friend you are close with and say, “I know Laura has told you about our fight and now you’re mad at me, too. I didn’t want to talk about it because I didn’t want people to feel like they had to choose sides.
