      "content": "Wear complimentary colors. Modern fashion includes all sorts of styles and color combinations, but there are certain colors that clash together and should not be paired up. To create an outfit that is complimentary together, keep color in mind. Colors that are directly opposite of each other on the color wheel are considered complementary such as blue and orange, pink and green, and yellow and purple. Wearing complimentary colors creates an attractive, color-rich palette. For example, you could wear a pink shirt with a green cardigan, or a blue skirt with an orange sweater. Keep the color wheel in mind, but do not be afraid to match other colors you think work well together."

Here is a list of pieces you should invest in and how to wear them: A plain white T-shirt is great on its own or for layering. You can wear it under a sweater, over a tank top, paired with a cardigan, tucked into a skirt, or left free with a pair of jeans. A striped shirt, in any color, looks great with a solid, floral, or plaid skirt or jeans. Add your favorite cardigan, and you will create a classic look. Dark denim looks great on everyone. Whether the jeans are skinny, bootleg, or flare cut, they will pair perfectly with a striped shirt, floral blouse, or sweater. Over-sized cardigans are a must have for current trends. You can never have too many cardigans to pair with your T-shirts, blouses, tank tops, or button downs. Start off with basic colors such as black, blue, and brown, and then accumulate more in brighter colors and designs that you can pair with just about any top."

Allow yourself several options for shoes, and just be sure they are all comfortable. Ballet flats are the perfect shoe to dress up or dress down, and they are very comfortable. Have a black and brown shoe option. This will help you always have a pair of shoes to match any outfit. Steer away from wearing high heels to school. Unless you have a special school function, there is no need for a shoe over three inches. If you do wear a shoe like a stiletto, you might get other students questioning your shoe choice."

Opt for more delicate pieces when you are trying to create a look that is school appropriate."

No matter what season it is, layering your tops together with a great pair of denim is always a great look. Here are some wardrobe ideas to follow: Always start with a basic T-shirt. A white T-shirt is good for everyday, but you can mix up your look with a variety of colors in a crew neck or V-neck cut. Add a polo or button down shirt over your plain T-shirt. If you are wearing a colored T-shirt, be sure that the shirt you wear over is complimentary. So if you are wearing a red T-shirt, try wearing a blue polo, or a blue checkered button down. Wear a hoodie or cardigan. Depending on the season, you can add a third layer to keep your look interesting. Cardigans and hoodies are better to leave neutral so you can combine them with more pieces. Try a beige cardigan over your blue checkered button down, or a black hoodie."

      "content": "Be sure your clothes fit well. Any attention you receive for your clothes should be positive, and not because your shirt is ultra low, or your pants are too tight. You do not want to find yourself breaking school rules and getting in trouble for inappropriate clothes. School is a professional atmosphere, so you should dress the part. Always check your clothes throughout the year for a proper fit. A top that may have once fit you perfectly, might now be riding a little too high on your stomach. Use these steps to check your clothes before you leave the house: Raise your arms in the air, and if your stomach shows, do not wear it to school. Bend over and touch your toes to check your pants. If you find that your underwear sits higher than the top of your pants, it may be time to get rid of them. Bend over, and check the top of your shirt. If you have a lot of cleavage showing, pick a shirt that is more conservative. Do not wear a shirt that shows your bra strap. Many schools require you to have at least three fingers of coverage on your shoulders. Check the length of your skirt, dress, or shorts by putting your arms straight down by your side. If the length is shorter than your finger tips, it is not appropriate for school."
