Unfortunately, dwelling on the negative will not do anything to keep your partner safe. Instead, try to be positive and optimistic at all times. If you find yourself worrying, you can call a friend or read a book to distract you. Occupying your thoughts with other activities prevents you from worrying too much because you are busy with other things."
