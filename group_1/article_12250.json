      "content": "Omit the shampoo and “co-wash” your hair. Also called the Curly Girl Method , omitting the shampoo and washing the hair with only conditioner works best for overly dry hair, as shampoo might do more harm than good. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a sulfate-free shampoo if you want to use one.",
      "content": "Use a sulfate-free shampoo if you want to use one. If you do choose to use shampoo, it is very important that you use a gentle one that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) which can be too harsh and damaging for curly hair and can cause frizz. [2] X Research source Choose a shampoo that contains natural oils like grape-seed or sage oil, which will clarify and maintain moisture in the hair. Apply a little bit of shampoo on the top of your head and massage it onto your scalp. Focus on the roots since they form the most oily part of your hair. Let it rinse towards the ends of your curls."

    {
      "title": "Condition",
      "content": "Condition your hair after shampooing. Be generous with the amount of conditioner you use. Apply it on the top of your head, and massage it onto your scalp, just like you did with shampoo if you used one. Concentrate the conditioner towards the ends of your curls. This way, your hair won’t lose its natural oils and get dry. [3] X Research source Make sure to use a conditioner designed for dry and damaged hair, even if the label does not specifically say “for curly hair.”"

      "title": "Use deep conditioner once or twice a week.",
      "content": "Use deep conditioner once or twice a week. Before you shower, you can apply a deep conditioner like coconut oil to your hair once or twice a week. Before showering, apply it to your hair, focusing on the ends of your curls, and wear a shower cap. Leave the deep conditioner in for at least 10 minutes. The steam will soften and moisturize your hair as you wash your body first. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a leave-in conditioner or cream by smoothing it onto your hair. After you step out of the shower, apply a leave-in conditioner or cream onto your hair to make sure it stays moisturized, and frizz free throughout the day. At this point, make sure your hair has no tangles left. If it does, gently untangle your hair with your fingers and then give it another rinse in the sink, making sure to reapply your conditioner."

      "title": "Get a holding product such as a gel or mousse.",
      "content": "Get a holding product such as a gel or mousse. In order to help your hair hold the curls for a long time, you should use a holding gel or mousse on your curls before shaping them. Try to get water-soluble products rather than alcohol-based ones, that don’t feel sticky on the skin. [7] X Research source Experiment with products and amounts of products until you get the right combination for your hair."

      "content": "Scrunch your hair. After applying a holding product, cup your hair in your hands and scrunch in an upwards motion, holding it a few seconds each time. The more you scrunch, the curlier your hair will be. Keep doing it until no more water is dripping from your hair."

      "content": "Twirl your hair for ringlets. Take a section of your hair, ranging from 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter. Apply a holding gel or mousse, and twist the section around your finger, making sure to go with the natural curl of the section. This method will produce perfect ringlets. Take a larger section for looser curls, or keep it small for tighter curls. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist your hair in two sections as opposed to one.",
      "content": "Twist your hair in two sections as opposed to one. If you want even better defined curls, try the twirling method except in two sections instead of one. Finger comb each section of your hair, apply the holding gel or mousse, then divide one into two parts, and start twisting them around each other. You can add some coconut oil or coconut butter to the ends to make them softer."

      "title": "Smooth your curls for a faster solution.",
      "content": "Smooth your curls for a faster solution. Instead of scrunching or twirling, try simply smoothing your curls to save time. Start with one section of your hair and apply a holding product. Run your hands down you hair with open fingers, smoothing the curls vertically. When you’re done, switch to the next section. [9] X Research source The smaller your section is, the tighter your curls will be. The bigger your section is, the bigger your curls will be."

      "content": "Smooth your curls with conditioner as an alternative. Also called the shingling method, this technique uses a big amount of conditioner on each hair strand to keep the curls moisturized and defined. Section your hair into four parts. Pick one and make a smaller section. Apply conditioner on your fingertips and run them through the section, smoothing the curl on the way. Lay it down and continue with the next small section."
