      "content": "Nothing happens when you land on the Free Parking space. In a classic game of Monopoly , the Free Parking space is just a resting spot you can land on without having to pay anything. You don’t get a reward for landing on the space, but on the bright side, you don’t have to pay other players or the bank for stopping there. [1] X Research source In Monopoly: Cheaters Edition , you can either draw a Chance or Community Chest card when you land on Free Parking. [2] X Research source If you own the out-of-print Monopoly: City Edition , you gain a Rent Dodge card. When you land on a property owned by another player, you can play the Rent Dodge card to avoid paying rent. [3] X Research source Playing Monopoly with the official rules will make your game go by more quickly so it doesn’t drag on too long."

      "content": "Collect money paid from taxes, Chance, and Community Chest cards. Whenever a player lands on a Tax space or has to pay money from a card they’ve drawn, put the cash in the middle of the board instead of giving it to the bank. When a player lands on the Free Parking space, they take all of the money from the board. [4] X Research source If there isn’t any money on the board, the player earns $100 from the bank instead. Alternatively, you could charge a $5 or $10 fee for passing the Free Parking space without landing on it. When someone lands on the space, they gain all the money. Playing with this house rule makes the game go on longer since players can gain a lot of money when they’re close to going bankrupt and getting eliminated."

      "content": "Draw a random Chance or Community Chest card. If you want to add more variety to your Monopoly game, then let players choose to draw a card from either of the decks. Chance and Community Chest cards may give you a benefit or a penalty, so it can be a risky decision to make. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pay $150 to move to any space on the board. When you land on Free Parking, you have the option to pay $150 to move your piece again. This can help you reach properties you want faster, and it makes the game quicker too! [6] X Research source The out-of-print Free Parking Mini-Game puts a fun twist on this house rule. The game has a wobbly board and small taxi pieces. When you land on the Free Parking space, roll the mini-game dice, and place a taxi on the matching section of the board. If you’re able to balance 5 taxis on the board without them falling off, you can move your piece to any space on the main game board. [7] X Research source"
