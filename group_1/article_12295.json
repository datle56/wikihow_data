      "content": "Preheat your oven to the lowest temperature setting. This is usually between 125º—200ºF (50º—90ºC). A higher temperature risks scorching the outside and not drying the inside. Keep in mind that wedges can take up to 12 hours to dry, so it's best to start the process in the morning."

      "content": "Peel and slice the bananas. To make chips, slice the bananas into 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) rounds. To make wedges, cut the banana lengthwise, then lengthwise again, and slice into desired length. [1] X Research source NOTE: Wedges can take up to 12 hours to dry! Start preparing them in the morning so you don't risk starting a fire overnight. Chips dry much more quickly. For extra crispy chips, slice the bananas into 1/8 inch rounds instead (0.3 cm). This may be easier with a mandoline. If the bananas are mushy and difficult to slice, chill them in the fridge for 5-10 minutes to firm them up. [2] X Research source You don't even need a knife to make wedges! Work your finger into the end of the peeled banana and it should divide into three segments. [3] X Research source It doesn't matter if the banana breaks in the process. You'll want it in smaller lengths anyway. For a large quantity of bananas, soaking them in lemon juice for several minutes before slicing will save you preparation time, but the additional moisture will add time to the baking stage."

      "title": "Dip the pieces in lemon juice.",
      "content": "Dip the pieces in lemon juice. This will add flavor and vitamins, but the main purpose is to prevent the bananas from turning brown. If you don't mind brown chips, you can skip this step. Brushing the juice onto both sides of the bananas will also work. Pineapple juice, lime juice, or any other acidic juice will work instead. You can even use vitamin C tablets crushed in water. If you don't like the flavor of the juice, dilute it in a 1:4 ratio with water and soak the bananas for 3-5 minutes."

      "title": "Place the bananas on a wire rack.",
      "content": "Place the bananas on a wire rack. This raised wire platform exposes every side of the banana to the air and allows excess moisture to drip through. Also ready a cookie sheet or baking pan to place beneath it. The bananas should be in a single layer, not stacked atop each other. It's fine if their edges are touching."

      "content": "Let them bake according to shape and desired crispiness. For chips, this will take 1 to 3 hours. Wedges will take 6 to 12 hours. The longer you bake them, the crispier they will be. Flip the bananas over once about halfway through the baking process. This will dry each side evenly and is especially important if the bananas are placed directly on a baking sheet. The bananas will become crispier as they cool, so remove them when they're still a little softer than you would like."

Peel the bananas and slice them in 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) to produce leathery chews, or slice them 1/16 to 1/8 inches thick (0.15 to 0.3 cm) to make crunchy chips. Chips will take up to 24 hours to dehydrate, whereas leather should be done within 12. Plan accordingly. Slices smaller than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) will tend to stick together when stored. Dip the pieces in lemon juice to prevent the chips from turning brown. This step is optional."

If your model of dehydrator comes with specific instructions for bananas, use the temperature and time listed there instead. Check their progress every 2-4 hours and rotate the tray to ensure even drying. If you decided not to put lemon juice on them, the caramel brown color is a good sign that they're done or nearly done. Otherwise, you can take a sample out to taste test once it's cooled to room temperature. If you leave your chews in too long and dislike the extra-tough texture, continue to dehydrate them and turn them into crisps. This may not work if the slices are extra thick."
