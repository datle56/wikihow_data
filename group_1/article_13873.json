      "content": "Stand without moving your feet. Engage your leg muscles and lift yourself in one fluid motion. Once you've risen to the point that your knees are straight but your back is still arched, lower yourself back down into your original position. [2] X Research source Try not to move your feet at all throughout. Keep your knees aligned directly above your ankles when you are sitting, and do not allow them to extend beyond your mid-foot as you stand."

      "content": "Do 3 sets of 10 reps each. Lift and lower yourself 10 times, then take a little break. Repeat until you've completed 3 sets. For best results, do this series of movements 5 days a week. It may take up to 6 weeks of consistent practice for you to notice results. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place a small object between your legs.",
      "content": "Place a small object between your legs. If your knees tend to collapse inward when you stand, you may need to encourage your glutes to engage more. Doing the sit-to-stand exercise with a small object between your legs can help with this. If you have a small exercise ball, or even a kid’s bouncy ball, this is ideal, but almost any small object can work. Press the ball (or other object) between your legs, and squeeze your legs together to keep the object in place as you stand. [4] X Research source You can try using a small pillow, yoga block, stuffed animal, or book."

      "title": "Sit on an exercise ball instead of a chair.",
      "content": "Sit on an exercise ball instead of a chair. This will throw off your balance, making it a little harder for you to rise up into a full standing position. Using a stability ball helps to strengthen your legs more effectively, and to better tone your core. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Increase the number of reps.",
      "content": "Increase the number of reps. For faster results, you can gradually increase the number of reps you do in each set. Try doing 3 sets of 15. If you’d still like more intensity, you can do 3 sets of 20. You can also increase the number of times you do this exercise per week. [6] X Research source"

Another way to make this workout a little more intense is to hold a dumbbell in each of your hands [7] X Expert Source Alphonso White Certified Personal Trainer, CompleteBody NYC Expert Interview. 24 February 2021. . Try starting with 3 pound (1.4 kg) weights. If that’s not enough, move up to 5 pounds (2.3 kg). If you can get through 15-20 reps without feeling worn out, move up to slightly larger weights. As you continue to work out, move your weights up in 2 pound (0.91 kg) increments approximately every 8 weeks."
