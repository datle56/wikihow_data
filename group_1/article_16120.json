      "content": "Protect yourself with religious or spiritual talismans. From the Star of David to the West African gris-gris, almost all cultures have items and clothing used to protect the wearer from spiritual attacks. Make sure you choose something you actually have faith in. There is not much use wearing something if you don't believe in it at all, as it is stripped of any use or power. Keeping several of these items in the house can also help ward off spirits, such as crosses above the door or shrines to benevolent gods and spirits. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Kindly ask the spirit to leave, avoiding anger or fear.",
      "content": "Kindly ask the spirit to leave, avoiding anger or fear. The reason to avoid fear or anger is two-fold: it both keeps you calm (and thus effective) and prevents the spirit from deciding you're a threat to its safety. Let the spirit know that you mean it no harm, but that the physical world is not their place anymore. Assure them that the spirit world awaits them and they will be safer there. Remember, spiritual possession is not necessarily \"evil.\" Most spirits are simply lost, confused, or still clinging to life, and will leave when asked. If you believe the spirit is evil, try banishing it in Latin: “Ecce crucis signum, fugiant phantasmata cuncta\" (“Behold the emblem of the Cross; let all specters flee”)."

      "title": "Light a sage smudge stick.",
      "content": "Light a sage smudge stick. Carry the sage stick around the house and wave it in a clockwise motion. Let the smoke fill the room, especially any rooms where paranormal presence is felt. Smudge sticks are simply long bundles of sage leaves and stems tied together into a rod of sorts, then lit on the end. You can also crush the dried sage in a small bowl and light this instead, carrying it around to smudge the house. Smudging sticks have been used for centuries by shamans and religious leaders and are one of the few tools used by many different faiths. Some cultures use cedar in place of sage, but either can be used. When smudging a house , crack open a window and take your time—let the smoke calm you and the room, slowly directing it to fill the room."

      "content": "Spread a little holy water around the house. You can get holy water at most Catholic churches, though it helps if you are a practicing member of the faith. Sprinkle it in the corners of rooms, at door and window frames, and any areas where you experience the most physical paranormal activity. You can still get holy water at many churches. Call ahead to make sure they bless water there."

      "content": "Recite prayers against spirits. Choose a prayer that speaks to you or one from your religious faith. Don't underestimate this connection—if a prayer feels useful and powerful, use it. Some common prayers include: The Lord's Prayer [2] X Research source Archangel Michael's Prayer of Protection [3] X Research source The Serenity Prayer [4] X Research source Personal mantras asking the spirits to leave, such as, “Spirit, go now,” or “Spirit, this is not your home.”"

      "title": "Leave out Kosher salt or raw rice.",
      "content": "Leave out Kosher salt or raw rice. These two substances are thought to drive away spirits and malicious energies. If you do, leave a window or door open, as the spirit will need a way to flee the room. If you’re performing prayers or continuing to ask the spirit to leave, repeat these rituals as you spread the salt or rice. Remember that your conviction when doing this is important—if you are fearful or half-hearted, you may not see any results."

      "title": "Try to determine a cause for possible possession.",
      "content": "Try to determine a cause for possible possession. Before seeking professional guidance, use the county records, local papers, social media, neighbors, and other relevant resources to figure out if there could be a reason for the paranormal activity in your home, such as the death of a former inhabitant. As with all adversaries, you and your professional exorcist will be better prepared to fight if you know what exactly you're up against. Knowing the cause of a possession can also help you determine what sort of professional to call, as you could be dealing with religious or secular spirits, depending on your beliefs. The cause of paranormal activity could be easy to see if you uncover a murder that took place in your living room, but the causes for spiritual possession can be much more nuanced as well, from long-forgotten tragedies to deaths that gripped a soul before they were quite ready to go."

      "title": "Consult with spiritual guides or religious leaders.",
      "content": "Consult with spiritual guides or religious leaders. These could be leaders in your faith or spiritual practice, or spiritual mediums or psychics who perform exorcisms. The most important quality of an exorcist, in any practice, is someone who makes you feel comfortable and safe. The Church of England, some Catholic groups, spirit or faith healers, and mediums are all good resources for information about exorcisms. Talk to 2-3 groups, if possible, but know that the sorts of groups willing to perform exorcisms are rare. Most people or organizations willing to perform an exorcism will want to come do a quick investigation of the house before undergoing the exorcism. Know that not every expert will perform an exorcism or spiritual cleansing. They may be able to offer you counsel regarding how to proceed, but not all faiths and practices believe in spiritual possession, or have systems in place to handle them."

      "content": "Observe the spirit’s behavior to aid the professional. Note anything you can of value, and keep a small log of all the paranormal behavior you experience to help accurately fight off the psychic intrusion. This doesn't only include the physical details—oftentimes you can sense or feel out a personality through their actions as well. Do they feel malevolent or mischievous? Do you feel in danger or just bothered? What rooms or objects does the spirit gravitate towards? Are there places they ignore? What brought out the spirit’s presence? When was it first noticed?"

      "content": "Remember that mental fortitude is key to an exorcism's success. Even if it’s scary or frustrating having a spirit in your house, try to stay calm throughout the process. At the end of the day, the power of most spirits depends on the power that you give them. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for signs of paranormal behavior in your house. Remember that very, very few houses are ever possessed, and even fewer are visited by \"evil\" spirits, contrary to what Hollywood seems to think. Look out for: Moving or disappearing and reappearing possessions, especially similar objects or the same object. Electronics turning on and off on their own. Unknown footsteps, doors/windows opening and closing, strange noises, or voices. A feeling like you are not alone, often combined with chills and sudden fear or panic. Specific or recurring nightmares, especially those that seem to direct you to do something. Extremely hot or cold spaces in the house, often confined to small areas. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Rule out the obvious causes of \"other-worldly\" noises and issues first. The need for exorcisms is rare—and there are almost always common explanations for most \"unexplainable\" phenomenon. Houses, no matter how old, all \"settle\" over time. The pieces shift and groan, boards move, and pipes whistle and bang. Older houses do this constantly, and this is the source of most noises. Strange odors and smells commonly come from leaks or trapped moisture somewhere, especially after rains or floods. Open windows, cleaning, and plain bad communication are the cause of most missing objects, not spirits."

      "content": "Take an honest appraisal of your own health and stress levels. If you're already stressed out, not sleeping well, having trouble eating, or feeling generally under the weather, you are more likely to see and feel things out of the ordinary. Don't let the worry of a spirit ruin your mental and physical health—keep taking care of yourself and spend some time relaxing. If the spirits fade away, they were likely the result of an overworked, overtired brain and body."

      "content": "Ignore the alleged spirits as much as possible. The \"spirits\" may disappear as soon as you stop thinking about them. If things still happen or occur more rapidly, you might have an issue to investigate. If there are spirits, they generally need and feed off of your attention, looking to make themselves known. Ignoring them generally keeps them in check if they are actually present. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Have a religious leader, medium, or psychic examine the house. If the activity doesn’t stop, open up to your spiritual leaders and ask their opinion and advice, or consider inviting a psychic/medium to your home to have a look and determine if you need extra help. Oftentimes, all the house needs is a quick energy clearing with a smudging stick or some incense. A psychic or medium can walk you through this or do it for you."
