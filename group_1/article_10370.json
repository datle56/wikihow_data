      "content": "Invest in a bralette . A bralette is a bra that has no padding or underwire. Free from all the usual bra trappings, you don’t have to worry about your cleavage taking over the night. If this still isn’t cutting it, you can go a step further and choose a lace bralette. This version of the bralette is edged in lace and is meant to be worn in public, rather than buried beneath a shirt. The lace will help cover your cleavage and add a romantic touch to your dress.

      "content": "Layer a lace camisole under your dress. Camisoles are basically tiny, body-fit tank tops.

Also, some camisoles have a bra built in, allowing you to skip the bra entirely – whether this is to your advantage or not depends on the dress. [4] X Research source Try wearing a cami that matches your skin tone or the color of the dress for a subtle look, or choose a color that complements the dress if you want to add a little contrast.
