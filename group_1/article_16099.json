Squats are one of the most popular exercises for working out the butt muscles. To do a traditional squat, simply stand up straight with your feet hip-distance apart. Then, bend your knees so they're at a 90-angle and keep your knees lined up with your feet. Your butt should come close to being parallel to the floor. Hold the squat for several seconds. Make sure to keep your back straight. Repeat this several times. If you're new to squats, try them without weights. If you're more experienced, there are several different ways that you can makes squats even more challenging. [2] X Research source Try holding a dumbbell in each hand. You can extend them down towards the floor when you squat, and then raise them up to your chest when you stand up. You can also do this with a medicine ball. Keep your arms out straight in front of you at chest-level. You can also hold a barbell behind your head while you practice squats."

Then take a wide step out to the side with one leg and bend that knee. Squat as deep as you can into the one leg, keeping your other leg extended straight out to the side.

      "content": "Challenge yourself with a single-legged squat. If you're an experienced squatter, you can attempt to lift one leg out in front of you as you squat. This is a pretty advanced exercise, so you may find that you can only lift the leg a little bit, or maybe not at all. Do your best! If this is too much for you, you can practice by squatting with one heel lifted off the floor. [4] X Research source Another way to do a single-legged squat is kick one leg behind you as you squat. You may find that this is easier to do than lifting the leg in front of you. To help your balance, you can shift your torso down so that it is close to being parallel to the floor and extend your arms out straight in front of you. [5] X Research source"

If you want to add some variation to your workout, try adding some squats that require different leg positions. As with all squats, remember to keep your back straight. Try a sumo squat with your feet planted at about twice the width of your hips. For an extra challenge, you can lift both of your heels off of the ground while you are squatting. [6] X Research source For a prisoner squat, start with your feet a little bit wider than the width of your shoulders. Keep your hands clasped behind your head as you squat. Widening your stance even more may make it easier to keep your back straight and your heels on the ground."

Repeat up to 20 times before releasing your squat and then performing the exercise with the other leg. Don't release your squat at all during this exercise if you can help it."

      "content": "Challenge yourself with a leg lift from plank. To work out your core and arm muscles at the same time as you strengthen your glutes, try doing leg lifts from plank (a push-up position). Leave the knee of the leg you will be lifting slightly bent. Then raise the leg as high as you can without moving your upper body. Hold for a second and then release the knee down to the level of your other knee before repeating. [8] X Research source If you can't maintain plank position, start on your knees and elbows (your entire forearm should be on the ground). Then extend one leg out straight behind you and lift it so that it is in line with your spine. Hold for a second, release, and repeat several times before switching sides."

Then step up with one leg, pushing down so that the stationary leg lifts off the ground. Repeat this several times with both legs. You can hold weights in both hands as you do this exercise if you want. The higher the platform, the more you will be working your glutes. If you don't have access to a platform or step, you can get similar results by climbing up a hill, using an elliptical, or using a treadmill at a high incline. Reader Poll: We asked 266 wikiHow readers to tell us their favorite cardio exercise to do at the gym and only 6% of them said the elliptical machine (even though this is known to be a great way to build your glutes). [Take Poll] The elliptical may not be popular, but it could be your secret weapon for building and shaping your butt!"
