      "content": "Choose a parent. Assuming that you have access to both parents' signatures, the first step will be to choose which parent's signature to forge. Studies have shown that there are detectable differences between male and female handwriting. [2] X Research source Therefore, it may be easier to fake a signature of the parent who is the same gender as you, if applicable."

      "title": "Study a signature sample.",
      "content": "Study a signature sample. Once you've chosen which parent to copy, you'll need a sample of that parent's signature. You probably have many basic handwriting samples of that parent lying around the house, but you need an actual signature. Try looking for a personal check your parent has written for someone, or a receipt he or she has signed. Observe your parent's letter stylings, proportions, and height ratios. These are the parts of a signature that are often neglected when someone forges another person's signature, and it makes it much easier to catch the forgery. [3] X Research source Look for signs of your parent's pen starts and stops, as these can also be telling markers of an authentic vs. a forged signature."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice the signature.",
      "content": "Practice the signature. Keep your parent's authentic signature close at hand and practice replicating it on a blank, disposable sheet of scrap paper. Pay close attention to the form of each letter, whether the pen is ever lifted (and if so, where), and the overall hand movement suggested by the signature. [4] X Research source Compare your practice signatures with the real thing. Keep practicing until you achieve a nearly identical replica. As you practice your parent's signature, compare the size and length of the two signatures. Most people use the same amount of space to sign their name, no matter what document is being signed. If your replica signature is noticeably bigger or smaller than your parent's, it will be pretty easy to identify as a fake."

    {
      "title": "Sign the real document.",
      "content": "Sign the real document. Once you've adequately practiced your chosen parent's signature and can make a convincing replica, you're ready to move on to the actual signature. Before you put pen to paper, however, you should be aware of the ways in which even a studied signature could be identified as fake. Hold the pen comfortably. A common trait among people forging a signature is to grip the pen with a tight fist out of nervousness and/or concentration. This produces a very rigid signature, which can easily be identified as a counterfeit. If you must look up to re-examine the actual signature at any point, do not hold the pen to the page. This produces a blot of ink that can be a very obvious sign of forgery. Likewise, try to avoid breaking the signature (to re-examine the original) between letters or in mid-letter. A sudden change in the signature in which the pen was obviously lifted from the page is a tell-tale mark of a forged signature. Aim to replicate the entire first name in one smooth run, then the entire last name in one continuous signature."

If you signed your father's name and he sees a document that he has never seen before with \"his\" signature on it, he will immediately know something is not right. You should also return your parent's original signature to the location where you found it. Lastly, be sure to destroy the practice pages you used to learn your parent's signature. Any sign of a sheet of paper with dozens of signatures on it will quickly tip off your parent that you've forged something in his/her name. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a sample signature. Once you've chosen a parent whose signature you will trace, you'll need to find a written sample of that parent's signature. Look for something your parent would need to sign his or her official signature on, such as a personal check, a receipt, or some official document. If at all possible, find something with a dark, bold signature. This will make it easier to trace that signature through whatever page you will be signing. Be aware that tracing a signature may leave a second line of ink, or at least an indentation, on your parent's original signature. This evidence will be impossible to conceal, and may even invalidate whatever document your parent initially signed. Use great caution when selecting a signature to trace so that you do not ruin any important documents or leave behind any obvious evidence. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Align the two documents and backlight them. The easiest way to trace another person's signature is by aligning the signature line of the un-signed document directly over a sample of the authentic signature. You can do this easily by securing the two documents in place with a paperclip on each side of the document. Be sure that the paperclip extends to cover all four edges of both pieces of paper. [7] X Research source Once the real signature is aligned under the blank signature line on the un-signed document, you'll need to provide a source of light behind or under the authentic document. You can do this by holding the two papers (tightly secured to one another) over a lamp shade or on a window (assuming it's light out). The backlighting is necessary to allow you to see the authentic signature under the un-signed document. Otherwise, unless the un-signed document is printed on thin tracing paper, you will have a very hard time tracing the signature."

Thomas Jefferson used a version of the pantograph, called a polygraph, to create a second copy of every letter he wrote. Similar machines/devices are variously called auto-pens or writing machines, and produce an identical signature when perfectly traced over an authentic signature.

For the purposes of forging a parent's signature, however, you can also trace over an existing signature to create an identical duplicate. You may want to take the ink cartridge out of the tracing pen so that it does not draw over your parent's existing signature, or use a signature that is not important and can be discarded (like a credit card receipt from an insignificant purchase). Try tracing the signature onto a blank scrap of paper before you attempt to \"sign\" the actual document. This will ensure that you get the signature's motion and fluidity down correctly."
