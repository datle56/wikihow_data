    {
      "title": "Know your camera’s features and how to use them.",
      "content": "Know your camera’s features and how to use them. Review the manual that came with your camera. Look up video tutorials for features like exposure, flash, white balance, timers, f-stop, shutter speed, and burst mode. [1] X Research source The more familiar you are with your camera, the better you’ll be able to use it properly and take the best possible pictures. [2] X Research source Besides features that affect the photographs themselves, learn how to check technical elements like how many pictures are remaining on your memory card and the battery status. You don’t want your camera to fill up or die right before the perfect shot."

      "title": "Learn how to angle and frame shots for good composition.",
      "content": "Learn how to angle and frame shots for good composition. Composition is how you align everything within the frame for the best possible photograph . As you line up shots, consider how the subject fills the frame and what the focal point is. Look at the edges and corners of the frame. Ask if the shot feels balanced overall. These simple reflections help you take pictures that are well-composed and interesting to look at. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider the lighting before taking any photos.",
      "content": "Consider the lighting before taking any photos. How a photo is lit affects its colors, white balance, shadows, saturation, brightness, and clarity. Having good lighting is essential for taking quality photographs. Evaluate your environment’s lighting before shooting. Is it warm or cool? Soft or harsh? Natural or artificial? Consider the position of the light source and look for shadows. [4] X Research source Learn three-point lighting for studio photography."

    {
      "title": "Study the rule of thirds, but don’t rely on it.",
      "content": "Study the rule of thirds, but don’t rely on it. The rule of thirds is a guideline where you put your subject along the right or left third of an image (along the vertical lines of an imaginary tic-tac-toe grid). This usually creates a more compelling shot than a simple central subject, explains photographer Crystal Bear. [5] X Expert Source Crystal Bear Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 21 Jan 2021. [6] X Research source Like any convention, it’s not meant to be followed all the time. Learn the rules so you’re comfortable breaking them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use edges and lines for better framing.",
      "content": "Use edges and lines for better framing. Try to use the edges of items or features in the frame—the horizon, fences, roads, furniture, walls, and trees, for example—to guide the viewer’s eye to your subject. Consider the lines that are naturally present in the image and how to frame them for the best possible photograph. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Help subjects feel comfortable posing.",
      "content": "Help subjects feel comfortable posing. Whether you do photography as a hobby and like to use family and friends as subjects or you’re working with clients and models, it’s key to be able to make your subjects comfortable. Learn basic poses you can guide subjects into if they’re unsure how to stand. Encourage them if they’re feeling awkward—model example poses for them to copy. “It helps to build a rapport with the [subject] and let them feel like they're in a safe space. Just joking with them and trying to have fun is really important,” says portrait photographer Jessica McKnight. [8] X Expert Source Jessica McKnight Photographer Expert Interview. 16 Apr 2024. Don’t comment on your subject’s body or attractiveness—keep your comments appropriate and professional. Not every photo has to be posed. If you’re photographing an event like a birthday party, make sure to capture natural moments of people laughing and talking, says McKnight.

    {
      "title": "Consider every aspect of your photo before shooting.",
      "content": "Consider every aspect of your photo before shooting. There’s more to composing a photograph than following the rule of thirds (which is always optional). Pay attention to every element of what’s in your frame. Create a mental checklist and go down it before you snap—you’ll probably make a few tweaks before taking the photo. [10] X Research source Aspects to consider include tone, color, symmetry, balance, contrast, texture, lighting, and your intuition about how the photo should be captured."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include only what’s essential in the frame.",
      "content": "Include only what’s essential in the frame. Get as close to your subject as you can. Use your feet, and use your zoom lens (if you have one) to fine-tune your composition. Leave out anything that doesn't give some important context to understand your photo fully. Often, simple photographs are the most striking and profound. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Learn a photo editing software.",
      "content": "Learn a photo editing software. Taking pictures is only part of being a photographer. A lot of work happens in the editing room. Learn how to use a photo-editing software like Adobe Lightroom , Adobe Photoshop , or GIMP . If you’re shooting RAW instead of JPEG, editing software is essential to control lighting, color, noise reduction, shadows, and focus. [12] X Research source Photographer Stephen Cardone recommends Photoshop for beginners who are looking to get serious with photo editing. It has robust tools and is similar to other Adobe programs. You can also use the native photo editing applications that come installed on your computer. [13] X Expert Source Stephen Cardone Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. If you’re shooting on film, consider learning how to develop film yourself and experiment with adjustments in the darkroom."

      "title": "Alternate between shooting RAW and JPEG files.",
      "content": "Alternate between shooting RAW and JPEG files. Many professionals shoot in RAW format because RAW files are lossless, capturing all the data from your camera’s sensor. This enables you to tweak elements and process the photos in the editing room. JPEG files are compressed and the camera does more of the processing. They look more finished without editing. Try both to find out which you prefer. [14] X Research source Because JPEG files are compressed, they result in smaller file sizes than RAW files, which saves you money because you can use less memory space. If you’re picky about tweaking, say, white balance, shadows, and highlights, you’ll want to shoot in RAW."

    {
      "title": "Try shooting with film, if you haven’t.",
      "content": "Try shooting with film, if you haven’t. Both film and digital cameras have their place in the learning photographer's arsenal. They both have their advantages and disadvantages, and both will teach you a different set of habits. Digital cameras give you immediate feedback on what you’re doing right and wrong. They also reduce the cost of experimentation—you can always delete bad photos. However, you may fall into the habit of shooting without intention and hoping a good photo comes out. [15] X Research source Using film leads to less experimentation because you can’t delete bad shots, but it makes you think carefully before taking photographs. What's more, film has a look all its own. If you already shoot film, then shoot digital as well."

    {
      "title": "Photograph static and moving subjects.",
      "content": "Photograph static and moving subjects. A good photographer knows how to capture the perfect still subject and capture movement and motion. Taking a good movement photo requires a different skill set, as well as technical knowledge to set up a burst or series of photos and reduce motion blur. Example moving subjects include animals, theme park rides, and athletes. [16] X Research source If you’re taking portraits, try to capture people in motion. Whether they’re laughing or jumping, your subjects’ dynamic movement can enhance the liveliness and emotion of your portraits."

      "title": "Take photos every day.",
      "content": "Take photos every day. The best way to develop and improve your photography skills is to take photos every day. Practice really does make perfect. Be intentional with your daily photos, challenging yourself to find interesting framing, subjects, and angles. Don’t wait for the perfect photo opportunity—get out there and find it. [17] X Research source Keep your camera on-hand by taking it wherever you go. With it easily in reach, you’ll feel more inclined to use it. The more photographs you take, the more comfortable you’ll be using a camera. Take note of what works and doesn’t work. After a few months, review your photographs and reflect on the ones you like the most. What makes them feel better than the rest? See if you can articulate your signature style as a photographer."

      "title": "Find inspiration from the works of other photographers.",
      "content": "Find inspiration from the works of other photographers. Look for photographs that make you smile, laugh, cry, or feel surprised. While anyone can learn to take a technically impressive photograph, what elevates a photo to a work of art is the emotion and storytelling behind it. Study a mix of the greats like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Annie Leibovitz, and Ansel Adams and contemporary photographers who are on the rise. [18] X Research source Browse photo books at your local library or view photographs online. Follow photographers you like on social media to get fresh inspiration. Look through pictures in a photography magazine and critique the photos. List two positive things and two things you'd try to change in the photos."

      "title": "Start a project to give yourself clear goals.",
      "content": "Start a project to give yourself clear goals. While tasking yourself to take photographs every day is a good start, you may feel aimless and lose motivation. Counteract this by taking on a photography project that lets you set goals and track your progress. Example projects include doing only night photography for a month, experimenting with negative space, or only photographing one color for a week. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Get inspired by nature and art.",
      "content": "Get inspired by nature and art. Other photographers are a great source of inspiration, but don’t limit yourself to the discipline. Let the beauty of the natural world and the art you enjoy inform your practice as a photographer. This includes visual mediums like painting and film, but also literature, theater, and music. [20] X Research source For example, if you just read a beautiful story set in the countryside, use the book’s vivid descriptions to inspire a photo shoot in a rural area near you."

      "content": "Create DIY camera accessories for unique effects. Resist the temptation to buy a bunch of expensive gear you might not need or use often. Instead, DIY accessories to achieve cool practical effects with your photography. For example, pull a pantyhose over the lens for a dreamy, blurry look. Use your laptop or television screen as a light source for portraits or product photography. [21] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a tripod to slow down your process.",
      "content": "Use a tripod to slow down your process. Not only does a tripod stabilize your camera so you can take clearer shots, but it also forces you to be more intentional with your photographs. The act of setting up and moving the tripod slows you down, so you can be more thoughtful about your subject and composition. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Try different types of photography to find your niche. Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned photographer, it’s never too late to find a niche you enjoy. Try shooting portraits, landscapes, events, animals, products, and food. Experiment with black-and-white, color, panoramic shots, and close-ups. Find the type of photography you have the most fun doing, but don’t limit yourself to it. [23] X Research source"

      "content": "Take a photography course or join a photography club. Formal education isn’t required to become a better photographer, but it could be helpful as a tool for learning, finding community, and staying motivated. Take a photography class at a local community college. Alternatively, find a photography club in your area and connect with your peers. [24] X Research source Study how your fellow photographers work and ask them for tips, especially if they have more experience than you."

    {
      "title": "Ask for feedback on your work.",
      "content": "Ask for feedback on your work. It's good to seek out constructive criticism, as long as you're careful about who you listen to. Posting on online photo critique threads might invite trolls and haters. Listen to fellow photographers, teachers, and people you trust. Ignore feedback that’s mean-spirited or overly critical—the best feedback focuses on how you can improve, not what you failed at. [25] X Research source"

      "content": "What’s the 20 60 20 rule in photography? The 20/60/20 rule says to spend 20 percent of a shoot taking basic or safe shots, 60 percent of a shoot getting creative and taking risks with your photos, and 20 percent of the time trying to capture a once-in-a-lifetime shot. The rule comes from National Geographic photographer Paul Nicklen. [26] X Research source"

      "title": "What are the 3 Cs of photography?",
      "content": "What are the 3 Cs of photography? The 3 C’s in photography are content, concept, and composition. Content is the actual contents of the image—the subject and everything around it. The concept is the idea behind the photograph—the emotion or message you want to convey. The composition refers to elements like framing, lighting, color, and balance—all the choices that inform how the subject looks and how the concept comes across. [27] X Research source Other C’s of photography include cohesion, clarity, and creativity. [28] X Research source"

      "content": "Can I be a good photographer with a phone camera? Yes, you can be a good photographer with a phone camera . Much of what makes a good photograph is conceptual, not technical. Focus on learning how to take good photos with any type of camera. If you want to become a professional, consider investing in a camera that has more features and storage than a phone. [29] X Research source Use editing software to make your photos look more professional."

      "title": "How do you take better portraits?",
      "content": "How do you take better portraits? Limit headspace (the space above the subject’s head), says McKnight. Study angles—specific angles can make someone’s face look thinner or wider. Research and copy poses to help people learn what to do with themselves during the portrait session. McKnight also emphasizes the importance of finding good lighting.
