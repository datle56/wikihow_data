      "content": "If you feel comfortable, you'll appear more attractive. It's great to put effort into your appearance, but that doesn't mean you have to buy a whole new outfit. You'll look (and feel) your best if you wear some of your favorite staples. That dress that makes you feel like a million bucks? That's the right choice, not a brand new jumpsuit you've never worn in public. Remember, you don't have to show too much skin if you don't want to. Wear what makes you feel comfortable. [1] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 13 December 2018. Wear shoes that you've worn at least a few times. That way, you won't have to worry about breaking in a new pair of shoes while you're walking around with your date. If you want to take a fashion risk, try a bold new necklace or pair of earrings. Accessories can be a subtler way to experiment."

      "content": "You want this person to like you for you (including your normal style). If you're a sporty gal that would rather wear Vans than heels, you don't have to pretend to be something you're not. People are attracted to women who are comfortable with who they really are. Wear an outfit that shows off your personality, and skip the trendy items that don't feel like your style. Sites like Instagram and TikTok are great for spotting the latest trends, but they also perpetuate beauty standards that can feel impossible to reach. Remember that the right person will find you beautiful just the way that you are."
