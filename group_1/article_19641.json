Genetics also play a big role in how much and how fast someone can lose weight.\" If counting calories isn’t safe for you, no worries! You don’t need to track your calories to be mindful. Just think about eating until you're satisfied and only snacking when you need to. Don’t rely on food to manage your stress. Instead of reaching for a candy bar, call a friend.
