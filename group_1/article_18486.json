      "content": "Worn or damaged seals A worn or damaged seal is often the most likely culprit of a leaking garbage disposal. The seals are designed to keep water from leaking, but they degrade over time due to repeated use. As the seals degrade, your garbage disposal may become susceptible to leaking, especially if you’ve had it for a long time. [1] X Research source How to diagnose it: Look for any visible damage to the seals around the flange and bottom of the disposal. How to fix it: If your seal has degraded, you need to replace the garbage disposal with a new one. In most cases, seals cannot be replaced. When to call a pro: If you don’t have any experience disassembling or installing garbage disposals, call a pro for this."

      "title": "Cracked housing",
      "content": "Cracked housing Garbage disposals have tough interior shells that house all of the internal equipment, like wires and the motor. As your garbage disposal ages, the shell becomes vulnerable to cracking. When the shell cracks, water can seep through and cause leaking at the bottom of your disposal. [2] X Research source How to diagnose it: Disconnect your disposal, remove the top, and look for any cracks or holes around the housing. How to fix it: Use liquid weld epoxy to seal any cracks and add a bit of extra life to your disposal When to call a pro: If you don’t have any experience disassembling a garbage disposal or your housing is cracked beyond repair, call a professional to replace it."

      "title": "Rust or corrosion",
      "content": "Rust or corrosion As your disposal ages, it will show signs of that age through corrosion and rust, especially if you don’t use it. [3] X Research source Corrosion and rust can gradually break down the structure of your disposal, leading to leaks. If your disposal is showing signs of significant rust or corrosion, you may have to replace it. Consult a plumber to decide what to do. How to diagnose it: Disassemble your disposal and inspect the inside for any signs of rust or corrosion, like red-orange flaking or rusted holes. How to fix it: Use a wire brush to clean away any rust or corrosion debris. Apply liquid epoxy weld to any rust holes and let it dry. Then, reassemble your disposal. This is a temporary solution. If your disposal continues to leak, it’s best to get a replacement. When to call a pro: If you don’t have any experience disassembling your disposal or using liquid weld epoxy, call a pro to replace your disposal."

      "content": "Loose connections If the cords, pipes or wires of your garbage disposal were installed incorrectly, that may be the reason for your leak. For example, a dishwasher pipe that isn’t properly connected can lead to leaks underneath the sink. [4] X Research source How to diagnose it: Inspect the connections around the sink flange for loose mounting bolts. How to fix it: If you find any loose mounting bolts, unplug the garbage disposal and turn off the circuit breaker. Then, tighten the loose bolts with a wrench. When to call a pro: If you suspect the disposal was improperly installed, it’s best to call a pro unless you feel comfortable or have experience with disassembly and removal ."

      "content": "Damaged impeller Your impeller is a spinning object with sharp blades that is responsible for breaking down the food that you put into your dishwasher. The centrifugal force of the impeller attracts the food, while the blades break them down. [5] X Research source How to diagnose it: If the impeller or its blades are damaged, your disposal may hum without starting. How to fix it: If you hear a humming sound, contact a professional for the repair."

Coat the tip of a craft stick with the epoxy and apply enough to cover the hole. Spread any excess around your disposal, then let it dry. [12] X Research source Be careful not to apply too much epoxy to the sides, as it will be difficult to put the top of your disposal back on. If you do accidentally apply too much epoxy and it hardens, take a blade or similar metal object and chip it from your disposal."
