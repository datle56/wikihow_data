If you carry yourself with confidence, your fashion statement will be heard loud and clear. If you're uncomfortable in what you're wearing, it will show.

      "content": "Create your trademark. You can create a memorable trademark by accentuating the parts of your body or personality traits that you love about yourself. We all want to be remembered by something great, and creating your personal trademark is a great way to define yourself. For example, if you're quirky and outgoing, make bright and unique jewelry your trademark. If you love your naturally beautiful dark hair and tan skin, accentuate these features by making your trademark a deep red lip color."

      "content": "Embrace and define your personal style. Your choice of clothing is a reflection of who you are, including what you're interested in, your inspirations, and your aspirations. The more connected you are to your personal style, the more confident you'll appear. Incorporating your favorite music, hobbies, and goals will help you truly connect with your style. Say you're interested in metal bands. Incorporate your favorite band t-shirts into your wardrobe. Dress up your metal tee with your favorite jeans and heels for a stylish look that's completely you. If you aspire to be a corporate CEO, dress the part! Incorporate power suits or sleek dresses into your weekly wardrobe. Dressing to your goals will bring out your inner confidence."

      "content": "Observe others to find inspiration. Fashion is all around you, so look at how other people dress. Study what clothing they're wearing, what colors they're mixing, what shoes they pair with which accessories. When you see an outfit that you like, figure out why you like it. For instance, is it the overall vibe of the look (e.g., preppy, hippy bohemian, rockstar inspired), is it the general color scheme of the outfit, or is it a specific piece (e.g., a great cut jacket, the perfect pair of jeans)?"

      "content": "Imitate outfits that you love. After all, imitation is the greatest form of flattery! Yes, developing a unique sense of style is important, but if you're a complete beginner, imitating others can be extremely helpful. Find an outfit you love and copy it, then keep the parts of the outfit that work for you, and change the aspects of the outfit that don't. If you've found an outfit you love, but the colors don't look good on you, find similar pieces in a more flattering color scheme."

Study your board, and look for patterns of what you see as stylish, then figure out how to add that style to your look. If you find yourself pinning a lot of preppy, nautical themed looks, it's evident that you're drawn to that style. Find your favorite pieces on your Pinterest board, and add them to your wardrobe. Study your Pinterest board for ideas how to style your new wardrobe."

      "content": "Discover which colors work best with your complexion. We all have surface tones and undertones. Surface tones are how we typically describe our own complexions, and can be ivory, light, medium, tan, dark, etc. Your skin’s undertone is the color beneath the surface. The three different undertones are: cool (pink, red or bluish undertones), warm (yellow, peachy, golden undertones), neutral (a mix of warm and cool undertones). There are a few different ways to determine your skin's undertone. Check your veins to discover your undertone. Look at the veins on the inside of your wrist. If they're more blue, you likely have cool undertones. If they look greenish, you have warm undertones. Use the jewelry trick to learn your undertone. Do you look more radiant in silver or gold? If you typically look better in silver, you have a cool undertone, whereas gold usually looks best on a warm undertone. Determine how your skin reacts to the sun. Do you get a golden brown tan, or turn pinkish and burn in the sun? If you fit into the former, you’re warm-toned, while cool undertones tend to burn (fair skin will simply burn, while medium-skinned undertones will burn, then tan.)"

      "content": "Choose a silhouette that best complements your figure. It is important to dress for your body type! Every body is different, and what looks great on one person may not look as good on another. Flattering your shape is a crucial part of looking and feeling confident with your personal style. Triangle/pear body shape: You have a slim upper body and waist, with curvy hips and legs. Wear bright colors, layers, and accessories on top to attract attention. Wear slimming, lengthening bottoms, such as skinny jeans or bootcut pants in darker colors. This will balance out your body beautifully. Circle body shape: You have slim legs and shoulders, and a soft, round middle area. Covering your body in layers can make you look bigger. Instead, create a slimming effect by adding angles and lines across your figure with wrap dresses or asymmetrical hemlines. You should also try dresses with rushing in the middle to hide your tummy and create an hourglass effect. Try a straight leg or bootcut pant, and wear a heel to show off your legs. Hourglass body shape: You have curvy breasts and hips, and a slim waist. Embrace your silhouette with snug fitting tops and bottoms. Wear tiny belts to accentuate your waist, and avoid excessive layering and draping. Skinny leg pants and pencil skirts are especially flattering, and show off your figure. Athletic body shape: You have a naturally sporty shape, and appear more fit than curvy. Your body type can appear boxy with the wrong clothing, so try wearing delicate, feminine fabrics and shapes to compliment your figure. Tops with thin straps, light fabrics such as silk and lace, and high waisted or wide legged pants are flattering on you. Inverted triangle shape: You have broad shoulders, a trim waist and hips, and nice legs. Amplify your lower body to match the fullness of your shoulders; wide-leg pants or long skirts can create balance. Simple and soft tops feminize your strong upper body. [4] X Research source Men's fashion caters to a variety of body types as well. Like women's fashion, it is all about the balance. For example, If you have a smaller upper body, layer with sweaters or blazers."

      "content": "Dress your age. Though there are no set guidelines, certain styles are more appropriate for certain ages. Your 20s are all about self-discovery. Whether you're a party animal, a business entrepreneur, or a free spirit, it's important to experiment with fashion to discover what style fits you best. Your 20s are the time to have fun with short dresses and bold jewelry, or wild bow-ties and ripped jeans. In your 30s, your life is finally starting to fall into place. You're becoming comfortable being yourself, and aren't as worried about following the hottest new trends. Your 30s are the years of adding your touch of flair to wardrobe staples and classic pieces. You should have a few nice suits or dresses in your closet, and be able to dress them up with unique cuff links or one-of-a-kind pumps. When you've reached your 40s, it's time to start pampering yourself. Spoil your closet with a beautiful gown or a nice cashmere sweater. As you mature, allow your closet to do the same. You've made it to your 50s, meaning you've reached the age of fun and eccentric fashion! You've lived, you've learned, and now it's time to let your confidence shine through. Keep it comfortable with practical pieces, while accessorizing with bright sunglasses and costume jewelry. You've experimented with fashion, and in your 60s you know what you love. It's time to let your statement pieces shine: a fur coat, a phenomenal handbag, and all of your diamonds."

Get a comfy pair of sneakers and a good pair of heels in a neutral color. A little black dress is also a must, as is a trenchcoat and a versatile pair of sunglasses. Mix and match these items with other garments you own to create the perfect look for any occasion. You can dress the pieces up or down depending on what you pair them with. For instance, pair the jeans, white tee, and sneakers for running errands on the weekend. Wear the black pants and heels with a nice blouse and the trenchcoat to work."
