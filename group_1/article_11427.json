      "content": "Wash the rind of a watermelon. Use a fruit wash if you have one, or rinse the watermelon under the faucet to remove dirt, germs, and pesticides from the watermelon rind. It’s important to wash the rind because everything the knife touches on the outside of the melon will end up in contact with the watermelon flesh as it slices through."

      "content": "Slice off the top and the bottom of the watermelon. A serrated knife works best for items that have a softer interior and tougher exterior like melons, tomatoes, and breads. Knives must be longer than the fruit you're going to cut."

Note that if you cut along the dark stripes on the outside of the watermelon, then the watermelon seeds will end up on the outside of the pieces of watermelon, making them easier to remove."

[3] X Research source If you have a food-grade vacuum sealer, try placing several slices in a vacuum bag and vacuum sealing them. This is called \"compressed melon,\" and it produces a more tender texture and an amplified flavor by removing most of the air from the melon. Simply vacuum-seal, open, and enjoy!"
