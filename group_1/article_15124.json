As long as you’re part of the Islamic faith, it’s perfectly acceptable to recite du’a for traveling on any type of outing. [9] X Research source In addition to reciting du’a, you could keep a written (or typed) copy with you in your wallet or bag. If you’re traveling with friends or family, you can invite them to recite du’as for traveling with you. It may also be beneficial to make du’as a routine part of traveling; that can help you memorize them (and get a sense of comfort when you travel, or if you start feeling anxious on a trip)."
