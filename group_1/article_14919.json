      "content": "Hide alcohol in other containers. If you want to drink subtly, try to conceal your alcohol in other containers. Pour beer into a soda container. Mix liquor into half a bottle of soda or juice. Pour alcohol into a paper fast food restaurant cup. Pour clear liquor into a mouthwash container. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy a concealed flask.",
      "content": "Buy a concealed flask. Many online retailers, such as Amazon, sell flasks specifically made to help you conceal alcohol. Prices vary depending on the type of flask you get. Most flasks are hidden in clothing. They may strap under a tie or bra or can be secured up your sleeve. [2] X Research source Other flasks are disguised as bags or purses. If you want to drink at an event that forbids alcohol, these devices could come in handy. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a coffee cup to hide alcohol.",
      "content": "Use a coffee cup to hide alcohol. The styrofoam, plastic, or paper coffee cups given out at coffee shops are great for concealing alcohol. Save a cup the next time you get coffee out. If the coffee cup is Styrofoam or unclear plastic, you can use it to conceal virtually any type of alcohol as the liquid will not be visible through the cup. [4] X Research source A clear plastic cup can still be useful. Red wine looks like coffee and you can also mix a dark liquid, like soda or pomegranate juice, with a liquor of your choice. You can also simply spike your coffee. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose vodka.",
      "content": "Choose vodka. Vodka produces less smell than many types of alcohol. It is also easier to conceal as it looks like water to a causal observer. You can easily drink vodka out of a water bottle without getting caught. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Hide odor by creatively spiking drinks.",
      "content": "Hide odor by creatively spiking drinks. If you want to add alcohol to drinks, there are many ways to creatively spike a beverage that masks the odor. Consider some of these tricks. Spike your coffee. Coffee has a strong scent that covers the smell of most alcohol. Adding a dash of liquor to a cup of a coffee is unlikely to cause too much smell. Choose a peppermint flavored drink, like peppermint hot cocoa or tea. Peppermint gives off a strong scent that usually overpowers alcohol. Around the holiday season, non-alcoholic drinks made with flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, and other strong, earthy scents are easy to spike without getting caught. Much like peppermint, these smells are hard to detect."

      "title": "Drink carefully to avoid getting caught.",
      "content": "Drink carefully to avoid getting caught. Be aware of the manner in which you are drinking. Taking extra caution when imbibing can decrease the likelihood of getting caught. If you're using a flask to conceal alcohol, drink when others are not around. Sneak off to a private location to steal a drink. If you're hiding alcohol in something like a coffee container, drink as you normally would. Keep the container in which you're hiding alcohol away from others. If they take a sip or smell the alcohol, you'll end up getting caught. If someone asks to try your drink, make up an excuse. Claim you have a cold or flu and do not want to infect them."

      "title": "Freshen your breath.",
      "content": "Freshen your breath. Alcohol tends to cause bad breath. If you want to hide the fact you're drinking, use mouth wash, breath strips, and mint flavored gum. Try to always be chewing on something with a strong odor, like foods with red onions and garlic, in order to cover up the smell."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use eye drops.",
      "content": "Use eye drops. Some people are prone to bloodshot eyes when drinking. If this is the case with you, try to carry a small eye drop container with you when you drink. You can purchase one at a local drugstore. If you feel your eyes getting itchy, irritated, or dry run to the bathroom and use the container."

    {
      "title": "Stay hydrated.",
      "content": "Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water when you're drinking. Not only can this prevent hangovers, it can help cover up the smell of alcohol. Strive to drink one, 8 ounce glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink. A 8 ounce beer or glass of wine counts as a drink. One shot of hard liquor also constitutes roughly one drink. Sports drinks that contain electrolytes can also be helpful when it comes to concealing alcohol."

      "title": "Keep quiet.",
      "content": "Keep quiet. People tend to slur their speeches when drunk. They also tend to lose track of the volume of their voice. If you're trying to avoid getting caught drinking, try to keep quiet and listen."

    {
      "title": "Know when you've reached your limit.",
      "content": "Know when you've reached your limit. After a certain point, you cannot hide your drinking no matter how hard you try to conceal it. Inhibitions fall with drinking and you'll be less vigilant the more you drink. If you begin to feel tipsy, you might want to stop. You may notice you feel unbalanced or lightheaded. Many people also feel increasingly social and happy when they're beginning to become drunk. If you notice these symptoms, stop drinking."
