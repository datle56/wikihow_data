They come in a variety of different sizes and pressures, but you will probably be prescribed a class 1 (light compression) or class 2 (medium compression) stocking. They’re also available in different colors, lengths (to the knee or to the thigh), and different foot styles (covering your whole foot or stopping just before your toes). [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While compression socks can improve circulation in your legs, you will likely need to wear them all day to see any noticeable results. Replace your compression stockings every 3 to 6 months. Compression socks are not guaranteed to prevent varicose veins from getting worse or prevent new varicose veins from appearing, but they will improve your circulation.

      "content": "It’s an injection that closes the varicose veins with foam. It will cause them to become less noticeable, and they won’t be as visible in your legs. Your doctor can tell you if you’re a good candidate for this procedure. [8] X Research source No anesthesia is needed, but you may need multiple treatments for the same vein. If you’ve had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the past, you may not be eligible for this procedure.

      "content": "Laser therapy is usually used on smaller veins. It’s a medical procedure done by your doctor that uses strong laser light directed at the varicose vein in short bursts, eventually causing it to disappear. The treatment is not generally effective for varicose veins larger than 1/10 inch (3 mm). [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Laser treatments can last for 15 to 20 minutes, and you may need 2 to 5 treatments before you get rid of the varicose veins.

      "content": "Lasers or radio waves will kill the vein with heat, causing it to close. After the vein closes, it will scar over and fade from view. Deeper varicose veins, called saphenous veins, are usually treated with this method. [10] X Research source Your doctor will insert a catheter, or small tube, into the problem vein through which a small probe is inserted. The laser or radio waves are transmitted through the tip of this probe, closing off the vein. Healthy veins around the closed vein take over the flow of blood. Varicose veins on the surface that are connected to the treated vein usually close up shortly after treatment, as well. This is a newer procedure, and it usually replaces the need to surgically remove the veins."

      "content": "Your doctor will tie off the vein and then remove it. They will make small incisions in your leg and then pull the vein out once it’s been tied off. This treatment was more common in the past, but is generally only used for patients who cannot undergo endovenous thermal ablation. [11] X Research source You will receive anesthesia during this treatment, and the treatment will be performed in an operating room. After the veins are removed, deeper veins will usually take over for the veins that are now missing, so blood flow should not be affected."

The endoscope, a tiny camera attached to the end of a thin tube, is inserted into the vein and pushed through. A device on the end of the tube seals the vein shut.
