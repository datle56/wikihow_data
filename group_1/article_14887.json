      "content": "Start off drinking small amounts of kombucha. It's best to start slow whenever you add something new to your diet, especially fermented items. Start with a few sips to get used to the flavor. The first few times you drink kombucha, stick to 3 or 4 fluid ounces (89 or 118 mL) or less 2 to 3 times per day. Kombucha changes your microbiome, or gut bacteria. Drinking a large amount without easing yourself into it can cause an upset stomach. You can get the best probiotic potency by drinking kombucha on an empty stomach. [1] X Expert Source John Burson Certified Nutritionist Expert Interview. 9 June 2021."

The U.S. American Nutrition Association advises limiting consumption to 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) at a time up to 3 times per day. Drinking any more than that doesn't offer any extra health benefits. Other authoritative agencies suggest capping daily consumption at 4 fluid ounces (120 mL), so start from there and see how it affects you.

      "content": "Take claims of health benefits with a grain of salt. Fans of kombucha argue that it can help treat medical conditions ranging from high blood pressure to cancer. However, there's not much evidence for most of the health benefits attributed to kombucha. If it makes you feel good, drink it, but try not to think of it as a cure-all. [5] X Research source There is evidence that the healthy bacteria found in kombucha and other fermented products are good for the digestive system. It also may contain small amounts of beneficial nutrients and antioxidants."

      "content": "Try tasting different flavors of kombucha. Kombucha comes in a variety of flavors, such as ginger, lemon, mango, raspberry, and strawberry. Buy bottles of different flavors at your local grocery or health food store, and see which ones you like best. [6] X Research source You could also look online for nearby kombucha taprooms or tasting rooms. If there's one nearby, you can order flights of assorted kombuchas, and talk to brewers about their techniques and flavoring agents."

      "content": "Go for glass-brewed kombucha with natural ingredients. Check the label, and make sure it notes the kombucha was brewed in glass. Read the ingredients, which should list tea, water, sugar, and culture, along with natural flavorings, such as ginger or citrus. Finally, unless you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, choose unpasteurized kombucha. [7] X Research source Pasteurization kills the good bacteria along with the bad. Since kombucha is acidic, it's safe to drink unpasteurized. Note that pasteurized products are the safest choice if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant. Brewing kombucha in plastic or steel can cause leeching, so products brewed and stored in glass are the best choice. Dark glass is also preferable to clear glass. Dark glass helps filter light, which can damage probiotic bacteria."

Store-bought products that contain less than 0.5% ABV (alcohol by volume) are not legally considered alcoholic beverages. However, be sure to check product labels, as some contain levels of 2.5% or greater. [11] X Research source If you're a recovering alcoholic or can't drink alcohol, avoid drinking kombucha or go for products with an ABV less than 0.5%. If you like trying out new alcoholic beverages, you can find kombucha beer that contain 5 to 8% ABV. Remember to always drink responsibly. Even if it seems like a healthy drink, kombucha beer is an alcoholic beverage with the same content of alcohol as a standard beer."

Alternatively, search online for a local fermented food co-op or a health store that carries SCOBY. SCOBY is an acronym that means “symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast.” These are microscopic organisms that ferment tea and sugar, which turns these ingredients into kombucha. Get your SCOBY from a reliable source. It's a colony of bacteria and yeast, so you want to make sure it's been properly cultured. Always inspect your SCOBY for mold, fungal growth, or strange discoloration before using it. A SCOBY looks like a filmy, light-brown, beige, or deep yellow mat. It's typically stored in the fridge or at room temperature in a small amount of already-fermented kombucha. To avoid contaminating it, wear non-latex gloves when handling a SCOBY. For help in keeping SCOBY safely stored, see How to Store SCOBY ."

Pour the sweetened tea into a 1 gallon (3.8 L) glass jar or container. Once it has cooled to about 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C), add 3 1 ⁄ 2 US quarts (3.3 L) of room temperature filtered or distilled water.

When the sweetened tea has cooled to 72 to 84 °F (22 to 29 °C), pour both the SCOBY and the already-brewed kombucha into it. Then cover the top of the jar with 1 to 2 coffee filters, and secure them tightly over the rim with rubber bands. The starter liquid that the SCOBY is stored in will help hasten the fermentation process. Generally, SCOBY are stored in about 1 cup (240 mL) of already-fermented, unflavored kombucha. If your SCOBY isn't stored in kombucha, you should still add unflavored kombucha to the sweetened tea help encourage fermentation."

Do your best to keep it in a spot that stays at a constant temperature between 72 and 84 °F (22 and 29 °C). The pantry or a cupboard above your stove could be good storage options. If you like to bake bread, think of spots around the house where you like to proof your dough. Warm, dark environments that promote yeast growth in bread dough would similarly encourage your kombucha to ferment."

Make sure your fermented batch has a pH between 4.2 and 2.5. It needs to be acidic in order to prevent harmful bacterial growth, but too much acidity isn't good for you. The lower the number, the higher the acidity. A pH of 2.5 is more acidic than a pH of 4.2, and 7 is pH neutral. If the pH doesn't reach 4.2 in 7 days, discard the batch and start over, preferably with a new store-bought culture. [15] X Research source"

Pour the batch into smaller separate containers, and try flavoring your kombucha with varied ingredients. Add flavoring agents to 6 cup (1.4 L) portions of your kombucha, and use a wooden spoon to muddle them into the liquid. [16] X Research source Try adding 2 ounces (57 g) of fresh sliced ginger and 2 cups (470 mL) of apple cider vinegar to 6 cups (1.4 L) of your kombucha. For a fresh citrus flavor, mix 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) each of lemon and lime juice with 6 cups (1.4 L) of kombucha.

To pause the fermentation process, store the sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 3 months. Within 3 months, use the stored SCOBY to make a new batch of kombucha. Repeat the fermentation steps, and add the SCOBY and the 1 cup (240 mL) of kombucha you've stored it in to freshly brewed sweetened tea. You can continue to reuse the SCOBY to brew batches of kombucha, as long as you refrigerate it to pause the fermentation process and make a fresh batch within 3 months. Just make sure it doesn't have any unusual growths or discoloration. It'll grow larger; if you'd like, cut off 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) slices and give them to a friend."
