Some severe, not funny red flags include: [1] X Research source Gaslighting Love bombing Never apologizing Being rude to strangers Getting serious too fast Previous history of infidelity Lack of emotional intelligence Not respecting your boundaries Lack of friends or social connections Overly controlling or jealous behavior Bashing or bringing up their exes a lot Negatively affecting your relationship with friends and family"

      "content": "People tend to ignore red flags when they‚Äôre infatuated. Clinical psychologist Asa Don Brown says that ‚Äúinfatuation masks the red flags, causing us to be blinded by egregious behaviors.‚Äù When you‚Äôre infatuated with someone, your brain releases love and pleasure hormones, which help bond you to a new person. This creates a euphoric feeling in your body, but also makes it hard to recognize any flaws in your partner. [2] X Research source Infatuation can seriously impair your judgment, and by the time you notice red flags in your relationship, it may be difficult to leave your partner. Denial, pride, and fear of failure can also keep you hostage in a toxic relationship. Some people believe their partner will change so they disregard red flags in their relationships."

While everyone has things they can work on, clinical psychologist Asa Don Brown says you should ‚Äúnever ignore or dismiss red flags.‚Äù Pay attention to toxic patterns of behavior, and address red flags as soon as possible. Bring up the most pressing issue at hand, and use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to describe how you feel. Once you communicate with your partner, set healthy boundaries so you can move forward. [3] X Research source End your relationship if your partner refuses to change their behavior or does not respect your boundaries. Talk to trusted friends and family members about your situation, and establish an exit plan so you can make a clean break.
