      "content": "Blow dry your hair so that it is uniformly dry. Use your thermal protection spray, and blow dry your hair so that it is mostly straight and completely dry. You do not need to worry about styling your hair at this point. You are simply drying it before you style it. If you do not blow dry your hair, you can towel dry your hair, and let it air dry. Give yourself more time for the whole hair styling process if you air dry your hair. Also, do not sleep on your hair before you style it."

Then weave the hair in and out of the pin from side to side creating a figure eight pattern until you get to the end of the pin. If parts of your hair stick out of the pin, that is okay. You will be spraying it with hairspray, and the overall effect will still be achieved. Your hair will make a zigzag pattern on the pin."

Do not use a round brush. If you want to use your fine tooth comb, you can tease the roots of your hair to make your hair more voluminous. You can take an inch section that needs more volume, and from the midsection of your hair to your root, comb downward to create texture and volume. Be aware; however, that teasing damages your hair."
