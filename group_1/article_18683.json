[9] X Research source Carrot on a stick - You will need an undamaged fishing rod in the middle-left box, and a carrot in the bottom-center box. Golden Carrot - You will need a carrot in the center surrounded by eight gold nuggets. Nine gold nuggets can be crafted by putting a singular gold ingot in a crafting table (even the small 2×2 one in your inventory). Rabbit Stew (PC only) - You will need a baked potato in the center, a cooked rabbit in the top-center box, a carrot in the left-center box, a mushroom in the right-center box, and a bowl in the bottom-center box."

Each person will be given a small or large fraction of the potion's original duration, dependent on how close the person was to the splash potion's landing site at the moment it hit the ground."
