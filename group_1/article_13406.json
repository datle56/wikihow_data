      "content": "Test your floor for moisture by taping down a plastic garbage bag. Place a plastic garbage bag on your garage floor and secure it with duct tape on all 4 sides. After 24 hours, gently lift up the corner of the bag to check for moisture accumulation. If the floor is dry underneath, you may proceed with your floor coating. [1] X Research source If there is moisture, your floor is not suitable for epoxy—consider using a different floor coating, such as an acrylic sealant , instead. A floor with moisture present will cause the epoxy to adhere improperly and peel away."

      "content": "Check if your concrete has been sealed by pouring water onto the floor. If the water immediately beads up, a concrete sealer has been used on your floor in the past. If this is the case, it is best to forego the epoxy project, as epoxy and concrete sealant are incompatible. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source If you’re dealing with a newly installed concrete slab, wait at least 28 days (preferably 2 months) before applying the epoxy. This gives the floor time to cure and dry thoroughly prior to coating."

      "content": "Remove any floor paint with sodium bicarbonate and a blasting unit. [4] X Research source An epoxy coating will not seal properly if applied over polyurethane or latex floor paints. If your floor is covered in one of these materials, you must strip your floor with sodium bicarbonate and a blasting unit before starting the epoxy process. A blasting unit (pot blaster) works similarly to a power washer and is available for rent at a local hardware store. Rinse the floor thoroughly with clean water, let it dry overnight, and use an industrial vacuum to remove any remaining powder or debris."

      "content": "Use a degreaser to remove oil and grease stains. Mop your entire floor using an industrial degreaser or solvent-based cleanser according to your product of choice’s directions. After you allow the floor to dry, look for any remaining oil/grease stains. Spot-clean these areas with a concrete degreaser and a stiff scrub brush.

[7] X Research source Using an industrial power washer , spray down the garage floor so that any remaining impurities make their way out of the garage and toward a drain. Allow your flooring to dry out overnight. Vacuuming the floor with a wet vac after each time you expose it to water may be helpful in speeding up the amount of time it takes to dry, as well as removing fallen debris from the cleaning process. Pressure washers are available to rent from many home improvement stores or other rental outlets in your area. To avoid any potential damage to your flooring, use a pressure setting under 1,750 psi."

      "content": "Etch the floor with muriatic acid. [8] X Research source To etch the floor, you will need about 0.25 gallons (950 ml) of muriatic acid (a.k.a hydrochloric acid) for every 50–70 square feet (4.6–6.5 m 2 ) of the floor. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on your product of choice to ensure its proper application. General instructions for etching a concrete floor include: Thoroughly hose down the floor with water. Mix 1 part muriatic acid with 3 parts water in a plastic bucket. Use a plastic watering can or a pressure sprayer to coat the floor with the diluted acid. Finally, wait until the acid stops bubbling (between 2-15 minutes)."

Apply this mixture over the floor to neutralize the acid. [9] X Research source Some muriatic acid products will not need to be neutralized. Review your bottle's instructions to determine whether this is the case. You may also use water and ammonia in a 20:1 ratio to neutralize your flooring, though banking soda is considered safer, as ammonia is a harmful chemical."

Cracks that are 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) or larger, as well as any holes or spalled areas, will need to be filled in with epoxy crack filler. Place the product into the opening of the crack or crevice, then use a putty knife to scrape it down to surface level and smooth it out. Let the epoxy crack filler dry for 4-6 hours."

      "title": "Choose between solvent-based or water-based epoxy.",
      "content": "Choose between solvent-based or water-based epoxy. Solvent-based epoxies adhere well and are available in many colors. The drawback is that these products are extremely hazardous. Water-based epoxies are clear in color and don’t produce hazardous fumes, making for a safer application process. [12] X Research source Both products typically contain 40-60% solids (epoxy). The higher the percentage, the harder your floor will be and the more expensive the product will likely become. Using a ventilator while applying solvent-based epoxy products is mandatory."

      "title": "Buy an epoxy primer if your floor has cracks and holes.",
      "content": "Buy an epoxy primer if your floor has cracks and holes. Epoxy primers smooth out minor imperfections in the floor and give the epoxy a better base to bond to. Additionally, primers add strength and durability to any floor. [13] X Research source Primers must be used on porous, flaky, chalky, or rough floors. Always select a product compatible with the epoxy you plan to use."

This amount can vary based on the percentage of solids in the epoxy you buy, so be sure to check the labels to guarantee you've purchased the correct amount. Purchase enough epoxy to cover your floor in at least 2 coats. [14] X Research source Solvent-based epoxy products are more challenging to find. While some paint specialty stores may carry them, you may need to visit an industrial-supply store. Water-based epoxy products can be purchased at most home supply stores."

Mix all of part A with all of part B to create the amount of epoxy listed. Most epoxy products (including most primers) have a “bucket life” of about 40 minutes, meaning that you must apply the mixture within this time window before it hardens."
