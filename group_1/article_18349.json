      "content": "Pick a unique name to help you tell each group chat apart. Ideally, you should be able to look at each group chat name and know which chat it is (and who’s in it)—and a memorable group chat name can help you do just that! Try picking a name that’s easy to remember and pronounce and relevant to the people in the chat, as well as the overall purpose of the group chat. Avoid using any offensive or insensitive language. It’s okay to be funny, but you should also be respectful. To that end, avoiding using anybody’s personal information in the group chat name (or mentioning it in the group chat) is also important. Try proposing a group name to see if everyone likes it before making the change—and, after all is said and done, don’t forget to have fun with it!"
