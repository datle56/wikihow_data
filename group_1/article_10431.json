      "title": "Cleanse your skin.",
      "content": "Cleanse your skin. Before you begin, it's a good idea to cleanse your tattooed skin with a wipe or a little facial wash. If you have a large tattoo, take a shower or bath. This prepares the skin to receive the makeup. Keep in mind that you shouldn't attempt to cover a tattoo with makeup unless it's fully healed, otherwise you could ruin the ink or develop an infection. Tattoos can take as long as 45 days to heal completely. Don't attempt to cover a tattoo that is fresh and hasn't peeled yet."

      "title": "Apply a light concealer.",
      "content": "Apply a light concealer. Take a heavy coverage liquid or cream concealer that's several shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Alternatively, use a color-correcting concealer. Use a makeup sponge or stippling brush to apply the concealer to the tattoo. Try to dab or blot the concealer onto the skin instead of rubbing it. Rubbing simply pushes the product around rather than adding coverage. As a result, blotting will also help you to avoid wasting too much of your concealer. Once you've coated the tattoo in an even layer, wait a minute or two for it to dry. Don't worry if the tattoo is still visible."

    {
      "title": "Add foundation.",
      "content": "Add foundation. Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone perfectly. Spray foundations are the easiest to work with and provide the most even coverage, but liquid or cream foundations will also work. If you're using a spray foundation, give the can a good shake then hold it approximately 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the tattoo. Spray the foundation in spurts, rather than spraying in a continuous stream. This will prevent you from being too heavy-handed with it. Spray until you have evenly covered the tattoo, then give it 60 seconds to set. [1] X Research source If you're using a liquid or cream foundation, use a makeup sponge or stippling brush to apply the product, using the same blotting technique you used with the concealer. If necessary, use your fingers to smooth out the top layer and blend around the edges."

      "title": "Cover it with translucent powder.",
      "content": "Cover it with translucent powder. Use a large powder brush to apply a layer of translucent powder over the foundation. This provides a matte finish. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spitz the makeup with setting spray.",
      "content": "Spitz the makeup with setting spray. When you are done layering the foundation, concealer, and powder, finish with a light spritz of makeup setting spray. This sets the coverage and will prevent the makeup from rubbing off onto any clothes or furniture. Allow the area to dry before touching it or attempting to cover it with clothing.

      "title": "Do a trial run before the event, if desired.",
      "content": "Do a trial run before the event, if desired. If you plan on covering up your tattoo for a specific event such as a job interview or wedding, it's a good idea to do a trial run beforehand. This will give you a chance to practice your technique and ensure that your makeup is the right color for your skin tone."

      "title": "Use tattoo cover-up.",
      "content": "Use tattoo cover-up. There are many products on the market designed specifically for covering up tattoos. These products are highly effective, due to their heavy coverage and broad selection of colors, which can match nearly any skin tone. The only downside to these products is their cost. Some of the best products include: Tattoo Camo: This tattoo camouflage brand provides a complete kit for covering your tattoo. The product comes in a tube which can be rubbed directly over the tattooed skin with no need for brushes or sponges. The kit also provides a special cleanser for removing the product. The kit is available from their website. Dermablend: Dermablend is a fantastic product which was originally designed by dermatologists to cover up scars and skin conditions. It is hypoallergenic, making it an excellent option for people with sensitive skin. It can last for up to 16 hours. It is also available online.

The kit includes a skin primer, a liquid foundation, a matte powder, and a special applicator."

      "title": "Try stage makeup.",
      "content": "Try stage makeup. Stage makeup provides extremely heavy and long-lasting coverage and is good for tattoos covering large areas of skin. You can use a color-correcting concealer underneath the stage makeup to hide the tattoo. It's possible to buy stage makeup in a variety of skin colors, but you can also use plain white makeup to cover up the tattoo, then use your regular foundation on top to match your skin tone. Some of the most popular and widely available stage makeup brands include Killer Cover, Ben Nye, and Mehron."

      "title": "Get an airbrush tan.",
      "content": "Get an airbrush tan. If your tattoo is quite small or light in color, it may be possible to cover it up with an airbrush spray tan. These spray tans not only darken the skin but also even out skin tone and cover imperfections. Call into your local tanning salon to see if they offer airbrushing services. Show them your tattoo and ask them if they think the treatment would effectively cover it up. At-home spray tan products such as Sally Hansen airbrush legs can also be used to try to cover up small, light-colored tattoos."
