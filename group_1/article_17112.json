      "content": "Check out the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler, the inspiration for Dracula. Vlad III Dracula, a.k.a. “Vlad the Impaler,” was a brutal 15th-century warlord and ruler of Wallachia, a province of modern-day Romania. He was allegedly born in Sighișoara, Transylvania, and you can visit his birthplace. [1] X Research source While there’s not enough evidence to confirm Sighișoara as Vlad’s birthplace, Transylvania is now permanently linked to vampires, making it the perfect place for vamp fans to visit. Vlad the Impaler got his name for his unusual way of executing his enemies, the Ottomans: he would impale them with wooden stakes. (Sound familiar?)"

In the 1400s, Curtea Veche (\"Old Princely Court\") served as a fortress for Vlad the Impaler to protect Romania’s southern border (in what is now known as Bucharest) against Turkish invaders. Today, the place is mostly ruins, but you can visit the famous bust of Vlad the Impaler, still keeping his watch...."

      "content": "Visit Vlad the Impaler’s fortress. Poenari Castle was built in the 1200s, but when Vlad the Impaler came upon the abandoned structure in the 15th century, he claimed it as one of his many fortresses against Ottoman invaders. [2] X Research source Some people believe the castle even served as inspiration for Dracula’s castle in Stoker’s novel, though this isn’t confirmed. In any case, this beautiful and looming fortress—only a few hours away from Transylvania—is well worth a visit for history buffs and vampire lovers alike."

Allegedly, Vlad the Impaler was imprisoned here for 7 years and eventually went mad. [3] X Research source Vlad was reportedly imprisoned by a leading Hungarian noble, John Hunyadi, before being freed and ultimately entering a political alliance with Hunyadi. Originally designed as a sturdy fortress, over the centuries, the castle was renovated to look more fairytale-esque."

      "content": "See the inspiration for Dracula and enjoy the largest goth fest in the world. Gloomy, gothic Whitby, a coastal town in northern England notable for its dramatic abbey ruins and spooky churches, heavily inspired Bram Stoker while he wrote Dracula . [4] X Research source It was in a coffee shop in Whitby in 1890 that Stoker came upon a book about Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. “Dracula,” or “son of the dragon,” and decided to use the name for his novel. The wreck of the Russian Dmitry in Whitby served as inspiration for the Demeter , the ship that carries Dracula to Whitby in the novel. Today, you can visit the ghostly Whitby Abbey ruins mentioned in the novel and wander through the church’s graveyard. Stoker even stole some names for his book from the graveyard’s tombstones! Inspired by Dracula , Whitby plays host to the largest goth festival in the world every October. Come as a Victorian vampire or modern-day goth punk and dance to some of the biggest names in alternative music. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Many of the filming locations from Interview with a Vampire were destroyed in Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but there’s still a lot to see. Aside from filming locations, there's also the Boutique du Vampyre, a store selling vampire books, art, and costumes. There’s also a lot of history to these places: Destrehan Plantation not only figured prominently in the film, but it was also the site of the 1811 German Coast Uprising, the largest slave revolt in the country."

Los Angeles may translate to “city of angels,” but let’s be real, it’s more like the city of vampires (unless you’re thinking of the vampire Angel from Buffy , in which case it’s both). Yep, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was filmed in LA! Visit the set of Sunnydale High and check out the hellmouth for yourself, or pop by Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous Ennis House, a.k.a. Angel’s home in the TV show. [7] X Research source There’s more: True Blood might take place in Louisiana, but it was filmed in Long Beach, and guess what? You can stop by Fangtasia IRL—the TV bar was filmed at the real-life Alex’s Bar. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "If it’s chills you’re after, Brown’s grave will do the trick. This one’s a little too real for us, but you can’t deny it’s fascinating. After Mercy Brown died of tuberculosis in 1892, the local villagers, believing her to be a vampire, mutilated her corpse. [9] X Research source Because Brown died of a mysterious illness (what we now know as tuberculosis) and because her corpse seemed to be suspiciously well-preserved, the citizens of Exeter worried she was really a vampire. They cut out her heart and burned it, and then they had her brother, Edwin (who was currently sick with tuberculosis), drink the ashes. (He still died.) Today, Mercy Brown is known as “New England’s Last Vampire.” You can find her grave in Chestnut Hill Cemetery, a small graveyard off of Ten Rod Road, a few miles off I-95 in Exeter, Rhode Island."

Forks is a popular logging and sport fishing town, but since Stephenie Meyer made it the setting of Twilight in 2005, it’s become the site of a Twilight tour and a yearly Forever Twilight in Forks Festival every September. [10] X Research source During the festival, which falls on the weekend closest to Bella’s birthday (September 13), fans enjoy a variety of fun events and entertainment. Year-round, you can go on a self-guided tour of Twilight stops around town, including the Swan house and the real La Push, and check out props and costumes from the movies. But there’s more to Forks than Twilight : be sure to carve out time to hike , swim , fish , or just sightsee at the town’s beautiful rainforests and beaches."

      "content": "Visit the museum of historic Kraków and see how vampires were buried. An underground excavation of Kraków’s market square in 2005 led to the discovery of the 700-plus-year-old ruins of a medieval settlement. Today, an underground museum showcases the artifacts discovered. The excavation turned up thoroughfares, aqueducts, a cemetery, and the remnants of merchant stalls. The settlement was destroyed by invading Tatars in 1241. Rynek Underground was opened in 2010 to showcase the remnants unearthed. It also incorporates holograms of medieval Krakovians to show what daily life was like in the 14th century. The museum includes displays depicting medieval burial traditions, including how to bury a vampire: in the fetal position, with hands tied and heads removed and placed beneath their feet. Tickets go fast for Rynek Underground, so be sure to buy in advance if you want to check it out (and we know you do). [13] X Research source"
