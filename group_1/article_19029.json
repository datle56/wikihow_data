      "content": "Go back to Johto and then head to Whirl Islands. The Whirl Islands are located to the east of Cianwood City. You need a Pokémon that knows the move Whirlpool to access the Whirl Islands. Go through the cave until you reach Lugia's chamber, and press A in front of Lugia's sprite to go into a battle with the level 70 Lugia. If you need help going through the Whirl Islands, search on YouTube for a video that shows the player going through the cave. You'll also want to have a Pokémon that knows the move Flash, since the cave will be pitch black when you first enter it."
