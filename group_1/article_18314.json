      "title": "The full moon symbolizes a time of release and completion.",
      "content": "The full moon symbolizes a time of release and completion. The full moon marks the end of the monthly moon cycle, and it reflects something similar in a spiritual sense: it's the culmination of positive energy after a period of work or effort. The full moon is the perfect time to look back on what you’ve accomplished during the past month and enjoy the fruits of your labor. [1] X Research source During the full moon is the perfect time to let go of things that no longer serve you so you can start the next month refreshed. For example, you might release a small grudge against a coworker, or forgive yourself for not meeting a personal goal during the previous month."

      "title": "The full moon also represents emotion and spiritual growth.",
      "content": "The full moon also represents emotion and spiritual growth. The moon is connected to all things emotional and represents the deepest parts of ourselves: our spiritual nature and subconscious mind. On a spiritual level, your intuition, creativity, and emotions are generally running hot during a full moon. The emotions that come to the surface can provide a lot of insight since they reflect what you're dealing with spiritually. The full moon has specific meanings in astrology , too—it symbolizes emotion, the cyclical nature of all things, and feminine energy."

      "title": "Emotions feel unusually extreme during the full moon.",
      "content": "Emotions feel unusually extreme during the full moon. Full moon energy can manifest in the body in different ways—you may feel extra creative, anxious, sensitive, or even exhausted when the moon is full. All of these feelings are normal. Try to gently remind yourself that any extreme emotions you’re experiencing will pass. The full moon is the perfect time to sit with whatever emotions come to the surface—they're a reflection of what you’re currently experiencing on a spiritual level."

      "title": "Full moon energy can make it difficult to sleep soundly.",
      "content": "Full moon energy can make it difficult to sleep soundly. The moon is powerful enough to affect the ocean tides, so it makes sense that it might also affect human beings on a deeper level, too. Research indicates that our natural circadian rhythms may somehow be in tune with the phases of the lunar cycle—when the moon is shining bright in the sky, people tend to go to sleep later and sleep less than when the moon’s light is waning. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have trouble sleeping during a full moon, create a nighttime ritual to help you relax before bed. Doing gentle stretches , drinking a warm mug of herbal tea, or taking a soothing bath are all great options."

      "title": "Full moon energy starts 3 days before and lasts 3 days after the full moon.",
      "content": "Full moon energy starts 3 days before and lasts 3 days after the full moon. Scientifically speaking, the moon is only 100% illuminated for an instant when the sun and moon are exactly opposite one another. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Full moon energy builds up all month, though, and it generally lasts for about 3 days before and after the moon peaks in the sky. If you want to harness full moon energy for manifesting , aim to do it during this 6-day period."

      "title": "Set your intentions for the coming month.",
      "content": "Set your intentions for the coming month. Spend some time reflecting on the past month. Did you accomplish your goals, or get close? What worked and what didn’t? Which relationships lifted you up, and which ones dragged you down? Then, based on your reflections, start crafting the intentions you want to set for the coming month. [4] X Research source For example, you might recommit yourself to the projects and relationships that are important to you. Give yourself permission to let go of negative emotions, thoughts, and projects that aren’t serving you. Try reciting full moon affirmations to start the new month with positive energy."

      "title": "Perform or create a full moon ritual.",
      "content": "Perform or create a full moon ritual. A full moon ritual can be anything you want it to be, and it can be as elaborate or as simple as you like. If you want something simple, try a simple hike or walk under the full moon. Or you can take a purifying bath and just relax in the warm water. No matter what you decide to do, spend a few minutes outside basking in the moonlight before you begin. Focus on soaking up that positive full moon energy. Try this simple journaling ritual: After soaking up the moonlight for a few minutes, grab your journal and put your experience into words . Don’t worry about spelling or proper grammar—just get the thoughts, ideas, and feelings down on the page. Make note of any specific emotions or physical sensations you felt, as well.

      "title": "Meditate under the full moon.",
      "content": "Meditate under the full moon. Go outside and find a comfortable place to sit. Then, to meditate , focus on relaxing your body and emptying your mind of thoughts. If thoughts do enter your mind, don't stress about them. Just examine the thoughts as objectively as you can and try to let them go. If you’re new to meditation, aim to meditate for 2-3 minutes. It’s totally fine to start small! You can increase how long you meditate over time as you get used to doing it."

      "title": "Practice gratitude.",
      "content": "Practice gratitude. Spend a few minutes making a list of the things that you’re grateful for in your life right now. If lists aren’t really your thing, feel free to write a longform journal entry instead. The important thing is to write down whatever comes to mind without examining it too closely, and keep going until you naturally run out of things to write down. Then, take a few minutes to reflect on what you’ve written. You don’t need to push yourself to continue thinking of things you’re grateful for—stop when you’re ready. Aim to make this a relaxing and uplifting exercise."
