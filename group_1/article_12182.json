      "content": "Focus on the person’s age when choosing decorations. You can use this theme for any birthday, but it works especially well for first birthdays and other milestone birthdays like turning 16, 30, or 40. Go with banners, balloons, and party favors that announce the person’s age and make sure that the age number appears prominently throughout the décor. For example, for a first birthday, the décor and party favors can feature the number “1” or say “Happy 1st Birthday!” on them. The cake and Mylar balloons can be shaped like the number “1,” as well. You can also base color choices on the age. For example, a Sweet 16 party can be decorated in shades of pink. Black and gold decorations are popular for 40th birthday parties with an “Over The Hill” theme."

      "content": "Base the theme around the season for an easy option. Seasonal themes are great options that never go out of style. They're also extremely customizable and you should be able to find decorations at your local craft store or online quickly and easily. If you aren't sure what kind of theme to go with or if you don't have much time for planning, consider a seasonal theme! [1] X Expert Source Ivy Summer Certified Wedding & Event Planner Expert Interview. 29 January 2020. For example, a summer birthday party can have a tropical color scheme and feature beach themed decorations. If the party is in the fall, you could have a burgundy, brown, and orange color scheme and use autumn-themed decorations featuring leaves, pumpkins, cornucopias, and pinecones. [2] X Research source The season can also dictate activities for the party. For example, you can have pumpkin carving or pumpkin painting activities at a kids’ autumn-themed party. Bobbing for apples is another fun idea for fall!"

      "content": "Feature a favorite animal, sports team, or other interest in the décor. You probably know the person well enough to pinpoint one of their favorite hobbies or interests, but if you aren't that close to them, don't be afraid to ask someone who would know! Finding decorations that match a very specific or obscure interest may not be feasible at your local craft store, so try looking online instead. For example, a child who loves unicorns might love a unicorn-themed party with unicorn imagery and pastel decorations. If the person loves Harry Potter or Star Wars, you could go with decorations that reflect those interests. A football or hockey themed party would work great for a sports lover, and you can even zero in on a specific team and use the team colors for your color scheme. Create a Disney-themed party with decorations featuring their favorite Disney characters and settings."

      "content": "Go all out with a location-based theme for a creative solution. Transform the party space by creating an atmosphere based on a location. Depending on what you choose, this may be the most work-intensive choice, but if you have plenty of time for planning and have a creative streak, consider making a big splash with this approach. Go with a location or atmosphere that you know the person really loves! For example, create a carnival-themed party with brightly colored or striped décor, carousel imagery, tents, clowns, and lollipops. You could also consider a garden theme, a castle theme, or a zoo theme. Jungle, safari, and outer space themes are also very popular. [3] X Research source"

A simple banner might exclaim “Happy Sweet 16, Tara!” in purple and silver lettering, for example. You can also try something more on-theme; for instance, for a royal-themed party, create a scroll-shaped banner with a message like, “Hear ye, hear ye! It’s The Queen’s birthday!” [5] X Research source For a disco-themed party, you could have a banner with an iconic disco quote like, “Let’s get down tonight!”, “Stayin’ Alive”, or “Shake your groove thang!” Hang the banner somewhere prominent so that everyone can see it!"

You can find balloons in a wide variety of colors, shapes, and materials at most party stores and they're a classic go-to for creating a festive atmosphere. Balloon solutions can be simple or elaborate, depending on what you want to do and how much time you have. For example, for an easy option, blow the balloons up yourself with an air pump and scatter them around the room or tape them to objects. You can also rent a helium tank, fill the balloons, and either tie them to objects in the room or simply let them float along the ceiling. For a quick option, go with Mylar balloons in different shapes and colors and have the party store fill them with helium for you. Go all out by creating a balloon arch."

If the party is in your backyard or at another location where electricity is accessible, this is a great solution—especially if you expect the party to continue into the night. If you have trees that are fairly close together, drape the lights between them. You can also wrap the lights around tree trunks and thread them through the foliage. Buy colored lights to match the party's theme or go with white lights for a classic look. You can also find delicate fairy lights that come with battery packs if you don't have access to electricity.
