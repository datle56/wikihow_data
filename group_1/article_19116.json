      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the available positions. Student council comes with a variety of available positions. From president to treasurer, learn about the available spots to see where you would best fit in the world of student politics. The president of student council is generally responsible for arranging and running meetings with other student council members, making sure everyone does their job, and approving any events, fundraisers, budgets, or other plans and decisions made by student council. The vice president essentially assists the president with his or her duties. The class secretary should be a very well organized person who's good at taking notes. Your job is to take minutes at meetings, keep student council related materials organized, getting important information to class officers, and scheduling meetings. The class treasurer is responsible for managing the funds of student council. The treasurer keeps track of spending and is generally required to provide some sort of monthly report outlining financial decisions made by student council. In most schools, each class has a class representative for their year. Class reps usually represent the interests of their grade at student council meetings and events."

      "content": "Decide on a platform. The key to becoming a successful student council member is having a central belief system. If you want to run for student council, you have to have some kind of platform or ideology that drives your campaign. A platform should be your summary of things at your school you want to change. Think about your experience as a student. What has been satisfactory? What has not? What would you like to change and what changes can you reasonably see made as a student council member? [1] X Research source Talk to other students. Ask them about their concerns and opinions on the school and how it's being run. Ask them what they'd like to see change. Remember, however, that you need to be realistic. You can't promise, for example, two hours of lunchtime and no chemistry requirements. Try to fish out concerns that are legitimate. Are students concerned about bullying in your school? Do they want more diverse options for electives? Do they feel hot lunch options are not fair to students with certain food sensitivities? These are the kinds of concerns that you should take seriously. [2] X Research source"
