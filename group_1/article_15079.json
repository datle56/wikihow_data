Take the tofu out of the container and pat the surface dry with paper towels. [1] X Research source You don’t have to squeeze or press the tofu at this point. Just dry the surface as much as possible. If you're using silken tofu, just pat the surface dry. It is not firm enough to withstand pressing."

      "title": "Place the tofu on a plate between 6-8 layers of paper towels.",
      "content": "Place the tofu on a plate between 6-8 layers of paper towels. Stack about 3 or 4 layers of paper towels on a sturdy plate and place the block of tofu on top of the paper towels. Then, either wrap the paper towels around the block of tofu or add another 3-4 layers of paper towels on top. [2] X Research source The paper towels will help absorb the water released by the tofu as you press it. If your plates are deeply concave, you may want to turn the bottom plate upside-down."

      "content": "Add another plate and a 2 lb (0.91 kg) weight on top of the paper towels. Once you’ve stacked the tofu and paper towels together, place a second plate on top of the stack. Then, add something heavy—like a cast iron skillet or several cans of food—to the top so the tofu will be pressed between the two plates. Look around your kitchen to see what you can use! Try a canister of flour, for instance, or a large cookbook. You can buy a pre-made tofu press, but unless you’ll be drying tofu frequently, there’s no need to take up your cabinet space with something you won’t use often."

      "title": "Drain the water off the plate every 30 minutes until no more water comes out.",
      "content": "Drain the water off the plate every 30 minutes until no more water comes out. Every 30 minutes, tilt the plate over your sink and pour off any water that’s collected on the bottom plate. If the paper towels get completely soaked, replace them with new ones. [3] X Research source The type of tofu you use will affect how long it needs to drain. Super-firm tofu might be completely drained in 30 minutes to an hour, while medium-firm tofu might still need to be pressed for 3-4 hours."

      "content": "Use the tofu right away or store it for 2-3 days in the fridge. Once you’ve pressed the water out of your tofu, it’s ready to marinate or cook. If you’re not planning to eat it right away, place it in a resealable plastic bag and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you dry your tofu, it will be able to absorb more of the flavors from a marinade, and it will develop a crispier exterior once you cook it."

      "content": "Place your tofu in a microwave-safe container . The tofu will release some liquid in the microwave, so you may want to use a container with a rim. For instance, you might use a microwave-safe takeout container or a flat-bottomed bowl. [4] X Research source Leave the tofu uncovered when you put it into the microwave. You can also wrap the tofu in paper towels before microwaving it."

Turn your stove to high heat and bring the water to a rapid boil. [7] X Research source It may seem strange to pour water over something to dry it out. However, the heat and salt will cause the tofu to tighten, which will force out the water that’s inside. Salted water takes longer to boil than fresh water, so if you’d prefer, you can wait to add the salt until after the water boils."

Finally cut the strips into uniform squares or cubes. Once you’ve cut the tofu, move it to a shallow container or bowl. [8] X Research source Having evenly-cut pieces will ensure they soak and cook evenly. However, if you have a few irregular pieces, it will be fine. If you’d prefer to leave your tofu in planks, that’s okay too. [9] X Research source"

Tipping the pot away from you, pour the water slowly over the tofu. Remember, the steam and the water can both burn you, so be very careful. [10] X Research source It’s a good idea to use oven mitts or pot holders when you pick up the pot, as the handle could be hot. It’s okay if the water doesn’t completely cover the tofu."

Do not open the package or pour off the water, as the tofu might get freezer-burned. [13] X Research source Freezing tofu before you press it takes a little advance planning, but the actual drying process is much shorter than using the traditional pressing method. However, freezing the tofu will change its texture, making it somewhat more bready than tofu that hasn’t been frozen."

If you’re not going to use the tofu right away, put it in an airtight container or a resealable plastic bag and place it in the fridge for 2-3 days."
