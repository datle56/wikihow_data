When you're prompted to select the deadzone, make sure the inner circle encompasses your controller's drift. That way a small drift on your controller does not affect any movement recorded on the controller. Remember that you can repeat this process to calibrate the other controller if you need to."

You'll also need a bit of skill to do this. If you're not confident in your ability to take the controller apart and put it back together, you shouldn't attempt this method."
