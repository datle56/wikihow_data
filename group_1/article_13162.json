      "content": "Use water to dilute the bleach as you pour it down the drain. If you’re choosing to pour the bleach down your kitchen drain, turn on the faucet first. With the water running steadily, begin slowly pouring the bleach down the drain until the container is empty. Once you’re finished, let the water run for another couple of seconds before turning off the faucet. Avoid pouring the bleach down the drain without diluting it with water."

      "content": "Pour the bleach into the toilet to flush it down. This works especially well for smaller amounts of bleach. Uncap the bleach and pour it into your toilet bowl before flushing the toilet. [1] X Research source If you’re pouring down more than 0.25 gallons (0.95 L) of the bleach, try to flush it down the toilet in two separate flushes. If your toilet bowl doesn’t have a significant amount of water in it to begin with, fill a cup with water and pour it into the toilet bowl along with the bleach to help dilute it."

      "title": "Avoid mixing the bleach with liquids other than water.",
      "content": "Avoid mixing the bleach with liquids other than water. Bleach is toxic and can react badly when mixed with other things, so only dilute it using water. Flush it down the toilet when the toilet only has water in it, and make sure there’s nothing else in the sink as you’re pouring the bleach out. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at the label on the bleach container to see if it’s recyclable.",
      "content": "Look at the label on the bleach container to see if it’s recyclable. Not only should your container of bleach tell you how to dispose of the container, but it should also tell you what to do with the container once you’re done. Look for recycling symbols that indicate it can be placed in a recycling bin. [3] X Research source If you see lettering such as “PET” or HDPE,” the container is recyclable. Ask your local recycling facility if they recycle bleach containers if you’re unsure."

      "title": "Make sure the container is completely empty.",
      "content": "Make sure the container is completely empty. Check to make sure the bleach container doesn’t have any bleach left in it before putting the cap back on. It’s a good idea to pour some water into the container, put the cap on tightly, and then shake the container to help remove any leftover bleach. Pour out the water before putting the cap back on a final time. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Dispose of the container in the trash if you can’t recycle it. Even though you’re just putting the container in a trash can, it’s still super important that the container is completely empty. The empty bleach container will be picked up with the rest of your trash."

      "title": "Ask friends, family members, or neighbors if they need bleach.",
      "content": "Ask friends, family members, or neighbors if they need bleach. Instead of dumping out your unused bleach, check to see if anyone you know personally could use it. You can do this by mentioning it to friends and family in-person or by message, or you can mention it in a social media post. [5] X Research source For example, bring the bleach with you when you visit a family member to ask them if they would like the rest of it."

      "content": "Check to see if a local organization could use the bleach. Ask places such as churches, local nursing homes, homeless shelters, or food kitchens if they would like donated bleach. You can do this by calling them, sending them an email, or dropping by to ask in person.

      "content": "Post the bleach on a classifieds page online for someone who needs it. Websites such as Craigslist will allow you to post a picture and description of your bleach so that others nearby can come pick it up if they need it. You can also check out websites like Freecycle.org which are dedicated to recycling unused items. [7] X Research source Try posting on a Facebook classifieds page or group to see if anyone could use your extra bleach. Make it clear that the bleach is free and that the container is not completely full."
