      "title": "Wear supportive sports bras while you exercise.",
      "content": "Wear supportive sports bras while you exercise. Breasts bounce and stretch with each jump or step. Exercising is a healthy habit for you, but just make sure to wear a fitted sports bra before heading out for a jog. Having the right sports bra will reduce the stress and strain exerted on the breast tissue and chest muscles. Try and stay away from compression bras that flatten your breasts against your chest wall. Compression bras will help reduce the up and down bouncing, but not the side-to-side movements because the bra is treating your breasts as a single moving unit. Instead, opt for an encapsulation bra that has separate molded cups that will support your breasts’ movement individually. [1] X Research source If you have large breasts, look for underwire sports bras with thick straps. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Replace your bras when the supportive bands stretch.",
      "content": "Replace your bras when the supportive bands stretch. If the innermost clasp on the bra no longer provides a tight, supportive fit, it is time to replace them. Breast size can change with hormones, weight fluctuations, and pregnancy, so get sized for a new bra if your current bra is uncomfortable or too loose. [3] X Research source If you normally wear your bra by hooking the loosest clasp, slowly start using the tighter clasps as the bra stretches. As the bra wears over time, this will help you get the most use out of your bra. Maintain the life of your bras by clasping them before you wash them. If you can’t hand wash them, use the gentle cycle and place them in a mesh laundry bag to avoid stretching them. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid exposing your chest to sunlight for long periods of time. Excess tanning without a top on, especially without the use of sunscreen, can dry out the tissue around your breasts and cause it to lose its elasticity. If you want to tan, try doing so sparingly and always wear sunscreen."

      "title": "Practice good posture by keeping your back straight and your shoulders back.",
      "content": "Practice good posture by keeping your back straight and your shoulders back. Having your back hunched and your shoulders rolled forward will relax your chest muscles and cause your breasts to droop. If this happens regularly, gravity will naturally begin to pull down on your breasts. By simply straightening your posture, you will keep the muscles around your chest toned and lift your breasts. Place a pillow behind your back if you find yourself slouching in a chair. If you are sitting on the floor, lean your back against a wall to keep you from hunching over."

      "title": "Sleep on your back.",
      "content": "Sleep on your back. If you favor one side while you sleep, you may find that the elevated breast sags and stretches more than the one against the mattress. By staying on your back, you can keep both breasts firmer longer. If you wear a bra to sleep, while you may experience the immediate rewards of perkier breasts in the morning, you can actually be doing long-term damage to your breasts. By wearing a bra at night, especially one with an underwire, you are steadily decreasing your breasts’ natural ability to self-lift. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid weight fluctuations caused by yo-yo dieting. Going on and off your diet can lead to stretch marks and inelastic skin. When you gain weight, the skin around your breasts stretches. If you quickly lose that gained weight, your breasts may appear to sag more because the skin stretched. Over time, continuous weight fluctuation will cause your skin to lose its elasticity. [6] X Research source Try and come up with a realistic exercise and portion control regime that you will stick to. This will help break the cycle of the yo-yo dieting. You can have weight fluctuations from causes other than yo-yo dieting, but those reasons like hormone influxes, stress, and illness, may not be within your control to fix. Something like avoiding yo-yo dieting is."

      "content": "Quit smoking to minimize tissue stretching and collagen breakdown. Nicotine breaks down the elastin, which is the elastic connective tissue in the skin around your breasts, and the collagen, which is responsible for making your breasts firm. While quitting smoking might not reverse damage already done to the elastin and collagen, it may stop the sagging process from worsening. [7] X Research source To get started, visit your general physician and discuss ways to begin safely quitting. Quitting smoking can be difficult and put stress on your body until it adjusts to being without nicotine. You want to speak to your doctor about any ongoing conditions or illnesses the stress of quitting might worsen.

      "content": "Apply cold water on your chest. Cold water or even ice can help increase the elasticity of the skin around your breasts. After you have finished showering with hot water, rinse your breasts with cold water. Using cold water on your breasts works well in addition to a normal exercise routine. Since this method will only help the elasticity of the skin, it will not make your breasts firmer. Firming your breasts will require exercise. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Do traditional push-ups to engage your chest and upper body muscles. While these may seem difficult to do at first, doing push-ups is an easy way to increase your muscle endurance without needing any extra equipment. As you increase your reps overtime, the muscles in your chest and core will strengthen and firm, lifting your breasts. [12] X Research source Your back should be straight the entire time when you are doing the push-ups. If your back bows, you will not effectively work your chest muscles. To help build up your muscles, you can start by doing push-ups on your knees, and then gradually work up to being able to do a traditional push-up."

      "title": "Do weighted bench presses to tighten up your chest muscles.",
      "content": "Do weighted bench presses to tighten up your chest muscles. The weights will provide resistance to your chest and shoulder muscles, and will overtime lift your breasts. You can either use dumbbell weights or bar weights, whichever you are most comfortable with using. [13] X Research source Begin by lying flat on your back on an exercise bench and hold the weights with both hands. Keeping your back flat, push the weights away from your shoulders and into the air. Inhale as you bring the weights back down to your chest, and repeat the process 10 more times. [14] X Research source Bench presses can be dangerous since you are lifting the weights directly over your head. Make sure to have a spotter with you in case of an emergency. [15] X Research source"

Once you build up your muscles from the bench presses, you can transition the same technique into a dumbbell-fly exercise. This is an easy way to target extra muscles, and you can even do this exercise standing. [16] X Research source When you push the weights upwards for the bench press, exhale, and spread out your arms like wings until the weights are level with your shoulders. Keeping your arms straight, lift the weights up, and then bring the weights back down to your chest. Do not start doing this exercise with heavy weights as you can easily bend or twist your wrists.

To get started, you only need a small exercise ball, or a small playground ball. [18] X Research source Press the ball between your palms. The ball should fit comfortably between your palms, and have a little weight to it when you lift it up. Take a wide stance like you are mid-squat. Your knees should be bent at 90-degree angles, and your toes should be slightly pointed outward. Bend your elbows and bring the ball to your chest. Then extend your arms over your head, squeezing the ball tightly, while simultaneously extending your knees halfway out of the wide stance. Bring your legs back to the original squatting position. Then quickly pulse your legs upwards as you bring the ball back to your chest. The movement should be fluid, almost like a small bounce, before settling into your starting position."
