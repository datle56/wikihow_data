      "content": "Add the leaves and stir. Once the water’s boiling, add the leaves and stir them into the water so they’re nice and wet all over. Boil them for about three minutes. But be sure to stir them constantly. Otherwise they may end up sticking to each other and end up as big clumps, which can make them taste a little nasty! You don’t want to overcook the leaves, either, but depending on how much you’re making at once, they may need longer. If they do, start taste-testing after three minutes to make sure you don’t ruin the whole batch."
