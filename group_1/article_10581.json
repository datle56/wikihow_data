      "title": "Try picking your hamster up.",
      "content": "Try picking your hamster up. After your hamster seems used to your presence and touch, you can try to pick your hamster up. Work slowly and gently as you do so, watching for any signs of stress or fear from your hamster. Never lift your hamster by the tail or the front legs as this will only cause injury. Make sure you cup your hands and support the entire body of the hamster. Try to let your hamster climb up and onto your hand before lifting it out of the cage. Any pain or discomfort felt by your hamster will undo any bond and cause your hamster to fear you. Make sure your hamster won't get hurt from falling if it escapes from your hand."
