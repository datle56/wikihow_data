He has one special attack, Air Slash; when he swings his sword, a red slash of air will move towards the player. It's recommended to dash when the Saber Expert is using Air Slash to dodge it. One method to defeat the Saber Expert is to stand just outside the door and hit him, as he can't leave the room. However, if you go too far outside of the room, the Saber Expert will regenerate in the middle of his spawn room with 100% health. Another method to defeat the Saber Expert involves getting him stuck on the square bump in between the stairs. He can still hit you with his ranged move, but he is much easier to beat when stuck. You must do at least 10% damage to the Saber Expert to get the Saber, if you're fighting him with other users. [3] X Research source"
