      "title": "Use a pencil to create the base of your tree.",
      "content": "Use a pencil to create the base of your tree. Just like a real tree, a tree drawing starts with the trunk. Start by lightly sketching 2 parallel lines that curve toward each other ever-so-slightly in the middle. Start your lines in the center of your sketching paper, so you can easily add leaves, branches, and ground to the top and bottom. [1] X Research source Always draw with a pencil first so you can erase any mistakes you make before coloring and adding texture."

      "title": "Draw the branches at the top of the tree’s base.",
      "content": "Draw the branches at the top of the tree’s base. Draw 2 long, thin, v-shaped lines that extend from the top points of your tree’s base. Then, draw a few smaller, equally-thin lines that extend from your branch lines to represent the smaller branches. [2] X Research source Each tree has its own way of branching. If you want to draw a particular kind of tree, look at some real trees for reference. Pay attention to how the branches grow from the base. Drawing what you see is a great way to improve your artistic skills!"

      "title": "Draw puffs over the branch lines to make the leaves.",
      "content": "Draw puffs over the branch lines to make the leaves. If we look at a bushy tree from afar, we see these trees usually have their leaves in 1 big, fluffy mass. Create the leafy top of your tree by drawing a series of connected, u-shaped half-circles over the unconnected branch lines. Draw about 8 half-circles in 1 direction from the bottom up. Then, enclose this shape with about 5 more connected half-circles from the top-down. When you’re finished, the puff above the branches should look like a cartoon cloud. For a more realistic-looking tree, draw 2 cloud-like puffs: 1 on the right side and 1 on the left. Make 1 puff smaller than the other. It’s okay if your u-shapes are different sizes. Real life trees have leaves of different sizes, too! You can also add some swirls within the masses of leaves to create more texture and depth."

      "title": "Color over the leaves in various shades of green.",
      "content": "Color over the leaves in various shades of green. Using various green pens or colored pencils, begin shading in the puffy masses of leaves. For a more realistic tree, color the top part of the leaves in light green and the bottom curves in darker green, since the leaves of a tree look darker the closer you get to its trunk. If you want to do some more advanced coloring, look at a real tree to see how the light and shadows shift from one side to another."

      "content": "Draw lines and swirls on the base to make the tree look wooden. Natural tree bark has multiple textures and impressions on the trunk. To add texture to your drawing, sketch some spirals and curved lines between the two base lines of your tree. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Color the trunk of the tree brown.",
      "content": "Color the trunk of the tree brown. Once you’ve added texture to the bark, begin shading the base of the tree in brown or tan pen or colored pencil. For more realistic looking roots, extend your shading a little below the base lines of the tree. [4] X Research source To make the texture of the bark really pop, trace over the spirals and lines in a darker shade of brown or black. This will contrast nicely with the lighter brown you use to color the rest of the base."

      "content": "Use a pencil to draw the trunk of your tree. Lightly draw 2 parallel lines that curve at the base. Bring the lines somewhat close together in the middle. Then, have them extend further out at the bottom. When you’re done, you should have lines that resemble something like the bottom half of an hourglass. [5] X Research source Umbrella trees tend to have thinner trunks, so don’t extend the bottom of your base lines too far outward."

Keep these lines smaller than the lines of the trunk itself and closer to the top of the tree’s base. [6] X Research source For added texture, draw overlapping lines to resemble overlapping branches. [7] X Research source Don’t worry about your lines being perfectly straight. Jagged lines will add texture to the branches."

Then, add the cuts and curves of the leaves by drawing small, squiggly lines in the top 3rd of each puff. [8] X Research source Draw your squiggly lines with the curves in the same direction as the puffs"

(Avoid using black to trace your outline, unless you want the tree to look more cartoony.) Wipe away any mistakes or awkward lines with an eraser. Trace the base and branches of your tree with brown and the leaves of your tree with green. Put a sheet of layout paper over your sketch for a cleaner tracing. [10] X Research source"

With a pencil in hand, begin by sketching a small, slightly curved triangle with multiple jagged, slightly rounded edges at the bottom. [12] X Research source Sketching your first layer at the top of the paper will ensure you have enough space for the other rows of the pine. If you’re unsure where to draw your first layer, create reference lines by intersecting a vertical and horizontal line in the center of your page and using these lines as reference points."

All your layers should connect and the overall design of the layers will be the exact same. However, to make the tree look more realistic, draw the edges of each layer slightly differently. You could make them more or less round, different sizes, or anything in between. [13] X Research source"

Pine trees tend to have darker, bristlier leaves so you might want to use a richer shade of green and color the layers one line at a time. [15] X Research source For added detail, trace the bottom edges of each layer in a black or very dark green (and the rest of the leaves in a brighter green) to make it seem like the sun is casting a shadow."

Once you’ve gotten a rough outline of the tree’s leaves, begin creating these divides by drawing horizontal lines across the base of your tree.

Color the base of your tree (between the dividing lines) in a light brown or tan and the jagged edges of each palm leaf in a lemon or lime green. [21] X Research source If you added a sand dune, you can color this in yellow or orange (or whatever combination of the two most closely resembles real sand)."
