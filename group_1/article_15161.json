      "content": "Choose a hair dye color that is 2-3 shades lighter than the color you want. Since bleached hair is more porous, even with the protein filler, it absorbs more color than healthy hair does and ended up looking much darker than the intended color. [1] X Expert Source Karen Leight Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 13 November 2020. You’ll want to choose a slightly lighter color to balance out this darkening effect. [2] X Research source If you’re buying based on the image on the front of the box, look for one that’s slightly lighter than what you want."

      "content": "Protect your skin and clothes with gloves and an old towel. Before you even start mixing dye, put on a pair of latex gloves and lay an old towel around your shoulders to protect your clothes. The color will dye anything it touches, so make sure to wear old clothes that you aren’t worried about getting dirty. [3] X Research source Use a dark towel to hide any stains from the dye."

      "content": "Mix and apply the brunette dye according to the box instructions. With an applicator brush and a plastic bowl, measure and mix the dye and developer included in the color kit. Generally, dye and developer should be mixed in a 1:1 ratio, but this can vary between manufacturers. Make sure to follow the instructions on the box and combine the products until they have a creamy consistency.

      "content": "Divide your hair into 4 sections and clip them up. Using the pointed end of your applicator brush, part your hair down the middle, then from ear to ear. Clip each section up with a plastic clip to keep them out of the way while you work. Unclip and apply dye to only 1 section at a time."

      "title": "Apply the dye to your hair, working section by section.",
      "content": "Apply the dye to your hair, working section by section. Unclip your first section, then load up your applicator brush with dye and paint it onto a thin layer of hair about .5 in (1.3 cm) thick. Start at the roots and paint the dye onto both sides to thoroughly coat the strands. Work your way through each section until all of your hair is coated. [5] X Research source Get as close as you can to the base of the roots without touching the scalp. If the color matches your natural roots, try to blend it into the roots so you don’t have to worry as much about grow-out. Color-matching can be very difficult, though, so unless you have a lot of experience with coloring your hair, you may want to just dye your whole head. [6] X Research source"

Check the water draining down to see if it still has a tint from the dye--when it has no tint, you’re done rinsing! After rinsing, apply a conditioner for color-treated hair, following the manufacturer’s directions. This will help seal in your color."

Look for a filler with a strong red tint to add warm undertones back into bleached hair. This will help keep your hair from turning green or ashy when you dye it brown.

      "content": "Avoid using hot styling tools while your hair is still fragile. Since your hair will be more vulnerable to damage after the chemical treatment, you’ll want to use as little heat on it as possible. This includes styling tools such as curling irons, straightening irons, and blow dryers. If you have to use hot tools, make sure to spray on a heat protectant product first and use either the lowest heat or cool blast setting. You should especially avoid using hot styling tools in conjunction with heavy styling products, such as gels, volumizers, hairsprays, and mousses."

Work the product through your hair, concentrating on the tips, then run a wide-tooth comb through the strands to make sure it’s evenly distributed. Leave the mask on for 20 minutes (or as long as the product directs), then rinse well. [15] X Research source Look for a moisturizing mask that’s specifically formulated for colored hair. This is especially important if your hairstyling requires heat tools."
