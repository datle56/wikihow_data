The six instruments are located on the instrument panel in the following order: [1] X Research source Top left - The Airspeed Indicator shows aircraft airspeed, usually in knots. (A knot is one nautical mile per hour—about 1.15 MPH or 1.85km/hr). Top center - The Artificial Horizon shows the aircraft attitude and whether the plane is climbing or descending as well as whether it is in a bank to the left or to the right. Top right - The Altimeter shows the height (altitude) of the aircraft in feet MSL—feet above mean, or average, sea level. Lower left - The Turn and Bank Indicator is a dual instrument which tells what angle of bank you are in during a turn (rate of turn) and also whether you are in co-ordinated flight and feeling the proper, down-in-the-seat G-force from the turn. This is also called the \"Turn and Slip Indicator\" or \"Needle Ball.\" Lower center - The Heading Indicator shows the aircraft's current compass heading. This instrument needs to be calibrated on a regular schedule. Lower right - The Vertical Speed Indicator tells how fast the aircraft is climbing or descending. Note : The two round instruments directly to the right of the six pack are dual VOR (VHF Omni-directional Range) instruments, and to the right of them are two identical VOR radios, used for communications and VOR navigation"

The necessary controls for flying this plane are: [2] X Trustworthy Source Federal Aviation Administration U.S. government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation Go to source Throttle – a black knob – When pushed forward, the engine speed increases and when pulled back, the engine speed decreases. Full back is idle speed. [3] X Research source Fuel mixture – a red knob – Pushed full inward is the richest mixture (used for sea level takeoffs and landings). Full back will shut the engine off. Only pull the red knob fully out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine. [4] X Research source Carburetor heat – Used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions, notably on long descents with the engine at low power or idling, conditions which result in a cold engine paired cold air which often cause icing. [5] X Research source Note: For all practical purposes, this has to be either full-on or full-off. Flaps – a flat handled switch – Used to select the wing flap positions. Flaps are usually deployed to slow the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing. Note that the flaps should be advanced notch-by-notch; one position (10°) at a time. Fuel tank select – A Cessna 172 will almost always be set on \"Both Tanks.\" Yoke (\"steering wheel\") – This sets the attitude (climb and turn) and the speed of the aircraft. Use small pitch adjustments, in and out for pitch (to climb or descend). Turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft. Rudder pedals – These are operated by your feet. Press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied. Pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway. Control trim – There are two trim wheels in the panel. One trims the aileron and the other trims the rudder, thereby reducing the control pressure required to operate the respective controls. Trimming allows you to more easily maintain your direction of flight. Take care not to over-trim when landing as you may then not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go-around (aborted landing)."

As the aircraft gains speed, it will pull to the left and you will have to add a little right rudder to stay on the runway center line. Pull gently back on the yoke when your speed reaches 55 knots. This will cause the aircraft to slowly lift off the runway. When the aircraft reaches 70 to 80 knots, maintain that speed throughout the climb. Keep the wings level and showing only a few degrees of climb. At the same time, continue holding back on the yoke as needed to maintain 70 to 80 knots (the required climb speed for a Cessna 172). Make the exit turn. At about 500 ft. (150m) of altitude, make your required exit turn. Most airports have a requirement of making a 45° turn to exit the airport area (or you may request a straight-out departure). Stay in coordinated flight by using the needle ball (turn coordinator). This gauge has a little airplane with a level line and a black ball that rolls back and forth along the line. Keep the black ball in the center by adjusting the rudder so your turns feel smooth (coordinated). Pilots say step on the ball to know which rudder pedal to step on to center the ball and maintain a coordinated turn.

An essential part of flying is staying in touch with ATC (Air Traffic Control), Approach Control and Tower (in that order), during approach and landing procedures. You can find the correct frequencies on your sectional chart. Or on an Approach Chart as shown above. ATC may inform you of air traffic in your area. FAA's AIM (Airman Information Manual) requires that you respond by saying \"Traffic in Sight\" if you see the traffic, or \"No Contact\" if you don't. Be sure to respond promptly. The tower will tell you something like: Report entering downwind for runway 25L (pronounced two five Left), so set up your aircraft so you will approach runway 25L at the expected 45 degree angle, so that you will enter the airport area about 500 ft. (150m) above the runway. If given clearance to land runway 30 (pronounced three zero ), that will always be a straight-in approach. (See airport Chart above.) The runway numbers refer to the compass heading of the runway. The letters R & L refer to the left and right runways, when there are parallel runways (as shown above). There is a procedure called LAHSO (Land and Hold short). This requires you, at some airport runways, to land but hold short at the LAHSO sign at the runway crossing point ahead.
