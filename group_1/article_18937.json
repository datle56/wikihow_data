      "content": "Wash your face and body daily. While you’re in the shower, lather up with a moisturizing soap or body wash and use a natural scrubber to remove dead skin and restore vital moisture. If you have regular or dry skin, you can probably get away with cleaning your skin once a day, or even every other day. If you have particularly oily skin, you may need to step it up to twice a day. However, make sure to wash your skin any time it gets sweaty, such as after working out. [1] X Research source To keep things simple, look for a cleanser that you can use on both your body and face. However, if you are prone to breakouts, then you may want to invest in a special cleanser for your face. Look for facial cleansers with vitamins A, C, or E. These vitamins will help to wash off common irritants that get on your skin during the day. [2] X Expert Source Paul Friedman, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 8 April 2020. Avoid bar soaps, unless they contain added moisturizers. Bar soaps tend to be drying, and if you’re using them every day, their effects will quickly begin to show. [3] X Research source"

Squeeze the specified amount of moisturizer (usually a dime-sized blob) into one hand and rub it together between your palms. Then, work it into your forehead, cheeks, nose, and the area around your eyes until it’s no longer visible. Apply a liberal amount of body lotion to your body once daily as well. Repeat the process every morning and evening, or as frequently as needed for your particular skin type. [5] X Research source For most men, a regular moisturizing lotion will work just fine. For tougher patches of skin like those on your knees and elbows, it may help to grab a body butter instead for deeper nourishing. When shopping around for a good moisturizer, make sure the word “noncomedogenic” appears somewhere on the bottle. This means the product won’t clog your pores, which can cause breakouts. [6] X Research source However, if you have dry skin, then the product you choose may not include this on the label, and that is okay."

      "content": "Exfoliate at least once a week to remove dead, flaky skin. Exfoliation is especially important for men because it can help to prevent ingrown facial hair. Lather up your loofah or a scrubbing pad designed specifically for exfoliating and go over the skin on your face and body using smooth, circular motions. Sloughing off the dead skin cells that have a tendency to accumulate naturally will reveal smoother, softer skin underneath. [7] X Expert Source Paul Friedman, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 8 April 2020. Over-exfoliating can cause your skin to become red and irritated, so limit your scrubbing sessions to 3-4 times per week. [8] X Research source You can also use body washes and face creams that contain exfoliating particles if loofahs aren’t your thing. Just make sure you don’t get the kind with plastic beads, as these are bad for the environment."

If you often find yourself battling zits, blemishes, and imperfections, pick up a product that features salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide as its active ingredient. Start out by applying the cream once a day first thing in the morning. After that, you can gradually work your way up to twice a day. [9] X Research source Apply your acne cream of choice to your face, shoulders, back , and anywhere else you tend to break out As a last resort for acne, use a cream that contains at least 2% salicylic acid and follow it up with a topical lotion with 5-10% percent benzoyl peroxide. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that this may leave your skin dry and flaky, so it is not something you should do regularly.

If you’re particularly fair-skinned, you might also try wearing a hat and keeping your skin covered with a layer of light clothing for added protection. [12] X Research source Where skincare is concerned, it’s easier to prevent than to cure. Biting the bullet and rubbing on a little sunscreen now can keep your from ending up with dry, cracked, leathery skin later in life. Consistent sunscreen use can also reduce the threat of skin condition like eczema and melanoma, which are linked to UV rays. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply chapstick or lip balm periodically to keep your lips soft. It’s especially important to keep some moisturizing lip balm handy in chilly weather. If possible, find a product that contains an SPF 5-10 sunblock to safeguard your vulnerable lip skin from the sun, as well. Some guys are reluctant to use lip products, but the fact is they make a big difference in the overall health (and look) of your lips. Throw your lip chapstick or lip balm in your pocket, or keep a spare tube in the glove compartment of your car. That way, you’ll never be caught without it. Make sure that you do not use chapstick too often or your lips may become dependent on it and no longer moisturize themselves."

If you have no choice but to be outside for long periods of time, dress accordingly—bundle up with a high-collared coat, scarf, and gloves during the dead of winter and wear short-sleeved, breathable clothing in the sweltering summer months. You can’t control the weather, but you can at least plan for it. [14] X Research source You may find it necessary to up your moisturizing routine in the wintertime. Cold air and high winds can severely dry out your face and lips, making them cracked and painful.

Classical wisdom dictates that you should drink about 8 8 fl oz (0.24 L) glasses in a 24-hour span. However, a better system is to simply drink when you feel thirsty. Just try not to dip below the recommended 2 litres (68 fl oz). [22] X Research source A good way to tell whether you’re getting enough water is to take a look at the color of your urine the next time you go to the bathroom. If it’s clear or light yellow, it means you’re properly hydrated. If it’s dark yellow, pour yourself another glass. [23] X Research source Stick to water, tea, and coffee as much as possible.
