[3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The first symptom of MRSA is a raised, pus-filled abscess or boil that's firm to the touch and feels warm. This red blemish may have a “head” like a pimple, and can range in size from 2 to 6 centimeter (0.79 to 2.4 in) or larger. It can appear anywhere on the body, and will be extremely tender. For example, if it's on the buttocks, you likely won't be able to sit from the pain. A skin infection without a boil is less likely to be MRSA, but should still be checked by a doctor. More likely, you need to be treated for a Streptococcus infection or susceptible staph aureus. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a warm compress. [12] X Research source Hopefully, you saw a doctor as soon as you suspected MRSA and caught the infection before it became dangerous. The first, early treatment for MRSA is to press a warm compress against the boil to draw the pus to the surface of the skin. This way, when the doctor cuts the abscess to drain it, she'll be more successful in removing all the pus. Antibiotics may help speed up the process. In some cases, the combination of antibiotics and warm compresses may cause spontaneous draining without actually having to cut the lesion. Soak a clean washcloth in water. Microwave it for about two minutes, or until it's as warm as you can stand without burning your skin. Leave it on the lesion until the cloth cools down. Repeat the process three times per session. Repeat the entire warm compress session four times each day. When the boil has softened up and you can clearly see pus in the center of it, it is ready to be surgically drained by your doctor. Sometimes though, this can make the area worse. The heat pack may be quite painful and your wound may get bigger, redder, and much worse. Discontinue the heat packs and call your doctor if that happens."

      "content": "Allow a doctor to drain MRSA lesions. Once you've brought the bacteria-filled pus to the surface of the lesion, the doctor will cut it open and drain the pus out safely. First, she will anesthetize the area with Lidocaine and cleanse it with Betadine. Then, using a scalpel, she will make an incision in the \"head\" of the lesion and drain it of infectious pus. She will apply pressure all around the lesion, like pushing pus out of a popped zit, to make sure all infectious material is squeezed out. The doctor will send the extracted fluid to a lab to test it for responsiveness to antibiotics. Sometimes, there are honeycomb-like pockets of infections under the skin. These need to be broken up by using a Kelly clamp to hold the skin open while the doctor addresses the infection under the surface. Because MRSA is largely resistant to antibiotics, draining is the most effective way to treat it."

Over time (usually about two weeks), the wound will get smaller and smaller until you can't fit gauze in it anymore. Until that happens, though, you should wash out the wound every day."

Over-prescribing antibiotics only helps infections become more resistant to treatment; however, there are two approaches to antibiotic treatments in general — for mild and for severe infections. Your doctor may suggest the following: [13] X Research source Guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), 2014: Increase in MRSA Prompts Updated Guidelines for Skin and Soft Tissue Infections( SSTI). June 9, 2014 statement. Mild to moderate infection: take one Bactrim DS tablet every 12 hours for two weeks. If you're allergic to it, take 100mg of Doxycycline on the same schedule. Severe infection (IV delivery): Receive 1 gm of Vancomycin through an IV for at least an hour; 600 mg of Linezolid every 12 hours; or 600 mg of Ceftaroline for at least an hour every 12 hours. The infectious disease consultant will determine the length of your IV therapy."

[14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because MRSA is so infectious, it's important that everyone in the community take be careful about hygiene and prevention, especially when there's a local outbreak. Use lotions and soaps from pump-bottles. Dipping your fingers into a jar of lotion or sharing a bar of soap with others can spread MRSA. Don't share personal items like razors, towels, or hairbrushes. Wash all bed linens at least once a week, and wash towels and washcloths after each use."

[15] X Research source [16] X Research source Because MRSA spreads so easily, you must be especially aware of risks in crowded situations. These might include shared areas of a home or crowded public spaces like nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, and gyms. Though many common areas are regularly disinfected, you never know when the last cleaning was or who may have been in the area before you. It's wise to place a barrier down if you're concerned. For example, bring your own towel to the gym and place it between yourself and the equipment. Wash the towel immediately after use. Make good use of antibacterial wipes and solutions provided by the gym. Disinfect all equipment before and after use. If showering in a shared space, wear flip-flops or plastic shower shoes. You are at increased risk of infection if you have any cuts or have a compromised immune system (like with diabetes)."

It may be that the person who touched a doorknob before you had MRSA, and touched his nose just before opening the door. It's a good idea to use hand sanitizer throughout the day, especially when in public. Ideally, the sanitizer will contain at least 60% alcohol. Use it at the supermarket, when receiving change from cashiers. Children should use hand sanitizer or wash their hands after playing with other children. Teachers who interact with children should follow the same standard. Whenever you feel you may be exposed to potential infection, use hand sanitizer just to be safe."

When patients come into the hospital with MRSA, it is \"community-acquired.\" \"Hospital-acquired\" MRSA is when a patient comes in the hospital for treatment of an unrelated condition, then gets MRSA while there. Hospital-acquired MRSA does not usually affect the skin and soft tissues, so you don't often see community-acquired boils and abscesses. These patients progress quickly to more serious complications. MRSA is a major cause of preventable death and is an epidemic in hospitals across the globe. The infection spreads quickly from patient to patient via unaware hospital staff who don't follow proper infection control procedures."

But just as important as wearing gloves in the first place is changing gloves in between patients and washing your hands thoroughly each time you change gloves. If you don't change gloves, you may protect yourself from infection while spreading infection from one patient to the next. Infection control protocols vary from ward to ward, even within the same hospital. For example, infection is more prevalent in the intensive care unit (ICU), so contact and isolation precautions are usually stricter. Staff may be required to wear protective gowns and facemasks in addition to gloves.

Journal of Clinical Microbiology, March 2010 Volume 48 no 3 683-689 [22] X Research source Robicsek, et al Annals of Internal Medicine 2008 148 409 -418 When you're dealing with patients' body fluids — whether through sneezing or through surgery — it's best to pre-screen for MRSA. Everyone in a crowded hospital setting is both a potential risk and potentially at risk. The test for MRSA is a simple nasal swab that can be analyzed within 15 hours. Screening all new admissions — even those who don’t show symptoms of MRSA — can cut down on the spread of infection. For example, one study showed that about 1/4 of preoperative patients who did not have any symptoms of MRSA were still carrying the bacteria. Screening all patients may not be reasonable within your hospital’s time and budget limits. You might consider screening all surgery patients or those whose fluids staff have to come into contact with. If the patient is found to have MRSA, the staff can decide on a “decolonization” strategy to prevent contamination during the surgery/procedure and transmission to other people in the health care setting.

The last thing you want in a crowded hospital setting is for an infected patient to come into contact with uninfected patients there for other reasons.
