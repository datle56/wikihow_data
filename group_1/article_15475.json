      "content": "Figs taste best when they’re soft, ripe, and in season. Most people eat fresh figs raw. In fact, fresh figs are the most delicious when they’re warm and plucked straight off the tree! The entire fig is edible. Just twist off the stem and eat the fig—skin, seeds, and all. If you don't like the texture of the skin, remove the stem and then carefully peel the skin away, starting from the exposed top. Incorporate figs into your meals by chopping them up and tossing them in a salad, wrapping them in prosciutto and cream cheese, or baking them into a dessert with vanilla custard and cinnamon. The exact size and color of a ripe fig depends on the variety, but all varieties are soft when ripe. Ripe figs have a sweet scent and give a little when squeezed. They’re usually in season from July through October, but dried figs are available in grocery stores year round. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose ripe figs with clean, unblemished skin. Check for ripeness by gently squeezing the fig—it will feel soft and give a little, but still hold its shape. Smell for a sweet scent, and skip ones that have deep rips or bruises on the flesh. A few small scratches are fine, however, since they won’t affect the taste or quality of the fruit. Avoid figs that are too firm, appear to have mold on them, or those that smell sour or rotten. If you’re picking fresh figs from a tree, wait for the skin to change color and the fruit necks to wilt and drop down. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Store ripe figs in a plastic bag and place them in the fridge.",
      "content": "Store ripe figs in a plastic bag and place them in the fridge. Fresh figs are delicate and highly perishable, so try to eat them within 1-2 days of purchase. If you plan to eat them within a day, keep them at room temperature. Otherwise, put them in a ziploc bag in the coldest part of your refrigerator to prevent rotting . The coldest part of the fridge is typically the meat drawer, or the back and bottom shelf. Figs taste best at room temperature, so remove them from the fridge at least 30 minutes before eating them."

      "content": "Freeze ripe figs if you can’t consume them within 2-3 days. Preserve your figs by freezing them in ascorbic acid. Just wash 1 US qt (950 mL) of ripe figs in cool water, remove the stems, arrange them on a lined baking sheet, then pop them in the freezer overnight. The next day, put the figs in a freezer-safe container, and stir 0.75 tsp (3 g) of ascorbic acid into 3 tsp (15 mL) of water. Pour this solution over the figs to prevent them from browning. [3] X Research source Be sure to consume your frozen figs within 6-8 months for the best results. Unfortunately, frozen figs do not have the same texture or flavor as fresh figs, so substituting them in recipes may alter the final product."

      "content": "Wash your figs and pat them dry. Rinse the figs under cool water and gently wipe them dry with a clean paper towel. Since figs are delicate, do not scrub them with a vegetable brush. Remove any dirt you see by gently rubbing it off with your fingers. If your figs are really dirty, soak them in a bowl of cool water and veggie wash for 1-2 minutes before rinsing them clean. Before serving the figs, remove the stems by gently twisting them off with your fingers."

      "title": "Check for mold or sugar crystals on your figs.",
      "content": "Check for mold or sugar crystals on your figs. Sometimes, figs have a white powder on the outside. This process is called sugaring, and it happens when the natural fruit sugars crystallize on the surface of the fruit. These figs are still good to eat, but many people remove the crystals for presentation or texture purposes. [4] X Research source If the white powder looks fuzzy or slimy, it is likely mold so discard the fruit immediately. To remove sugar crystals, pour 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of water over 0.5 cup (60 g) of figs, then microwave them on high for 1 minute to dissolve the crystals."

      "content": "Fig toast A popular way to serve fresh figs is to enjoy them raw with a tangy cheese product. Spread goat, ricotta, or cream cheese on a piece of toasted sourdough bread. Then, top with sliced ripe figs and a drizzle of olive oil and honey. Add flaky sea salt to taste. [5] X Research source Feel free to sprinkle crushed walnuts or pistachios on top, or add some slices of prosciutto. Choose a sweet and tangy cheese, instead of one that’s sharp. Mascarpone and crème fraiche also pair well with figs. Alternatively, skip the bread. For a quick snack or appetizer, cut the figs in half and place a dollop of plain or flavored cream cheese on top."

Or, marinate the figs in red wine vinaigrette for 30 minutes, before tossing them with mixed greens, goat cheese, and crumbled bacon.

Alternatively, poach dried figs in wine . Gather 8 oz (230 g) of dried figs, cut the stems, and slice them in half. Combine 0.5 cups (120 mL) of red wine, 0.25 cups (38 g) of sugar, and a dash of salt and pepper in a saucepan. Add the dried figs to the liquid and bring to a boil.
