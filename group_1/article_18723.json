      "content": "Treat your hair with argan oil . One common way of training your hair naturally is by using a natural hair oil that will help to moisturize and keep your hair strong, making it more likely to take on natural curl and body. Once or twice a week, use a pea-sized amount of hair oil on a plastic comb and comb through your hair after rinsing to treat your hair and keep it strong. [2] X Research source It's also common to combine this treatment and cover your hair with a tight-fitting bald-cap or do-rag , to keep your hair kinked up and keep the oil close to the scalp overnight. When you remove the cap, your hair should be able to take on curl more easily. [3] X Research source Olive oil and coconut oil are also versatile food-based products that are commonly used in the hair to help keep moisturized and curly. Treating your hair with these products can help to keep them light and silky, making them more amenable to taking on curl."

If you want naturally curly hair, rinse your hair regularly to keep it clean and fresh, but don't use shampoo more than once or twice a week if you have naturally straight hair.

Regular rinsing helps to keep your hair lighter, keeping the dirt and build-up out of your hair, but it also allows the natural oils in your hair to keep your hair silky and light, giving it body and curl in the right conditions.

Different people will need to wash their hair more or less, accordingly. If you have particularly greasy hair, you might need to wash it every other day at least. If you have dry hair, try washing it only once a week or less and rinse every day."
