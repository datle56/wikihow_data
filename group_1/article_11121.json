      "content": "Apply a heat protectant to your hair while heating up your curling iron to 325ºF (162ºC). Most curling irons need 1-5 minutes to heat up. If you try to curl your hair before it reaches the correct temperature, your curls will not hold. Ensure your hair is completely dry. Run a blowdryer over any damp spots. Professional Hair Stylist Gina Almona recommends brushing out tangles and applying a heat protection spray . [1] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019. A good rule of thumb for your iron’s temperature is 325º F (162º C) for fine hair, 390ºF (198ºC) for coarse or thick, or 410ºF (210ºC) for curly or coily hair. Heat protectant spray will protect your hair from damage caused by exposure to high temperatures and prevent it from becoming dry and frizzy. Spray it liberally all over your hair before curling."

      "content": "Split your hair into sections smaller than the diameter of the iron. With your thumbs, grab all of the above the top of your ears and clip it on top of your head. Split the lower section of your hair into sections slightly smaller than the iron itself and continue. For instance, if you’re working with a 2-inch (5 cm) curling iron or wand, use 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) sections of hair. [2] X Research source Even if you have thin hair, you’ll get better results working with small sections of hair. This will ensure you’re curling everything in a uniform style. Using bigger sections of hair will result in bigger, looser curls, while using smaller sections will give you smaller, tighter ringlets."

To use a curling iron with a clamp, open it and position the ends of your hair at the lower end of the barrel (near the handle), then close the clamp to secure it. Wrap that section of hair around the iron by rolling it upwards towards your roots. Stop rolling when you’re an inch away from the roots to prevent burning your scalp. [3] X Research source For curling wands , start near the top of your hair and use your hand to wrap a piece of hair around the iron. Hold the end of your hair in place while that section curls. Use safety gloves to avoid burning your hands."

Divide it into small sections and curl each one. For a uniform look, wrap all the curls around the iron in the same direction. However, for a more natural effect, you can alternate the direction of each wrap. If your hair is flat, try pinning each curl with a bobby pin. Once your hair cools down, remove the pins."

The curls will pull down and loosen up as you do. You can also turn your head upside down and use your fingers to separate the curls. [5] X Research source If you loosen your curls with a hairbrush, your hair will look more wavy rather than curly."

      "content": "Set your hair with hairspray for a stronger hold. If you’re worried about your curls turning frizzy or falling out throughout the day, mist some hairspray over your curls. Hold the can about 12-14 inches (30.5 cm - 35.5 cm) away from your head and spray evenly around your hair. Be careful not to apply too much. [6] X Research source To maintain tight curls, spray each curl individually. For a looser style, wait until the curls have relaxed a little and spray them. Choose a loose hold hairspray so your curls aren't too stiff and your hair doesn't feel too \"crunchy.” Never apply hairspray to the curls while still wrapped around the iron. Combining the heat from the irons and the alcohol in the hairspray can damage your hair."

A flat paddle-style iron may not curl your hair the way you want, so opt for a flat iron with rounded edges that are 1 to 2 inches in width (2.5-5 cm). Set the iron to 325ºF (162ºC) for fine hair. Lightly coat your hair with heat protectant spray and make sure it's totally dry before applying heat. Add a volumizing mousse to your hair before drying it, which will help give you bouncy curls and prevent your hair from looking flat once styled. Curling hair with a flat iron is best for spiral curls, crimped hair, or beach waves."

      "content": "Curl one small section at a time. Pin the top section of your hair to your head, revealing the bottom layer. For large curls, use sections that are at least 2 inches (5 cm) wide. For tighter ringlets, use sections less than 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Clamp the flat iron around the hair, giving it a half turn so your hair is in a U-shape. Hold the flat iron horizontally as you move it down the section to the end. [7] X Research source The position of the flat iron will determine what kind of curls you end up with. If you want your hair curled from the root to the tip, position the flat iron as close to your scalp as possible without burning it. If you want to curl the ends of your hair, position the flat iron about halfway down the hair to begin. This is called a flick. The slower you move the iron, the tighter the curls. Moving the iron down the hair quickly will make your curls soft and loose."

[15] X Research source Don’t leave hot rollers in longer than the manufacturer’s recommended time to prevent damage to your hair. Wet set rollers will need to be left in until all of your hair is completely dry, which may take several hours or overnight.
