Many new mothers don't want to leave their puppies to eat, so they abstain from eating for too long after giving birth.

If your mother dog is hesitant to eat dog food right after birthing puppies, give her high-calorie treats that she can't resist.

[4] X Research source High-quality puppy food is a nutritious, high-calorie food source for mother dogs after birth and during nursing. However, it may be best to choose puppy foods designed for smaller breeds—the nutrient balance tends to be more favorable for milk production.

      "content": "Provide the dog with liquids immediately. A dog that has given birth will have lost a lot of fluids during that process. Because of this, you want to get her to drink some water as soon as possible afterword. This will help to avoid dehydration. If she doesn't want to drink plain water, try giving her a bit of chicken broth to drink. This may be more enticing to the dog than water is."

      "content": "Feed the mother dog more food than normal. A dog that has given birth and is breastfeeding her puppies will need to eat more food than it normally would. In fact, most dogs should be fed twice as much food as normal after they give birth. If you don't give her enough food, she won't be able to recover from whelping and feed her babies.

Go to source This food should be fed in small meals throughout the day, instead of just a few large meals. This will help your dog digest the food easier. Refer to the back of your dog's food bag to see what serving the manufacturer recommends for pregnant or nursing dogs. You can also check with your vet to see what an appropriate serving size would be based on her size and nutritional needs."

      "content": "Transition the mother dog to puppy food. Puppy food is high in calories and it is highly digestible. This means that the mother can absorb the nutrients in the food quickly. Feeding the mother dog puppy food also assures that the puppies she is feeding get the proper nutrition. [7] X Research source Feed the mother dog the food amount suggested on the puppy food packaging, but make sure to give multiple meals throughout the day or just let the dog graze on the food constantly. If you haven’t been giving her puppy food before this, transition gradually in order to avoid stomach upset, mix the puppy food with the dog's normal food for the first 3-4 days. This will help the mother dog to adjust to the puppy food gradually."

      "content": "Increase the amount you feed the mother dog for several weeks. Your mother dog will need to increase the amount of milk it produces over several weeks after giving birth. It will be at peak milk production around three weeks after giving birth. At this point it will also need to be eating up to four times as much food as it did before pregnancy. [10] X Research source This food should be spread out over at least four meals throughout the day. This will help her to digest this increased amount of food. If you dog is nursing more than 2 puppies, it’s okay to let her free-feed for the first 3 or 4 weeks after she gives birth. If she only has 1 or 2 puppies, give her several regular meals a day, but don’t let her free feed—she may produce more milk than her puppies can use, which can lead to mastitis.

      "content": "Monitor the mother dog's weight. A mother dog that is nursing puppies is at risk of losing too much weight. If she is not taking in enough calories to keep up with the milk production, her body will use reserves that can lead to unhealthy weight loss. In order to avoid this, make sure that your dog has not lost more than ten percent of its original weight before pregnancy. If your dog has lost too much weight you need to increase the fat and protein content of the food you are feeding it, as well as increasing the amount it eats. [12] X Research source"
