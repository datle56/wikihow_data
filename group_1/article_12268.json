      "content": "Put cooking spray on a pan. Lay a pan flat on a clean work surface. Use a bottle of cooking spray and squirt it across the surface of the pan. The dough will rise to double its size in the fridge so make sure that your pan is big enough for this expansion. [1] X Research source You can also make your own cooking spray. Buy a spray bottle and fill it with canola, olive, or another type of oil and use that on your pan instead."

      "content": "Put your pan in the refrigerator and leave it overnight. Ensure the dough has enough room to double its original size. If your pan is too big for the shelves, pull the shelf out of the fridge and place it on a lower groove on the inside wall of the fridge. [3] X Research source If you don't have the time to leave the dough in the fridge overnight, you can leave it in there during the day for 8 hours or so."

      "content": "Leave the dough rise at room temperature if you need to. If you think the dough still needs to rise a bit more, remove the plastic wrap and leave it on the worktop in your kitchen. Allow it to rise for 30-60 minutes. [4] X Research source You can preheat your oven while the dough rises at room temperature."

Before you place the plastic wrap over the dough, squirt the wrap with cooking spray. This will make sure the dough doesn't stick to it. [5] X Research source Wind the plastic wrap tightly around the dough."

Leaving it out at room temperature will give the dough plenty of time to properly rise. [8] X Research source Once the dough has risen enough, place it in the oven and bake it as per the recipe."
