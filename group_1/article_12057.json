Or, it might be that you got caught up in the romance of it all and are only now realizing the effect it's having on your life—and that's okay! It's easy to get caught up in those initial feelings, but as time goes on, you're likely to discover that you need more than you did at first. [1] X Research source It can be as simple as seeing pics a friend posts on social media and wishing you could post similar pics with your partner. Miller confirms that \"if you're comparing yourself to other relationships and yours doesn't feel as good,\" that's a sign your relationship is unhealthy. Making a list of little things like this that would make you happy can be a great way to help you better understand your needs and wants."

So even if you don't agree with it, you still have to find a way to understand where they're coming from.\" Here are some tips for a productive and worthwhile conversation: Use \"I\" statements : Start with \"I feel this way when\" to put the focus on how you feel. \"It's all about those 'I' statements,\" Miller advises. \"People turn off completely when they feel criticized.\" Listen actively : \"There's a huge difference between hearing and listening,\" Miller emphasizes. \"Hearing is just… picking up sounds, listening is actually hearing the noises and processing them.\" Paraphrase back what your partner says: \"I'm a big proponent of something called reflective listening,\" Miller explains, \"where the partner says something and the other partner repeats back what that person said.\""

If your partner has fears or past experiences that are pushing them to keep your relationship a secret, a counselor can help them unpack those issues. They can also help the two of you communicate better by providing a safe environment for you to express your feelings.

      "content": "Establish strong boundaries for moving forward. If something in your relationship is making you uncomfortable, set boundaries with your partner to protect your well-being. Boundaries aren't rules or ultimatums—rather, you're telling your partner what you need in your relationship and what you will do if that need isn't met. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, you might say, \"I feel stressed out by this secrecy. I want to start telling our friends and family about our relationship before the end of the month.\" Set a clear consequence if your partner violates your boundary. In the previous example, you might tell your partner that you won't continue the relationship unless the secrecy ends. Make sure whatever consequence you choose is clear, specific, proportionate to the violation, and something you're willing to actually do."

      "content": "They are a private person who is reserved about their personal life. Many people just don't want everybody knowing their business, and there's nothing wrong with that. But someone who's merely reserved isn't going to lie about being in a relationship or intentionally hide the fact that they're in a relationship. It isn't fair for your partner to use privacy as an excuse to misrepresent their relationship status. [4] X Research source For example, you might consider how your partner would answer if someone asked if they were seeing anyone. Someone concerned about privacy might say something like, \"I don't discuss my personal life with strangers.\" Is this okay? It is, as long as they're being honest with everyone. Remember, it's only been fairly recently in human history that social media has been around. It's not normal for every passing acquaintance to have all of this information about your personal life. At the same time, if you're someone who prefers to have a relationship that's more out in the open, someone who's very reserved about their personal life might not be the best romantic partner for you."

It sounds great at first—the idea of your relationship as this precious, tender thing that you want to nurture and protect so that it can grow a little stronger before you share it with the world. But if what your partner is really concerned about is criticism, they may never be ready to go public. [5] X Research source Is this okay? For a few weeks it can be. It's definitely not a bad thing to want to focus on your connection to someone you love. But as the weeks wear on, the act of keeping it secret can become a bigger deal than whatever interference you were trying to avoid. At the same time, it could also mean that your partner is trying to isolate you from friends and family members. It's worth taking a look at exactly what they're worried about people saying or doing when they find out about your relationship. [6] X Research source"

They might also be trying to avoid judgment from people they know if they pop up in another relationship too soon after the last one ended. But beyond a certain point, it can feel like your partner is just using this as an excuse to not make a commitment to you. [7] X Research source Is this okay? In the short term, a little secrecy here might be fine, as long as you're both okay with it—especially if their relationship ended fairly recently. It's not a bad thing that they want to show respect to their ex or to family or mutual friends."

      "content": "They want to take it slow and think it's too soon for labels. Making it official can be a pretty big deal for some people and they want to make absolutely sure before they pull the trigger. This is probably a good sign because it usually means they take commitment more seriously. But it can also be really frustrating if you're ready to take the relationship to the next level and they're dragging their feet. [8] X Research source Is this okay? It might be, but it's probably not a good thing for more than a month or two. That's usually long enough for someone to decide if they want to be in a serious relationship—and at that point, it probably shouldn't be a secret anymore."

      "content": "Your relationship is forbidden or prohibited for some reason. The idea of being \"star-crossed lovers\" can definitely feel romantic and exciting, especially at first. And often, the reason to keep the relationship secret applies to both of you—meaning that you would both suffer (or believe you would suffer) negative consequences if the relationship was out in the open. [9] X Research source For example, you might have a relationship with a co-worker at a company that forbids romantic relationships between coworkers—in which case both of you have an interest in keeping the relationship secret. Prohibitions can also be based on cultural or religious beliefs. These can sometimes be the most difficult to overcome. At the same time, fighting those prohibitions can be a very empowering and liberating experience. Is this okay? It can be fine, as long as both of you are on the same page. It can become problematic if one of you starts thinking that the reason for the secrecy is more important than the relationship (for example, you start to think that they care about their job more than they care about you)."

      "content": "They have children. Parents typically don't introduce their kids to someone they've been dating until things are getting pretty serious. Depending on how old their kids are, that might also mean keeping your relationship off of social media or even more secret to keep them from finding out about it before their parent has a chance to talk to them about it. [10] X Research source Is this okay? For a few months or even up to a year this is probably okay—and it's something you're going to have to get used to if you want to date someone with kids. Keep in mind that if you're dating a parent, their kids are going to come first. If you're not comfortable waiting or feel that they're taking too long, this relationship might not meet your needs."

You might feel rejected when they don't show you affection in public, or feel frustrated when you have to lie about your own sexuality to cover for them. At the same time, not everyone can safely be out to everyone in their life. The most important thing is being honest with each other. [11] X Research source For example, suppose your partner tells you they're going to come out soon but they keep pushing the date back. This could mean that they just keep getting cold feet—but it could also mean that they're just stringing you along and have no intention of ever coming out. Is this okay? You can't control when someone comes out, but is it fair to you to have to go back in the closet just because your partner isn't ready to come out yet? Probably not. It's up to you to decide if you understand your partner's reasons and are willing to accept them. If you're not comfortable living in the closet with this person, then they're probably not the best romantic partner for you at this point. That doesn't mean that the two of you can't hook up again down the road if they do come out later."

If your partner is deceiving someone else by being in a romantic relationship with you, it's probably time to quit while you're ahead and chalk this one up to a learning experience. [12] X Research source Some people go into an affair fully aware of the circumstances. And being someone's \"dirty little secret\" can be a hot—for a little while, anyway. But eventually, if you start getting more attached to the person, you're going to start wanting more. Cheaters will often tell affair partners that they plan to leave their existing relationship and continue the affair as a legitimate relationship—but they rarely follow through with this. Is this okay? Absolutely not. Under no circumstances is this one okay, just… no. You deserve better. Your partner isn't being fair to you or to their partner in their other relationship."

Research shows being in a secret relationship really tanks your self-esteem—even if you tell yourself you agree with the reasons for the secrecy. [13] X Research source You deserve to be celebrated and openly adored, not hidden in the shadows or behind closed doors. You might start to believe that your partner is actually ashamed of you or doesn't think you're good enough for them, which can really damage your self-worth. [14] X Research source If you start believing that you're not good enough, you might start overcompensating to try to prove your worth, which can lead to codependency. What you can do: \"I always say to gain more self-esteem, do esteemable acts,\" Miller advises. \"A lot of times we focus on our partner to lift us up and validate us again, and I'm saying no, it's the opposite.\""

This makes it difficult for you to make new friends or maintain the friendships you have. For example, you might find yourself ignoring texts from a friend you normally love to meet for coffee because you know they'll ask about your relationship and you don't want to lie about it. What you can do: Reach out to a good friend or close family member and make plans to hang out within the next week or so. If it's someone you feel comfortable talking to about your secret relationship, you might consider doing that."

You might think that you're taking private time to build your relationship and focus on each other, but you're really holding yourselves back. When you're in situations where you can't express your true emotions for each other, you're deliberately being false with each other. This can actually make it harder for you to trust each other later on, even if you take the relationship public. [16] X Research source As long as your relationship is secret, it's likely you'll only be able to take it so far. It's really hard to get to the point where someone is a top priority in your life if you have to keep your relationship with them secret.

[18] X Research source You're also missing out on a lot of shared experiences and different ways to connect with each other or be intimate with each other. What you can do: Let your partner know that you want to meet the other people in their life. For example, you might say, \"Could I come with you next time you go out to dinner with your folks?

Even if you agree with the reasons for keeping the relationship secret and you're okay with them, keeping that secret can take a tremendous toll on both of you and on the relationship as a whole. It can be exhausting just keeping up with what stories you've told to what people. [19] X Research source All of this is also stressful because you're living in a constant state of worry about being found out. That stress can seriously impact your physical and mental health. [20] X Research source Research going all the way back to 1994 has found that the act of keeping a secret requires you to carry a significant cognitive load at all times because you're constantly thinking of the secret and how to avoid revealing it, as well as trying to remember everything you've said to avoid revealing the secret. [21] X Research source What you can do: Make sure you're taking time for yourself. Go for a walk every day to recharge, join a club related to an interest, or meditate —whatever fulfills you."

Secret relationships not only make you feel bad about yourself, they also make you feel bad about your relationship.

Privacy, on the other hand, is about protecting your personal boundaries. To make things even more confusing, legitimate privacy interests can turn into secrets. [24] X Research source For example, someone might have a legitimate privacy interest in not introducing their children to everyone they date. But if they're lying to their children about the fact that they're dating, that would be nonconsensual secrecy.

People typically use these slang terms to refer to someone who is keeping a relationship secret for bad reasons, though—so saying you're being pocketed or that you're pocketing someone definitely has negative connotations. [25] X Research source If someone is pocketing you, it basically means that they're keeping you on the back burner but not making a full commitment to you or claiming you officially as their significant other. The implication is that the person is using the person they're pocketing—typically for sex, but sometimes for emotional support, companionship, or other reasons."

Keep in mind that when you change your relationship status on social media, you typically don't have to make a post about the change that will show up on people's feeds.

It also gives your friends a chance to get used to the idea of the two of you as a couple in a casual environment. For example, if one of you had to find a new employer so that the two of you could date publicly, you probably don't want to make your first appearance at a work event. It's also usually best to avoid making your first appearance as a couple at someone's personal event, such as a birthday party or wedding.

Relationships are supposed to enrich your life and make it easier, not burden it and make it harder. If you're ready to have an open, public relationship and your partner is not, your relationship might not be capable of fulfilling your needs anymore—and that's okay.
