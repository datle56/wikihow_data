      "content": "French bangs feature soft layers that taper downward. According to Master Hair Stylist Jasmine Todd, French bangs are \"thicker and longer than a traditional straight-across bang.

Unlike a blunt cut bang, a French bang has wispy ends and is usually cut with a razor to create a softer, more textured look. It is a popular choice for those looking for a more relaxed and effortless hairstyle.\" Wherever you look on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, tutorials on French bangs have reimagined our fascination with Parisian chic thanks to guides on cutting your own, before and afters at the salon, and styling tips."

If you’re worried about drying out your hair, you can apply a protection spray to your hair before blow-drying. Next, blow dry your separated front section of hair at a 90-degree angle while holding it with a round brush. At the same time, pull the hair up and away from your face to give it a boost of volume. Do this until your bangs are completely dry. Repeat the above step with the sectioned-off hair on each side of your face. This may take longer, depending on how many layers your fringe has. ​​Finish by using a texture spray so your hair stays fabulous all day long. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Get French bangs if you want a chic, effortless look. The French use a very specific equation for getting bangs. Grab your calculator or a paper and pencil for a little basic math! First, measure your forehead by placing your fingers horizontally between your forehead and the top of your eyes. If the height equals 3 fingers, it equals 1. Four fingers equal a 2, and 5 fingers equal a 3. Then, figure out which part of your face is the widest. If your forehead is the widest part of your face, it equals 1. Your cheeks equal 2, while your chin equals 3. Now, is the distance between your eyebrows larger or smaller than the width of one eye? Larger equals 1, while smaller equals 2. The three-digit number you end up with determines the equation. Your face may not be well-suited for bangs if your number equals 111, 121, 221, or 231. Resulting numbers of 222, 321, 312, 212, or 322 may work well with bangs. Ending up with 131, 112, 122, 132, 232, 311, 331, or 332 usually means you’re destined for curtain bangs.
