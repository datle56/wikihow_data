      "content": "Gather your materials. Making a basic scarf is easy to do, but you will need to have some special materials handy. You will need: [1] X Research source Medium worsted weight yarn in the color(s) of your choice. You will need at least one ball of yarn, and possible three or four depending on how big the yarn balls are and long you want to make your scarf. Worsted cotton is softer, and also can slip along your needle easier. It may also be more flexible, as well, allowing your scarf to be folded up and stored in a drawer for your next use. Size H crochet hook. This is a good size for working with medium worsted weight yarn. If you end up choosing a different type of yarn, then be sure to check the label for recommendations about what hook size works best with that kind of yarn. The yarn label should tell you which size of hook to use. If it doesn’t, choose one between 5 mm. and 6 mm. These should provide you with the type of material you want. Scissors Crochet needle (optional, for weaving in tail and embellishing)"

      "content": "Make a slip knot, and begin to chain. To make a slip knot, cross a section of the yarn tail over the working yarn, which comes directly from the yarn ball, creating a loop. Push the tail of the yarn through the loop, but not all the way. Use your thumb, and push it through just so that your hook can slip through the loop made. Pull the tail and the working yarn together. Pull the working yarn over your hook, and dip the hook to the left and down. (If you are a right-hander, dip it right.) Pull the yarn through the hook. You have made a chain stitch! Keep going, until you have the width of the scarf you would like."

[3] X Research source Make a slipknot first by looping the yarn around your fingers twice and then pulling the second loop through the first. Then, slide the slipknot onto the hook and tighten it. Make the first chain by looping the yarn over the hook and pulling it through the slipknot. [4] X Research source Continue to loop the yarn over and pull through until you have a chain of 34. Keep in mind that you can chain more or less stitches if you want the chain to be wider or narrower. The number of chains also depends on the thickness of your yarn.

      "content": "Use single crochet for the first row. Chain two stitches to begin the first row of single crochet stitches. This will be your turning chain. Always start your rows with a chain of two and then turn your work around before you begin working the single crochet stitch. To single crochet, insert the hook into the third stitch from the hook and yarn over. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete your first single crochet stitch. [6] X Research source Continue to single crochet all stitches to the end of the row. Insert the hook into the second loop underneath the hook. The chain stitches made little “v’s”. Choose the “v” closest to you, and insert your hook through one of the loops making the main “v”. Yarn over, and pull the yarn through the “v”. Now you have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, temporarily putting three loops, and pull through both the loops. Now you have one. Continue. Now, when you reach the end of the chain you made, create a chain. Flip the row you just made, and insert your hook into BOTH loops that make the “v” and continue. If you want an extra stretchy material, insert your hook into only one, known as “sc in blo only”."

Remember to chain two before each new row, and then turn your work around. To make your first double crochet stitch, loop the yarn over the hook, and then insert the hook into the third stitch from the hook and yarn over again. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook, and then yarn over again. Pull through the next two stitches, and then yarn over again. Pull through the last two stitches to complete your first double crochet stitch. [7] X Research source Continue to double crochet all stitches to the end of the row."

You can thread a crochet needle with some contrasting yarn and stitch polka dots, stripes, or even initials into your scarf to embellish it. You can also try single or double crocheting around the edges of your scarf to add an interesting accent, or if you want to get advanced, then you could try a triple picot border."
