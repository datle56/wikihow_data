      "content": "Slide your back down the wall, bending your knees until they are bent at about a 90 degree angle. Your thighs should be parallel to the ground and it should appear that you are sitting in an invisible chair. [4] X Research source Your knees should never extend past your ankles--they should be straight above your ankles. You may need to slide further up or down on the wall to get into this position. [5] X Research source This position strengthens your quadriceps on the front of your thigh and your hamstrings on the back of your thigh, which can help prevent damage to your knees. These muscles are necessary for everyday actions like standing and walking, so it's important to keep them in good shape."
