Changes in perception can be annoying or even frightening, but they aren't necessarily a sign of any serious physical damage that is life threatening. [3] X Research source Rathus, S. (2011). Psychology: Concepts and Connections. Cengage Learning. Any alterations in brain chemistry are related to how you see things, not how your body generally functions. [4] X Research source These alterations are also distinctly different from hallucinations since they're clearly not associated with what's happening in the present moment. Changes in perception shouldn't be confused with reality. Any serious health consequences of HPPD aren't caused by brain damage from whatever drug was used. Instead, health problems typically come from sustained depression or anxiety associated with the persistent flashbacks.

For example, you may feel as though you're watching yourself from an outside perspective or from outside your body. [6] X Research source This feeling of disconnect can also be accompanied by a sense that you're in a dreamlike state or that the world isn't a real place. Like other HPPD symptoms, this can be frightening and last for an unknown period of time. But, it's not necessarily a sign of serious physical damage that needs immediate treatment."

      "content": "Consider the severity of your symptoms. Sometimes people who use hallucinogenic drugs notice visual disturbances in the weeks after use, while sometimes they last for years.

Go to source Since this varies by individual, there’s really no clear way of knowing how long your visual disturbances will last. You most likely won't need to treat HPPD as if it was a serious health condition. But, if you have difficulty functioning, struggle to go to work or school, or can't interact with people, you may need to consider treatment for the symptoms. Even people who are affected by perceptual disturbances for years can go onto live a functioning lives despite the alterations. Some people have even reported pleasurable alterations in perception, with no desire for them to dissipate. [8] X Research source G Lerner, A., Rudinski, D., Bor, O., &amp; Goodman, C. (2014).

If you've used hallucinogenic drugs and are affected by perceptual disturbances to the point that you can't function in your daily life, you should get help. A mental health professional can work with you to discuss lifestyle changes and behavioral therapies. Or, if you see a medical doctor, you might be prescribed medications to alleviate some of the perceptual disturbances, even though there's no cure for HPPD.

These are primarily effective because they can relax you or temporarily improve the symptoms. But, these medications could have serious long-term side effects if you take them for a long period of time. [13] X Research source Pay attention to how your body responds to medication and let your doctor know of any harmful side effects. Also, remember that medication won't keep the perceptual alterations away permanently."

      "content": "Get therapy. You may want to work with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, to develop coping skills or techniques. This can help you manage the symptoms of HPPD and any anxiety or depression the symptoms may be causing. Working with a therapist can also be helpful if you specifically want help in managing the symptom of depersonalization. [14] X Research source Among therapeutic treatments, you might consider: Relaxation techniques, including systematic desensitization. These techniques can be useful in dealing with daily situations that may cause you anxiety. When practiced correctly and consistently, relaxation techniques can give you a greater sense of freedom in your everyday life. [15] X Research source Johnson, W. R., &amp; L, W. (1997).

This is especially important to consider when taking visually active drugs like LSD, cannabis and psychedelic drugs like magic mushrooms, MDMA, or mescaline.
