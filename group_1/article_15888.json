Dancing, playing a sport, jump roping, and playing outdoor games are great ways to exercise while enjoying the experience. You can exercise in fun ways by incorporating your family members and pets. Playing frisbee with your siblings or running with your dog can be far more exciting than running around the block 10 times."

If you are uncomfortable with your body hair, shave it (or wax if you are allowed to). Allow yourself to de-stress and talk to someone you trust if you are not feeling good. Females: If your breasts feel uncomfortable, buy a training bra. As you develop more, you can buy a larger, padded training bra and later, a cup bra. Additionally, some girls start their periods as preteens. Track your cycle to prepare when it starts and buy your menstrual products. You can use pads, tampons, or cups. Find ways to deal with leaking and cramps on your period. Males: Males will have frequent erections (sometimes by romantic thoughts, sometimes randomly), so find ways to hide them . If you accidentally get some liquid on your pants, know how to clean the fabric. If you have facial hair, you can shave it off or style it into a mustache or beard."

The preteen years are when some people start to feel stressed; the beginning of puberty, peer pressure, self-consciousness, and transition to middle school can make preteens feel anxious. If you are stressed, angry, or sad about something, feel free to tell someone you feel comfortable with. Such as your parents or a close friend. Don't hide your feelings and pretend they don't exist, since this will only worsen your mental health. Take some time off to de-stress and relax. If your parents enrolled you in many extracurriculars, this may be challenging. However, you can take 30 minutes before bed to relax and enjoy your free time. If you have too much on your plate, you can talk to your parents or school counselor about it. You may be able to remove some extracurriculars from your schedule. If you are feeling down, talk to someone. If your parents aren't available, try talking to a school teacher after class or a school counselor.

Your parents may be able to help you find a good therapist. Depression : People with depression feel sad and low most of the time. They feel empty or hopeless about their situation. They slowly lose interest in hobbies and things they usually enjoy doing. The person may cry a lot or get angry over things that never bothered them before.

Eating disorder : People with an eating disorder may care a lot about their appearance. They may stare at their body in the mirror frequently, thinking that they are unattractive. They may say that they are overweight or \"fat\" even when it is untrue. They may skip meals, vomit the food they ate, or exercise too much in order to lose weight.

      "content": "Understand what middle school (or secondary school) is like. If you are in your last year of elementary/primary school, you may be wondering what middle school is like. Middle school is different than elementary school since you have different teachers for each class. This means that you will have to pack up and move to your next class. If you are in an American middle school, you will have a locker to put your school items in. As middle school goes on, the teachers will remind you less of expectations and assignment due dates since you are expected to know this information. Some kids are mature in middle school, whereas some may act younger than their age. So, don't believe that you have to act a certain way to fit in. Everyone's different and it's completely okay. With most people going through puberty in middle school, males and females may feel uncomfortable being close to each other as friends than in previous years. However, there are no limits to who you can befriend! You can still be friends with someone of the opposite gender."

So, for your high school years (and your adulthood) to be successful, take time to review information from previous lessons. Take breaks in between study sessions so you won't get too tired (and lose focus). You can use a website such as Quizlet or Kahoot to review, or you could make your own paper notecards to study vocabulary. For math and science (mainly for math-based science such as physics/chemistry), practice a few problems on paper to make sure you understand the whole topic.

Shower (if you shower in the morning), get dressed, and do your hair or some light makeup if you're in middle school. Check if everything is in your backpack and head out the door! [13] X Research source Also, plan on leaving some spare time if you walk to school. Walking often takes a while, so leave home early. For example, if it takes you 10 minutes to walk to school and school starts at 8:15 AM, leave your house at 8 AM or 7:55 AM as a safeguard."

Because everyone is going through puberty (and will be self-conscious), your school may separate the boys and girls into different PE classes. Some may decide to keep everyone together for the sake of time. The school will likely tell you to purchase gym clothing, and you will change in and out of this clothing before and after each gym class. Here are some tips to survive PE as a preteen: Don't stare at people when changing. You may get in trouble for invading others' privacy. Look at a wall or your locker. Change fast. You may be able to wear your gym clothing to school; check with your PE teacher to make sure. If you are changing for swimming class, put a towel over your waist region to cover yourself. Remember that it's just gym class, not an official sports competition. Stop caring about whether your performance is good enough and that you can impress everyone in the class. PE is often only graded on participation, so you don't have to be a star athlete. Making friends in gym class can help you feel less alone. It also minimizes the chance that you get picked last during team selection, which can be embarrassing."

You can keep in touch with your old friends too by keeping cell phone numbers or email addresses. In sixth and seventh grade, try making some new friends to branch out. Even if you're one of the older kids, it's still possible to make new friends! You can make friends with classmates of any grade level. If you see a kid sitting alone, wave to them, smile, and introduce yourself. Ask them if you can sit next to them. If they agree, you can then strike up a conversation with them about school. Once you get to know them, you can talk about more personal matters. Be friendly to everyone who is friendly to you. If people are mean to you, you don't need to be too friendly."

[14] X Research source You might try out a new hairstyle or start wearing more earrings and necklaces. Try out different accessories to see which ones fit best on you. If you want to look more mature, avoid wearing cartoony graphic T-shirts and bright shorts/skirts too often. Bright or neon colors may make you look immature.

Think about it; what memories will you have if you scroll and watch videos for hours every day? You won't have many interesting memories of your preteen years in the future. Scrolling online and watching videos also wastes time. You want actual, tangible memories of you with your besties, family, and classmates that you can remember for years.

Instead, if they say something that offends you, say, \"I'm going to take a short break\". Take deep breaths, stretch, take a sip of water, and think about the best way to solve the problem. Use \"I\" language when explaining your emotions. Find a way to compromise if your parents have strong feelings for something. Sometimes, you may have to give in to your parents. This is normal at your age. Preteens don't have the maturity of older kids, and many preteens will still act impulsively. Your parents may be doing what is best for you. You may have to wait until you are in high school to dye your hair, and that's ok. It's not the end of the world, and you can wait a few months and check again to see if they will allow you."

You may find out where your crush sits during lunch to get closer to them. There are a few ways on how to deal with a crush. You can keep your crush a secret. You could admire them from afar and cheer on them during sporting events. This is fine, but you may miss an opportunity to know your crush more after you move on to high school (as you two may attend different schools). You could tell it to your best friends. Your best friends may encourage you to tell your crush about your feelings. Tape a note on their locker (or slip it into their backpack) asking for their feelings. You can do this to see if they feel the same way. If they do, you can date them; just know that the relationship may not last long. If they don't, move on. You could confidently admit to your crush that you are in love with them. After some thinking, you can tell your crush in private about your feelings and ask if they feel the same way. If they do, you can date them; just know that the relationship may not last long. If they don't, move on. On the other hand, stop crushing on them. If you know that a long-term relationship with them wouldn't be realistic (e.g. they are actually mean, too immature, or if you guys are going to different schools after graduation), move on.

You may think that you will date and eventually get married or start a happy life with your significant other. However, most people start having crushes at this time, but these usually aren't enough to blossom into fully committed and responsible relationships. Besides, many kids are still immature in middle school, so it's best not to date until you are older.

Preteens are under the age of 13, which is the minimum age you need to join most social media platforms. [19] X Research source Since you are pretty young, you should live your life happily offline instead of devoting your time to following online creators and posts. Go outdoors and enjoy the weather.

Kids try fitting in with others to feel included as part of a group. However, if you aren't happy with it, you should stop. Being yourself makes you the happiest, and it showcases your true personality to other people. You may also be liked more since you are more authentic.
