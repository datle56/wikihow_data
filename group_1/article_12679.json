      "content": "Compare your personality to the traits associated with each house. Think of which traits you value and use the most in your life, like bravery, wisdom, cunning, kindness, or fairness. If you’re struggling to identify with a particular trait, think about what you like doing in your free time. Do you like to go on adventures, read books, play strategy games, or do community service? Once you’ve nailed down your core characteristics, check which house traits they aligns with. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that your defining personality might not decide your house. Think about what traits you value most in yourself and others, rather than your strongest or most dominant traits. For example, most people would describe Hermione Granger as smart and intelligent above all else, making her a seeming shoo-in for Ravenclaw. However, she values bravery and friendship more than intelligence or academic achievements, which places her in Gryffindor. You might also be a mixture of two houses, which is totally fine! You could be, for example, a Slytherclaw or a Gryffinpuff."

      "content": "Consider whether there are any Harry Potter characters you relate to. Every witch or wizard character in Harry Potter is assigned to a house. So, if there are any characters you really see yourself in, that might be a big clue as to which house you belong to. For instance, if you relate a lot to Neville Longbottom’s character and think you’d make the same choices as he does throughout the series, you might be a Gryffindor just like him! Other characters you might relate to for each house include: [2] X Research source Harry Potter, Gryffindor: Harry’s personality reflects Gryffindor well—bravery, courage, and fearlessness. For example, he goes into the Chamber of Secrets to save his friend’s sister and almost gets himself killed. If you tend to act similarly to Harry, you may be in Gryffindor! Luna Lovegood, Ravenclaw: Luna is very educated in magical creatures, and she and her family enjoyed researching and learning more about them. Luna was also very creative, curious, and eccentric—all defining qualities of a Ravenclaw. If you see yourself in Luna, you might be a Ravenclaw! Cedric Diggory, Hufflepuff. Cedric proved himself to be very kind, level-headed, and humble throughout The Goblet of Fire . For example, Cedric kindly and humbly tells Harry to take the cup first when the pair are about to win the tournament. He also gives Harry a clue to one of the challenges in order to keep things just and fair. If you’d behave like Cedric, you might be a Hufflepuff! Draco Malfoy, Slytherin. Draco showcases ambition in the series, which we can see in his desire to outperform Harry to become a respected wizard and esteemed Quidditch player. He also prioritizes self-preservation—he’ll choose what guarantees safety for him and his family over the well-being of others or doing what’s “good.” If you relate to Draco, you might be a Slytherin!"

      "content": "Ask your close friends and family which house they think you’re in. Sometimes, the people closest to us can see us more clearly than we see ourselves. Your close friends and family experience your personality from an outside perspective and may bring up viewpoints about your traits that you aren’t even aware of yourself! Find a friend who knows you really well (and who also knows Harry Potter really well), then ask them which house they think you’d fit into."

      "title": "Consider which house you want to be in.",
      "content": "Consider which house you want to be in. As any true Potterhead knows, the Sorting Hat would take your preferences into consideration when assigning you to a house. In the Harry Potter series, it’s up to the Sorting Hat to decide which house each Hogwarts student belongs in. While the Sorting Hat will ultimately choose the best house for each student by analyzing their deepest qualities, values, and aspirations, it may consider a student’s preferences if one or more houses would be suitable for them. [3] X Research source For example, the Sorting Hat was having trouble deciding whether to place Harry Potter himself into Gryffindor or Slytherin. When Harry expressed a desire to be in Gryffindor, the Sorting Hat obliged. So, while you shouldn’t place yourself in Hufflepuff without embodying any of its traits just because you like it, feel free to consider your house preferences if you feel on the fence about which one you belong to. The Sorting Hat would do the same!"

Online quizzes are a fun and interesting way to quickly determine what your Harry Potter house might be—or to verify that your idea of your house is correct. However, these quizzes don’t know who you are in your heart, so they’re sometimes inaccurate, which is why it can be nice to decide on your own Hogwarts house. If you decide to take a quiz to find your house, take as many as possible, then see which result you got the most often—this result is the most likely to accurately reflect your true house! You can start by taking wikiHow’s ultimate Hogwarts House Quiz . Or, if you’re a kid, take kid’s version to find your TRUE Hogwarts house! The official Pottermore/Wizarding World quiz is another accurate test you can take when trying to find your Hogwarts house. Just make sure to answer the questions honestly!"

The Gryffindor house values bravery above all else, but especially bravery in the face of fear. In other words, you can still feel fear and anxiety and be a Gryffindor—you just have to be willing to face your fears and be brave enough to still do the right or moral thing. [4] X Research source Traits: Bravery, courage, chivalry, determination, loyalty, justice. Symbol: Lion. Colors: Scarlet and gold. Element: Fire. Notable Characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger. Gryffindor Celebrities: Simone Biles, America Ferrera, Oscar Isaac.

At the end of the day, they want to be known as “the clever one” in their social circle. Ravenclaws are more than book smart, however, as they also value intellectualism, creativity, curiosity, and thinking outside of the box. They’re known to embrace eccentricity and individuality—and they tend to have a competitive streak. [6] X Research source Traits: Intellectual, creative, open-minded, witty, wise, independent, intuitive. Symbol: Eagle. Colors: Blue and bronze (books), blue and silver (films). Element: Air.

A Hufflepuff is also likely to be the hardest working of all the houses, since they value hard work and a strong work ethic. They may also be especially good-looking (but humble) or have a gift for working with plants. [8] X Research source Traits: Hardworking, loyal, just, tolerant, kind, modest, patient, empathetic.

In reality, Slytherins are defined by their ambition, their cunning nature, and their strong leadership skills.

The enchanted hat is placed onto each student’s head before announcing which house the student will join. Then, the student joins their chosen house for a meal in the Great Hall. The Sorting Hat is also known to sing a different song about the school’s founding and the four houses during the Sorting Ceremony each year. [14] X Research source Originally, the four founders of Hogwarts (and the namesakes of the houses) would hand-select students for their houses. When it came time to decide how houses would be chosen after the founders died, Godric Gryffindor took off his hat and enchanted it—creating the Sorting Hat."

The House Cup is awarded at the end of each school year, with the winner being decided by which house has earned the most points throughout the year. These points are awarded (or deducted) based on the attitude, behavior, and academic achievements of students. [15] X Research source Quidditch matches are also played as house versus house, with each house having its own Quidditch team made up solely of members from their house. [16] X Research source While most of the competition between houses is meant to be friendly and collegial, the most bitter rivalry exists between Slytherin and Gryffindor. Students in these houses seem to naturally loathe each other, likely stemming from the rift between former friends Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin. [17] X Research source While Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff don’t share the same level of rivalry, there are some accounts that the humble Hufflepuffs become easily annoyed by the Ravenclaw habit of boasting about their intelligence, wit, and wisdom."

However, did you know that the entrances to each room are different—and that they’re designed to keep out students who don’t belong to that house? [18] X Research source Gryffindors simply have to give a password to the portrait of the Fat Lady in front of their common room door. Slytherins also give a password, but to a hidden stone wall near the dungeons. Hufflepuffs have to tap a barrel that’s near the school kitchens to the rhythm of ‘Helga Hufflepuff.’ Ravenclaws have to answer a riddle told to them by an enchanted door knocker."

[19] X Research source The Bloody Baron: He appears covered in bloodstains and bound in chains, due to his murder of Helena Ravenclaw (after which he took his own life). The Fat Friar: A jolly monk-like ghost who was executed for suspicious tricks, like curing pox and pulling rabbits out of a Communion cup. The Grey Lady: Helena Ravenclaw, the sad and solemn daughter of the house’s founder.

Rowena’s daughter, Helena (who later becomes the Grey Lady), eventually grew envious of her mother’s world-renowned intelligence. So, one day, Helena stole Rowena’s diadem and ran off with it. Rowena soon fell ill, but she wanted to see her daughter one last time, so she sent a man to find her and bring her home. [21] X Research source Unfortunately, that man turned out to be the Bloody Baron, who was deeply infatuated with Helena. When Helena refused to come home, the Bloody Baron stabbed and killed her.
