If you’re allowed, use a calculator to limit the number of simple math mistakes. For example: An object accelerating east at 10 meters (32.8 ft) per second squared traveled for 12 seconds reaching a final velocity of 200 meters (656.2 ft) per second. Find the initial velocity of that object. Write the known information: V i = ?, V f = 200 m/s, a = 10 m/s 2 , t = 12 s Multiply the acceleration and time. a * t = 10 * 12 =120 Subtract the product from the final velocity. V i = V f – (a * t) = 200 – 120 = 80 V i = 80 m/s east Write your answer correctly. Include a unit of measurement, usually meters per second or m/s , as well as a direction the object was traveling in. Without providing information about the direction, you only have a measurement of speed rather than velocity."

If you’re allowed, use a calculator to limit the number of simple math mistakes. For example: An object accelerating west at 7 meters (23.0 ft) per second squared traveled a distance of 150 meters (492.1 ft) within 30 seconds. Calculate the initial velocity of that object. Write the known information: V i = ?, d = 150 m, a = 7 m/s 2 , t = 30 s Multiply the acceleration and time. a * t = 7 * 30 = 210 Divide the product by two. (a * t) / 2 = 210 / 2 = 105 Divide the distance by the time. d / t = 150 / 30 = 5 Subtract your first quotient from the second quotient.
