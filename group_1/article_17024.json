      "content": "A VAT number is a tax ID code containing 2 letters and multiple digits. The VAT country code at the beginning of the ID is always 2 letters, and corresponds with the letters in a country's name. The number of digits that come after the letters vary between countries, but they’re usually 8–12 numbers or letters. Each company has a unique VAT number, so no two will be the same. Example: VAT numbers for Germany start with the letters “DE” and are followed by 9 digits, such as DE123456789. Example: The VAT country code for Estonia is EE, so an Estonian business's VAT number may look like EE93810511 The letters at the start of a VAT number may change based on the language you’re using. For example, the French VAT code is FR in English, but TVA in French. Use the right VAT code based on the government document that is requesting the information.

      "content": "Look for the company on a VAT search engine . If you know the company’s full name and the location where they’re based, you may be able to do a reverse lookup for their VAT number. Enter the country code for the country where the business is registered. Then, enter the company's official name into the search bar to see if the VAT numbers are publicly listed. Most VAT number search engines are for companies based in the European Union (EU), but they may also show results for a few non-EU countries. If the company you're inquiring about isn't in the EU or UK, search the country’s name and the term “VAT registry.” You usually have to enter the official name listed on the business's registration. So if you search for “Microsoft” when you're looking for “Microsoft Indonesia,” you may not see any results. A company's official name may be slightly different from its main product. For example, Pepsi is actually the name of a product while PepsiCo, Inc is the company name. Sometimes the search engines retrieve an outdated or incorrect VAT number. Always cross-reference the VAT number to guarantee its authenticity."
