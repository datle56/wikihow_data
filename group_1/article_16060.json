      "content": "Understand the concept of mutilated currency. If you own U.S. currency that is badly damaged, there are two basic ways to get the currency replaced. The correct method depends on whether or not the currency is considered \"mutilated\". Mutilated currency is defined as any currency that is damaged to the point where it is difficult to determine the value of the currency, or if at least one half of the currency is not present. For example, if you have a bill that is damaged to the point where only 25% of the bill remains, it would be considered mutilated. Missing or damaged security features also constitute a mutilated bill. Mutilation is typically caused by fire, water, chemicals, burial, or animal/insect damage."

If your bill is mutilated, the only way to redeem the currency is by filing a reimbursement claim with the Office of Currency Standards within the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Bureau will use trained experts to determine if the currency is valid before any redemption is made. [1] X Research source You must mail or personally deliver the mutilated currency to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. When you submit the currency, you must include a simple letter indicating the estimated value of the currency, your contact information, and how the currency became damaged. With your submission, you should also include your bank account and routing number if you want to be reimbursed via direct deposit. If you choose to be reimbursed via check, include your mailing address and payee information."

Mailing mutilated currency involves making sure procedures are taken to reduce the chance of further damage occurring. [2] X Research source If the currency is likely to fall apart, pack it gently in cotton, and place the package in a secure container. If the currency was flat when mutilated, never attempt to roll or alter the currency in any way to preserve it. If the currency was in a roll, never attempt to unroll it, and simply mail or deliver it as is. Mail your package to: Bureau of Engraving & Printing, MCD/OFM, Room 344A, P.O. Box 37048, Washington, DC 20013. If you are in the Washington DC area, you can deliver your submission to: Bureau of Engraving & Printing, MCD/OFM, Room 344A, 14th and C Streets SW, Washington, DC 20228 Claims typically take between 6 and 36 months to be fully processed."

Any bill that is clearly more than one half of the original bill and does not require any special training to determine its value is considered damaged. Damaged bills typically include dirty, worn-out, slightly torn, or defaced bills. These bills can be simply exchanged at your local bank."

      "content": "Make sure the currency you are exchanging is valid. In the United States, this is typically not a problem. However, elsewhere it is important to make sure the currency is still accepted as legal tender or exchangeable. This can typically be determined either by searching online for the name and value of the currency, or by calling a bank and asking."

      "title": "Check values if it is very old currency.",
      "content": "Check values if it is very old currency. It may be worth more than face value. There are some notes that are worth more to collectors than the face value. For example, silver backed one dollar bills from the U.S. typically sell for more than $1 in decent condition. If this is the case, you should always confirm its value. If you think your currency is old and may have value, check websites that post values by searching \"collectible currency values\". This will provide a list of price guides. Papermoneyguide.com or coinquest.com could be good starting resources. This is important to consider before simply replacing the currency at the bank. If you have currency from the early 1900s, for example, it may be worth more than the face value and is therefore worthwhile to confirm its value before exchanging. Generally, the older the currency, the more valuable it could be."

      "title": "Find out if the currency is still exchangeable.",
      "content": "Find out if the currency is still exchangeable. Sometimes a new government or central bank takes over and phases out an old currency. Other times, a merger with another currency replaces another. The most common example of the latter is the Euro replacing Francs, Lira, German Marks and other European currencies. Most countries that went to the Euro set a final date to exchange old currency. For the first countries that made the change, such as France and Germany, the final date was in 2012. This means that after this point, old Francs are just paper with no value for exchange. [4] X Research source"

This is the difference between what they pay for a currency and what they sell it for. Because the differences are dramatic at times, search for the best rate and lowest fees by calling and writing down the rates from different dealers. Don't forget to ask about any additional fees. A dealer should be able to quote you an exchange rate based on the spot price for that currency. Remember currency markets move so the rate today is not necessarily the rate tomorrow."

[6] X Research source Several companies of this type exist to provide redemption for defunct currency. These companies work by buying old money from customers at a low rate and exchanging it in bulk with national banks. The Currency Commission is one such company. Using this type of service will provide a lower rate for your exchange, but may be your only option once the issuing government's exchange deadline has passed."
