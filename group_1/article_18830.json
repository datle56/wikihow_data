      "content": "Head to Cianwood City. Cianwood City is an island city. The only way you can get there is by swimming or flying (and in this case you can't). Try surfing over to Cianwood with a Pokémon that has the move Surf. Start from Olivine City to the far left of the lighthouse to start surfing. Stock up on Repels when you Surf or else you'll encounter a lot of Magikarp and Tentacool! Try battling the trainers around the water for more experience points to beat the Cianwood Gym Leader, Chuck. When you get to Cianwood, you'll need to battle Eusine. He'll come by if you go to the upper part of Cianwood."
