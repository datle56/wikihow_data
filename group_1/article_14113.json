Probably the most popular way to share songs and albums over the Internet is through torrents, which are files that direct your computer to copy bits of a target file or folder (such as an album) from other torrent users until you assemble a complete copy. This software runs torrent files and helps you manage your torrents. Torrent is a small, fast, and reliable free torrenting program. You can download it at the official website. While searching for torrents and downloading the torrent file is not illegal, standard copyright laws apply to any content that is transferred through torrents. This means that if you do not legally own a copy of the song you are downloading, that material is considered pirated."

At this point, it's considered good etiquette to leave it in your list so that others can download parts of it from you, but you don't have to.

Soulseek is by far the safest and most reliable file sharing client available for free. It also provides access to one of the widest selections of music anywhere on the Internet. As with all file-sharing programs, be careful downloading files from unknown sources. Programs such as Soulseek do not scan for viruses or prevent users from sharing malicious files. It is up to the user to download safely. Sharing music through a file-sharing program is illegal if you do not own a copy of the music you are downloading. Providing music for others to download also increases potential charges against you. These programs are typically safe because they are community patrolled, but be aware that there is a legal risk in sharing music you do not own."

If your entire album list stays light blue for too long, try right-clicking and choosing Retry Download to kick-start it. Most users have a set number of downloads they allow at a time.
