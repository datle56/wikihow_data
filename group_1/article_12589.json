[4] X Research source For example, you might choose to cut ties with one sibling who has toxic tendencies and your others sibling may see this as an affront. As a result, you lose two siblings.

[6] X Research source If your relative is self-destructive, understand that you cannot save them from themselves. You may even be inadvertently encouraging their behavior by giving them the attention they want. Do not feel like you have to explain your choices, especially not more than once.

You might say, \"I lent out a great deal of money to Jeff, and he never bothered to pay me back. For this reason, I won't be lending money to family anymore.\" Asserting your boundaries may take time and practice if you've let other people push you around in the past. If someone tries to convince you to violate a boundary, say something like \"We've already discussed this. I'm firm on my decision.\" If they continue to push, then it is okay to ignore it. Hang up the phone or end the conversation when they start to push against a boundary."

For example, you might say something like, “I decided that getting some distance was the healthiest thing for me, and so far it has been.”"
