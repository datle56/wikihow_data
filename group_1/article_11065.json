      "title": "Move around to get your blood flowing through your feet and toes.",
      "content": "Move around to get your blood flowing through your feet and toes. Often, numbness in the feet or toes occurs when you have been sitting or standing in one place for a long time. The best way to get rid of this kind of numbness is to stimulate circulation in the foot by moving around. Try going for a short walk, or even just moving your foot around while you sit. [1] X Research source In addition to helping you get rid of occasional numbness, regular exercise can also help prevent numbness. Incorporate physical activity into your daily schedule, even if it's just a short walk. High impact exercises like jogging can cause numbness in the feet and toes for some people, so try lower impact exercises like swimming or biking. Stretch well before workouts, wear appropriate exercise shoes, and exercise on level surfaces."

      "title": "Change positions if you’ve been sitting or lying for a long time.",
      "content": "Change positions if you’ve been sitting or lying for a long time. Numbness is often triggered by seating positions that pinch the nerves in your legs and/or feet. Try uncrossing your legs, shifting your weight from side to side, stretching out your legs , or simply fidgeting around if you’re unable to get up (like on a plane or at a movie). [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Avoid sitting on your feet or crossing your legs for longer than an hour at a time. If you have to sit for long periods of time, you might want to try elevating your feet periodically to increase blood flow."

      "title": "Remove or loosen excessively tight clothing and shoes.",
      "content": "Remove or loosen excessively tight clothing and shoes. Overly tight pants, socks, shoes, belts, or other garments worn on the lower part of your body might prevent blood from flowing to your feet, which can cause numbness. Remove or loosen these items to allow for better blood flow right away. [3] X Research source When a tight garment is the culprit, you may also feel a “pins and needles” sensation in your feet or toes in addition to numbness."

      "title": "Massage the numb foot",
      "content": "Massage the numb foot or toes. Gently massage the numb area of your foot to help increase circulation and make occasional numbness go away faster. Use your hands and some lotion, roll tennis balls underneath your foot, or fill the bottom of a tub with marbles and roll your feet and toes over them with warm water. [4] X Research source For an extra helpful massage, try adding Epsom salt to the tub during a foot massage to help increase your circulation even more."

      "title": "Warm your feet with a heated blanket or heating pad.",
      "content": "Warm your feet with a heated blanket or heating pad. Exposure to the cold can cause numbness and tingling, especially in winter. If you suspect the cold is to blame, stick your feet under a heating pad or blanket and make circles with your feet and toes to get your blood flowing. Applying heat can help loosen stiff muscles or joints putting pressure on your nerves and reduce numbness. Steer clear of heating pads if you have neuropathy in your feet. The decreased sensation can lead you to accidentally overheat or burn your foot.

      "title": "Wear comfortable shoes that fit you well.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable shoes that fit you well. High heels or other stiff, formal shoes that pinch the toes can cause numbness. You may also experience numbness if you wear shoes that are too small for you, especially while exercising. Try going up half of a shoe size to accommodate for the slight swelling that happens when you’re on your feet for long periods. [6] X Research source Insoles may help make some of your shoes more comfortable and prevent numbness by softening the shock of your foot hitting the ground repeatedly while you walk. Beware shoes that are too big, too. You may start to “grip” the shoes with your toes, which can also cause numbness or tingling."

      "content": "See your doctor if your numbness is frequent or severe. Occasional numbness in the feet or toes is usually no big deal, especially when there is an obvious cause, such as an uncomfortable seating position or tight clothing. If you experience numbness frequently, if it lasts for more than just a few minutes, if it consumes an entire leg, or if it follows an injury, see a doctor to make sure there are no underlying causes. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Seek emergency treatment if your foot numbness accompanies symptoms such as weakness, paralysis, loss of bladder or bowel control, or slurring of speech. Schedule an office visit if the numbness gradually worsens, spreads, comes and goes, or seems related to specific, repetitive activities. Pregnancy can cause swelling of the feet and toes and lead to numbness. If your doctor tells you that your numbness is due to pregnancy and not another condition, follow their recommendations for relieving swelling during pregnancy.

      "title": "Discuss diabetes with your doctor if you have chronic numbness.",
      "content": "Discuss diabetes with your doctor if you have chronic numbness. Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic numbness in the feet and toes (neuropathy)—it damages nerves and contributes to poor circulation in your feet. Numbness is often one of the first symptoms of diabetes, so get tested to see if you have diabetes if you have regular numbness that does not have another obvious cause. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Numbness can be extremely serious for people with diabetes because it may cause them not to feel pain in the feet caused by things like heat, punctures, or blisters. Decreased circulation also means your feet will heal slower, so infection is a serious concern. It’s important to take especially good care of your feet if you have diabetes."

      "content": "Stick to the diabetes management plan recommended by your doctor. Keep your blood glucose levels in check to prevent circulation issues or neuropathy, both of which can cause numbness. Develop a plan with your doctor that works for you and your specific health situation. In most cases, follow these general guidelines: [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Check your blood sugar regularly with a blood glucose meter and get your A1C levels tested a few times each year. Do your best to stay as active as possible with your foot numbness. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise each day, whether it’s going to the gym or walking up and down the stairs at home. Eat a healthy, balanced diet including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, fish, and low-fat dairy. Try to avoid foods that trigger blood sugar spikes like cookies or soda. Take all of your prescribed medications, including insulin, regularly. Quit smoking and lower your alcohol consumption."

Try to get 150 minutes of moderate activity (like brisk walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (like jogging) per week. Losing weight may also lower your blood pressure, which helps reduce numbness. If losing weight is not enough to get your blood pressure under control, consider talking to your doctor about medications. [13] X Research source"

If you have diabetes, you may still benefit from some of the methods recommended for the relief of occasional numbness, such as moving your feet, elevating your feet, massaging your feet, and using warm compresses. While these techniques might offer you temporary relief from your symptoms, keep in mind that they will not cure the underlying disease.

      "content": "Ask about alternative treatments and therapies for numbness. Some studies have shown benefits to relaxation and biofeedback treatment (monitoring your foot temperature related to specific thoughts), as well as anodyne therapy (infrared light exposure), in the treatment of foot numbness related to diabetes. These treatments may not be covered by your insurance, but might be worth investigating if nothing else works to relieve your numbness. [15] X Research source Other topical creams and ointments, aroma therapy, and other non-drug treatments may have some benefits for improving circulation and preventing numbness. In some cases, injections of steroids like cortisone might be used to fight nerve pressure from inflammation or scar tissue. Your doctor may also prescribe medications like gabapentin and pregabalin to address your numbness, although it is likely to be an off-label use of the drug.

Check in with an orthopedist, neurologist, or chiropractor to treat your injury and relieve numbness. Physical therapy is a common treatment for injury-related numbness, but surgery may be necessary in severe cases. [17] X Research source See a doctor right away if you experience numbness (in your feet and toes or elsewhere) immediately after an injury. Apply ice or a cold compress to inflamed feet or toes after an injury, even if the area is numb. Ice reduces swelling, which reduces pressure on your nerves.
