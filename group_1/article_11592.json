      "content": "Learn your partner's expectations. If you're going into a relationship with someone who's never had sex, you'll want to learn your partner's expectations. Everyone has different feelings about sex and sexuality. You should understand your partner's expectations for a romantic relationship, including expectations regarding physical contact. Your partner may be a virgin because he or she practices abstinence. Abstinence means refraining from sexual activity. Your partner may be abstinent because of religious reasons. He or she may also be abstinent because they don’t feel ready to have sex yet. If your partner is practicing abstinence, understand their expectations. People define abstinence in different ways. Some people define abstinence as refraining from genital-to-genital contact and may be open to other forms of sexual activity. However, others define abstinence more strictly. Ask your partner what they expect in terms of physical contact regarding the relationship. Your partner may also be asexual. Asexuality means your partner does not experience sexual attraction or desire. Unlike people who practice abstinence, asexuality is not a choice. It is part of someone's inherent identity and sexual orientation. People who are asexual may experience feelings of attraction without feeling the need to act on those feelings. Many people who are asexual engage in romantic relationships as they have an emotional need for intimacy. However, an asexual person may not want sexual activity to be part of a romantic relationship. If your partner is asexual, he or she may have specific expectations regarding sex in your relationship. Make sure you have a discussion about those expectations going into the relationship."
