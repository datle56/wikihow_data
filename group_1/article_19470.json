Most of these products are pretty similar, so the brand doesn’t really matter! [1] X Research source Avoid products that advertise \"added shine,\" which usually means they contain oily ingredients. When you use your shampoo, don’t scrub it into your hair too hard. Just rub it enough to get a good lather going. Scrubbing too hard can irritate your scalp or damage your hair!"

      "content": "If your hair is always greasy, it may be a sign that you're not washing it enough. You may have heard that washing your hair less often can retrain your scalp to produce less oil, but that's actually a myth. Some of us just naturally have greasier hair than others, which means we need to shampoo more often than people with dryer hair. If your hair is regularly greasy, try shampooing more often and see if that helps. Experiment and find a washing schedule that leaves your hair feeling healthy and soft to address the greasiness without damaging your hair.

      "content": "Conditioner is designed to make hair soft and silky, which isn’t far from greasy. Only use it immediately after shampooing, when your hair is at its driest, and stick to a dollop about the size of a small coin. Rub the conditioner into the ends of your hair only. Your roots are slick enough on their own! [3] X Expert Source Jenny Tran Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 31 August 2020. To cut down on the amount of conditioner you’re using even more, try lightly applying a spray-on, leave-in conditioner instead."

      "content": "Dry shampoo is a scented powder that sits in your hair and absorbs grease. It even does so without rinsing away all of your hair’s protective oils! [4] X Expert Source Jenny Tran Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 31 August 2020. To apply dry shampoo, hold a spray can of dry shampoo about 6 in (15 cm) away from your hair and spray it lightly onto your hair near the roots in oily areas. Let it sit for 2 minutes, then massage it into your hair with clean hands. Apply dry shampoo whenever your hair feels greasy, or about 1 to 3 times between shampoo washes. [5] X Research source Too much dry shampoo can cause white buildup. To avoid this, always spray it lightly onto oily areas only, which are typically the layers of hair nearest to your scalp. Dry shampoo is available in powder form as well as sprays. Choose this variety if you are sensitive to fragrance or aerosols. If you don’t have any dry shampoo, use baby powder as an alternative. Sprinkle a little near your roots and rub it in to absorb grease. Avoid spraying the ends of your hair with dry shampoo because it can make them dry and frizzy."

[11] X Research source For long hair, you can also try hairstyles like buns and ponytails to keep it neat and tidy and avoid touching it throughout the day.
