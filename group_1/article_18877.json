For those players with lots of health, you can easily grind Aura stages by having Aura activated, using an elemental-type fruit, and letting enemies hit you. You're getting experience (exp) by letting the NPC hit you; and by not using mastered weapons (like a plain cutlass or dual katanas), you're not doing a lot of damage either. You're earning Aura exp every time the NPC hits you, and every time you hit them."

[3] X Research source Once you've leveled up your Aura to Stage 5, or full body Haki, come to this NPC to edit which stage is active. For example, you can turn off the full body Haki appearance if you don't like being all one color. Any changes you make will only affect how your character looks, not the buffs of the stage that you have unlocked."
