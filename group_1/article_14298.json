[2] X Research source To make your clouds more realistic, study what real clouds look like. Notice that they have perspective, like boxes going back towards the horizon. Also notice the direction of the light, and where they are light or dark. Study the color and brightness of clouds in relation to the sky.

The right brightness is important to make your clouds look like floating."
