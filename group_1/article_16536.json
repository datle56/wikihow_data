Practice the basic strikes, which are,diagonally towards southwest, and southeast.The 'stab' is the most useful move as it is harder to defend. Practice slowly until you perfect your moves, and then do them more quickly. As Bruce Lee said, \"I don't fear the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.\""

Stay away from rotations, turning your back on your opponent, even for the fraction of a second, is not a good idea."
