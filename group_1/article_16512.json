Some common examples include: [1] X Research source Polarized thinking: Not allowing for any gray areas in life, or thinking in “black and white.” Filtering or discounting the positives: Focusing on the negative of a situation and ignoring any positives. Fortune-telling: Thinking that you know what will happen in the future. Mind-reading: Thinking you know that others are thinking badly of you or that you are responsible for their negative feelings. Overgeneralization: Thinking that one bad experience guarantees more bad experiences. Blaming: Blaming yourself for things you are not responsible. Emotional reasoning: Thinking with emotions or letting emotions affect how you perceive an event. ”Should statements”: Using terms such as “should”, “must”, and “ought” to in your thinking; this is a form of judging yourself. Magnification and minimization: Thinking that make issues seem larger than they are or trying to ignore issues. Labeling: Using terms that diminish your whole self-concept by being known as a certain trait or mistake."

      "content": "Monitor your emotions in your journal. Our thoughts greatly influence how we feel and how we interpret and perceive our environments, our futures, and ourselves. People who suffer with depression often have thoughts that they are worthless, unlovable, or undeserving, and they often have thoughts that their environments are overwhelming, have insurmountable obstacles, and that their futures are hopeless. [2] X Research source Barlow, David H. (2014). Clinical handbook of psychological disorder: A step-by-step treatment guides. (5th ed). New York: The Guilford Press. Many who suffer from depression feel powerless to change how they feel and the course of their lives. Our thoughts greatly influences our feelings and behaviors, which is the basis for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT has been shown to be successful for treating depression. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source Relapse depression symptoms were much lower for those who had undergone CBT than for those who were being treated with medications alone. A great way to start this process is to monitor your emotions and automatic thoughts by recording them in a journal or daily record. Start first by noticing mood changes, then begin to analyze what your thoughts had been just prior to feeling differently. For example: Event: I received poor feedback on my presentation at work. Feelings: I felt embarrassed. Here is another example: Event: I forgot to sign the birthday card for my boss. Feeling: I felt regretful and embarrassed."

      "content": "Write down your automatic thoughts. Automatic thoughts are the things that pop into your head spontaneously. They tend to pertain to three types of ideas: ideas about yourself, about the world, and about the future. After you've identified your emotions about an event where your mood changed, you can start to analyze the automatic thoughts that correspond to the event. Then you can evaluate these thoughts to determine how they are dysfunctional, challenge them by looking for evidence for and against the thought. In your journal, create a chart in which you can record certain situations, their corresponding emotions, and the thoughts you had just prior to your emotions. [4] X Research source Barlow, David H. (2014). Clinical handbook of psychological disorder: A step-by-step treatment guides. (5th ed). New York: The Guilford Press. For example: Event: I received poor feedback on my presentation at work. Feelings: I felt embarrassed. Automatic thought: I am so stupid. Identify the dysfunctional thought: You are labeling yourself. Here is another example: Event: I forgot to sign the birthday card for my boss. Feeling: I felt regretful and embarrassed Automatic thoughts: I know my boss hates me now.

(2014). Clinical handbook of psychological disorder: A step-by-step treatment guides. (5th ed). New York: The Guilford Press. Some ways to generate more rational thoughts include looking for evidence for or against the automatic thought, looking to your past for a similar situation in which the automatic thought did not hold true, and analyze the situation for blame and logically redistribute responsibility for feelings and events to others that may have been involved. [6] X Research source Barlow, David H. (2014). Clinical handbook of psychological disorder: A step-by-step treatment guides. (5th ed). New York: The Guilford Press. For example: Event: I received poor feedback on my presentation at work. Feelings: I felt embarrassed. Thoughts: I am so stupid. Rational thought: I am not my thoughts or behaviors. I am not a label. I am not stupid. I made a mistake and will do better in the future. Here is another example: Event: I forgot to sign the birthday card for my boss. Feeling: I felt regretful and embarrassed Automatic thoughts: I know my boss hates me now. Rational thought: I cannot know what my boss is thinking about me. It was an honest mistake. I can always verbally tell my boss happy birthday."

[7] X Research source Barlow, David H. (2014). Clinical handbook of psychological disorder: A step-by-step treatment guides. (5th ed). New York: The Guilford Press. Rumination is the activity of replaying a scenario or problem in your head over and over, like a broken record. While some people consider rumination as a form of problem-solving (\"I'm thinking through this problem from every angle until I come up with a solution\"), if the problem is upsetting, you will end up continuing to be upset until you stop thinking about it.

Clinical handbook of psychological disorder: A step-by-step treatment guides. (5th ed). New York: The Guilford Press. It is important to begin in one area, scheduling this daily. For instance, you can start with being responsible for showering. You can also record your level of mastery in being responsible for showering. For instance, starting out, you may indicate that you were only able to get out of bed for the day and not shower. This may seem like no mastery at all, but it is more mastery that you previously had. Use your planner and feelings of competence to build yourself back up in self-care. Once you have taken on showering, you can tackle making the bed, then cleaning, etc."
