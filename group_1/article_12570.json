      "content": "Research and learn about the meanings of different tribal tattoos. Make sure you understand the significance of tribal tattoos and appreciate the culture they come from before you proceed with getting one. Read about what different symbols and placements can mean. [1] X Research source For example, if you want a Mayan tribal tattoo, Google something like “Mayan tribal tattoo meanings.”"

      "title": "Choose what you want your tattoo to say about you.",
      "content": "Choose what you want your tattoo to say about you. The series of dots, lines, and other shapes in tribal tattoos can all have a special meaning. Images of different animals can represent different things, too. So, decide what you want your tattoo to say about you/represent before you design it. For example, a tribal fox tattoo can symbolize intelligence and cleverness. Or, a tribal tattoo of a hammerhead shark can symbolize brute masculinity."

      "title": "Work with an artist experienced in the tribal style you want a tattoo in.",
      "content": "Work with an artist experienced in the tribal style you want a tattoo in. Discuss your ideas for your tattoo’s meaning and how you want it to look and listen to the artist’s ideas too. Get them to draw up a design and agree on it before you get it tattooed on your body. For example, if you decide that you want a Polynesian shark tattoo, ask your artist to draw up a few different designs of that for you to choose from."

      "title": "It depends on what the placement means for the tribe your tattoo is from.",
      "content": "It depends on what the placement means for the tribe your tattoo is from. In Māori and Polynesian tribal tattooing, for example, placing a tattoo on your face or head is a very spiritual gesture. Tattoos on your upper limbs or shoulders can be warrior symbols. Tattoos on your hands can mean you are an artist or artisan of some kind. [2] X Research source Here are some more examples of Māori tribal tattoo placements: tattoos on the joints can mean family ties, tattoos on the legs or feet can symbolize forward momentum, tattoos on your chest can mean generosity. Ultimately, the placement is up to you. Whatever you think looks best is probably a good choice, but make sure to consider the significance of the placement based on the research you did before you settle on a spot."

      "content": "It is a sacred design tied to a certain tribe or culture. Tribal tattoos come from a wide variety of different cultures around the world, which were often historically organized into tribes. This style of tattooing typically uses black lines and dots to tell stories or depict animals and/or mythological creatures. [3] X Research source Tribal tattoos were historically often used for ritualistic or even therapeutic purposes. For example, the mummy of Otzi the Iceman was covered in tattoos, many of which corresponded to acupuncture points. Tribal tattoos were also traditionally used to denote social status and familial ties."

      "content": "They come from different indigenous cultures from all the continents. Some of the oldest evidence of tribal-style tattooing comes from ancient Egypt. A few of the most well-known styles of tribal tattoos come from ancient African, European, Celtic, North American, Mesoamerican, South American, and Polynesian cultures. [4] X Research source For example, Māori tribal tattoos, from the indigenous population of New Zealand, are one of the most widely recognized styles of tribal tattoos still commonly found today."

      "title": "They can be, if you don’t have a strong tie to the tattoo's culture.",
      "content": "They can be, if you don’t have a strong tie to the tattoo's culture. Tribal tattoos have a deep meaning for people that are part of the culture they come from. Tattooing such sacred designs on you when you aren’t from that culture can be considered cultural appropriation and is damaging to the people and traditions of that culture. [5] X Research source Cultural appropriation is taking things from oppressed cultures, especially art, and using it as your own when you have no ties to that culture. For example, if you are a white person of European descent, it could be seen as very disrespectful to get a Native American tribal tattoo. There are always exceptions, such as if you grew up or spent a lot of time among people of a culture different from your own and they see you as one of their own. If you have no connection to tribal culture, consider other tattoo styles. There are tons of different styles you can get that are not culturally appropriated."
