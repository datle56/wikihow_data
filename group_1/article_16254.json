      "content": "Watch for dizziness. You might feel a slight, or severe, dizzy spell immediately before you faint. This is a strong warning sign that your circulation system is not functioning normally. As soon as you start to feel dizzy at all, stop what you are doing and try to get lower to the ground via sitting or lying down. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch for changes in vision and hearing.",
      "content": "Watch for changes in vision and hearing. Your senses will most likely be affected as well in the minutes right before you faint. You may experience tunnel vision or feeling as if your vision is collapsing into one small tunnel to look through. You may see spots or blurs. Your ears might start to ring or feel as if they are giving off a slight buzz. [3] X Research source Other major symptoms include a clammy and pale face, numbness in your face and exterior limbs, feelings of severe anxiety, or sudden onset nausea or stomach pains."

      "title": "Sit or lie down immediately.",
      "content": "Sit or lie down immediately. When you experience any symptoms related to fainting, the goal is to get as low as possible as quickly as you can. Many people receive serious injuries not from the fainting, but from the fall to the ground connected with the loss of consciousness. It is best to lie down on your back or side, but if that is not an option it is okay just to sit down. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source When you lie down it puts your head at roughly the same level as your heart and encourages circulation to be restored and your blood to head back to your brain easier. If you are pregnant you should lie down (and usually sleep as well) on your left side to lessen the burden on your heart. If the area is crowded, for example, and it is only safe to sit down that can work as well. For maximum benefit, hang your head between your legs. This will encourage the blood to follow gravity and head back down into your brain."

      "title": "Get yourself some space.",
      "content": "Get yourself some space. If you are in a crowded area it is probably best to touch a wall and slowly try to lean yourself against it. If needed, you may slide yourself slowly down the wall. This will prevent you from being trampled while you are on the ground. Getting away from the crowd might also lower your temperature and make breathing easier."

    {
      "title": "Try to fall against a wall.",
      "content": "Try to fall against a wall. If it is too late to lie down in a controlled way, then you will want to control the direction of your fall as much as you can. As you begin to lose consciousness, do your best to angle your body towards a wall if there is one within arm’s reach. This will allow you to slide down the wall instead of going into a free fall. You can also make an effort to buckle your knees. This will have the effect of lowering you to the ground and will lessen your final fall."

      "title": "Be very careful on stairs.",
      "content": "Be very careful on stairs. If you are on stairs and the symptoms start to appear, move from the inner rail to the outer one connected to a wall. Sit down on a stair. If you are close to a landing, try to scoot down on your behind to it where you can then lie down. If you feel yourself going down before you can sit, try your best to maintain a firm grip on the rail. It can help to guide you down to the floor even as you lose consciousness. If nothing else, draping your body partially over the outer rail (against the wall) will slow the course of your fall and turn it into a slide down."

      "content": "Ask someone for help. Call out for assistance using your voice. If your voice isn’t working properly, wave your hands in the air and mouth out the word “help” repeatedly. Be careful trying to walk towards someone to get help as you could go down mid-step. If you see someone you might say, “Help! I’m about to pass out!” Or, “Can you help me? I think I’m going to faint.” Don’t be afraid to approach strangers who may be able to help you stay safe. If you are lucky and someone helps you, they should start by assisting you to the floor if you are not there already. If you do fall and injure yourself, they should apply pressure to the bleeding area and call for medical assistance.

[6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source They will need to make sure your airway is clear and stays that way. It may be necessary to tilt you to the side if you begin vomiting. They should check for signs that you are breathing properly, even when unconscious. If anything looks concerning, they should dial for emergency assistance immediately and wait until help arrives."

      "content": "Prop your feet up, if you can. Simple fainting episodes are usually resolved by rapidly elevating the person’s feet and legs. While you are on the ground see if it possible to elevate your feet at all. Making it so that they are higher than your head is best, but an elevation will help. If you are lying down, see if you (or your helper) can stuff a jacket under your feet. This will improve the blood flow to your head and speed up the healing process. [8] X Research source"

So, to prevent another episode, you will want to drinks lots of water immediately after standing and for the remainder of the day.

They will decide if any additional action is necessary and this will give you peace of mind moving forward. They might also ask you to watch for particular warning signs, in addition to fainting, such as increased thirst. Your doctor may order tests such as a blood sugar draw, a general blood test to check for anemia and nutrient levels, and an EKG (to scan for heart issues). These are all fairly standard diagnostic tools. [12] X Research source Your doctor may also place restrictions on your behaviors until the cause of fainting has been established and treated. They may request that you limit your driving and avoid operating any kind of heavy or complex machinery. [13] X Research source It is helpful if you can bring with you a statement or brief note from someone who witnessed you faint. After all, you were unconscious for part of this time and this person call “fill in the blanks” regarding what happened to you. [14] X Research source"
