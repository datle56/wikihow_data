      "content": "Wash your hair. Curly hair is often more dry than straight hair because the natural oils produced at the scalp have a hard time maneuvering their way through the twists of curly hair. The result is that these natural oils aren’t distributed throughout the hair, especially at the ends. This causes hair to be dry, and then break and become frizzy. If you wash your curly hair every day, use a moisturizing shampoo that will hydrate it to prevent it from breaking, and to reduce frizz, split ends and add shine. [1] X Research source Choose a shampoo that’s either sulfate free or doesn’t contain ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate. These are essentially powerful detergents that strip your hair and scalp of the natural oils your hair needs. [2] X Research source Try to stay away from all products that contain alcohol, which sucks up hair’s moisture and gives curls that crunchy look and feel."

      "content": "Alternate between a moisturizing and protein conditioner. Hair needs a balance of both moisture and protein to have elasticity. This means it stretches without breaking, and it is the primary indicator of your hair’s health. [3] X Research source Protein conditioners not only penetrate the hair shaft to make it stronger, but they also form a film on the hair cuticles, or the outer layer of the hair, so they lay flat. This helps reduce frizz. Use a protein conditioner containing wheat, keratin, silk, milk, collagen or soy or a moisturizing conditioner containing jojoba oil, glycerin (or vegetable glycerin), aloe vera, shea butter or Vitamin E. You can alternate between the two daily, every few days or weekly. You may even use one more often than the other depending upon your hair’s texture and how often you use heat to style it. Use a protein conditioner more often if your hair feels dry and frizzy, stretches a great deal but still breaks, feels limp when wet or if it doesn’t hold its curl or style very well. Use a moisturizing conditioner more often if your hair breaks or snaps very easily, feels brittle or straw-like, or doesn’t stretch much or at all."

      "content": "Try “co-washing” your hair with conditioner instead. The “co-washing” movement calls for primarily skipping shampoo because it strips away natural oils over time. Instead it recommends using a gentle cleansing conditioner. Choose a conditioner that is designed for co-washing or that says it’s a cleansing conditioner. They often will label themselves as such and contain natural ingredients like aloe vera. Avoid any with silicones because they will weigh down hair. Wash hair with a cleansing conditioner every 3-7 days depending upon your hair type. Wash less often the curlier and more coarse it is. [4] X Research source Use more than you normally would, massaging it in from root to end, and let it absorb for 3-5 minutes before rinsing. Wash your hair with a sulfate-free, clarifying shampoo every 2-4 weeks because cleaning conditioners do cause build-up. Co-washing is not recommended for those with fine hair because it will weigh thin hair down and make it too oily.

      "content": "Apply a leave-in conditioner and detangle. Air drying allows hair more time to absorb moisture from the air and swell. This makes it more apt to break and the cuticle to become rough and cause frizz. Leave-in conditioners contain polymers that form a barrier or film on the hair strand, blocking humidity and reducing frizz. [8] X Research source Comb the leave-in conditioner through your hair with a wide-toothed comb. (Using a brush to tug through your hair after you wash it is very damaging.) Focus on the mid-shaft, or the middle of the length of your hair, to the ends. [9] X Research source Here are some detangling tips to make the process less damaging. Divide your hair into 4-8 sections and pin each up with bobby pins, flat pin curl clips or crocodile clips. Release one section at a time and use either your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to gently rake through your hair, starting at the ends and working up toward your roots. If you encounter a particularly troublesome knot, put some conditioner on your fingers to work it out. Once you have detangled a section of hair, give it a twist and pin it back up before moving on to another. When each is done, take all pins and clips out of your hair. If your hair is very thick, very curly or you have masses of curls, use a comb with long teeth that’s able to penetrate your hair. [10] X Research source"

You should apply an anti-frizz and/or curling serum, oil, cream, gel, mousse, lotion or spray before your hair gets too dry to control frizz and to define and control/hold your curls. The type(s) you choose depends upon the texture of your hair, your curl type and how you want your curls to look. You may find that a combination of two or more works best. [11] X Research source Serums, oils, lotions and creams are generally used to smooth. Gels and thicker creams are used most often to help control/hold or to define/shape. Mousses and foams add volume and also help define/shape. Sprays can do many of these things, in addition to add texture. Reading reviews online is a great way to help select products."

This will cause it part naturally. Then move your fingers in a zigzag motion at your scalp to lift your hair away from the roots. This will give it lift and air circulation to dry more quickly. [12] X Research source Next use your hands to either scrunch your hair or twist it, depending upon your curl type and the look you desire. When scrunching, either stand straight or flip your head first to one side, to the other and then forward. Either way, place your hand under the end of your hair, one section at a time, and scrunch upward toward the root a few times. Then move to another section. When twisting, use your fingers to hook onto 1-3\" sections of hair and twist it around your finger, moving from the bottom up, and hold for 15-30 seconds. They should be pretty well defined. If not, add a bit more product to your hair. [13] X Research source As your hair dries, don’t touch it!

Here are some tricks to add volume that involve parting your hair and pinning it in different ways as it air dries. Part your hair to the side you normally wouldn't and then flip it back just before it’s dry. Create a deeper side part on the side you normally part your hair and then flip it down just before your hair is dry. Make a zigzag part, and use your fingers to part along your natural part just before your hair dries. Or you can make a zigzag part after your hair dries. Take flat pin curl clips, which won’t leave lines or marks in your hair, and clip them at the roots on the top of your head and along your part line. Remove them when your hair is dry. [15] X Research source Use claw clips to secure rows of hair. Grab two, roughly 1-2” sections of hair near your forehead (one on each side of your part), crisscross them and secure it with a small claw clip. Make 2-4 more rows behind, or going away from your forehead."

Use your fingers to separate your curls unless they’ve dried in the style you prefer. If separating, use only one or two fingers to gently loosen each curl. You can loosen them more a second time; however, over-loosening isn’t an easy fix. Finish with a styling product such as these. Spritz or spray a medium-hold flexible or medium-hold humidity-resistant hairspray all over your hair. Hold the can about 12” from your head. Keep your hand moving the whole time, and use the smallest amount needed. [16] X Research source [17] X Research source [18] X Research source For a textured or piece-y finish, rub a penny-sized amount of pomade between your palms. Use your fingers to apply it from the mid-shaft to the ends. [19] X Research source Use thicker, water-soluble gels (or those with guar gum) that don’t feel sticky to help tame and control medium-to-big curls. Use denser creams for tight curls. [20] X Research source You can also finish your hair with an anti-frizz or smoothing serum or a natural treatment oil like argan, coconut, avocado, sweet almond or grape seed. Use only a dab and rub it between your palms before either a) applying it to areas that are frizzy or need more control or b) to the ends using a twisting motion. Avoid products with silicones unless they are water-soluble or more gentle on the hair. More gentle silicones are amodimethicone, cyclomethicone/cyclopentasiloxane and trimethyl-silylamodi-methicone. Silicones that are more water-soluble include behenoxy dimethicone and stearoxy dimethicone. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy the right blow dryer. All use of heat on hair is damaging in some way, particularly so for curly hair that already tends to be dry and more prone to breaking. In fact, excessive heat changes the proteins in hair that creates the signature spiral shape of curly hair. So use a blow dryer that’s no more than 1300-1874 watts (1400 watts is all you really need) with a cool shot button and multiple heat and speed settings. If you plan to dry your curly hair frequently, get a ceramic, ceramic ionic or ceramic tourmaline blow dryer. All reduce damage by either emitting infrared heat or using negative ions to break down water molecules. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure you get a diffuser. Some blow dryers come with diffusers; others do not. Yet they are crucial for blow drying curly hair because they help evenly distribute heat, create volume in heavy curls, minimize frizz, and help keep curls intact. The normal nozzle on a blow dryer blows hair everywhere, which only distorts curl patterns and creates frizz. Diffusers also enhance curls for hair that’s less wavy. Choose a diffuser that's concave in the center, or not flat, so curls can rest inside it and take shape naturally. Or buy one that has a cup-like shape in which curls can nestle. Also look for a diffuser that’s about 2½-3” wide for better heat distribution and that has at least 1-2” long “fingers” to help separate curls. They need to be long enough to reach roots for lift and volume. [23] X Research source While many diffusers claim to fit all hair dryers, online reviewers say this isn’t always the case. You may have to go by trial-and-error. You also might buy a blow dryer that comes with a diffuser, buy a diffuser that comes with a ring or strap to help secure it to your blow dryer, or go to your blow dryer company’s product website and see if it recommends particular diffusers for your dryer model."

Thermal protectants form a protective barrier around each hair stand to reduce damage to hair cuticles. They also cut down on drying out the hair shaft more than necessary. Some are silicone-based and offer the most protection, but these also create the most build-up and often weigh down hair. Others are water-based and oil-based. Avoid the latter should if your hair gets greasy quickly.

      "title": "Dry your hair with the diffuser.",
      "content": "Dry your hair with the diffuser. There are a few ways to do this, and much of it depends upon the length and thickness of your hair and how much volume you want to create. For starters, though, always work in sections (you can use clips if that helps). Also blow dry on low-to-medium heat so you don’t burn your scalp and use a low-to-medium air speed setting to reduce frizz. Additionally, only dry your hair 80-95% if it’s curly, not wavy, before letting it air dry the rest of the way. Do the ends last or not at all. Both of these measures will reduce damage and frizz. One way to dry with a diffuser is to hold the blow dryer at a 90˚ angle from your head and place the diffuser at the roots of one section of hair. Start at the nape of your neck and gently hold the ends away from the blow dryer. Turn on the blow dryer and use the fingers of the diffuser to lift hair at the roots. Move in a circular direction at the same time. Another way, one that will add more volume, is to flip your head upside down and place the diffuser at the roots of your hair. Use the diffuser’s fingers to lift the roots in a circular direction. Then use the diffuser to scrunch up the mid-shaft to hold and dry. With this method, you want the roots and mid-shaft to dry completely to lock in volume. Another option is to tilt your head to one side and use your hand to cup up one section of hair from the mid-shaft to the root. Place the diffuser at the roots and hold the dryer at a 90˚ angle. Then turn on the blow dryer and dry for a couple of minutes before turning it off to move to another section. Tilt your head the opposite direction to do the other side, then start at your crown and move down. At the end, go back through using the dryer’s cool shot button to set it. Finally, if your hair is wavy and you’re trying to add more curl, place your ends in the cup of the diffuser one section at a time. Push it to your scalp and hold until dry. [25] X Research source Some also find it beneficial to let their hair air dry for 20-30 minutes, or until it’s about 50% dry, to allow its natural curl pattern to better form. If you’re trying to enhance curl, however, you should begin drying immediately."

Because your curls will stack on top of each other through plopping, they will have more spring and shape, and you’ll get more volume at your roots. Wash, condition and apply an anti-frizz or curling product to your hair first. Then follow these steps. Lay a large t-shirt on a flat surface with the short sleeves closest to you. Bend over and place your head in the center so your hair is lying above it on the t-shirt, and fold the end of the t-shirt over your hair and top of your head. Grab the sleeves and twist inward toward your ears. Tie it (or secure with a clip) loosely at the base of your neck.

Pull tight at the scalp because this is the area that’s most resistant to straightening. Secure each roller at the scalp with a large clip. Make sure you roll backward, away from the face. Allow your hair to dry naturally, or use a bonnet dryer or hooded dryer on a low heat before switching to cool to set your curls. You can also combine air-drying with either dryer by letting your hair air dry for awhile before using one of the dryers.
