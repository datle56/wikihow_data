      "content": "World poverty could be reduced by 50% if all adults received secondary education. In fact, 60 million people around the globe could escape poverty if they received 2 more years of schooling. [1] X Research source Most jobs require secondary education, so extra schooling can increase the amount of money people can make. [2] X Research source However, people all over the globe (especially girls and women) face barriers to education, starting in elementary school. [3] X Research source Common barriers to education include a lack of teachers and educational resources, as well as a lack of transportation to and from school. [4] X Research source Here are a few ways you can promote education: Donate to scholarship funds. For instance, you can donate to the Children’s Scholarship Fund to support K-8 education in the U.S. at https://scholarshipfund.org/ Support afterschool tutoring programs and mentorship programs that connect students with caring adults.

Vocational training means teaching people the skills they need to work in a specific industry. Job training is an incredible investment–it boosts people’s chances of finding a job by more than 20%. [7] X Research source There are a variety of ways to provide job training to more people: [8] X Research source Governments can provide federally-funded or state-funded job training programs. These are often run by state workforce development commissions. Employers can provide more substantial skills-based training for employees. You can save taxes by starting a nonprofit organization or foundation. [9] X Research source [v161791_b01]. 23 April 2021. Nonprofit organizations and communities can provide training. You can even set up a trust for this purpose and transfer your assets to it. [10] X Research source [v161791_b01]. 23 April 2021."

Go to source With microfinance, loans come from microcredit firms, governments, or NGOs (non-governmental organizations). The theory behind microfinance is that it creates job opportunities by giving people money to cover startup costs as they launch businesses and hire employees. [12] X Research source New studies on the impacts of microfinance question whether it’s a solution that truly benefits the poor. While it may help empower female entrepreneurs living in poverty, microfinance can potentially worsen overall debt. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Automation and technology make production more efficient, but they reduce jobs. Think about a basic assembly line for cars. The more you rely on machines to put cars together, the fewer people you’d have to employ to run the assembly line. To help reduce poverty and unemployment, communities have to invest in industries that require a lot of hands-on labor, like agriculture, food service, hospitality, healthcare, and mining.

      "content": "Building roads and other civic projects provides jobs. Construction and transportation jobs give opportunities to people without formal college degrees. Even once the roads, waterways, and energy grids are built, people can find opportunities for work in transportation, maintenance, and operations, all thanks to the new infrastructure. [16] X Research source Beyond just providing jobs, infrastructure development makes the economy more connected. When there’s more infrastructure, it’s easier for people to travel around in order to buy or sell goods and services. For instance, to help alleviate poverty and unemployment in the rural Philippines, better access to roads and the internet could help farmers sell their goods. [17] X Research source"

[18] X Research source For instance, some states give bigger unemployment benefits to people with children or other dependents. To help reduce poverty, one organization suggests giving unemployment insurance benefits to people seeking part-time work. [19] X Research source Some states specify that only people with a certain work history length can receive unemployment benefits, and adjusting work history requirements could more people eligible. [20] X Research source States also could consider eliminating waiting periods for people to receive their unemployment insurance benefits. Currently, 42 states require people to wait 1 week to receive benefits. [21] X Research source To receive unemployment benefits, you have to prove you lost your job through no fault of your own. States might consider changing what qualifies as an “acceptable” cause of unemployment. [22] X Research source"

The goal behind affordable housing in the U.S. is to keep housing costs below 30% of a family’s income, so people have enough money to pay for other key things.

In turn, a lack of access to proper water and sanitation affects not only peoples’ health, but also their ability to pursue work and education. [25] X Research source In certain countries, a huge number of women and girls can’t pursue work or school because collecting water is their daily responsibility. Imagine having to carry the weight of a 5-year-old child for 3 hours each day–that’s the weight of a typical water jug used in Africa.

Plus, medical bills and treatment can also be costly! On the community and governmental level, policymakers have to work to reduce the cost of care, potentially through better insurance or partnerships with private-sector companies. [28] X Research source On the provider level, doctors have to understand that patients in poverty might face greater obstacles to getting treatment.

This results in a cycle of debt and poverty. [33] X Research source To tackle this problem, communities can help boost digital financial services and provide free financial advice online. For instance, creating free digital banking services can make it easy for people to access accounts. [34] X Research source In the U.S., predatory financial services, like high-cost mortgage firms, have historically targeted Black and Latino communities.

By supporting single-mother households, communities can help lift their children out of the cycle of poverty, too. There’s evidence that federal benefits help encourage single mothers to work and can reduce poverty. In the U.S., programs that help women in poverty include work support programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), food stamps, and funds for childcare. [36] X Research source Support single mothers in your community by donating kids’ clothes and toys and contributing staples like canned goods to your local food bank.

Some people are even imprisoned because they can’t pay fees. It creates a vicious cycle!
