      "content": "Use elemental reactions to defeat the Fatui Skirmishers. While you can defeat them in any order, it is a good idea to defeat certain enemies first before defeating others. Start by tackling the Hydrogunner if present. This enemy will be a big hindrance as they will continuously regenerate the HP of its allies as well as provide them with an attack boost. Next, tackle the Anemoboxer, then the Geochanter, if present. These will provide protection to their allies, reducing their damage input and potentially reflecting the damage back at you. Finally, defeat the Cryogunner, Pyroslinger, and Electrohammer, in any order, if present. These will be much easier once they cannot be provided protection or healed."
