      "content": "Ventilate the room. Make sure that the room you’re working in is well-ventilated. Open all windows and doors in the room. In addition, open windows elsewhere in your house and turn on the air conditioning to encourage cross-ventilation. Make sure the room is not very humid or moist. By ventilating the room, you'll help the mattress dry after you use cleaners on it and will allow bad smells and chemical smells to dissipate."

      "content": "Strip the sheets and bedding. Before you take any steps to clean the mattress, you must remove everything from the mattress that is not part of it. This is important, as dirt, grime, and bad scents can accumulate on sheets, mattress liners, mattress protectors, and other things we commonly put on top of our mattresses. Carefully fold your sheets up as you remove them so more dust or dirt does not fall on to the mattress. Remove any mattress protectors you may have covered it with. Take off any pieces of fabric that can be detached. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source"

      "content": "Vacuum the mattress. Perhaps the most important way to prepare your mattress is to vacuum it completely. Without vacuuming it properly, there will be a lot of dirt and debris left on the mattress – undermining your effort to clean it. Use an upholstery attachment with your vacuum. Systematically go back-and-forth width-wise on the mattress until you vacuum the whole thing. Use the crevice attachment to vacuum hard-to-reach places like crevices, indentations, and embroidery. Flip the mattress and vacuum the other side. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source"

      "content": "Deodorize with baking soda. Sprinkle baking soda or another deodorizer liberally on the mattress. Allow the baking soda to sit for up to 24 hours. Without properly deodorizing the mattress, your mattress will retain smells and won’t be properly cleaned. It is okay if you wind up using an entire box or even more. The longer the baking soda sits, the more moisture and odor it will absorb from the mattress. There are a variety of mattress deodorizer products you can choose to use when cleaning your mattress. Just make sure to follow the directions on the product’s box. If you live in a dry climate, consider leaving your window open. If possible, move the mattress into the sunlight.

Use your upholstery tool and crevice attachment to remove all the deodorizer. After you think you’ve removed all the deodorizing, vacuum the mattress again. By vacuuming the mattress, you’ll remove not only the deodorizer, but the smell and other debris, too.

Combine 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of cool or cold water. Do not add any other ingredients to the mixture. Spray the mixture lightly over your mattress and then wipe it down with a clean, damp rag. Use safety equipment like gloves, goggles, or even a mask when working with bleach. In addition, make sure you are in a well-ventilated area. If it is a dry, sunny day, you can bring the mattress outside to dry out. You can also use other products like Lysol spray or vodka to disinfect your mattress."

Dirt stains are not only unsightly, but they can be a breeding ground for bacteria and other health problems. For tougher stains, consider using general upholstery cleaner or other solutions intended for use on mattresses. Make sure to follow the directions and do not oversaturate the mattress.

Lightly dab the solution on the urine stain. Avoid soaking the mattress with your solution. Allow the area to dry. Urine is one of the most common stains on mattresses – especially on mattresses used by children. Not only does urine stain mattresses, but it leaves a nasty odor that is hard to get rid of. If the stain is still visible, combine 3 tablespoons of laundry powder and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of water. Spread this on the stain and allow it to sit for half an hour. Then, remove the paste with a knife or thin flat piece of plastic. Vacuum to remove any residue. [7] X Research source"

While not as common as urine, blood stains on mattresses are not that rare. But while blood stains lack the odor of urine stains, they’re often harder to remove. If the stain is still visible, lightly dab it with a clean white cloth that has been moistened with hydrogen peroxide. [8] X Research source"
