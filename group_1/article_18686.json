      "content": "Pay for a premium people finder service. People search organizations such as Intelius can quickly find just about anybody. A simple name/address/phone number search can be very inexpensiveâ€”in some cases, under a dollar. If you do a lot of searches, though, you would probably want to consider a more robust plan. Most online searches will \"find\" a person for free. But to get any more information than that will have a significant cost. These organizations do not always have the most up-to-date information. For example, while they may be able to find the cell phone number of a particular person, the person may have changed their number since. Use caution when considering these organizations to ensure you are working with a legitimate company. Experience has also shown that those sites have incorrect ages or locations, even going so far as to offer to sell you the phone numbers of people who are long deceased."

      "content": "Contact your mutual friends and connections. When the internet fails, chances are that someone knows the phone number of the person you're looking for. If you have mutual friends or acquaintances, consider asking them. Use word of mouth to get cell phone numbers. For example, if you need to find Dave, but don't know his phone number, ask mutual friends if they will get a message to Dave and say that you'd like to contact him. If they don't know where Dave is, broaden the search to check with coworkers and family. Be sure to be honest with these contacts regarding the reason behind wanting to find this person's cell phone number to ensure the best results for all parties involved."
