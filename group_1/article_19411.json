      "content": "Sugar scrubs help remove dry skin and soften hard or cracked skin. You can make a basic sugar scrub by combining brown or white sugar with a small amount of olive oil and an oil extract. You can also add essential oils to the mixture if you want so your feet end up soft and smelling good. To make a sugar scrub, combine 2/3 cup granulated white sugar, 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, and 1/2 cup olive oil in a mason jar. You can also add one tablespoon vanilla extract to give the scrub a vanilla scent. You can make a soothing peppermint foot scrub by combining 1 cup of Epsom salt, 1/4 cup olive oil or almond oil, and 10-15 drops of peppermint essential oil in a mason jar. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Buffing your feet with a pumice stone can leave them feeling smooth. Pumice stones are made of volcanic rock. They're really useful for removing dead skin from tougher areas of your body, including your feet. Run a warm bath and add a small amount of Epsom salt to the water. Let your feet soak for several minutes and then rub them with a pumice stone. The water epsom salt bath will help to loosen up the dead skin, making it easier to remove. [3] X Research source Follow this foot scrubbing routine every night or several times a week. Using a pumice stone on a consistent basis will also allow any foot moisturizers you are using to penetrate your skin and soften hard or cracked skin on your feet."

      "content": "Heel balm will moisturize your dry and cracked heels. Heel balm can come in a container or in stick form. When you put it on first thing, it will help improve the elasticity of the skin on your heels as you walk around and move for the day. Put it on again at night to hydrate your feet while you sleep. You may find heel balm to be slippery on your heels, especially when you move around during the day in shoes without socks. If so, start with a small amount of heel balm on the rims of your heels and on any cracked areas. If you don’t want to get heel balm on your hands, you can use a heel balm stick for easy application."

You should try to follow a foot soak with a good scrub with a pumice stone to help remove dry skin and leave your skin feeling soft and refreshed. Avoid soaking your feet in Epsom salt, as it can end up drying out your feet more. Instead, add 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar to a warm bath and soak your feet in the solution for 10 to 15 minutes.

      "content": "Opt for flat, well-fitting shoes that offer good arch support. Tight, uncomfortable shoes can cause painful foot growths and distort your toe shape. They can also irritate your feet and lead to blisters and cracked skin. Try to wear comfortable shoes that fit well on a daily basis, especially if you are always on your feet throughout the day. [7] X Research source If you wear high heels, look for heels that are wide, stable, and no higher than two inches. Make sure there is enough room in your heels for your toes, as your shoes should not narrow until well past the balls of your feet. You should also alternate your heels heights regularly to prevent your Achilles tendon from shortening. Avoid wearing flip flops and completely flat shoes, as they do not provide arch support. You should also avoid walking around barefoot to avoid developing flat feet. Minimize the amount of time you wear shoes with no arch support to keep your feet healthy and strong."

You should also change your socks every day so you wear a fresh pair. This will prevent foot irritation and infections, which could trigger dry and cracked skin. Invest in shoes and socks with breathable material to help your feet stay aerated throughout the day."

Soap, although important in hygiene, can cause irritation and may not help in removing any of the dead skin caused by dryness. Instead, rinse your feet thoroughly with warm water every time you bathe in order to promote moisture. Warm water (40 to 34°C) promotes circulation and both comforts and refreshes your feet. [8] X Research source Always wash the bottoms of your feet well and between your toes. You should use a washcloth to get between your toes or use a long handled sponge on your feet if you prefer not to have to bend down in the shower. Be sure to dry your feet well to prevent bacteria that could cause odors or even infection. [9] X Research source"

You should also check if you have symptoms of eczema on your feet, such as scaly skin, painful breaking of the skin, and possibly weeping or bleeding from the skin.
