      "content": "Draw egg(s). This is a simple design; draw something that looks like a bean or a small cylinder to serve as a butterfly's egg. Draw the egg situated on a leaf. Butterflies usually lay their eggs on specific plant leaves, such as the swan plant. Draw a text box. Inside of the text box, write egg. Then draw a line pointing to the picture of the egg. From this point, you'll shortly be able to draw a line to connect to the next picture."
