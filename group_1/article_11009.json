      "content": "Spooning The classic spoon is a great way to build intimacy and decrease conflict between romantic partners. [1] X Research source Spooning consists of a “big” and “little” spoon, where you both lie on your sides tucked into each other. The big spoon is the one in the back and often drapes their arm over the torso of the little spoon. [2] X Research source Because your heads are nearly even with each other, you might bump the big spoon’s nose on accident. Try to stagger the positions of your heads so one is a little lower than the other. The big spoon can rest their head on the shoulder of the little spoon or prop it up on one arm."

      "content": "Half-spoon The half-spoon is almost as popular as the spoon because it allows you to hear the other person’s heartbeat. It can be extremely intimate and soothing because it reminds you of when you were a baby falling asleep on your mother’s chest or shoulder. [3] X Research source To half-spoon, lie on your back and have your partner face you, lying on their side. The person on their side rests their head on the other’s chest or in the nook of their arm. Over time, your heart rate tends to line up with your partner’s, which is a symbol of how close you are…or want to be. [4] X Research source Another option is for both of you to be on your backs, with one resting your head on the other’s chest. Try intertwining your legs for an even more intimate cuddling session."

Keep your upper bodies separate while entwining your legs together. This position lets you read, eat, or scroll on your phone while still maintaining intimacy with your sweetie. [7] X Research source If you’re feeling playful, try playing footsie to add a little fun to your cuddling. A leg hug is also a great option when you want to cuddle, but it’s a little warm out."

This lets you stay connected while giving you a little breathing room. If you get hot easily or get a little claustrophobic during an extended cuddle, use the back-to-back cuddle with only your butts touching to allow for more air circulation. This position shows you want your partner to be comfortable while staying close to them."

This cuddle position gets its name because it’s the perfect way to cuddle when you’re camping or watching a meteor shower. Lay on your backs next to each other and wrap your legs together. Hold hands over your torsos or in the space between your bodies. Alternatively, one of you can slip your arm under the neck of the other person in a half-embrace.

Ask your partner if it’s okay to cuddle, what type of cuddling they like, and how they like to cuddle. Then, discuss how far you both want your cuddling to go.

If it’s too hot, you might have to limit the amount of physical contact to avoid turning into a swamp monster. Are you on a couch or a bed? Or something else entirely? The amount of space you have to sprawl will change the cuddling positions you can perform. [13] X Research source If you plan on doing some long-term cuddling during a movie or before bed, change into comfortable clothes or grab a cozy blanket. Although you might be resting on the other person, having a pillow present might be a good idea, too. Spooning is one of the greatest heat-generating cuddling positions because there is so much physical contact. The big spoon may have to hold off wrapping their arm around the little spoon or move their legs back a bit to avoid creating a sweat pool. [14] X Research source"

Plus, playing with your partner’s hair can help them feel comfortable and relaxed. Gender doesn’t matter when it comes to playing with hair. Both men and women enjoy it.
