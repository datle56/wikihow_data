This spot will act as the point in a \"V\" with legs V that extend to either temple. The hair that falls inside this V shape is what you'll cut to create new bangs. [3] X Research source Make sure you don't gather too much hair. Cutting bangs that extend past your temples on either side will give you an old-fashioned look. Gathering too little hair is also a mistake. You want your bangs to look full and pretty, not thin."

[7] X Research source Do not use fingernail scissors or safety scissors to cut your hair. It is very important to use professional haircutting scissors. They have a sharper edge and will make a much prettier cut. Using other types of scissors will make your bangs look choppy."

Holding the scissors vertically, trim the bangs to the length you want, working your way from the middle of the bangs to the ends. Blunt bangs should be slightly shorter in the middle and slightly longer at the ends. This helps them lay more naturally on your forehead.

This may allow you to comfortably wear your bangs at the current length, reducing the likelihood that you'll accidentally cut them too short."
