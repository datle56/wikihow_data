      "content": "Prompt a playful back-and-forth exchange with a unique answer. If you want to set the stage for a fun and engaging conversation, opt for an answer that gives your match something to talk about. The following answers invite the other person to be creative and show off their playful side, whether it’s guessing your favorite drink or giving you a unique compliment.

      "content": "Do keep your profile positive. Focus on highlighting your best qualities, such as your playfulness and sense of humor, instead of your dislikes or complaints. Negativity turns most people off, and you don’t want to lose a potential match because of a few phrases. If you present yourself in a positive manner, you’re more likely to attract the right partner! Remember, you want to draw attention to your incredible and unique features. If you've had negative dating experiences in the past, it's normal to want to keep your guard up, but try to avoid letting those experiences affect the tone of your profile."

There are endless prompts on Hinge, but it’s a good idea to take on three categories: one that showcases your humor, one that showcases your knowledge, and one that showcases your dream date scenario.

As a rule of thumb, keep your answers short and sweet so there’s room for discussion in your chat."

If you pick a basic answer that everyone else has heard before, it may lower your number of matches or turn people off. Reflect on your interests, hobbies, and favorite things to craft a response that’s entirely your own! [7] X Research source For example, a common answer for the “first round is on me if” prompt is “the second round is on you.” That answer doesn’t provide any insight into your personality or give your matches anything to work with."

      "content": "Don’t be too demanding or push gender stereotypes. While the “first round is on me if” prompt is supposed to be fun and playful, some people answer it in a way that makes them seem materialistic or have unrealistic standards for a partner. Answers like “it’s never on me,” “you give me your wallet,” or “you’re over 6 foot” are likely to turn people away and make them view you in a negative light. Instead, answer the prompt so it highlights your personality, values, or relationship goals."
