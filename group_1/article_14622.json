      "content": "Most spiritual traditions have a way to interpret dreams about the dead. Depending on your beliefs, your dream can mean many things. In Islam, it is believed the dead can directly reach the living through dreams. When you meet someone, they’re really there talking to you and are trying to help you make peace with their death. [8] X Research source Viewed through the lens of Hinduism, this sort of dream means the deceased has not ascended to heaven yet. Whoever is speaking to you is asking for your help to get over their death. Christianity is a little trickier. Since the dead did not visit people in the Bible (instead they were resurrected) some believe that there is no Christian interpretation of speaking with the dead in a dream. Others believe the person has come to help you with a problem you can’t solve yourself. In Judaism, like Islam, when you see someone who has passed on in a dream, you’re really seeing that person. Speaking to them is considered a good omen."
