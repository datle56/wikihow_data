      "content": "Wash and dry your hair. You’ll need to start with hair that is clean and dry. Use your usual shampoo and conditioner on your hair. Then, allow it to air dry or blow dry it . Having dry hair will ensure that you don’t cut your hair too short, as wet hair can end up drying much shorter than it looks. [3] X Research source It’s essential to blow dry your hair first if it’s curly or wavy. Curly hair appears much longer when it’s wet. [4] X Research source Before you dry your damp hair, you might want to use the hair comb to find your natural part. Finding your natural part is important if you plan to part your hair to one side rather than do a middle part. You can find your natural part by running the comb over the front section of your hair, so the hair falls to the back of your hair. Then, use your hand to push your hair forward gently. Your hair should fall toward your natural part. You can also determine your natural part by noting which side of your head you usually part your hair on. You can then keep this in mind when cutting your hair so your hair parts as you like it."

Then, secure the 3 sections using hair ties. [5] X Research source Make sure the back section sits just above the nape of your neck. You’ll need to gently slide the hair ties up and down your hair at the back, so don’t tie them too tightly."

      "content": "Cut the back section off with scissors. You may need a hand mirror to see the back ponytail if you're cutting your hair yourself. Move the back ponytail up or down against your neck, based on the length you would like the bob to be. If you want a shorter bob, move the ponytail further up. For a longer bob, move the ponytail further down. [6] X Research source Use the cutting shears to cut right underneath the back ponytail. You may need to cut across the top of the back ponytail slowly to ensure you get an even cut, especially if you have thicker hair. For a more blunt look, use the hair clippers to trim any uneven hairs underneath the back ponytail. If you are using the hair clippers on your own hair, take care to hold the clippers steady as you trim off any uneven hairs. Try to get an even cut all the way across the back ponytail so the back section will appear straight and even."

      "title": "Use the hair razor on the side sections.",
      "content": "Use the hair razor on the side sections. Release the back ponytail once you are done trimming it. Then, release the side ponytails. You should have a blunt, even cut in the back section and longer side sections. You will then take the hair razor and shape the side sections until they are the length you would like for the bob. [7] X Research source If you are going for a more A-line look, you may want to keep the side sections a bit longer than the back section. Lift small sections of hair and run the hair razor through the bottom of the hair in an angled, upward motion. This will help to trim and shape the hair , so it’s at an even angle to the back section of your hair. For more of a straight bob look, use the hair razor to shape and trim the side sections, so they are in line with the back section. Run the hair razor through the bottom part of your hair in an upward motion until it is trimmed to the length of the back section."

      "content": "Add layers , if desired. Adding layers might be a good option if you're looking for extra volume. Layers are ideal if you have thinner hair, as they will give your hair more body. If you have thicker hair, you might want to skip layers to avoid your hair getting too puffy or round. To add layers, use the hair comb to comb out a section of hair on the side of your head, towards the back of your head. Hold the section of hair so the ends are facing upward, and use the cutting shears to trim the ends, pointing the scissors down and in as you trim. Don’t cut the hair straight across, as this will lead to jagged ends. Continue to do this on the sides and back of your hair, cutting the ends of the hair with the scissors pointed down and in. This will create layers throughout your hair, giving your bob a more voluminous look."

      "content": "Blend the ends of the hair. As a finishing touch, you should blend the ends of your hair so your bob looks even and polished. Blending the ends will also help to remove any stray pieces of hair that are too long. [8] X Research source Lift small pieces of hair and run the hair razor on the ends of the hair in a downward, angled motion. This will help to taper the ends and make them appear more blended. Do this around your entire head for a uniform result. You might find it helpful to spritz your hair with a spray bottle to dampen it slightly as you cut, especially if your hair is straight. This will help you achieve clean, even lines as you tidy up your bob. If you want a softer, textured bob, use thinning shears on the bottom 1 in (2.5 cm) of your hair, rather than a razor.
