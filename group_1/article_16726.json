      "content": "Figure out what style you're going for. Before you start looking for the best brands, you should take a moment to figure out what kind of look you're trying to go for. Are you aiming for something casual and innocuous, or a bold visual statement? You should keep your intent at the front of your mind when you are choosing your eyeliner. Don't just think about how it looks, but also what that particular shade or technique is meant to convey. Having a strong idea what you want to do will take guesswork out of the equation further down the road."

      "content": "Consider the size of your eyes. Taking a look at your place and giving it an objective analysis can be incredibly helpful when it comes to choosing cosmetics, as it lends a more specific insight into what traits should be emphasized or evened out. There are several dimensions that factor into the right type and style. The most important of these factors are the shape and size of your eyes. Some traits relate to the type of eyeliner, while others will have an effect on the way you put it on. To get a grasp of your eyes' relative size, judge them in rough proportion to your other facial features, such as the nose or forehead. If you have smaller eyes , you'll want to aim to brighten your eyes with light shades and only use dark liner on the outer corners of your eyes.

      "content": "Figure out the shape of your eyes. If you're trying to figure out whether you have round , or thinner almond eyes, check to see if you can see visible whites above or below your iris whilst assuming a normal facial expression. If you can, you have relatively round eyes. If you don't, they're considered almond eyes. Simple enough? While neither type is necessarily better than the other, they do favour different cosmetic approaches. Almond eyes favour strongly favour makeup that highlights their distinctive shape, so lining the top and bottom contours of your eyes is recommended if your eyes fit that bill. [3] X Research source If your eyes are rounder, you should try adding length by adding liner wings or 'cat's eye' makeup."

      "content": "Consider your eye colour. While there is no single set answer for each shade of eye, you should keep in mind the likely effect eye colour/liner combinations will have on your appearance. Choosing an eyeliner that contrasts your natural eye colour, for example, serves to emphasize that colour. Keep that in mind when you're looking for a certain shade of eyeliner; having a rudimentary knowledge of the way colours intermingle will help you figure out what liner will look best on you. If you have brown eyes , choosing a lighter shade of brown eyeliner will help to emphasize the lighter shades in your eyes. Blue eyes combine well with gold and rusty-coloured eyeliners. Green eyes , on the other hand, work well great with reddish tones. If you're feeling creative, you might want to throw another dimension into this by experimenting with different-coloured contact lenses!"

      "content": "Shop for a set of eyeliners. While the colour of eyeliner should hinge on the colour of one's eyes, a lot of the eye size and shape-specific effects you're looking to get from eyeliner are based in the product's application, less so the product itself. However, you'll want to purchase a brand that is reputable, and preferably cruelty-free. This means steering clear of dollar store cosmetics, and going to a department store, specialty boutique, or shopping online instead. While this might cost you something more, the difference between quality and 'budget' eyeliners are night and day, and you shouldn't think of buying a low-grade product that will have such frequent contact with your skin anyway. If you've got an adventurous personality, don't be afraid to pick up some liners in bold and surprising colours! While the standard black and brown liners should absolutely be a part of your makeup arsenal, you can make a memorable statement by highlighting your eye with a colour people aren't expecting."

      "content": "Enlist the help of a beauty specialist. Most department store beauty sections will have employees who are specialized in the choosing and application of cosmetic products. If you're still having any difficulty in deciding what might work for you, it is recommended you seek one of them out and ask for help in choosing the right eyeliner. Make sure to let the specialist know what general style you're going after; that way, she'll be able to give you more accurate suggestions."

      "content": "Visualize your desired look. Once you have a decent set of makeup and eyeliner, stand in front of the bathroom mirror and decide how you'd like to use it to accentuate your eyes. This is different from your initial brainstorming, as you'll be thinking of practical ways you can put your new tools to the best effect. As a general rule, you want to balance out your features as much as possible, and exercise moderation in highlighting features that are already prominent. Whether you have large or small eyes, wide or almond-shaped, there will be particular techniques that favour your shape, and others which probably won't yield as desirable a result. While some techniques are safer bets than others, part of the fun of makeup is trying new things, so if you think of something that goes against popular recommendation, feel free to try it out. If it doesn't turn out the way you imagined it, you can always wash it off!"

      "content": "Go thick for the bold occasions, and light for the casual. One crucial part of mastering makeup is knowing which looks work for certain situations. You wouldn't want to dress for the red carpet going to the mall or the grocery store, and the same works vice versa. Generally speaking, for more glamorous or exciting situations, you should draw on your liner thicker. Likewise, you should keep it subtle for stay-in occasions. If you're having any trouble deciding how much is enough for certain situations, keep your eye out for others' makeup at certain events; what is the common extent at a night club? How about a library? It's recommended to fall back on popular trends if you have any doubt. From there, you can eventually springboard into your own style."

      "content": "Add wings to your eyes. Winged liner is a very popular technique, as it adds length and distinction to the contour of your eyes. Most important, possibly, is the fact that the winged technique may apply to an extensive variety of eye shapes and sizes. While adding a subtle accent to the outer ends of your eyes is appropriate to virtually every kid of eye, how far you go with it depends on the shape and placement of the eyes. Although it's known for its versatility, winged liner is most recommended for round eyes, as it will add length to their appearance. Narrower eyes may still benefit from wings, so long as they're left very subtle."

      "title": "Draw liner on the top and bottom of your eyes.",
      "content": "Draw liner on the top and bottom of your eyes. If you're looking for your eyes to 'pop out', drawing a thin line along the bottom of your eye to complement the top will emphasize your eyes' natural shape. This is particularly recommended if you have almond eyes. However, you might want to avoid this technique if your eyes are on the small side; because a double line will make them smaller than they really are."

      "title": "Try a white eyeliner.",
      "content": "Try a white eyeliner. White eyeliners are interesting because they make your eyes look more awake. Although they don't make them look wider per se, smaller eyes benefit from the rejuvenating effect this technique will have on your look. Either try drawing a thin line along the top of your eye, or smudge it behind a black one. Either way, regardless of your eye shape, this is a great trick if you're going for a livelier look."

      "content": "Seal your eyeliner. Once you have perfected your masterpiece, the last thing you want is to have it smudge or mess later on. The best way to avoid this is to dab over your liner with an eyeshadow that matches your skin tone. Doing this simple step will save you a lot of trouble further down the road, so even if the extra step means more work, it's well worth your time."

      "content": "Look in the mirror and judge your work. What do you think of the effect the eyeliner brings out in your face? Does it suit the situation you were planning for? More importantly, does it emphasize the right characteristics in your eyes? If the result isn't up to your standard, you can always rub it off and try again. Even if you are okay with it, you can always pick out way you might improve for next time!"

      "content": "Ask a friend what she thinks! Don't feel self-conscious about asking a friend what they think of your eyeliner; many of your friends have probably faced similar issues, and some may have even invented methods of their own they'll be all too happy to share with you. Friends are a notably underrated source of insight when it comes to makeup, so make the most of their knowledge. If you can think of a friend with a similar shape and colour to their eyes, they might be best to ask for advice. Bonus points if you think they have a good fashion sense!"
