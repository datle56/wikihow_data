Breaking things down will help you focus on correct form and proper execution. Doing the hop step is all about gaining balance and control in what you're doing.

      "title": "Land with both feet.",
      "content": "Land with both feet. This is especially important when learning the hop step. Failing to land simultaneously on both feet can result in a traveling call by a referee."

    {
      "title": "Limit your pivot.",
      "content": "Limit your pivot. Once you land on both feet, you can pivot with one foot or the other, but not both. Even executed perfectly, some officials may still call you for traveling, as it can be difficult to discern a hop step from a travel. Possession of the ball and prior use of a player's allotted pivot can also influence traveling calls."

      "title": "Dribble the ball slowly down the court.",
      "content": "Dribble the ball slowly down the court. You should pay close attention to footwork and stance. At random intervals or at the signal of a whistle, combine the footwork you learning with the dribbling and take your hop step. Try getting close to the rim. The closer you are to the rim, the more help the opposing defense will create. Once the defense comes in, other players on your team will be open.

    {
      "title": "Land with both feet simultaneously.",
      "content": "Land with both feet simultaneously. This is the key point of the hop step. Landing with both feet at the same time means you can pivot either direction, giving you more mobility on the court. Keep your knees bent, body low, and head up after landing."

    {
      "title": "Practice your single pivot.",
      "content": "Practice your single pivot. If your body is familiar with the halting of momentum that the hop step requires, you are less likely to take an illegal second step/pivot."

      "content": "Pivot once. You should switch between sides so that you aren't predictable to your opponents. You should practice coming to a complete stop following the pivot to limit traveling calls. If you had possession of the ball prior to performing this move and have already used your pivot, you may not pivot a second time following your hop."

Practice receiving a pass on your own by: Throwing a ball slightly in front of you with backspin. Executing a small hop while the ball rebounds from the floor. Catching the ball in the air on its return. Pivoting on one foot."
