This is handy if you want to have multiple Gmail addresses pointing to the same Gmail account but don't need to actually sign in and send emails from those addresses. [1] X Research source Use this method if you want to sign up for different products, services, and mailing lists with an alternate email address so you don't get inundated with offers and spam. You can then filter messages sent to your alias so they are labeled/added to a specific folder rather than appearing in your inbox. Your aliases will all be variations of your existing email address. So, if your email address is john.smith@gmail.com , your aliases can be things like john.smith+spam@gmail.com , john.smith+offers@gmail.com , and john.smith+medical@gmail.com . You can create an unlimited amount of email addresses this way."
