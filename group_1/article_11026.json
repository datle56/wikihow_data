      "content": "Wash with a medicated shampoo. Just like on your scalp, dandruff of your beard may respond well to washing with an anti-dandruff shampoo. [1] X Research source Be aware that there is different information on using anti-dandruff shampoos and some people feel products like Selsun Blue and Head and Shoulders may be too harsh for gentle facial skin. Do a patch test on a small piece of skin that no one can see. Leave your anti-dandruff shampoo on for about 5 minutes and see if you have a reaction. If not, go ahead and use your chosen product. If you do have a reaction, consider using a specific beard wash or dandruff treatment product. Both of these are gentler on your skin than regular dandruff shampoos. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser or baby shampoo to remove excess oil before applying the medicated shampoo. Then apply the medicated shampoo and leave it on your skin and beard for at least 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly so you don’t have a buildup of residue, which can make dandruff appear worse. Comb your beard when you’re done. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Deep condition your beard. Beard dandruff may be caused or exacerbated by environmental factors such as cold air. This can sap your skin and beard of precious moisture and result in flakes appearing in your beard. Use a deep conditioner, especially during cold winter months, to keep your skin and beard moisturized. [3] X Research source Use any type of deep conditioner you like or consider trying a conditioner specifically designed for beards. Look for ingredients to soothe and moisturize your beard and underlying skin such as cotton, great tea, oat and willow bark extracts. Apply the conditioner after you shampoo your beard and leave it on for a few minutes while you’re in the shower. Make sure to thoroughly rinse out the conditioner to prevent residue from building up and making your dandruff worse."

Although it’s important to keep your skin and beard clean, it’s also important to not overwash them. It could inflame your skin, strip its oil, and lead to beard dandruff.

Wear loose-fitting items and use natural fiber bedding to keep your skin moisturized and supple, which can also keep your beard looking fabulous. Wear sweat or moisture wicking hats, helmets, or balaclavas, especially during cold and dry winter months. These can keep sweat away from your skin and help prevent beard dandruff. Sleep on bedding—or at least a pillowcase—made out of cotton or another smooth, natural fabric. This can prevent skin irritation, which may otherwise lead to beard dandruff. Make sure to regularly wash any garments or bedding that come in contact with your skin and beard. Use a mild detergent to remove dirt, oil, and bacteria that can clog and irritate skin.
