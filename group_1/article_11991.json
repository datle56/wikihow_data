      "title": "Tell the person openly and honestly how you're feeling.",
      "content": "Tell the person openly and honestly how you're feeling. Make the first move and lead a conversation to let the person know how their actions and words have hurt you. If they seem genuinely confused or shocked and sorry, maybe it was just miscommunication rather than mind games. But if they try to twist your words or take over the conversation, they were likely playing mind games with you. [1] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I feel like you disregard my feelings when we talk.\" Someone playing mind games might respond by saying, \"How am I supposed to know how you're feeling?\" Get into the habit of expressing your feelings honestly. Healthy communication is probably the most important aspect of building and maintaining healthy relationships. [2] X Expert Source Jin S.

      "title": "Address the mind games directly.",
      "content": "Address the mind games directly. Let the person know in no uncertain terms that you're aware of what they're trying to do and you're not going to fall victim to it. If they're called out, they're less likely to continue trying to manipulate you. [3] X Research source For example, if someone's trying to say something didn't happen the way you know it did, you might say, \"I can see that you're trying to gaslight me and I don't appreciate it. I know what happened.\" People who play mind games think they can control you. When you outsmart them by letting them know you're onto them, they'll know they can't control you that way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set a boundary around the manipulative behavior.",
      "content": "Set a boundary around the manipulative behavior. Tell the person how you expect to be treated and what's acceptable to you. Then, create consequences by telling them what will happen if they continue to violate the boundary you've set. Be clear and direct when you establish the boundary and be ready to enforce it consistently by following through on those consequences if they try to come at you again. [4] X Research source For example, you might say, \"Please don't raise your voice when you talk to me. If you do it again, I'll walk away and end the conversation.\" Then, enforce that boundary by walking away if they raise their voice again. Many people who play mind games see boundaries as something to push past. They might think other people's boundaries don't apply to them. By enforcing your boundaries, you set yourself outside their control."

      "title": "Ask probing questions to draw attention to their manipulation.",
      "content": "Ask probing questions to draw attention to their manipulation. The right questions put the focus on the manipulative part of what the person's trying to say. When you put the manipulation front and center, it forces them to answer for it directly. This can be a really powerful way to shift power and outsmart the person—you might even get them to admit what they're trying to do. Here are some examples of questions you might ask: [5] X Research source Do I have a say in this? Are you asking me or telling me? Does that sound fair to you? Does that seem reasonable to you? Would you agree to that if you were in my shoes?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ignore the person or disengage from the conversation.",
      "content": "Ignore the person or disengage from the conversation. If someone says something to you that sounds manipulative, just ignore it rather than respond to it. Continue the conversation as though they never said it at all, or just remain silent and let it sink in. If they get aggressive or double down on their manipulation, you always have the option to simply walk away. [6] X Research source For example, if the person tries to gaslight you by saying, \"Oh, you're just being overemotional,\" simply stand there in silence with a blank expression on your face. When you refuse to respond, it can really highlight how wrong their statement is and can make them feel silly for trying to manipulate you that way."

      "title": "Keep your distance from the manipulative person.",
      "content": "Keep your distance from the manipulative person. Sometimes, when you take a few steps back from someone playing mind games, you can see what they're doing more clearly. Watch how they act around other people—manipulative people often put on different masks for different audiences. Plus, if you keep them at a distance and avoid interacting with them unless you absolutely have to, it gives them less control over you. [7] X Research source Distancing yourself from the person and the situation can also help you figure out why they're trying to manipulate you. This won't stop the behavior, but it can give you some insight and help you understand it. [8] X Research source Ending any relationship is uncomfortable but sometimes necessary. Once you've identified that a relationship is toxic, it's usually best to end it. [9] X Expert Source Jin S. Kim, MA Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 14 May 2019.

      "content": "Take steps to get away from a manipulator's influence and control. Mind games are really tricky to deal with, even after you’ve stood up for yourself. Separate yourself from the manipulator gradually by telling them no or creating clearer boundaries. As you slowly remove that person’s influence from your life, you'll feel happier and more in control. [10] X Research source For example, if you live with a parent who constantly plays mind games, you might want to make plans to get your own place or move in with a friend or other relative. If the manipulative person is also abusive in other ways, create a plan that maintains your personal safety. Build a support system or talk to someone at a domestic abuse hotline.

      "title": "You question your own thoughts and feelings.",
      "content": "You question your own thoughts and feelings. The whole point of many different types of mind games, such as gaslighting, is to get you to question your own understanding of reality. If you start questioning things you were previously sure about, that could be the result of psychological manipulation. For example, if your partner goes out by themselves all the time and you mention that you're concerned about that, they might try to gaslight you by saying, \"You're imagining things. I never go anywhere without you.\""

      "title": "You feel inferior or bad about yourself.",
      "content": "You feel inferior or bad about yourself. People who play mind games use insults or unfavorable comparisons to others to make you feel bad about yourself. Their hope is that you'll feel bad enough about yourself that you'll be willing to do whatever they ask you to do in the hopes of returning to their favor. [15] X Research source For example, your manipulative boss might say, \"Your report was okay, but even your best still isn't as good as Alice's worst. If you want to get ahead in this company, you need to step it up.\" In a personal relationship, these types of mind games can be particularly hurtful. For example, a manipulative partner might say, \"You shouldn't wear so much makeup, it only makes you look older than you already are.\""

They believe that if you feel guilty for doing what you want to do, you'll do what they want you to do instead. [16] X Research source For example, you already have plans for the evening but one of your friends is feeling lonely and wants you to hang out with them instead, so they tell you, \"If you really cared about how I feel, you'd come over and hang out with me.\""

      "content": "You're filled with doubt and insecurity. Not all acts of manipulation are aggressive. Sometimes, people playing mind games use more passive techniques, such as forgetting something important to you and then downplaying your response. The whole point is to sew seeds of self-doubt and make you feel insecure about yourself and the things that you value.

      "title": "You feel pressured to change your boundaries.",
      "content": "You feel pressured to change your boundaries. Manipulative people tend to see boundaries as things for them to overcome. They don't care about respecting your limits—they want you to change your limits for them. Getting you to bend to their will in this way is how they exercise control over you. [19] X Research source This can also take the form of the person using excessive praise to try to get you to do something you ordinarily wouldn't do. For example, a boss playing mind games might publicly praise your work on a project to get you to take on more work than you can handle. [20] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source A healthy relationship is one where both people have respect for each other and their boundaries.
