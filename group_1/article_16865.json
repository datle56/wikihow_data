For example, if you searched \"Bill Clinton,\" it will show the most recent tweets, photos, or videos about Bill Clinton. Accounts: Shows a list of accounts with your search term as the real name. The most popular accounts will be ordered first. If you are searching for a celebrity, like Hugh Jackman, the first account will likely be the actual account.
