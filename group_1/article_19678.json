[1] X Research source However, \"time\" could mean anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple of years, so you may wish to treat the wart to help it go away more quickly. If you have a healthy immune system, the warts should eventually go away on their own, but this can take anywhere from 1-3 years."

[2] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Its effectiveness varies and it can take weeks for it work. Because these products are widely available over-the-counter, they're a good first-line treatment for warts. They help irritate the skin, which can trigger your body's immune response to the wart. Soak the skin in water for 5 minutes or longer, apply the acid liberally using the brush and let it dry. Leave it for a day. You can either peel or file it off and then file remaining dead skin. Do this every two or three days."

Duct tape occlusion therapy (DTOT) is supposed to localize medication in the general wart area as well as \"choke\" the wart itself. One study found that duct tape following the application of imiquimod 5% cream was an effective treatment against the common wart. However it takes a long time (up to 6 months), and usually people don't see success with this.

[5] X Research source There is some pain involved, but you may see results in just a day. Cantharidin is also known as “beetle juice.” [6] X Research source The doctor applies cantharidin directly on the wart, then applies a bandage. After a few hours, the cantharidin is washed off. Within a day, blisters will begin to form on the wart, which will gradually dry up and peel away—hopefully taking the wart with it. [7] X Research source While the application of cantharidin doesn’t hurt, the blister that forms after it is washed away may cause discomfort. If it doesn't work in one treatment, you may need another method—your doctor will make appropriate recommendations."

Cryotherapy works by damaging the cells of the wart, which can help your body generate immunity to the wart. Alternatively, many drug stores carry OTC freeze treatments to zap the wart. [9] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. If using an OTC wart freeze treatment, keep the following tips in mind: Follow the direction on the wart removal package. Your skin should turn from white to red in a matter of minutes, and a blister should begin to form underneath the wart. Small black dots should appear beneath the wart after a few days. This is a sign that the treatment is working. Resist the urge to pull the wart off. The wart should fall off on its own. If it doesn't, treat again after two weeks. Do not treat a wart that has been unsuccessfully treated three times; see a doctor."
