Match up the ends so they meet nicely and then make a crease down the middle where the bill is folded. Unfold the bill and then fold it the other way. Make a crease and unfold it again. [1] X Research source At this point, you should have 2 creases in the bill that form a cross and divide the bill into 4 equal rectangles."

Fold the bottom edge up and match the edge with the center crease you made in the first step. Use your fingernail to crease the fold along the bottom. [2] X Research source Do not unfold this crease."

Fold it upward so that the bottom crease you just made meets the middle vertical line you made in the first step. Crease the fold you've just created, making half of the point at the bottom. [3] X Research source Repeat the process on the left side, bringing the bottom crease over to meet the right side you just brought to the middle. You should now have a point at the bottom and 2 flat edges at the top."

It will make a diagonal crease along the bottom left of the bill. Do the same with the right side. [7] X Research source Your bill should now have a flat edge along the top. On the bottom, it should be a diagonal fold going down towards the middle, a short straight edge in the middle, and a diagonal fold going back up to the right side."

Flip it over and fold the edge up the same amount as you did on the other side. You're basically creating a fan-style fold, moving from the bottom of the bill to the top.

Place the longest side of the accordion fold face up. Bring the 2 ends of the fold up to meet each other, creasing the bill in the middle as you do. [9] X Research source As you fold this step, the bottom of the bill should start to fan out like a leaf. When you bring the 2 ends together, you're creating the middle of the leaf."

Pick the side that's slightly longer than the other, and open the layers with your finger. Slip the other edge between those 2 layers. The longer edge should go over the first crease in the smaller edge, holding it in place. [10] X Research source Your leaf is complete and ready to stick on a money tree!"

Press down to make a crease in the bill below it. Do the same on the other side so that the side crease meets the other one in the middle and push down on the bill below to make another crease.

Use your finger to open up the skirt at the bottom by pushing between the 2 folds. As you bring out each side, make a crease along the diagonal, creating a fuller skirt. Basically, you're pulling apart the \"trough\" you made earlier in the folding process. As you pull it apart, it naturally creates space to make a diagonal fold from the \"waist\" of the dress down to the \"hem.\""
