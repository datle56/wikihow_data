      "content": "Write down the people you want to include in the diagram. A family tree begins with you, and branches out from there. Start by writing down the names of people in your immediate family, then move to your parents' generation. Make sure you don't leave anyone out! Your family tree will be an important piece of family history, so take time to create an accurate diagram. Write down your name, your siblings' names, and your parents' names. Write down your grandparents' names, your aunts' and uncles' names and your cousins' names. Write down your great grandparents' names and your great aunts' and uncles' names. Many people stop there, but you can include as many generations as you want."

      "content": "Fill in the holes by doing some research. It might start getting difficult to fill in names once you go back a few generations. In an effort to make sure everyone gets included and all the names are accurate, conduct some research to double check yourself. This is a great opportunity to learn more about your family history. [1] X Research source Talk to older members of your family to find out more information. Find out the names of your grandparents' siblings, their spouses, their children. Ask around to find out as much as you can. If you're lucky, you'll get the opportunity to hear some surprising family stories and secrets, too. Do online research using a genealogy tool. There are many online tools that let you simply enter your name and your parents' name, then do all the research for you. These sites usually give you a limited amount of information free, then require payment for more in-depth research. If you're serious about mapping your ancestry, this is a great way to collect information."

In addition to including the first and last names of your family, you might want to list their birth dates, death dates (if applicable), marriage dates, and so on. Having these dates on the family tree will make it even more informative as a historical document for your family. In addition to dates, you could consider including your relatives' birthplaces or hometowns. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide whether to include photos. If you have access to photographs of your ancestors, you could include a small portrait of each person. This option is best for family trees that are relatively contained, since the pictures could take up a lot of room on your finished diagram. [3] X Research source If you only have a few photos, you could just include pictures of your immediate family members. Track down photos of as many family members as possible. If you want to make them all the same size, scan them into your computer and use Photoshop or another photo editing program to change the scale."

If you want it to branch out vertically and get bushier at the top, like a tree, start at the bottom of a large sheet of paper. You may also start on the left side of a sheet of paper so that your diagram will be easy to read from left to right. No matter what shape you want your diagram to take, fill in the following information to get started: [4] X Research source Write down your name. Draw a line from your name to the name of your mother. Draw another line from your name to the name of your father. Draw a horizontal line connecting your mother and father. If you have siblings, draw lines from your mother and father to their names. If your siblings have spouses, write them in and connect them with lines. If your siblings have children, write them in and connect them with lines."

Remember to connect married couples with horizontal lines, and to draw lines from parents to their children.

Copy the diagram in pencil on a large sheet of drawing paper, then use nice ink or paint to render the names and add colorful embellishments. You could choose to use the classic tree shape or try something new and creative to illustrate your ancestry. Here are a few ideas: [7] X Research source Turn the connecting lines into branches, and write each person's name on a different leaf. Children's names can be written on apples or berries. Make a family galaxy, with people's names written on planets and stars. If you want, make your name the \"sun.\" Create a family neighborhood, with each name written on a little house, all connected by streets."
