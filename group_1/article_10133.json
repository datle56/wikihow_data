      "content": "Frame your memories in a positive light. It is all too easy to let negative emotions of death overwhelm us and drown out the wonderful memories of someone while they were alive. Think of the funny, quirky traits of your loved one and share them with others. Celebrate a person's accomplishment's and life, finding the good in a difficult time. Many studies show that our mindset while coping with grief profoundly affects how we feel 1-2 years later, so positive feelings now will help you stay positive in the future.

      "content": "Make time to process your loss. Oftentimes our reaction to tragedy is to eliminate free time-- working more hours, going out often, and sleeping in late. This is an attempt to \"bury\" feelings of grief, keeping busy to avoid unpleasant or sad feelings. Coping with death, however, takes time. Resist urges to use drugs and alcohol to cope with death, as this not only inhibits your ability to cope but can lead to other physical and mental problems."

      "content": "Talk about your feelings with loved ones. You are not alone in your grief, and sharing your thoughts, memories, and emotions with others can help everyone understand what has happened. Shutting out others not only hinders your ability to cope with death, but it creates rifts between people when they need each other the most. While talking is difficult, there are ways to begin the conversation: Bring up your favorite memories of the deceased. Plan the funeral service, burial, or rituals together. Admit when you need someone to vent your feelings of anger or sadness to."
