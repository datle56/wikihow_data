Open the cabinet under the sink and you'll see the shutoff valves. Since you have 2 handles, you'll likely also have 2 shutoff valves—left for hot and right for cold. Shut them off one at a time, then see if your leak stops. That'll tell you which handle is the culprit. [2] X Research source Even if only one handle is leaky, it might be worth your time to go ahead and replace the parts in both of them. If they're both the same age and one of them is leaking, it's only a matter of time before the other one starts leaking as well.
