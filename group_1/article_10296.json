      "content": "Create a copy of your original music. Under copyright law, original work is entitled to copyright protection from the moment that it's \"fixed\" in some way. For a song, this could mean sheet music or a digital recording. Keep in mind that there are two different copyrights at work here—a copyright in the composition and a copyright in the sound recording. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source If you wrote the song and recorded it yourself, you can claim both the composition and sound recording copyrights. On the other hand, if you had a producer for the sound recording, you likely can only claim the composition copyright. Your music must be completely original if you want to claim a copyright for it. If you used anyone else's music (for example, by sampling), you'll need a license to use that work in your own."

      "content": "Choose the correct application and fill it out. Unless you're filing sheet music, there will be two copyrights for any given song—one in the composition itself and another for the audio recording of that song. The sound recording copyright protects the actual sounds that are fixed in the copy while the composition copyright protects the notes and lyrics as written. [4] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source If you own the rights to both the musical composition and the sound recording, you can use the same application to register both copyrights. There are 3 basic types of applications: [5] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source Standard application: Use this if you're registering only one copyright in either the musical composition or the sound recording of a single song. Group Registration of Unpublished Works: Use this to register up to ten separate copyrights that you own. This could include both musical compositions and sound recordings. Keep in mind that your work is \"unpublished\" if it hasn't been copied for distribution to the public. Group Registration of Works on an Album of Music: Use this if you've created a full-length album. You can register up to 20 musical compositions or up to 20 sound recordings, or some combination of the two. For example, if you have an album with 10 songs on it, you could register both the musical composition and sound recording copyrights for each of those 10 songs."

You'll get a copyright certificate in the mail when that process is completed.

Then your work falls into the public domain and anyone can use it. There are no criminal charges for copyright infringement and the Copyright Office doesn't enforce copyright claims. Rather, it's up to you to both discover infringement and sue the infringer to enforce your copyright.
