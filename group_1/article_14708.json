Clothes that fit well and hug your body in the right places are more flattering than super tight or oversized pieces. So, identify your body type and dress accordingly. [1] X Research source Pear body type (smaller bust, wider hips and thighs): Flatter your gorgeous curves with straight leg pants and structured, shoulder-enhancing tops (off-the-shoulder, boat neck, or sweetheart necklines). Avoid extremely long or cropped tops and bottom-heavy patterns. Rectangular body type (straight torso, minimal curves): Highlight your athletic figure with mid-waist jeans , belted jackets , and softer fabrics that cinch in at the waist. Avoid silhouettes that are vertical, such as straight-leg pants or straight jackets, and boxy, shapeless styles. Inverted triangle body type (broad shoulders, narrow hips): Show off your amazing arms and legs with ruffled tops , jeans , wide-leg trousers , and A-line skirts . Avoid thick straps, halter-neck tops, shawl collars, and larger patterns on your top half. Hourglass body type (balanced bust and hips, defined waist): Emphasize your waist with figure-hugging silhouettes, A-line dresses , and V-shaped necklines. Look for pants with angled pockets, instead of inseam pockets. Avoid boxy or baggy clothes that hide your curves. Round body type (broader shoulders and bust, less defined waist): Flaunt your legs in straight or bootcut pants , and elongate your torso with V-shaped necklines. Empire waist dresses that hit above the knee work nicely. Avoid tight or clingy fabrics around your midsection."
