Each strip should be roughly 1 inch wide and 5 inches long. If you want extremely tight curls, you'll need to make more rag curlers (roughly 15-20). If you want looser, bouncier curls, you'll need fewer curlers (roughly 7-10). [1] X Research source"

You should divide your hair into four sections: the top, the back, the right side, and the left side. Tie each section in place with a hair tie. Start with the section of hair on the top of your head. Once you've finished curling the top section of your head, take the next section you'd like to work on out of its hair tie. Proceed until each section of your hair is in rag curlers."

Hair Stylist Yan Kandkhorov recommends that you roll your hair in \"a flow going away from your face versus towards your face\" This will help the curls frame your face rather than getting in your way. Take a 1-inch piece of hair from the top section of your head. Hold your strip of fabric perpendicular to your hair, and wrap the ends of your hair around the rag 3-4 times. After wrapping the ends of your hair tightly around the rag curler, begin to roll the rag upwards towards your scalp. Once you've rolled your piece of hair all the way up to your scalp, tie a knot at the end of your rag curl. You'll only need to tie one knot, no need for a bow or double knot. Pull the ends of your fabric tight so that you curl will stay in place."

[4] X Research source Roll 1-inch pieces of hair into curlers all the way to the nape of your neck. This should take 4-8 curlers, depending on the size of the curlers and how much hair you have. At this point, you're curlers should be in a mohawk type shape. After you've finished the middle section of your hair, roll the side sections of your hair into curlers, starting at your temple and working your way back. Each section should use 3-8 curlers. The bigger the curlers, the fewer you'll need. The smaller the curlers, the more you'll need. If you have thin or short hair, you'll use fewer curlers. If you have long or thick hair, you'll use more curlers. Tie a scarf around your head to keep your curlers in place overnight."

Be sure to use the proper curling iron to get the results you want. For tight and bouncy curls, use either a 3/8\" or 5/8\" curling iron. These sized curling irons will give you tight spiral curls that will beautifully mimic the look of a perm. For springy, bouncy curls that are larger near your scalp and tighter near the ends, use a curling wand. A curling wand will give your hair a pretty spiral curl. For full curls or defined waves, use a 1\" curling iron. This size is recommended for shorter hair, and is great for creating beach-inspired hair styles. For large, voluminous waves, use either a 1.25\" or 1.5\" curling iron. This is a must have curling iron for every day, body-filled waves. [6] X Research source"

Hair Stylist Yan Kandkhorov explains two different ways to curl your hair: \"if you want to have more curly, wavy hair [that is] looser on the bottom, [...] start from the middle, curling it and then letting the ends stay [...] out to make it looser. If you want to create stronger curls, you curl from the bottom up.\" Grab pieces of your hair one small section at a time. Do not curl your hair by clamping it in your curling iron and rolling upward. Instead, hold the curling iron in place and wrap your hair around it. Starting close to your roots, wind your hair around the curling iron away from your face. Hold the bottom 1/4 inch of your hair in place for 10 seconds. Then, let go of your hair and gently pull the iron away from your hair. Do this to each piece of hair until the bottom half of your hair is curled. [9] X Research source Unclip the top portion of your hair, and grab the first piece you'd like to curl. Curl the top of your hair the same way you curled the bottom. Starting near the roots, wind small pieces around your curling iron. Continue until you have curled all of your hair."

If you want smooth yet big volume, comb your curls out with a wide-tooth comb. Let your hair set until it is cool to the touch before you touch or comb your curls. Touching it too soon after curling can cause the curls to fall out. [10] X Research source Finish your look by spraying your curls with hairspray."
