      "content": "Write your note on cute stationery or something unexpected. Choosing really nice stationery or a special note card for your love note is a nice touch, but you can also use anything you have handy. A basic piece of paper is good enough if that's all you've got—remember it's the words and the thought behind them that count! Here are some fun ideas: Sticky notes (small, but you can fit them anywhere!) Napkins or paper towels (just make sure they don't think it's trash and throw it away before reading it!) Bookmarks or postcards Plain T-shirts"

      "content": "Leave your note for your sweetheart to find. This is how most people deliver their cute love notes because it makes it like a game. That doesn't mean you hide it just anywhere, though, because you want to have some control over when they find it (and you probably want them to find it pretty soon after you put it there), so put it in a place where they're guaranteed to look. Here are some ideas: If your partner makes coffee every morning, put your note inside the carafe or filter basket. Put your note in your sweetheart's lunchbox, purse, or other bag they carry with them every day. If your partner drives every day, put your note in the car—maybe in the visor or in front of the instrument panel. Stick the note in the pocket of the pants or jacket that you know your favorite person is going to be wearing tomorrow."
