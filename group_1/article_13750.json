Make sure that the braid is very tight to your head so that it wonâ€™t come undone while you play. French braiding your hair is the same as normal braiding, except instead of braiding straight down, you add a section of hair every time you cross over the center. Begin by crossing the right and then the left side of the braid over the middle. Then, add a small section of hair to the right side and cross it over. Do the same with the left. Continue doing this until you reach a point just below your ear. [3] X Research source"

Take three chunks of hair from your bangs closest to your side part and braid them once: left chunk under center, then right chunk under center. [5] X Research source When it comes time to braid the left side again, add a little bit of hair from your bangs before braiding. It will help to keep your head tilted to the left side.

You can get more mousse or wax as needed, but don't use too much, or else you will need to shampoo your hair. If you have longer hair, you can use a straightener, but it's not necessary, especially if you're going to be running around. [7] X Research source"
