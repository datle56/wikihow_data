Pull the hard drive straight out once you remove the screw. While you are looking at this side, remove the sticker towards the top of the case to reveal a Torx screw. You will need a Torx screwdriver (star) to remove this screw. In the front, there will be four small star screws. For these, you must have a small hole in the screw to get them out due to the metal sticking out the middle of them. Removing the sticker will void any warranty you have on your PlayStation."
