Coleman says, “I would log your food for a week or so, look and see what's happening, and then come up with a plan of action for the week moving forward.” Burning calories from exercise can also make up your caloric deficit. For instance, you might do cardio to burn 250 calories and then eat 250 fewer calories that day, too."
