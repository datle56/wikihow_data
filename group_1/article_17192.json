This means that as the x values increase, you expect the y values to increase also. Because the correlation coefficient is very close to +1, the x-data and y-data are very closely connected. If you were to graph these points, you would see that they form a very good approximation of a straight line."

The correlation coefficient is a single number that you can calculate for any two sets of data points. The number will always be something between -1 and +1, and it indicates how closely connected the two data sets tend to be. [14] X Research source For example, if you were to measure the heights and ages of children up to the age of about 12, you would expect to find a strong positive correlation. As children get older, they tend to get taller. An example of negative correlation would be data comparing a person’s time spent practicing golf shots and that person’s golf score. As the practice increases, the score should decrease. Finally, you would expect very little correlation, either positive or negative, between a person’s shoe size, for example, and SAT scores."

The arithmetic mean, or “average,” of a set of data is calculated by adding all of the values of the data together, then dividing by the number of values in the set. When you find the correlation coefficient for your data, you will need to calculate the mean of each set of data. [15] X Research source The mean of a variable is denoted by the variable with a horizontal line above it. This is often referred to as “x-bar” or “y-bar” for the x and y data sets. Alternatively, the mean may be signified by the lower-case Greek letter mu, μ. To indicate the mean of x-data points, for example, you could write μ x or μ(x). As an example, if you have a set of x-data points (1,2,5,6,9,10), then the mean of this data is calculated as follows: μ x = ( 1 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 ) / 6 {\\displaystyle \\mu _{x}=(1+2+5+6+9+10)/6} μ x = 33 / 6 {\\displaystyle \\mu _{x}=33/6} μ x = 5.5 {\\displaystyle \\mu _{x}=5.5}"
