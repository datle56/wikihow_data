      "content": "Search online or contact your local government for disposal information. CaCl2 is not considered a hazardous waste material by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety in the U.S. [1] X Research source However, in some areas, there may still be special laws and regulations governing how you can dispose of it, especially in a solid state. Before throwing away any solid CaCl2, do a search online or ask someone at your local health department to find out about restrictions in your area. For example, do a search using terms like “Dispose of calcium chloride in Texas.”"

      "content": "Bring solid CaCl2 to a hazardous waste disposal site if local laws require it. If your local government treats solid CaCl2 as hazardous or “special” waste, you’ll need to bring it to an approved facility or use a qualified waste disposal service. Visit your government’s waste management website or contact your local health office for more information about where to dispose of your unwanted CaCl2. For example, in Illinois, all solid chemical waste is classified as “special waste,” and it’s against the law to throw it away in the regular garbage. Some areas offer special hazardous waste collection events or pickup services for residences and businesses. Many colleges and universities have their own services for disposing of chemical waste from campus labs."

      "content": "Put solid CaCl2 in a sealed box in the trash if local law allows it. In many areas, it’s legal to dispose of CaCl2 in the regular trash. If this is the case where you live, put closed containers of CaCl2 inside a box lined with a plastic bag. Tape up the box and put it in your trash can. [2] X Research source Don’t dump solid CaCl2 directly into your trash or into a dumpster. If someone came into contact with the material while handling the trash, it could irritate their eyes, skin, or respiratory system. [3] X Research source Depending on local laws, there may be limits on how much solid chemical waste you can dispose of in the regular trash. For example, in some areas, you can’t throw away more than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of non-hazardous chemical waste at a time. You may need to take larger amounts to a hazardous waste disposal site."

      "content": "Sweep or shovel unused solids into airtight containers for reuse. If you have leftover solid CaCl2, you may be able to reuse or recycle it. [4] X Research source Carefully sweep up any unused portion (or use a shovel, if you’re dealing with a large amount) and place it in a container that you can seal, such as a plastic tub. [5] X Research source Work carefully so you don’t stir up a lot of dust, since it can be irritating to your eyes and respiratory tract. Store the closed containers in a dry area to prevent the CaCl2 from liquefying."

      "content": "Look up your area’s laws about disposing of CaCl2 solutions. In most areas, calcium chloride is considered safe to pour down the drain as long as it’s in an aqueous solution (dissolved in water). [6] X Research source However, this may not be true everywhere. Always check with your local water and sewerage department first. For example, do a search like “liquid calcium chloride disposal Illinois.” You could also contact your local water or sanitation department directly."

      "content": "Flush liquid CaCl2 down a drain connected to the sewer system. If local laws and regulations allow it, dispose of liquid CaCl2 by pouring it into your sink or tub while running water to dilute it. Make sure to use a drain that’s connected to your sewer system, since that water will eventually be routed to a wastewater treatment plant. [7] X Research source Avoid pouring liquid CaCl2 directly into local waterways, since it can be harmful to plants and animals and may contribute to heavy metal contamination. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Dilute liquid CaCl2 while you flush it with 10-20 times its volume in water. You can dispose of liquid CaCl2 more safely if you dilute it. Run the water in the sink for several minutes as you pour it down the drain, or mix your CaCl2 with a generous amount of water before dumping it. For example, if you have 15 millilitres (0.063 c) of CaCl2 solution, wash it down the sink with 150–300 millilitres (0.63–1.27 c) of water. If you run the faucet while dumping the CaCl2 down the drain, let the water continue to run for 5-6 minutes after you’re done."

[9] X Research source If you need to use CaCl2, work outdoors, in a well-ventilated room (i.e., with open windows or doors), or under a fume hood. [10] X Research source If your work is likely to stir up a lot of dust, wear a ventilator mask with a particulate filter to help prevent inhalation. Inhalation of CaCl2 is not known to cause long-term harmful effects. However, if you have concerns or if you experience symptoms (such as a sore throat, coughing, or burning in your throat or lungs) that don’t get better after you move to fresh air, call your doctor."

[12] X Research source Keep your eyes safe by wearing a face shield or chemical safety goggles, preferably with side shields. Never wear contacts while working with CaCl2, since they can trap the chemical against your eye and concentrate it, leading to more severe injuries. [13] X Research source If you get CaCl2 in your eye, flush it with water for at least 15 minutes, then see an eye doctor. If you do happen to be wearing contacts, remove them immediately."

To prevent accidental ingestion, don’t put anything in your mouth while working with CaCl2. [14] X Research source If you accidentally swallow some CaCl2, don’t induce vomiting. Rinse your mouth with water and drink 1 or 2 large glasses of water or milk, then seek medical attention."
