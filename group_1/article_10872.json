The hole can either be a 1x3 rectangle or a 2x2 square, but either way, it should only be one block deep. [1] X Research source Materials needed: Shovel (optional). You don’t need any tools for this, but it’s faster if you use a shovel . You can make the hole bigger if you want, but it will take more water to fill. Once the hole is filled with water, the water you take from it will always be replenished."

Then, place another water block on the opposite end of the hole. The water will fill the center block. When the water is level with no visible flow in any direction, you’re finished. [2] X Research source Materials needed: Two buckets of water. If you’re not sure how to get this, check out our sections on crafting a bucket and obtaining water source blocks ."

Place a second block of water in the corner that’s diagonally opposite from the first one. The water will level out and have no visible flow. [3] X Research source Materials needed: Two buckets of water. If you want to make a bigger area of water, place your water source blocks in every other block, like a checkerboard pattern. [4] X Research source If the area is enclosed, alternating blocks around two sides of the perimeter may make the entire water layer into an infinite source—if that happens, the surface of the pool will become still.

Once your infinite water source is finished, you can take as much water as you want—it will automatically replenish itself every time you fill your bucket. Important note: If you made a 1x3 hole, only harvest water from the center block. If you pull water from the two outside edges, it will mess up the generator. [6] X Research source If you made a 2x2 hole, you can harvest water from any block and it will refill. Sometimes if you harvest water too quickly it will break the generator and you’ll have to replace the water source blocks. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Locate a body of water.",
      "content": "Locate a body of water. It can be any river, lake, or ocean. Minecraft worlds are generated randomly, so you'll need to search the world to find a water source. Luckily, water is pretty common in Minecraft, and you shouldn't have to travel too far. Just make sure you find a solid water source—you can’t fill a bucket with flowing water. [8] X Research source You can also place a cauldron on the ground and wait for it to fill up with rain, then pour that into the bucket. A water source block will be still—it won’t have a flow. You can find it in water tanks, reservoirs, and puddles. Flowing water has a current, like a running stream or river."
