      "content": "Place featherless baby birds back in the nest if you’re able. If the baby bird doesn’t have feathers or only has a few down feathers, it’s a nestling that can’t survive on its own. First, see if you can locate the nest in a nearby tree or bush. If you find the nest, carefully cup the baby bird in one hand and inspect it for injuries. If it looks okay, gently place it back in the nest so the parents can feed it properly. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source While you may have heard that parent birds will reject babies after a human touches them, it’s only a myth. Birds actually have a poor sense of smell and identify their young mostly by sight and sound, so they will accept a fallen chick back into their nest. If you can’t find the nest nearby, try putting an empty basket or a plastic container in a nearby tree or bush where it’s safe. Line the container with newspapers or grass and place the baby bird inside, and the parents will most likely come back to feed the baby. [2] X Research source If you see other dead chicks inside the nest, then the nest has been abandoned and the parent birds won’t return. You may need to feed the baby bird on your own."

      "title": "Leave feathered fledgling birds on the ground.",
      "content": "Leave feathered fledgling birds on the ground. Birds that have all their feathers but are still too young to fly are called fledglings. Ornithologist Roger J. Lederer, PhD says, “Leave it alone because it most likely jumped from its nest and is being cared for by its parents.” He explains, “Baby birds rarely fall from the nest. They leave because it is getting too crowded…But they can’t fly so the parents stay nearby to feed them.” If you’re unsure if a bird is a fledgling, leave it alone and observe it from a distance. You’ll most likely see the parent birds feed it after a little while. Keep pets indoors while fledgling birds are on the ground so they don’t get stressed or injured. Baby ducks and geese are considered precocial birds, which means they follow their parents but can eat and drink on their own. Leave these birds alone as well."

      "title": "Contact a bird rehabilitation center.",
      "content": "Contact a bird rehabilitation center. If the bird is injured, you cannot locate the nest, or the parent birds haven’t returned after a couple of hours, bird specialist Jeff Jones recommends reaching out to the nearest bird or wildlife rehab center for advice. They will either take the bird in and care for it professionally, or they can guide you on the best next steps to take at home. If you do not know where to find a bird rehabilitation center, call a local veterinarian or game warden who can provide the information. In some cases, there may not be a wildlife center in your locality, but there may be an individual, licensed rehabilitator somewhere close by. If there isn’t a way to get the bird to a rehabilitation center quickly, you may have to care for the baby bird yourself as a last resort. Taking care of a wild baby bird on your own is extremely demanding, and doing it improperly is more risky for the bird, so only do it if you have no other options. In addition, some local wildlife laws prohibit you from keeping a wild bird in captivity unless you have the proper permits and licenses. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a mix of ground oatmeal and hard-boiled egg. If you need to make emergency bird food , use a mortar and pestle to grind a scoop of plain, dry oatmeal into a fine powder. Hard-boil an egg and put a quarter of it into the mix, breaking it into smaller pieces. Add water to the mixture a little bit at a time until the food has a soupy consistency that’s not too thick or too runny. [4] X Research source If you aren’t able to grind the oatmeal, use baby cereal as a substitute. Add a little bit of mashed banana or pureed fruit baby food to help entice the bird to eat even more.

Place a scoop of the kibble in water and let it soak for a few minutes until the pieces are soft. Then, squeeze out any excess water and break the kibble apart into smaller pieces so a baby bird can safely eat them.

      "content": "Mix baby bird formula for pet birds. Formula has all the required nutrients a baby bird needs, and it’s specially formulated for domesticated birds. Follow the mixing instructions on the packaging, and use hot or boiling water. Let the formula cool down to 102–105 °F (39–41 °C) before feeding the baby bird to prevent burns or infection. [7] X Research source Avoid heating formula in a microwave because it could create hotspots and may kill any probiotics in the mix."

      "title": "Avoid giving baby birds water.",
      "content": "Avoid giving baby birds water. Baby birds get their water from the food they eat, so they don’t need any extra liquids. If you try giving a young bird water, the liquid could fill their lungs and cause them to drown. [8] X Research source When baby birds have feathers and start feeding themselves, place a shallow dish of water in their cage. If you believe that a baby bird is dehydrated, you will need to bring it to a vet or bird rehabilitator who can inject the bird with fluids."

      "title": "Use a syringe or tweezers to give baby birds food.",
      "content": "Use a syringe or tweezers to give baby birds food. If you’re feeding a young nestling, dip a syringe in the runny food mix. Hold the syringe tip above the baby bird until it opens its mouth. Slowly press down on the syringe a little at a time so the baby bird can eat. Alternatively, hold smaller pieces of soaked kibble above the bird’s beak with tweezers and drop the food in its mouth. [9] X Research source Alternatively, use a small spoon with raised sides to slowly pour food into the baby bird’s mouth. If the baby bird doesn’t open its mouth, tap its beak lightly or rub the food around the edge of the beak. This signals to the bird that it’s time to feed."

      "content": "Give the baby bird food until its crop is full. The crop is a small pouch located on the right side of a baby bird’s neck. As you feed a baby bird, the crop fills up and gets distended like balloon. If the crop looks full, then stop feeding the bird so it doesn’t cause any injuries. [10] X Research source Baby birds will usually keep their mouth closed or turn away from you if they’re not hungry anymore. Do not place food on the left side of the baby bird’s throat, as this is where its trachea is."

      "content": "Feed baby birds every 40-60 minutes during the day. Baby birds have very demanding feeding schedules from sunrise to sunset. Before giving the bird any food, check that the crop at the base of its neck is empty so you don’t overfeed it. [11] X Research source Birds are active during the day, so they don’t need any feedings in the middle of the night. Just be prepared to wake up early to feed them in the morning. When baby birds open their eyes and sprout some feathers, gradually increase the amount of food per feeding and reduce the number of feeding times."

      "content": "Use a plastic syringe to feed your baby bird. After you mix the formula, check that it’s cooled between 102–105 °F (39–41 °C) using a thermometer. Fill the syringe with the feeding formula and hold it near the bird’s head. If it starts shaking or bobbing its head, then it can safely eat. Slowly press down on the syringe so the baby can eat. [12] X Research source Plan on feeding a baby bird around 6-10% of its bodyweight each time. If a baby bird doesn’t respond to feeding or turns away from the syringe, then avoid trying to give it more food because it could accidentally inhale the food."

      "content": "Feed your bird 2-5 times a day. “Baby birds tend to need to be fed anywhere from 2 to 5 times daily,” advises Hayley Heartfield, a bird specialist. She adds that you may have to do more frequent feedings depending on “how young the baby is and how much food it will take per feeding.” When baby birds don’t have their eyes open yet, plan on doing 5-6 feedings a day, or once every 3-4 hours. [13] X Research source Once baby birds open their eyes, reduce feeding to 3-5 times a day. When you see feathers starting to come in, then you can limit feeding to 2-3 times a day. Always check that the bird’s crop at the base of its neck is empty before feeding it."

      "content": "Switch to solid foods when pet birds grow more feathers. As birds get older and develop all their feathers, they can start eating on their own in addition to hand-feeding. Provide bird food pellets that are rich in nutrients in a separate dish so your bird can eat on its own.

Line the bottom of the box with a towel or tissues so the bird has a soft surface to walk on. [17] X Research source Avoid stringy or shredded bedding because it can wrap around the baby bird’s wings and throat. Also, avoid using grass, leaves, moss, or twigs that become damp and moldy. Change the bedding whenever it becomes damp or soiled, or at least once a day."

      "content": "Keep the baby bird warm. If the chicks feel damp or chilled, warm them up as soon as you place them in the box. If you have a heating pad , turn it to the lowest setting and place it on one side of the box. Alternatively, place a warm rice pack inside the box near the baby bird so it can stay warm. [18] X Research source If a baby bird is shivering, then the box is too cold. If you notice a bird panting or drooping its wings, then the box is too hot. Maintain the bird’s nest at a regular temperature depending on its age. If the baby bird has no feathers, keep the temperature around 95–97 °F (35–36 °C). When the bird has small pin feathers, reduce the temperature by 1 degree every 2-3 days. [19] X Research source"
