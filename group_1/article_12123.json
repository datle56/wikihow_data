      "content": "Use the first character to discover the continent of manufacture. You can skip straight to the next step to find which country it is made in, but this basic information is easy to check and remember. [2] X Research source If the first character is an A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H , the vehicle was made in Africa. J, K, L, M, N, P, or R as the first character means the vehicle was made in Asia . This includes the Middle East. Note that a VIN never begins with a zero or O due to the ease of confusing these two symbols. S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, or Z indicate Europe . 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 indicate North America, including USA, Mexico, and Canada . 6 or 7 indicate Australia or New Zealand . Note that nearby nations such as Indonesia or the Philippines are considered part of Asia for this purpose. 8 or 9 indicate South America ."

      "content": "Use the first two characters to narrow it down to country and manufacturer. Many vehicles are made in a different country than the one the manufacturing company is located in. Compare the first two characters of the VIN to an online chart like this one , including the first \"continent\" code described above, and find out where a vehicle was really made. [3] X Research source This will also tell you which company made the car. Some companies use the third digit as well to indicate manufacturer or company division. The first two digits should be enough to identify the country and company, however."

      "title": "Use the tenth character to determine the model year.",
      "content": "Use the tenth character to determine the model year. This method will always work for North American cars, and will often work for cars from other regions. Note that this might be one year later than the car was actually made. A model year of 2008 means the car was probably made either in 2007 or 2008. See below for decoding instructions: [4] X Research source A 10th character which is an A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H indicate the years 1980 – 1987 in alphabetical order, or the years 2010 – 2017. J, K, L, M, and N are reserved for model years 1988 – 1992, or 2018 – 2022. P means the model year is 1993 or 2023. R, S, and T mean 1994 – 1996 or 2024 – 2026. V, W, X, and Y mean 1997 – 2000 or 2027 – 2030. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 indicate the years 2001 – 2009 or 2031 – 2039. A real VIN never contains the letters I, O, or Q. The year code has additional restrictions, never using the number 0 or the letters U or Z. If you're not sure whether your car is new or old, check the vehicle's 7th character. If this is a number, your vehicle's model year is earlier than 2010. If the 7th character is a letter, the model year is 2010 or later (until 2039)."

Try VIN Decoder.net if you're looking for detailed, quickly accessible information. You can try to find a VIN lookup on your car manufacturer's web site, but it's not guaranteed to have one. If your vehicle was manufactured before 1980, it might have a nonstandard VIN. If free lookup websites don't work, try a paid service such as CARFAX, AutoCheck, or VinAudit. These should give you a little information for free, but a full VIN decoding will cost money."

Specialized VIN websites and VIN lookup services exist to see whether your vehicle was involved in an accident, fire, or other damaging situation. You cannot decode this information from a VIN yourself, since the VIN for a vehicle never changes. These services just take advantage of the fact that police and other organizations use the unique VIN to describe a car in accident reports. First, try the free service at The National Insurance Crime Bureau website. If you cannot get information for free online, you may need to pay for a Vehicle History Report. This should be included in the VIN report services described earlier, such as VinAudit's."

Finding out where and when your car was made should be easy, while the other methods may take extra effort. These codes are fully standardized in North America. Elsewhere in the world, most major manufacturers follow the same standards, but they may use the 9th and 10th characters for different purposes. In North America, the 9th must be used as \"checking code\" to confirm the VIN is real, and the 10th must be used to indicate the year the car was made."

For all additional information, such as the make of engine or the exact assembly plant that made the vehicle, you'll need to know the internal system that car manufacturer uses. If you don't know the car manufacturer, you can look it up based on the second character. Look up the most common manufacturer's code online. Try to find a VIN lookup service or the VIN decoding sheets on your car manufacturer's website. Failing that, use a search engine to look for \"VIN decoding sheet\" + \"(name of company)\". This may be difficult or impossible for some manufacturers. Contact the company's support service if they have one and ask about VIN decoding specific to their cars. Ask an auto service shop if you can see their decoding charts. The workers there use the charts to direct the repairs and adjustments they make. [10] X Research source"

Depending on the manufacturer, the third character of your VIN is used either to narrow down the location further to a company division, or to describe the vehicle's type.

Using an online calculator can quickly confirm whether it's a lazy fake, but a smart criminal will use a real sticker from a similar model.

This character can be used in a mathematical calculation to determine whether the VIN is fake, and has no other purpose. Note : The check character will always be a number or the letter X. If it is a different letter, either the VIN was fake, the car was made before 1980 and uses a different standard, or the car was made outside North America and, unusually, the makers decided not to follow the check digit standard.

A and J become 1 B, K, and S become 2 C, L, and T become 3 D, M, and U become 4 E, N, and V become 5 F and W become 6 G, P, and X become 7 H and Y become 8 R and Z become 9 If there is an I, O, or a Q in your VIN, it is fake.

In our example above, the fifth digit of the original VIN is 2 but our remainder is 5 . These numbers are not the same, so the VIN must be fake."
