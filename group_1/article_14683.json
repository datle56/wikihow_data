Men have an array of body types, knowing what fits on yours is crucial to looking great. Clothes that fit your body correctly can make you seem taller, thinner, broader, or more evenly proportioned. If you have broader shoulders and a smaller waist, go with straight or slim cut pants to balance out your proportions. V-neck shirts will help narrow your chest, balancing your body out. When it’s time to wear a jacket or blazer, an unstructured one with slim lapels will widen your torso, without adding too much volume to your shoulders. If you have wider hips and narrower shoulders, focus on straight cut clothing that fits closely to your body. When wearing a blazer, a well structured, single-breasted one will broaden your shoulders and slim your torso. Getting clothes that fit you correctly involves more than just wearing the right size. You have to factor in how the cut of a garment works with your body type as well. Consult a personal stylist to give you advice on what types of colors, cuts, and styles fit your body type the best. Don’t wear something just because you like how it looks. If it doesn’t look good on you, then it’s not right."

The right tie, socks, belts, and shoes tie your whole outfit together. Stick to similar colors and patterns, i.e., brown belt and brown shoes. If you feel so inclined, add some bracelets, necklaces, or earrings. Just don’t overdo it. Smaller items are meant to be small statement pieces, not in the foreground."

      "content": "Dress up for work. When the occasion calls for more of a sophisticated look, like your job, take pride in dressing up. Ditch the wrinkled, oversized button down and pleated khakis. Instead, wear a tailored blazer with chinos or trousers. You can wear a tailored suit and tie, or deconstruct it to go more relaxed. Pair the jacket and tie with dark wash jeans, or forget the tie altogether for a classy, yet carefree look. Your jacket should be cut so that it makes you look slim and gives your torso a nice trapezoid look that’s wider at the shoulders. Your sleeves should come down to your wrist bone so that the cuff of your shirt peeks out about half an inch. Your trousers should drape nicely with clean lines from your waist. Avoid pants that bunch up in the back. Depending on your personal style, you want the break of the pants to just kiss the top of your shoes."

You can easily add, subtract, or swap pieces to change your style instantly. Need to go straight from the office to an after-work event? Wear a blazer, oxford shirt, and chinos. If the office has a stricter dress policy, wear a tie with a tie-clip during work. Then, ditch the tie, and loosen a button on your shirt. Keep the loafers or wingtips on if you’re heading somewhere upscale, or swap them for a pair of clean sneakers if you’re going for drinks. Coordinate your colors to give you a polished look that’s perfect for work and play. Navy and beige work well together. A black blazer pairs perfectly with gray legwear."

Whether it’s the weekend or a day away from the office, take a more relaxed approach. [9] X Expert Source LaTricia Brown Master Tailor & Creative Director Expert Interview. 24 January 2022. Leave the structures of your day job, and your suit for the work week and throw on a sweater or jacket. You want a well-fitting shirt that doesn’t have loud patterns and a crew neck sweater that fits without exposing the buttons underneath or bunching up. Pair with your favorite sneakers and any type of legwear. If you want more of a street look and less of a prep school vibe, swap the sweater out for a denim jacket. Pair the jacket with beige or dark green chinos. If the buttoned up shirt isn’t your style, try layers. Start with a thin henley, and add an overshirt. An unbuttoned overshirt in buffalo check or solid color will add weight to your look and isn’t as heavy as a jacket."

      "content": "Go black tie. Sometimes, an event calls for formal wear, like a gala or wedding. On these occasions, your best look is a suit or tuxedo. While you don’t always have to go all the way, if you’re going to a casual wedding, it’s best to start more formal and work your way down. When wearing a tuxedo, the same rules of tailoring and fit apply. The jacket should be broader at the shoulders and slimmer through the waist. [10] X Research source Slimmer men can stand out with a short peak lapel on a double breasted jacket. The peak lapel has a pointed cut that extends past the collar, giving you a broader look. The notch lapel is perfect for any occasion and any body type. However, a slimmer notch will give you a more fashionable, modern look. The shawl collar is the most formal of the three lapels and is reminiscent of smoking jackets and gentlemen's clubs. You can go more formal by adding a vest under your jacket. Or, take the look down a bit by keeping the vest and taking off the tie."

In these months, dressing like a model can be simple with the right colors and items. If you want the rugged model look, a white or beige t-shirt or henley is a great place to start. Pair with dark blue or black jeans and black boots. Swap out the pants for a a pair of non-pleated shorts that land just above your knee. Take off the boots and put on a pair of loafers, boat shoes, or canvas sneakers. Go bold with statement stripes. Stripes are a staple for spring and summer, and will make you stand out. Pair tailored striped shorts or pants with a solid colored button down, thin long-sleeve shirt, or vise-versa. Try bolder stripes to switch up your look. If you’re broader, go vertical, and if you’re slimmer, horizontal. [11] X Research source You can also sport floral if you’re feeling extra bold. Make your floral piece the focal point of your look, pairing it with subdued neutrals."

Autumn and winter allow you to really show off your runway style because you can add layers for more robust looks. Jackets, sweaters, turtlenecks and darker legwear are some staples to start with. Grey and navy blazers and suits are versatile. Wear as a suit or paired with chinos, jeans, or trousers. If you want to keep warm and still suit up, consider a light vest under your blazer. This is a stylish look that lets you flaunt your wardrobe in the fall without freezing. Dark colored cardigans are a perfect replacement to your suit jacket when the weather turns. If you want some color, opt for mustard yellow, or maroon. If you’re feeling really bold, sport a checked blazer for an upscale English style. Flannel shirts and lighter vests are another great combination for when you feel like a relaxed look. For outer layers, a raincoat, or fitted pea coat are always fashionable. In these colder months, boots are your friend. Hiking boots are great for a weekend cabin look. Chelsea boots can be dressed up with wool trousers, or dressed down with jeans. Brogue and desert boots are versatile enough for anywhere in between. [13] X Research source To complete your look, scarves, leather gloves, and minimal wool hats tie the look together."

      "title": "Wear the right fabrics.",
      "content": "Wear the right fabrics. Depending on the season, you want to incorporate certain fabrics that will keep you cool when it’s warm, and warm when it’s cold. While cotton is a year-round fabric, it really works in the spring and summer. Not only does cotton breathe, but it holds its shape, whatever the type of garment. White or beige lightweight cotton works for a t-shirt, or when you need to dress up, with a blazer. Linen is a durable summer fabric that won’t make you feel like you’re in a sauna. Linen suits are perfect for a summer wedding or cocktail party. Linen knitwear, like a light sweater, can be perfect for those cold mornings and nights. Wool is your most valuable fabric in colder weather. Merino wool sweaters are great when you want an extra layer but need something light. Cashmere is great for pairing with a suit when the occasion calls for more formal dress. Worsted wool suits are best for colder months and add a stylish texture to your look. Flannel is another great option for shirts and trousers. A plaid flannel shirt is a staple for a casual day. Flannel trousers kick up your look a notch and feel extremely comfortable. Try a monochrome palette for a year round street style look. Pick items that stand out more for shape than color. Try a look that’s all black, or gray, or blue. For this look you want to avoid bright “loud” colors."
