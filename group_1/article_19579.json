      "content": "Watch for an itchy red rash 12-48 hours after contact with poison ivy. The rash might appear earlier if you contact a lot of the urushiol oil. You'll only have a rash where the plant's oil touched your skin, so it often appears in a line that resembles small bug bites. [1] X Research source In most cases, the rash disappears in 14-20 days untreated, but can fade faster with treatment. The rash may spread from scratching if you still have oil on your skin. Also check for poison oak rash or poison sumac rash , which are similar to poison ivy rashes and treated in the same manner."

      "content": "Watch for blisters and swelling around the affected area. Blisters are typical symptoms of poison ivy rashes, and can vary from pin-sized to dime-sized. They usually develop within 1 to 14 days after contact with poison ivy. Your blisters may pop and release a clear fluid, but this is normal and won't spread the rash. You'll also have inflammation as a result of the rash, which can cause swelling. [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Resist the urge to pop the blisters; allow them to settle or break on their own to reduce irritation. Poison ivy rashes are often accompanied by more severe swelling than other rashes. If you notice pus on the affected skin, then your rash is likely infected. See a doctor as soon as possible for treatment."

      "content": "Check for rash splotches if a contaminated pet or item touched you. The oil from a poison ivy plant can linger on your pet's fur or on clothing that came in contact with the plant. This lingering oil can also cause rashes. If you suspect your pet or personal items have contacted poison ivy, check yourself for splotchy areas where the items contacted your skin. [3] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Wash any clothes that came in contact with poison ivy immediately and separately. Handle them as little as possible. If your pets come into contact with poison ivy, wash them immediately with shampoo and water. Also wash anything you know they touched, as the irritating oil could remain on the surface. Dogs and other pets don’t typically show symptoms of poison ivy rash, but wash them anyway, and take them to a vet if they show signs of irritation, like licking or scratching.

      "content": "Dab the area with rubbing alcohol to remove the oil, if possible. Rinse the affected skin with rubbing alcohol, or use a soaked cotton swab or an alcohol wipe. It's best to do this within 10 minutes of contacting the plant to avoid a rash, but you can do it later to remove any oil that's lingering on your skin. Don't rub the wipes on areas that didn't contact the oil. You don't want to accidentally spread it. After using gauze or a cotton swab, throw it away. Avoid applying any sort of alcohol to the area around your eyes to avoid irritation."

      "title": "Rinse your affected skin with water as soon as you can.",
      "content": "Rinse your affected skin with water as soon as you can. Run cool water over your affected skin for several minutes, but don't soak the area in still water. After thoroughly rinsing, wash the area with plain, mild soap (in the shower, if possible). Wash off the poison ivy oil as soon as you can to reduce your chances of developing a rash or having the oil spread across a larger area. If possible, use a clean washcloth to scrub the affected area to avoid passing oil between your hands. The water needs to be running in order to remove the oil. If you soak in water, the oil will mix with the water and affect more of your skin. Avoid using hot water, which opens your pores and could cause your skin to absorb more of the oil."

It is a low-growing leafy bush that produces yellow and orange bell-shaped flowers. Mash up some jewelweed to make a paste, then apply it to your rash. Leave it on until it dries, then rinse it away with cool water. Jewelweed helps by countering the oil contained in the poison ivy. It can help you avoid a rash or reduce the intensity of your symptoms. Only use paste you made from the jewelweed itself. Don't rely on extracts and soaps made from jewelweed, which aren't as effective.
