      "content": "Install a video downloader app. There are several apps in the App Store (iPhone and iPad) and the Google Play Store (Android devices) that claim to let you save videos from X. Open the app store on your phone or tablet and search for “X/Twitter video download” to see a few options. Before selecting an app, check the reviews. Some of these apps require you to pay after downloading a certain number of videos, others are glitchy and need to be reinstalled frequently, and some no longer work. Some of the most popular options in the Apple App Store include TW Save, TweetSave, and Video Saver PRO. We tested the TW Save app for this article. Unfortunately, some users report that the popular Download Twitter Videos app for Android no longer works. Some alternative options include Downloader for Twitter (Alpha App Team), Video Downloader for Twitter, and TwiTake. If you're using an Android, you may also be able to download Twitter videos using one of the video downloaders recommended for desktop users."
