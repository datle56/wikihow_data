Admitting the problem is the first major step in dealing with it. If you first recognize the signs of your problem, you can then learn to modify your behavior. Signs and symptoms of a gambling problem include: getting a thrill from taking gambling risks, taking increasingly bigger gambling risks over time, a preoccupation with gambling, reliving past gambling experiences (through imagination or telling stories), using gambling as a way to escape problems or negative feelings, feeling guilt or remorse after gambling, and repeated failed efforts to cut back on gambling. Additional social issues associated with gambling include: taking time away from work or family life to gamble, concealing or lying about gambling, and borrowing money or stealing to gamble."

Gambling excessively can cause many issues including: relationship problems, financial issues, legal problems, occupational concerns (job loss), substance use, poor health, and mental health issues (such as depression). Do you lose time from work to gamble? Do you extend yourself beyond your means by gambling away money that you have set aside to pay your rent, mortgage, or other bills? Do you use credit cards to gamble? Are you secretive about where the money's gone to after you've gambled? Make a list of all of the consequences you have encountered due to your gambling. Also, identify people you have hurt as a result of your gambling such as family and friends."

Pay bills immediately, when you have funds set aside to pay them. Add up losses and keep a running tally. When you've added up losses from a gambling session, list the things that you might have purchased with that money, or other debts you could have paid down. Admit it to yourself and others when you have gambled."

      "content": "Identify your triggers and cope with them. Knowing what your triggers to gambling are can help you become better at dealing with your impulse to gamble. Triggers are thoughts, feelings, situations, and behaviors which make you want to gamble. For example, being around friends who gamble is a powerful trigger for many gamblers. Identify your triggers by keeping a thought journal. When you have the desire to gamble, stop at that moment and write down your thoughts (possible trigger such as thinking about gambling), feelings (perhaps boredom which is a trigger to gambling), and ways you are going to cope with your trigger. Do negative emotions such as stress or sadness lead to your gambling? If so, you may need to learn better ways to deal with these emotions. Do you often gamble when you are looking for excitement? If so, boredom could be a big trigger for you. You may need to keep yourself busy or engage in other exciting (and safe) activities to fulfill your need for a thrill. Try listening to music. Music may help calm and relax you in order to reduce impulsivity and deal with triggers to gamble. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't put yourself in a position to gamble. An individual with a gambling problem cannot gamble sensibly because the addict may be hooked on the adrenaline rush associated with \"the chase.\" It is difficult to be in control if you are preoccupied with the feeling you get from an activity. If friends suggest a trip to the casino, be honest with yourself and with others about the fact that, for you, gambling has gone beyond being recreational. Suggest another activity or opt out of this particular one. At the earlier stages of recovery, avoid even driving past a gambling hall. Avoid going to places that encourage gambling such as Las Vegas, Nevada. If you surround yourself with gambling it can make it very difficult to resist the urge to make a bet."

      "title": "Change your thinking about gambling.",
      "content": "Change your thinking about gambling. Negative thinking habits such as irrational beliefs, the illusion of control, and the gamblers fallacy can lead to increases in gambling behaviors. [7] X Research source Reduce these negative thoughts by identifying them and modifying them. The illusion of control is common in people who gamble. It is the belief that you can somehow control the outcome of the game. In order to counter this thought, remind yourself that no strategy or trick can control the outcome; it is impossible to control the game (whether it be cards, online poker, betting on a sports game or horse race, or using slot machines). Each throw of the dice is independent and random. The gamblers fallacy is when someone believes that a random event is less likely to happen due to a previous event. For example, a person may believe that his chances of losing a game of cards is less likely because he just lost; therefore, he believes it is more likely that he will win this time around. However, statistically speaking, the odds are exactly the same as before. Superstitious thinking is also a common thinking habit associated with gambling. You may believe that random incidents have meaning. For example, if you are betting at the horse race track, perhaps you always pick a certain horse with a particular name because you believe it is lucky. Remind yourself that superstitious thinking occurs due to random events that occur together; it does not actually mean something is lucky. Reduce risk-taking behaviors by thinking logically about the consequences and outcome of the situation. When you want to gamble, think about how much money you have lost and are likely to lose if you make a bet. [8] X Research source"

Planning on what to tell yourself when you feel the urge to gamble can help ensure that you have a strategy when the time comes; this strategy can help you limit or eradicate your gambling. [9] X Research source You can start by telling yourself, “It is too risky to gamble. I know that if I start I won’t be able to stop. I need to avoid it altogether.” Explore different ideas of things to tell yourself and pick the ones that work best for you. You can write them down on index cards if you are likely to forget them. Then you can take them out and read them out loud when you have the urge to gamble."

Your gambling may be out of control if: it's affecting your relationships, finances, or work or school life, you're devoting more and more time and energy to gambling, you've unsuccessfully tried to stop or cut back on your gambling, you try to conceal your gambling from family or others, you resort to theft or fraud to get gambling money, or if you ask others to bail you out of financial woes because you've gambled money away. These types of issues can add up, and professional help is out there if you are open to it. Contact your health insurance for a list of approved therapists. If you do not have health insurance you can conduct a search for low-cost, sliding scale, or free mental health clinics in your neighborhood. Ask questions of your therapist such as: What's the best approach to my gambling problem? Should I see a psychiatrist, psychologist, addiction counselor or other mental health provider?
