      "title": "Dress at least as well as those employed in your position.",
      "content": "Dress at least as well as those employed in your position. If at all possible, you should see how people in the position you are applying for dress on the job. Follow their precedent. Dress at least as well as them. For lower level positions you probably want to even dress a bit better than the standard work attire, though this is not so much the case for higher level positions, because you also want to refrain from being ostentatious. [1] X Research source It is not common for bank tellers to wear a suit jacket when working. However, if you are interviewing to be a teller, you should. This is also true for women who should wear either a skirt suit or a pantsuit. Ask the recruiter about the dress code required for the interview."

      "title": "Dress conservatively.",
      "content": "Dress conservatively. Although bankers dress professionally, they are not fashionistas. Dressing in a way that would attract too much attention or make you stand out will work against you. [2] X Research source One of the most common objections at interviews is smell. Wearing too much perfume or cologne can be a distraction and is frowned upon. Wear little if any. Leave the bling at home. Ostentatious watches can create feelings of jealousy. Similarly large, showy jewelry is generally not considered appropriate. Wear something small and simple or nothing at all. Donâ€™t try to exploit your sex appeal. It is not considered appropriate to dress in a provocative way. Wear little makeup and stick to shades that are more or less natural. [3] X Research source Stick to simple patterns, if any. Usually ties, suits, shirts, and dresses of a single, conservative color are best. Refrain from bright colors or complex patterns."

      "content": "Clean up. For a banking job you will want to devote less time to finding unique attire than to keeping what you have immaculate. Pay close attention to wrinkles, stains, scuffs, and your own personal hygiene. Banking is about paying attention to detail. Your attire should convey your abilities in that regard. Iron everything that you wear to get out wrinkles. If there are any stains or imperfections in your attire, wear something else. Shoes matter a lot in the banking world. Have your shoes professionally waxed. If there are scuffs, signs of wear and tear, or if the heels are falling off, buy a new pair. Get a professional haircut and manicure. Your hair should be short and you should be clean shaven. Women should have gray hair colored. Wear clear nail polish or none at all. Remove body piercings and hide tattoos. These are becoming more acceptable in certain institutions, but until you find out otherwise, assume that they are not considered proper professional attire. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Stick to the standards for men. Men in the banking world are typically expected to wear a handful of items. Usually these items are even expected to be of a standard color. These are as follows: Wear a business suit that is gray or navy blue. Stick to a blue, green or red silk tie without patterns. The tie should come down to your belt buckle. Do not let it hang below the waist or sit far above it. Stick to a standard knot, like a Windsor. [5] X Research source The prototypical shirt in the banking world is a long-sleeve white shirt. Light pastel colors are increasingly considered acceptable as well. If you go this route, be sure that it matches with the tie.

      "content": "Ask about casual days. Ask about casual days within the company or bank branch. On casual days it's often appropriate to wear clothes that would otherwise be considered too casual for the banking industry. Casual Fridays are not as common as they once were, but they do exist even in high-level investment banks. Barclays has instituted a policy whereby jeans and t-shirts are acceptable on Fridays. Jeans and t-shirts, however, are generally considered too casual even for a casual Friday. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep everything neat. You should dress for a bank job neatly, cleanly and conservatively. Iron out any wrinkles, tuck in your shirt and don't wear anything stained or ripped.

      "content": "Wear clothes that are an appropriate length. Check shirts and sweaters to ensure that they cover your stomach and midriff without exposing too much cleavage. Be sure that your skirts are an appropriate length for the workplace by not wearing any that don't at least reach your fingertips when your hands are down at your sides. Anything shorter, or with a slit that goes higher, isn't appropriate for work attire."

For any higher ranking position, assume that you should wear a suit jacket and that your attire should vary little from what you wore during your interview."
