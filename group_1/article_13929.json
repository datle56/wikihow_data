      "content": "Host a giveaway on social media instead if you can’t do an online raffle. A giveaway is when you offer an item for free in exchange for shares on social media. Giveaways are often hosted in order to get more likes or followers, to generate brand awareness, or to increase sales. To start a giveaway, pick an item you want to promote and write a post asking your followers or friends to like the post, share it on their page, and/or comment with a number between a certain range in order to pick a winner. [3] X Research source By typing a number between 1 and 1,000, for instance, you can use a random number generator to pick a winner fairly and honestly. You can pick any number range you'd like. For example, if you make jewelry, you can host a necklace giveaway to get people to share your items and increase traffic on your website. You can host a giveaway on social media such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. However, if you want to do a giveaway through Facebook, you must have a Facebook page to host the giveaway, rather than a personal Facebook page."

We are hosting a raffle for a Pittsburgh Steelers signed jersey to help generate donations, and each ticket costs $3.” If you are hosting a giveaway for artwork on your Instagram page, write something like, “I am an artist living in Portland, OR looking to give back to my followers. By sharing and liking this post, you are entered to win an original 8x10 painting. Comment with a number between 1-500 for a chance to win.” If you’d like, list your fundraising goal. For instance, if you want to raise $10,000 for a personal operation, list that on your raffle website. If you want to gain 500 followers, write that in your Facebook post."
