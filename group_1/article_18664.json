Remove the wet sheets as soon as the cycle ends. Do not place them in the dryer. Instead, let them air dry either by hanging or in the sun. Treat the blood stains again if they do not come out after the first wash cycle. You will need to continue treating and washing until the blood is no longer visible. Once you get the blood out, you can dry the sheets as you normally would. Consider using bleach on white sheets. [5] X Research source"

Follow this step with any of the stain-removal treatments listed below. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that the stain may be permanent, especially if it has been through the dryer. Heat sets stains, so if you put your stained bed sheets into the dryer, the blood may have been baked into the fabric."
