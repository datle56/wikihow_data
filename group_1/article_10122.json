      "content": "Take a deep breath and stay calm. Though you may find it difficult to handle being around an annoying person, you should strive to maintain your composure and stay calm. Getting angry, upset, or frustrated may only ruin your day and have no real effect on how that person is behaving. Rather than let your emotions get the best of you, try to take deep breaths and remain calm. [1] X Research source You may try doing deep breathing exercises, where you close your eyes and inhale deeply in your nose from your diaphragm, followed by a deep exhale out your nose. You may do deep breathing a few times to calm down and block out the annoying person."

Put yourself in their shoes for a second and consider why or how they may have become so annoying. Be empathetic toward the person and show them some compassion. Doing this may help you remain calm and composed around them. [3] X Research source For example, perhaps the person who is always pointing out the negatives of every situation did not have a very happy childhood and tends to see only the worst possible outcomes. Or maybe the family member who is often too happy and excited about everything is in fact lonely and isolated in their social life, leading them to try to always project a sense of happiness."

      "content": "Prepare some stock lines to say to the person. When you encounter this person, you may be so frustrated that you end up saying something that hurts his or her feelings.

I don't know the first thing about that!” “It was nice to see you, but I have to run!” “I'm sorry. I don't have time to talk right now. Maybe some other time.” [4] X Research source"

You may ask yourself, “What does the person do that annoys me so much?” or “What is it about this person that I find irritating?” You may then able to address the issue once you are aware of what it is. [5] X Research source For example, you may be annoyed by the fact that your co-worker always comes into meetings late and appears disorganized in front of clients. You may then realize that you are annoyed by her behavior overall and how unprofessional she is acting.

You may ask the person if you can speak to them privately after work or call them and ask to talk to them in private. Try to speak to them in person, if possible. Always use “I” statements and avoid placing blame or accusing the person. For example, \"I feel\" or \"I think.\" You may start the discussion by saying, “Listen, I need to let you know that I am feeling annoyed at your behavior.” You may then expand your thoughts and be honest about why you are annoyed by the person. You may say, “I feel as though your tardiness to meetings and your disorganization is reflecting badly on our team and the company as a whole. I am concerned that you are coming across as unprofessional to clients.” Or, you may say to your family member, \"I feel as though you are not being considerate of others and are only focusing on your needs. I am concerned that you are not being as aware of others and their issues as you could be.\""

You may want to reach out to a superior at work, such as a Human Resources representative, a close friend or another family member, and ask them to support you if the conversation gets too intense. [7] X Research source You should try to enlist support leading up to the conversation with the person who annoys you as well, as your co-workers or friends may be able to give you suggestions on how to address the issue.

You may try to limit the amount of time you spend with the person, such as only chatting to them briefly in the morning at work and leaving the office for lunch. Or you may only answer their calls or texts when you have free time rather than answering them right away. You may also try to remain calm and detached when they speak to in meetings or social situations where you cannot excuse yourself. Doing this can set up personal boundaries for you to help you cope with the person's irritating nature. For example, if the annoying person starts talking too loudly at a family dinner, you may try to stay detached and focus on something else in your mind. This will allow you to block out the person and stay calm."

You should also keep your arms relaxed and by your sides. Avoid responding to the person with a passive aggressive comment or a snide remark. Instead, say something simple and polite like, “Thank you for sharing that with me” or “Sounds great.”"
