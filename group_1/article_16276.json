    {
      "title": "Examine the overall quality of the shoe.",
      "content": "Examine the overall quality of the shoe. Real Gucci slides are designed to prevent blisters while balancing style and comfort. Authentic slides will have seamless edges, while fakes will have coarse and abrasive lines. The rough strap will chafe against your skin, and the foot-bed will taper off toward the bottom rather than maintaining the symmetry associated with the real shoe. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check the strap’s finish and colors.",
      "content": "Check the strap’s finish and colors. Real Gucci slides feature a vibrant green and red strap with a matte finish. Fakes, on the other hand, often have duller, muted colors and a glossy sheen, which makes the material look cheaper. Real slides also have a grainy, textured black outline on the straps, while counterfeits are usually very smooth. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for a smooth line and embossing on the heel.",
      "content": "Look for a smooth line and embossing on the heel. Examine the heel from the side and locate the line beneath it. A real Gucci slide has a smooth, faint line while a counterfeit has a thick, bold line. Pay attention to the embossing of the “Gucci” lettering, as well; real shoes will appear sleek and flat, while fakes will be chunky and more pronounced. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the quality of the side font.",
      "content": "Inspect the quality of the side font. On a fake slide, the “Gucci” lettering on the side of the shoe will look flat and less bold than that of the real shoes. The fake leather of the embossing may look like it will peel off at any moment, as well. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the pattern on the bottom of the shoe.",
      "content": "Examine the pattern on the bottom of the shoe. Real Gucci slides have an intricate and detailed design on the sole, which counterfeits struggle to replicate. While the pattern may be there, it won’t be as detailed as the real shoe. Oftentimes, fake Gucci slides have a darker blue sole than authentic slides, as well. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the spacing on the logo.",
      "content": "Check the spacing on the logo. The bottom of your slides should feature a logo that reads “Gucci: made in Italy.” The authentic letters are large, sleek, and spaced out, while the fake letters appear smaller, denser, and squished together. [6] X Research source All Gucci products feature the “made in Italy” label. If your slides do not, that’s an automatic sign they’re fake."

    {
      "title": "Examine the box and dust bag.",
      "content": "Examine the box and dust bag. If the slides you’re buying come with a box, use it to further determine if the shoes are real. Gucci has currently only used two box designs: their famous brown box and the classic black-and-white box. Examine real Gucci boxes to compare the details to yours. Similarly, many Gucci shoes come with brown or black-and-white dust bags which can be examined in the same way. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy from an official Gucci store.",
      "content": "Buy from an official Gucci store. The easiest way to ensure you’re buying an authentic product is to buy directly from the brand. Visit a Gucci store if there’s one in your area, or shop online at their official website. Gucci guarantees all products bought from their store are authentic. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Expect to pay a high price.",
      "content": "Expect to pay a high price. Remember, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Gucci is a luxury brand and all of their items are made from high-quality materials. Depending on the style of the slide, expect to pay anywhere from several hundred to over a thousand dollars. Anything cheaper than this is probably counterfeit. [9] X Research source Sometimes, counterfeiters will price their items at the same or higher price as authentic Gucci. Be sure to carefully examine any products before buying. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make sure the material is high-quality.",
      "content": "Make sure the material is high-quality. If you aren’t buying directly from Gucci, try the slides on, if possible, so you can determine how they feel. If you can’t try them on, compare the product to high-quality images of real Gucci slides so you can see if there are any differences. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Research reputable sellers if buying secondhand.",
      "content": "Research reputable sellers if buying secondhand. If it’s not possible for you to buy directly from Gucci, don’t buy the first pair of slides you find. Take some time to research different sellers and read their reviews and ratings. If they have a long history of selling reputable items, it’s probably okay to purchase the slides. Most reputable sellers also offer a return policy and will be willing to answer any questions you have about the authenticity of their product. [12] X Research source Pay attention to other items the seller offers. If they have multiples of the exact same product, it’s likely the items are counterfeit or stolen."

      "title": "Verify the serial number or authenticity card on Gucci’s website.",
      "content": "Verify the serial number or authenticity card on Gucci’s website. Most authentic Gucci products come with a unique serial number and/or authenticity card to prove that they’re real Gucci. If you have the serial number or card, visit Gucci’s website and verify them with the product listed or contact customer service for assistance. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Scan the item on Gucci’s app.",
      "content": "Scan the item on Gucci’s app. Many Gucci products now come with an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag embedded in the material. This tag contains the product’s identification number and provides information about its manufacturing history. If your product has an RFID tag, download the Gucci app, tap the “My Gucci” icon, and access the “Gucci tag” section. From there, scan the back of the item to access the authenticity page. [14] X Research source Note that this is a relatively new service, and not all products have an RFID tag. These are most commonly found in purses and bags."

If you’re not having any luck authenticating your Gucci products on your own, there are many professional services that authenticate designer products. Do some research online to find a reliable service, like Real Authentication , that can confirm whether your Gucci slides or other Gucci products are real. [15] X Research source"
