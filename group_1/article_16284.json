      "content": "Complain about missing your period in the days before your prank. Your prank will be more convincing if you tell the person you’ve missed your period. Begin mentioning your skipped period several days before you plan to tell them you’re pregnant. [1] X Research source Say something like, “Wow, my period was supposed to come 2 days ago. I hope it comes soon, so I won’t be on it during Karen’s pool party.” If the person you’re pranking doesn’t respond to your casual comment, follow up with another comment. For instance, “I’m getting worried about my period not coming. Do you think something might be wrong?”"

      "title": "Pretend to have morning sickness by faking nausea and vomiting.",
      "content": "Pretend to have morning sickness by faking nausea and vomiting . Morning sickness is a common symptom of early pregnancy that most people will recognize. Excuse yourself and run to the bathroom, then pour water into the toilet to mimic the sound of vomiting. You could also pretend to gag since that sounds like you're vomiting. Additionally, “cope” with your fake symptoms by snacking on crackers, drinking club soda, and eating smaller meals. [2] X Research source Dab some water on your forehead after you pretend to vomit to make it look like you’re sweating from the effort of vomiting. Strong odor is a common cause of nausea in women who really are pregnant. Whenever you smell a strong odor, tell everyone you feel nauseous."

      "title": "Visit the restroom often to pretend you’re urinating frequently.",
      "content": "Visit the restroom often to pretend you’re urinating frequently. When you get pregnant, your body produces more blood, which means your kidneys filter out more fluids. These fluids become urine, so you have to use the restroom more often. Excuse yourself at least once every hour to use the restroom. Additionally, complain about having to go so often. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Say, “I’m so tired of going to the bathroom. I feel like I live in there,” or “I feel like I need to pee all of the time. I hope I’m not pregnant.” You don't need to actually go to the bathroom if you don't need to; you can just leave the room and lie that you're going to the bathroom. If you do this, however, only spend about three to five minutes out of the room. Any longer and they might think you're doing a \"number two\", and any less and they might realise you're lying."

      "title": "Act like your breasts are swollen and tender.",
      "content": "Act like your breasts are swollen and tender. Hormonal fluctuations in the early weeks of pregnancy can make your breasts feel painful even before you know you’re pregnant. Mention this discomfort to the person you’re planning to prank. You might even put a warm compress over your chest to “relieve” the pain. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you live with the person, make a point of taking your bra off while you’re at home. Say, “My breasts are too uncomfortable for me to wear this bra. I feel like they’re more swollen than usual.”"

      "title": "Pretend to feel tired all of the time.",
      "content": "Pretend to feel tired all of the time. When you get pregnant, your body makes more progesterone, which makes you feel tired. That means you’ll start feeling fatigued even in the early days of a pregnancy. Pretend to have fatigue by telling everyone you’re tired. Additionally, you might take naps or fake falling asleep in the middle of the day. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t pretend to sleep at work or school, as this can get you in trouble. Say something like, “I shouldn’t feel this tired because I slept for 9 hours last night. I wonder what’s wrong.” Other people may assume you're sick since feeling tired can also be a sign of illness. If someone thinks you're sick, point out that you don't have a fever."

      "content": "Fake being emotional and weepy to mimic mood swings. Because pregnancy causes so many hormonal fluctuations, it often causes mood swings. You can fake mood swings by pretending to cry during commercials or after seeing a sad meme. Additionally, you might fake anger over minor problems and then pretend to cry . [6] X Research source For example, show the person a GIF of a cute dog. Then, pretend to cry uncontrollably, saying, “He’s just so cute.”"

      "title": "Pretend to crave weird food combinations.",
      "content": "Pretend to crave weird food combinations. While cravings don’t usually start in the first few weeks of pregnancy, they’re an easily recognizable symptom of pregnancy. If you pretend to want weird foods, the person you’re pranking will likely wonder if you may be pregnant. Ask for treats like pickles and ice cream , or request peanut butter as a topping for your corn dog. If you don’t have a strong stomach, prepare your own smoothie and then tell the person it has a lot of weird ingredients. [7] X Research source You might say, “Mmm...this smoothie is so good. I put pickles and anchovies in it because I’ve been craving them so much.”"

      "title": "Buy a fake pregnancy test for the easiest option.",
      "content": "Buy a fake pregnancy test for the easiest option. Joke pregnancy tests are the best option because they give you a false positive every time. To use the test, bring it into the bathroom and urinate on it like a real test. Wait for the result, then show it to the person you’re pranking. You can find fake pregnancy tests online or at a local joke shop. Make sure you read and follow the directions for the test you buy so that it works correctly. If you end up needing to actually urinate on the joke test, make sure it doesn't contaminate anything, and wash your hands after throwing it away."

      "title": "Dip a pregnancy test into a cup of Coke or Pepsi.",
      "content": "Dip a pregnancy test into a cup of Coke or Pepsi. Some ingredients used to make sodas mimic pregnancy hormones, so they can give a false positive on a pregnancy test. Bring a soda with you into the bathroom when you go to take the test. Then, dip the test into the soda instead of urinating on it. Hide the soda before opening the bathroom door. Since you may be asked to take a second test to confirm your pregnancy, hide an extra soda in the bathroom in case you need it. Put it somewhere others are unlikely to look, like inside your makeup kit or a box of tampons."

      "title": "Open the test and draw a line to create a positive result.",
      "content": "Open the test and draw a line to create a positive result. Most pregnancy tests have a separate piece of plastic for the front and back side. Use a thin piece of metal, like a pair of tweezers or a metal nail file, to pry the front off of the pregnancy test. Then, use a marker that’s close to the same color as the test results to draw in a line to create a positive result. Next, dab some water onto the test to make it look like you peed on it and put the test back together. A light pink marker will be your best option. The results may look better if you draw on all of the lines. This also eliminates the need for you to actually pee on the test. In addition to making the test look used, wetting it also helps fade the marker so it looks more real."

      "title": "Take the test at least an hour before the prank so your urine evaporates.",
      "content": "Take the test at least an hour before the prank so your urine evaporates. Most pregnancy tests only produce accurate results for a few minutes. After that point, the urine starts to evaporate from the pad, making the lines look darker. This often creates a false positive. Use this to your advantage by taking your test at least an hour in advance. Once the result looks like a positive, bring it into the bathroom and pretend to take it. [8] X Research source This may not always work, but it’s a common cause of false positives on pregnancy tests."

      "title": "Try an expired pregnancy test to get a false positive result.",
      "content": "Try an expired pregnancy test to get a false positive result. An expired pregnancy test can also give a false positive, but finding one might be tricky. Ask your friends if they have an old pregnancy test that they could give you, or check a site like eBay to see if someone is selling an old test. You might also find one at a discount dollar or thrift store. [9] X Research source The expiration date is printed on the pregnancy test box. This may not work every time, but it’s common for expired tests to give a false positive."

      "title": "Get a pregnant friend to give you a urine sample.",
      "content": "Get a pregnant friend to give you a urine sample. Although this is a little icky, it will guarantee that you get a positive test result. Ask your pregnant friend to pee into an airtight container, like a jar. Then, bring the sample into your bathroom when you take the test so you can dip the test into the collected urine. Be careful that you don’t get urine on yourself. You may be able to use the same sample to fake multiple tests."
