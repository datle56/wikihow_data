Remember that you'll be crouching, climbing, bending, and moving a lot to see the animals, so you'll want to avoid tight pants that could rip and short skirts, dresses, and shorts that could ride up. Since you'll be surrounded by families with young children, it's probably best to avoid anything see-through, overly revealing, or featuring offensive language. If you're going on a date or have plans before or after and find that dressing comfortably isn't as fashionable as you'd like, consider bringing a change of clothes and leaving it in the car."
