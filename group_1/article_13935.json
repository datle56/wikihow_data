      "title": "Hold the coin between the tips of your fingers and thumb of your left hand.",
      "content": "Hold the coin between the tips of your fingers and thumb of your left hand. Use a coin that’s the size of a quarter or larger for your trick since it will be harder to perform the trick with something small. Hold your left palm face-up and pinch the coin horizontally between your index finger, middle finger, and thumb. Hold the coin up so your audience can see it clearly in your hand. You can also hold the coin on your right hand if you want. If you want to add more performance to your trick, ask a member of your audience for a coin so they feel more involved. If you don’t have a coin, you can also use a small ball or similarly-sized object instead."

      "title": "Reach your right hand over the coin to conceal it.",
      "content": "Reach your right hand over the coin to conceal it. Hold your left hand and the coin out in front of you and quickly reach over with your right hand. Make sure your right palm faces you as you reach over or else it will be difficult to conceal your next movement. Slide the thumb of your right hand underneath the coin and place your fingers over it to hide it from the audience. This movement will make it look like you’re about to grab the coin. Don’t linger too long on concealing the coin or else your audience may catch onto the trick and won’t be fooled by it."

    {
      "title": "Drop the coin into your left palm.",
      "content": "Drop the coin into your left palm. At the same time you’re concealing the coin, pretend to grab it with your right hand. Instead of taking the coin, let it fall into your left palm. As you drop the coin, make both of your hands into fists to hide the coin from your audience and make it seem like you took the coin. Keep the coin pinched in your palm tightly so it doesn’t fall out of your left hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull your right hand away and follow it with your eyes.",
      "content": "Pull your right hand away and follow it with your eyes. Once the coin drops into your left palm, move your right hand toward the right side of your body and hold it up by your head. As you bring your hand up, watch it the entire time so your audience follows your gaze. This will help distract them from your left hand, which is still holding the coin. Lower your left hand toward your side quickly so your audience doesn’t pay attention to it. Don’t pay any attention to your left hand after you “grab” the coin since your audience will look at it if you are."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open your right hand slowly to show that it’s empty.",
      "content": "Open your right hand slowly to show that it’s empty. Clench your fist tighter so it appears like you’re crushing the coin in your palm. Slowly raise your fingers one at a time to reveal that the coin has disappeared. Your audience will think that you grabbed the coin and made it disappear as long as you don’t draw any attention to your left hand. Try the trick in front of a mirror or a small audience when you’re first starting so you can build up confidence and make the trick look natural."

    {
      "title": "Drop the coin into your pocket to reveal it’s not in your left hand either.",
      "content": "Drop the coin into your pocket to reveal it’s not in your left hand either. After you “grab” the coin and move your right hand away, move your left hand with the coin to your side. As you focus on your right hand, discreetly open your palm and drop the coin into a pants pocket. That way, at the end of your trick, you can open your left hand to show that the coin isn’t there either. It may take a few tries to drop the coin in a pocket without anyone noticing. A heavier coin may make the fabric on your pants move when you drop it into your pocket."

      "content": "Tap your right hand with a magic wand to add more visuals to your trick. Before you perform your trick, practice gripping the coin in your palm so it doesn’t fall out when you use your hand. After you “grab” the coin with your right hand, grab a magic wand or stick on a table in front of you with your left hand, being careful not to show or drop the coin. Tap on your right hand a few times with the tip of the wand before opening your fist. [1] X Research source Don’t make a big deal of grabbing the magic wand. Instead, focus on your right hand so your audience pays attention to it."

      "title": "Make the coin reappear behind someone else’s ear to surprise your audience.",
      "content": "Make the coin reappear behind someone else’s ear to surprise your audience. Once you “grab” the coin with your right hand, hold your right fist out for an audience member and ask them to blow on it. When the audience member blows on your fist, open your right hand to reveal the coin is missing. Pretend like you notice something behind the audience member’s left ear, and reach with your left hand. Move the coin to your fingertips and pull the coin out to show to your audience. [2] X Research source This trick works best with a small group or one-on-one since other people may notice you moving the coin. Practice your trick a few times so you’re able to do it fluidly when you perform in front of people."
