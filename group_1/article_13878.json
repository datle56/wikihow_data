      "title": "Choose a small sock that matches your hair.",
      "content": "Choose a small sock that matches your hair. You’ll need a clean sock that you don’t mind ruining. With short hair, it’s especially important to choose a sock that isn’t too long, such as an ankle or quarter length style. Go with one that’s a similar color to your hair too, so it won’t stand out if any of it peeks through. [1] X Research source A sock with very firm elastic at the top works best because it will help keep the bun securely on your head. You can also use pantyhose by cutting off one leg and removing the toe area. Roll this into a donut shape that you can mold your hair around. Pantyhose can provide a nice match to your hair because they come in many colors."

      "title": "Cut the toe off the sock.",
      "content": "Cut the toe off the sock. With a pair of scissors, snip off the toe of the sock. Your goal is to create a tube of fabric that you can easily slip your hair through. After you’ve removed the toe, turn the sock inside out. [2] X Research source You only have to cut off enough of the sock to open it up. However, if you only have a long sock, you may want to cut off a little more so it fits your short hair better."

      "content": "Fold up the sock to form a donut. Once the sock is inside out, begin rolling it up from the toe to the elastic. Continue rolling it until the sock forms a thick donut that you can slip your hair through. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush out your hair.",
      "content": "Brush out your hair. With short hair, you want the pieces to be as smooth as possible so they lay well in the bun. Use your favorite brush or comb to smooth out your hair and get rid of any tangles. If you’re going for a messier, more textured bun, you can skip the brushing. Spraying your hair with dry shampoo can add texture and make your hair easier to work with."

      "title": "Apply some gel to your hair.",
      "content": "Apply some gel to your hair. The bits and pieces of short hair will lay more smoothly in the bun if you apply some product before you style it. Work a small bit of gel or serum through your hair with your fingers to keep the short pieces up and secure when you create the bun. [4] X Research source Gel tends to provide a wet look. If you’d prefer a dry look, try a non-aerosol hairspray instead. You can spritz it on your hair, and then smooth any loose pieces in place."

      "title": "Pull your hair up into a ponytail.",
      "content": "Pull your hair up into a ponytail. Gather your hair together as you would for a traditional ponytail. Don’t pull the hair up too tight, but secure it with an elastic at the back or top of your head. [5] X Research source The spot that you place the ponytail is where the bun will wind up. While a traditional top knot it usually positioned at the top of the head, you can go for a low or side bun if you prefer. If some stray hairs fall loose from the ponytail, don’t worry. You can take care of those after you’ve created the bun."

    {
      "title": "Pull the ponytail through the sock donut.",
      "content": "Pull the ponytail through the sock donut. After you’ve secured your ponytail, grab your sock donut and slide your hair through the center. Move the donut all the way to the base of the pony and then pull it back down so there are only a few inches of hair on the other side of the sock. [6] X Research source If you hair is extremely short, you may be better off pushing the sock donut all the way to the base of the ponytail. Instead of rolling your hair into the bun, simply divide the end of the pony into several pieces and wrap them around the sock to hide it. Pin the hair in place to secure it."

      "content": "Split your ponytail into several sections and tuck them under the sock. While holding the sock donut in place at the end of your ponytail with one hand, use your other hand to divide your hair into three or four sections. Wrap each one around the sock and tuck the ends under of the donut to secure them. [7] X Research source Spread the sections evenly over the donut. You may even wish to backcomb them slightly, then smooth out the top surface before you pin."

      "content": "Roll the sock up toward the base of your ponytail. With the ends of the ponytail tucked under the sock, slowly begin to roll the sock to the base of your pony. Use both hands to roll so you can keep the hair in place as you go. [8] X Research source As you roll up the sock, your hair will be wrapped around it to hide it. If there are any gaps, you can move the hair around to cover the fabric once you’ve secured the bun."

If the elastic is tight enough, the bun may stay all by itself. Especially with short hair, though, use some bobby pins to secure it. [9] X Research source"
