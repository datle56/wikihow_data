    {
      "title": "Sketch the children’s heads as an oval.",
      "content": "Sketch the children’s heads as an oval. Draw an oval with guidelines on the right side of the paper. Draw another, slightly rounder oval with guidelines to the left of this, leaving plenty of space between them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch the bodies and body positions using geometric shapes.",
      "content": "Sketch the bodies and body positions using geometric shapes. Draw a vertical rectangle for the torso and a horizontal rectangle for the lower body, connected to each other and the head by a curved line (like a spine). Draw straight lines for the hands and legs, with circles for joints, and rectangles for the hands and feet. Make a taller body for the right head than for the left head, since this is the older sister/friend of the pair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create the shape of the body on the sketched “skeleton.\"",
      "content": "Create the shape of the body on the sketched “skeleton.\" Draw the face and ears, but don't include features like the eyes and mouth just yet. Add the rest of the body to the “skeleton.” Don't detail the hands or feet too much at this step (same as the faces)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the child’s eyes, nose, and mouth.",
      "content": "Draw the child’s eyes, nose, and mouth. Start with the girl on the right: Make big eyes (following the horizontal guideline) and eyebrows above them, with a small triangular shape for the nose and a horizontal curved line for the mouth. Give her a bob hairstyle with bangs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give the smaller girl eyes, a nose, and a mouth.",
      "content": "Give the smaller girl eyes, a nose, and a mouth. However, make her eyes bigger and for the nose draw a flat oval. Change the hairstyle as well. Draw bangs and shoulder-length hair. If you want your girls to be sisters or very close friends, you can actually give them more similar hair/facial expressions--it's all about the choices you make for your drawing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add details to the girls’ clothes and hands.",
      "content": "Add details to the girls’ clothes and hands. Then, carefully erase the “skeleton” lines. Draw a sleeveless dress for the bigger girl and a dress with short sleeves for the smaller girl. Add collars for both of them, but draw them in different styles. Make crinkles on both dresses. Finish up with the shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strengthen the lines and add color.",
      "content": "Strengthen the lines and add color. Darken the children’s outline. Then, use the illustration as a reference, or color them as you wish. When you’re done, carefully erase all the sketch lines."
