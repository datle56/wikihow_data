      "content": "Measure the dimensions of the floor you’re covering. An accurate measurement is important so you buy enough canvas to cover the whole floor. Use a ruler or tape measure and measure the length and width of the room. Then multiply those 2 measurements together to calculate the floor area. If you measure 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m), the area is 100 square feet (9.3 m 2 ). If you’re covering more than one room, make sure to measure each room individually. Canvas is usually sold in square yards, so translate your measurements into yards. If you measured in feet, divide the square footage by 3. For example, 100 square feet (9.3 m 2 ) is 33.3 square yards (27.8 m 2 )."

      "content": "Order white or decorated canvas from a fabric store. Decide what kind of fabric you’d like to cover your floor with. The design is up to you. If you want to decorate the canvas yourself, order a blank white roll. Otherwise, find a design you like and buy that one. Bring your measurements to the store with you so you remember how much canvas to buy. Depending on the size of your floor, you may be able to buy one large sheet that will cover the carpet. Otherwise, you can buy a roll of material and lay several sheets across the floor. If this is the case, you'll need an additional 2 inches (5.1 cm) for each sheet so you can overlap them."

      "content": "Cut the fabric to fit the room. Roll out the fabric and measure the length of the room on the fabric. Add another inch (2.54 cm) to make sure the cloth covers the whole carpet. Then use a pencil and straightedge to draw a straight line across this point. Use a sharp pair of scissors and cut along this line. Repeat this for as many fabric sheets as you need. For example, if your floor is 10 feet (3.0 m) long, make a mark at 10 feet (3.0 m) and 1 inch (2.5 cm) point. Cut along this line."

      "content": "Paint the fabric if you want to create your own pattern. If you’re feeling artsy, you can decorate the canvas yourself. Take the sheets outdoors or to the garage. Then use paint or markers to decorate the sheets. You can design the cloth freehand, or look for stencils from a craft store. Make sure the paint has dried completely before you put the sheets on your carpet."

Instead, overlap the sheets by 2 inches (5.1 cm) so the carpet stays covered. If you have the skill, you can also sew the sheets together to prevent them from separating."

This option removes easily and is a simple fix to hide ugly carpets. [1] X Research source Consider what type of design you would like. Home goods stores or the internet should have many options to choose from, so think about your room and what kind of design would look best. Check how many tiles come in each pack, and how much area those tiles cover. You may need to buy multiple packs to cover your whole floor."

Repeat this for as many pieces as you need. [5] X Research source Place the tile on a piece of wood or scrap piece of carpet so you don’t cut the floor. Since this is a quick fix, you could also leave that space open and just put your couch or another piece of furniture over any bare areas."

Although hardwood panels that snap together shouldn’t damage the carpet, your landlord may still have some concerns about it.

[8] X Research source For reference, a piece of cardboard is about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm). Put a small piece between the walls and the flooring for the correct distance. Some installation kits suggest you remove wall molding or cut into door frames to fit the planks in. Do not do this if you’re in a rental."

[9] X Research source Wear gloves and goggles while using a saw. Depending on the size of the planks you use, you might just be able to build around some obstructions.

Cut along this line with a hand or power saw. Then fit this piece into the remaining space. [10] X Research source Remember that only one edge will snap to the previous plank after you cut the wood.

[11] X Research source To fill the remaining space, you can cut the planks lengthwise so they fit in the space. Remember to leave 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) between the final plank and the wall. However, since this is a temporary fix, you could just leave this space and cover it with a couch or other furniture. Some installation kits recommend that you cut the planks to different lengths to create a varied wood pattern. Some kits have this pattern already designed on the planks. Follow the instructions on whatever kit you use."
