      "content": "Typically, Costco’s propane refilling station is in the parking lot. Propane or full propane tanks are never stored inside a Costco warehouse. This is because of the National Fire Protection Association’s regulations, specifically NFPA 58, which states that aboveground containers of propane of 125 US gal (470 l) or more must be at least 10 to 25 ft (3.0 to 7.6 m) away from buildings. The Costco propane station is usually in the parking lot beside the warehouse’s garage or tire center, but this can vary based on location."
