According to legend, if you welcome the demon Dry Bones into your home at 12:01 a.m., he will chase you around your house. If you successfully hide from him until 3 a.m., he will grant you a wish. If you lose, he may take your soul! [1] X Research source"

Face the mirror and think about what you want to wish for. Focus entirely on your wish and visualize it in your mind. [4] X Research source Warning: If you hear anything unusual, do not proceed with the ritual. If it is safe to do so, leave your house and stay somewhere else for the night, like a friend’s house. Do not return until daylight. Note: If you’re a child or a teen, do not leave your house without your parents’ permission, even if the game says to do so. If you get too frightened, call your parents or a trusted adult to come check on you."

Come now.” [6] X Research source Another version of the chant is “I am aware of your presence, and I welcome you into my home but not into my body. Come now.” This may be a good option if you’re worried that Dry Bones will attempt to possess you."

Don’t ask for anything that defies the laws of physics, for example, like being able to fly. It’s okay to wish for something grand, like winning a lot of money, as long as it is something that is physically possible. For example, you might wish for a new pair of shoes, tickets to your favorite musician’s concert, or a vacation to the Bahamas. It can be as big or small as you want."
