The controller will reset to factory settings, so you'll need to connect it again with your console. You'll find instructions for re-pairing wireless controllers for PS5 , and PS4 . Press and hold the button on the back of your controller for 5 seconds. This is a recessed button, so you'll need a pin or straightened paper clip to be able to press it. Connect your controller to your PlayStation with a USB cable. The controller came with a USB cable, but you can easily purchase one from any electronics retailer. It's ok to use a short USB cable since you'll only connect this way initially so you can connect wirelessly to your console. Turn on your PS4 console and wait for it to start up completely. Press the PS button on your controller. If your console is turned on, this will trigger the controller to connect with it. You'll see the light turn on in front of your remote, letting you know it's connected. If resetting your controller does not fix your stick drift, it's most likely not a software issue and you need to continue to the next method. You should restart any Xbox controllers as well. Press and hold the \"Xbox\" button for 5-10 seconds and it will turn off. Turn it back on and that's it!"

      "content": "Clean your controller (Basic). There can be dust and debris that's preventing your stick from sitting normally and this basic cleaning doesn't require you to take apart your controller, which means it's so easy that anyone can do it! To clean this , you'll need: Compressed air Cleaning alcohol (like Isopropyl alcohol) A cotton swab Turn off your controller and console. To prevent shock and injury or damage to your controller, you want it to be off when you clean it. Put cleaning alcohol on a cotton swab and clean the area around the sticks. You want to rub the cotton swab around the base of the analog sticks to clean the area of dust and dirt. Move the sticks left and right so you can clean them better. Use your cotton swab to clean the new areas you're exposing by moving the sticks left and right. [1] X Research source Push the sticks down and use compressed air to clean them. Once you've gotten to all the areas you can with your cotton swab, begin using the compressed air. Press the sticks down and rotate them 360 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise for about 10 seconds each way. This is also a good way to remedy your R3 and L3 buttons not working. Shake the can well before you use it, and don't spray the can too close to the sticks or they can freeze. Once you're done, let the controller sit for about 10-15 minutes so it can dry. After that time has passed, turn on your console to test your controller."

While this is the most common fix for controller drift, a more severe issue may require you to clean the controllers as well. Go to Settings . You can simply aim the controller to select menu items. Select the search bar and enter Deadzone . The search bar is at the top of the menu and you can use the on-screen keyboard to type if you don't have an actual keyboard connected. Select Thumbstick Range and Deadzone . This will bring you to the controller menu. Alternatively, go to Devices > Controllers to get here. Select Reset Left or Reset Right next to Thumbstick Range and Deadzone. Doing this will allow you to reset the calibration on your controller so it won't drift. Do this on the controller that you notice is drifting. If you don't know which controller is the culprit, you can repeat these steps to calibrate both of them. Select Calibrate Left or Calibrate Right and follow the on-screen instructions. You'll need to roll the thumbstick around and click Next to continue. When you're prompted to select the deadzone, make sure the inner circle encompasses your controller's drift. That way a small drift on your controller does not affect any movement recorded on the controller. Remember that you can repeat this process to calibrate the other controller if you need to."
