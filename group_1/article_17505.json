      "content": "Mix 1 to 2 US tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of water into your putty. Lay your putty on a flat surface, like a table or desk. Pour a few spoonfuls of water into the putty, then begin molding and kneading it with your fingers to see if it feels any softer or more pliable. [1] X Research source If you’re using store-bought putty, check the label to see if you can add in water or other ingredients. Lukewarm or cool tap water works well for this."

      "title": "Add 1 squirt of hand lotion into the putty if it still feels firm.",
      "content": "Add 1 squirt of hand lotion into the putty if it still feels firm. Hold your putty in 1 hand, then squeeze a pea-sized amount of lotion into the putty. Use both hands to fold the slime into the putty to see if it becomes any softer. [2] X Research source You can use any kind of lotion for this!"

      "title": "Soak your putty in water overnight if it’s still too firm.",
      "content": "Soak your putty in water overnight if it’s still too firm. Place your putty back in its original container, leaving space between the top of the putty and the edge of the container. Pour several spoonfuls of lukewarm water on top of the putty and cover it with the lid. Let the putty sit overnight, then mix and knead in any excess water. [3] X Research source If the putty didn’t come in a container, use your own covered container for soaking and storage."

      "content": "Knead your putty in a bowl of hot water to get a very soft consistency. Fill a large bowl halfway with hot water so you can soak your putty. Place your putty in the water and begin folding and squeezing it with your hands. Continue kneading it in the water until it feels softer and easier to play with. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix in several spoonfuls of hair gel to give your putty a slime texture. Place your putty in a large, microwaveable bowl or container, then add in at least 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of hair gel. Use your hands to knead the hair gel into the putty, folding and squeezing it until the gel is completely absorbed. [7] X Research source If you’re working with a large batch of putty, you might want to use more gel. Similarly, if you’re working with a smaller amount, you might want to start with 1 tablespoon (15 mL)."
