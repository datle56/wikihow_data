      "title": "Start with dry, unwashed hair.",
      "content": "Start with dry, unwashed hair. It is much better to work on hair that hasn't been washed for at least 1 day. The natural oils on your hair will not only help protect it against the dye, but they will help the dye stick better as well."

      "content": "Buy boxed dye kit specially formulated for black or dark-colored hair. Since this type of dye will lighten your hair, look for a brown color that's 1 or 2 shades lighter than your own. You can also use a regular boxed dye kit in either light ash brown or dark ash blonde. [1] X Research source Buying an \"ash\" shade is key because it has cool under tones, which prevent your hair from looking too brassy or orange after you dye it. [2] X Expert Source April Ferri Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 8 December 2020. [3] X Research source If you have natural hair, look for a kit that's formulated for natural hair. It will not only lighten your hair, but protect it against damage as well."

      "content": "Protect your clothing and work station. Put on an old shirt that you won't mind ruining. If you are worried about your counter, cover it with newspaper, paper bags, or plastic bags. Put away anything that might get ruined by accidental splashes or spills. [4] X Research source If you don't have a shirt to spare, drape an old towel or plastic hair dyeing cape around your shoulders instead."

      "title": "Divide your hair into 4 sections if it falls past your shoulders.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into 4 sections if it falls past your shoulders. Part your hair down the middle, then drape each half over your shoulder, like making pigtails. Divide each half horizontally at about ear-level, so that you have a top and bottom section. Twist each section into a bun and secure it with a hair clip. [5] X Research source Make short, thick hair more manageable by dividing it into 6 or 8 mini buns. This is a great option for African American or natural hair. If your hair is just a few inches/centimeters long, or even shorter, don't worry about sectioning it. Instead, you can simply apply the dye to your whole head, working it through to make sure that every strand is evenly coated."

      "title": "Apply petroleum jelly around your hairline, then pull on plastic gloves.",
      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly around your hairline, then pull on plastic gloves. Your hairline includes your forehead, temples, sideburns, and nape. It would be a good idea to coat the tips of your ears too. Once you have the petroleum jelly applied, pull on a pair of plastic hair dyeing gloves. [6] X Research source If you are using a hair dye kit, the gloves should already be inside the box. If you can't find them, pull open the instruction packet; they are usually in there. If you're not using a kit, pick up a pair of gloves from the beauty supply store or hair salon. Craft stores may also carry plastic or vinyl gloves for fabric dye."

After that, you can pour the mixture into the mixing bowl. [7] X Research source Your finished dye should not have any streaks in it. If there are any, stir them out with a plastic spoon, or with the handle of your tinting brush. You can leave the dye in the developer bottle if you have very short hair. If your hair is short enough that it did not need to be sectioned, you don't need to pour your dye into a bowl. If you are using dark ash blonde dye, consider adding a packet of \"color corrector\" to reduce brassy tones. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Undo 1 of the bottom sections in your hair. Comb the section out so that it is nice and smooth, and free of any knots and tangles. If you have very thick hair, you may even want to divide that section up into 2 or 4 smaller sections. Don't worry about this if you didn't section off your hair. If you choose to divide the section up further, just twice and pin the smaller sections into mini buns."

If you are touching up a previous dye job, apply the dye to your roots first, then work your way down to the lighter portion of your hair. If you've never dyed your hair before, however, apply the dye to all your ends first. Then go back and dye apply the dye to your roots. This helps prevent your roots from taking on too much color and becoming \"hot roots.\" [9] X Research source The heat from your scalp will cause the dye to process faster. If you apply the dye from roots-to-ends, it will lighten too fast at the top. If you kept the dye in the kit's bottle, squeeze some out onto your hair, then work it in with your fingers. Comb the section afterwards with a wide-toothed comb. [10] X Research source You are only applying the dye to the loose section of hair. Don't worry about the other sections."

      "content": "Undo the next section of hair and repeat the process. Finish the bottom sections first, then do the upper sections last. This is because the heat generated by your scalp will cause the dye to process and lighten faster in those areas. You can leave the already-dyed section loose, or you can twist it back up into a bun. If you are touching up a previous dye job, apply the dye to your hairline, then work your way down to the ends, or whenever the lighter color starts."

Read the instructions on the bottle or kit to find out how long you should wait. In most cases, however, you will wait around 20 to 30 minutes. [11] X Research source The shower cap will not only help keep your surroundings clean, but also trap the heat and help the dye process better. [12] X Research source If you don't have a shower cap, use a plastic bag instead. Secure it with hair clips to trap the heat."

[13] X Research source If your kit didn't come with conditioner, use conditioner made for color-treated hair. You can also use a sulfate-free conditioner."

[19] X Research source If you can't find any, stick with sulfate-free products instead. Most shampoos and conditioners state on the label if they are \"sulfate-free.\" If the label doesn't say this, check the ingredient label. Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents that cause hair to turn dry and brittle. They also cause dye to fade. [20] X Expert Source April Ferri Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 8 December 2020. About once or twice per month, consider switching out your conditioner for a deep conditioning mask instead."

Let your hair air dry whenever possible, and focus on heat-free styling methods instead of using curling irons and flat irons. [21] X Research source If you must heat-style your hair, apply a heat protectant to it first. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you use a curling iron or flat iron on it. Instead of blow drying your hair from start to finish, allow it to air dry about 90% of the way first, then use a hairdryer to finish drying and styling it."
