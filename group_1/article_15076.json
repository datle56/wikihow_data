      "content": "Cut the sunflower’s stem down to about 6 inches (15 centimetres). Sunflowers have long stems, so it’s easier to dry them if you trim the stem down to about 6 inches (15 centimetres) in length. Be careful not to cut the stem too short, however, as you need enough length to tie the flowers together. Remove any dead leaves around the head of the sunflower, as well.

      "content": "Hang the flowers upside down in a dark, dry place. Tie yarn or kitchen twine around the bottom of the stem; if you’re drying multiple sunflowers, bundle them in groups of three without letting the heads touch. Pick a dark, dry place to hang them, such as an unused cabinet, closet, or attic. Use a wire hanger, stick, or hook to hang them upside down. [2] X Research source Zúñiga says if the flowers touch, “There isn't air circulation over the entire flower head, [and] you could end up with a little bit of mold growing in there. So I think that's something that you want to stay away from, [as] it doesn't smell good and it's not good for your health.” [3] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. Zúñiga recommends drying the flowers upside down because it “[allows] gravity to pull the petals and wick [the] moisture out. If there are any drops of water inside, it's going to pull that water out of the petals rather than have it all sit inside the head of the flower and rot. That's why drying upside down is important.” [4] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020."

      "content": "Let the flowers dry for at least 2 weeks. Leave the flowers undisturbed for about 2 weeks, then check to see if they’re dry. The petals should feel crisp and stiff. If they’re completely dry, cut the twine and pull them out of the closet, being careful not to break off any petals. [5] X Research source Depending on the size of the sunflowers, they may take as long as 3 weeks to dry completely. If they aren’t completely dry, leave them hanging for a little longer. Zúñiga says it’s important to keep the flowers out of the sun if you want them to remain bright yellow: “The sun will just leech out all the color, unless you're [going] for that look. It can make [the flowers] more brittle, and you lose your color variation that way.” [6] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. If you're aiming for a sepia-toned flower, leaving them in the sun may help you achieve this look."

In general, the sunflowers should be well-preserved once they’ve dried completely, but most flowers still lose their color over time.

      "content": "Let sunflowers dry naturally in a vase. If you aren’t pressed for time, letting sunflowers dry naturally is a great way to preserve their color. Simply place your sunflowers in a vase filled with water and forget about them. Let them dry slowly, even when they start to droop or shrivel. Leave them alone until they feel stiff and crisp—this will likely take several weeks. The sunflower heads will start to droop as they dry, so if you want them to dry straight, prop them up or lay them flat once they are mostly dry. If you want your dried sunflowers to have a natural, faded look, shake off some of the petals."

Then, cut your sunflower’s stem to about 2 inches (5 cm) long, and place the flower head in the gel, face up. Pour more gel into the container until the sunflower is completely covered. Put the lid on and allow the flower to dry for 2-7 days in a cool, dry location. Check on the flower every few days and remove it once it’s completely dry. [8] X Research source If you don’t have silica gel, another option is to mix equal parts Borax and cornmeal or 2 parts Borax to 1 part sand. Add a spoonful of salt to help preserve the petals’ color."

If you have access to a dehydrator , cut the stems off of your sunflowers right at the base and lay the blooms face up on your dehydrator tray. Space the flowers out so they aren’t touching, set your dehydrator to low, and check on the flowers after 6-8 hours. Depending on the type of dehydrator you have, you may need to rotate your trays if the heating element and fan are located at the bottom of the dryer. [11] X Research source If your sunflowers are particularly large, it may take longer for them to dehydrate. Check on them every few hours if they aren’t completely dry the first time you check them."

Place the petals in a single layer between two sheets of blotting paper or parchment paper , then place the sheets between the pages of a heavy book.

[12] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Unless you have a flower press , pressing whole sunflower heads isn’t usually a viable option, as they’re too big and thick.

Microwave the petals on high power for 20-40 seconds or until the petals dry completely. [13] X Research source The paper towels will wick away moisture released by the sunflower petals. Check the petals after the first 20 seconds to make sure they haven’t become too crisp. Let the petals rest on the paper towels for several hours before you use them. It’s also possible to preserve petals with silica gel or in the oven, following the same instructions as you’d use for entire flower heads."

If possible, do not cut the flower heads off before the back turns yellow-brown. Ideally, wait until the sunflower loses its petals and the head droops. [14] X Research source If the sunflower starts to droop, tie the flower head to a stake to keep the plant upright. The head will become heavier as it droops, and the plant will begin to weaken under its own weight."

If you want your dried sunflowers to maintain their color and shape, it’s usually best to choose blooms that are almost fully open, but not quite. The flowers should feel heavy, indicating that they are well-nourished, and their stems should be firm and green. Avoid sunflowers that have brown or discolored edges and wilted leaves, as this means the flower is past its prime. [19] X Research source It’s possible to dry any sunflower (including the really big ones), but in general, it’s easier to choose small or medium-sized blooms."

[20] X Trustworthy Source Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Iowa State University's Extension and Outreach program dedicated to educating and engaging communities Go to source It’s also a good idea to pick the flowers on a cooler day, as this minimizes stress on the plants. When you cut the sunflowers, make a clean cut at a 45-degree angle so the flowers hydrate correctly. Place them in a vase of lukewarm water immediately to prolong their life until you’re ready to preserve them."
