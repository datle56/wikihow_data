For example, search for “John Doe los angeles sports journalist.” [1] X Research source From there, you can navigate to someone’s social media sites, or any other personal websites that may come up. If you’d like to find images directly from Google without going through a social media site, you can type your search query directly into Google Images.

[5] X Research source A reverse image search can also help you identify an individual, if you’ve found a picture online and would like to see other photographs.
