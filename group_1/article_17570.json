      "content": "Buy or rent a heat gun to loosen up the tint and melt the glue. Either buy a heat gun or rent one at a construction supply store. To remove air bubbles, wrinkles, creases, or minor mistakes, you reheat the tint to soften the adhesive and push the mistakes out. You cannot do this with a blow dryer since it doesn’t get hot enough to melt the glue. [1] X Research source You can buy a heat gun for $20-60. You may be able to rent one from your local construction supply store for $10-15, though."

      "title": "Heat the area around the bubble on high heat for 3-5 seconds.",
      "content": "Heat the area around the bubble on high heat for 3-5 seconds. Do this on the outside of the window. Turn the dial or press the button on your heat gun to set it to the highest setting available. Hold the heat gun 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) away from the bubble and pull the trigger for 3-5 seconds. Move the gun in a circular motion around the bubble, crease, or wrinkle to soften the glue up. [2] X Research source The tint should get hot enough that you can’t touch it for more than 2-3 seconds. Keep your hands off of the glass after you’ve heated it. Do not heat the window from the inside. You will damage your window tint if you do this. If the mistake is in the middle of the window, heat it directly. If it’s within 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of the edge of the window, heat the area just outside of the mistake so that the heat gun is slightly closer to the middle of the window. The heat gun will melt the trim or plastic around the window if you heat it directly. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Work the mistakes towards any edge of the window with a plastic razor.",
      "content": "Work the mistakes towards any edge of the window with a plastic razor. Grab a plastic razor or old gift card. Open the vehicle door to go to the other side of the window. Take your plastic straight edge and hold it with the longest side towards the window. Drag the edge at a 25- to 35-degree angle over the bubble, wrinkle, or crease to push it towards the edge of the window. Do this for 20-30 seconds to smooth the mistake out. [4] X Research source You can move the bubble or wrinkle out by pushing the problem to the top, bottom, or sides of the window. It doesn’t really matter. Just choose whichever edge is closest to the mistake. For wrinkles and creases, hold the straight edge perpendicular to the line in the tint. If the bubble or wrinkle isn’t moving at all, heat it for another 3-5 seconds."

      "title": "Reheat the area whenever the bubble or wrinkle stops moving.",
      "content": "Reheat the area whenever the bubble or wrinkle stops moving. It may take 3-5 rounds of heating and smoothing out to remove the mistake entirely. Whenever the bubble, wrinkle, or crease stops gets hard to move with your straight edge, go back outside of the door and reheat the blemish for another 3-5 seconds. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Continue smoothing the mistake out until you push it over an edge.",
      "content": "Continue smoothing the mistake out until you push it over an edge. Once you’ve reheated the adhesive, open the door again and pick your plastic straight edge back up. Keep dragging the plastic edge over the mistake until you push it to an edge of the window. Repeat this process until your tint is entirely smooth and uniform. [6] X Research source If there is debris trapped in the window or the mistake is so bad that you can’t get it to the edge of the window, you may need to replace the tint. Repeat this process for all of the bubbles, wrinkles, and creases in your window."

      "title": "Replace the tint if there’s debris or you can’t remove the problem.",
      "content": "Replace the tint if there’s debris or you can’t remove the problem. If you can physically see hair, dust, or some other contaminant trapped between the tint and the window, you won’t be able to fix it. Some air bubbles and mistakes will also be too stubborn to actually remove. In these cases, you can replace the tint on the window. [7] X Research source If a professional shop installed your tint and there are visible mistakes, they’ll usually fix it free of charge."

      "title": "Take your car outside when it’s warm to remove the tint yourself.",
      "content": "Take your car outside when it’s warm to remove the tint yourself. If it’s hotter than 65 °F (18 °C), you can use the sun to remove the tint. Drive your car out into the driveway or park it on the street to do this. You may want to remove the tint if you’re replacing it yourself, or to save some money at the tint shop. [8] X Research source If you’re going to pay a professional to replace the tint, you can always take your vehicle to them and ask them to remove it. You’ll save yourself $15-30 in labor if you do this yourself though, and it’s not particularly hard to do."

      "content": "Spray the inside of the window down with glass cleaner. Grab a commercial glass cleaning spray. Open the door on your vehicle and spray the tint down with your glass cleaner. Really soak the tint to get the entire window soapy and wet. The glass cleaner won’t damage the interior, so don’t worry about drips. You can just wipe them away with a clean cloth.

      "content": "Cover the inside of the window with a black trash bag. Grab a black trash bag or a sheet of black plastic. Spread the black plastic over the inside of the window and smooth it out over the door. Push the plastic against the glass with the palm of your hand. The plastic will stay in place since it will stick to the window cleaner. Make sure every section is covered by the plastic. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Shut the door and let the tint bake in the sun for 20-45 minutes. Close the vehicle door and let the trash bag stick out around the sides of the door. Let the vehicle sit in the sun for 20 minutes if it’s 80 °F (27 °C) or hotter. If it’s a little on the cooler side, wait a little longer. [11] X Research source The plastic insulates the window as the sun heats the glass up. The adhesive will melt while it sits out on the sun and make removing the plastic easy. You can achieve the same effect with a heat gun, but this is much easier and safer for your vehicle."

      "content": "Peel the film off in one sheet to remove it from the window. After the vehicle has sat out in the sun for a while or after you’ve heated it with the heat gun, open the door and peel the black plastic bag off the window. The tint should have wrinkled up a little in the sun. If it did, grab a wrinkle near the edge of the window and slowly peel the tint off like you’re removing a sticker. If you can’t do it by hand, grab a metal straight edge, like a razor blade, and scrape the tint with the edge to peel it off in strips. [12] X Research source"

Take your vehicle to the professionals and pay them to replace your window. This is the best way to ensure you don’t end up with a bad tint job. It typically costs $100-400 to tint an entire vehicle, but it will cost considerably less to get a single window replaced."

      "content": "Redo your tint job if you want to install the tint yourself. If you installed the tint on your own, you already know what you’re doing. The odds are high that your main mistake was not cleaning your window enough, or not smoothing the tint out with your straight edge correctly. This time, spend an extra 5-10 minutes cleaning the window with soapy water and spend an extra 10-15 minutes smoothing it out when you reinstall the tint. [13] X Research source Tinting a vehicle is a pretty touchy process. If your first attempt to tint your windows was unsuccessful, you likely got enough practice to nail the process this time."
