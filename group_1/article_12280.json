Although it takes much more time to allow your frozen scallops to fully thaw in the refrigerator, it will produce the best-tasting scallops. And because the frozen scallops will defrost gradually, there’s almost no chance of damaging or contaminating the scallops during the thawing process.

      "content": "Remove the scallops from their packaging and place them in a large bowl. The bowl needs to be large enough to fit all of the scallops. It also needs to have enough extra room for any water that forms from the melting ice around the scallops. Take the scallops out of their packages and arrange them so that the bowl is about ¾ of the way full. Use another bowl if you have too many scallops to fit in one bowl."

      "content": "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Because the scallops are slowly thawing, they are at risk of becoming contaminated and spoiling. Wrap the bowl securely with plastic wrap to keep the scallops from coming into contact with any other food particles in your refrigerator. If your bowl has a lid, you can use that to cover the scallops."

Once you’ve covered the bowl with plastic wrap, clear some space in your refrigerator and place the bowl of scallops on a low shelf to keep them from coming into contact with any other food. Don’t put the bowl in a temperature controlled drawer unless the temperature is set to 37 °F (3 °C)."

Take the bowl out after 24 hours and check to see if the scallops have defrosted by touching the center of them with your finger. They should be cool but not frozen at all. [2] X Research source Frozen scallops can take on a rubbery, chewy texture if they’re cooked before they have fully defrosted. If your scallops haven’t fully defrosted after 24 hours, cover them again with plastic wrap and put them back into the refrigerator for another 6 hours."

You can speed up the thawing process of your frozen scallops by using cool water if you don’t have the time to let them defrost on their own in your refrigerator. There also isn’t a risk of cooking the scallops using cool water. The frozen scallops will defrost more quickly, but they may be a little tougher when they’re cooked."

Move the bag of frozen scallops around a little while the bowl is filling up with water to make sure it doesn’t stick to the side. The water needs to be about 50 °F (10 °C) in order to thaw the frozen scallops without cooking them and changing their texture. Fill the bowl with enough water to cover the bag. Keep the bowl in the sink in case you overfill it."

After 10 minutes, empty the water from the bowl and fill the bowl back up with cool water. After another 10 minutes, empty the water and check to see if the scallops have defrosted by touching them with your finger. They should be cool but soft with no frozen parts. It takes about 30 minutes total to defrost the scallops but larger frozen scallops can take longer. Make sure the bag is resealed after you check to see if the frozen scallops have defrosted. Do not refreeze the scallops after they’ve been defrosted."

You need to use a microwave that has a defrost setting because scallops are very fragile and will start to cook if you use a standard setting to defrost them in a microwave. Check your microwave to see if it has a defrost setting. Scallops that have been defrosted in a microwave can be tougher and more chewy when they’re cooked."
