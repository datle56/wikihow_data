      "title": "Start over.",
      "content": "Start over. Write down everything that you did in order to study last time. Write where you studied, what you studied, how much you studied, and how. Consider these to be 'variables' in what is making you unable to get positive results. By learning from your mistakes, you can create a better future."

      "content": "Create a new schedule. Whether it be a planner, a calendar, a diary-like log, you have to find a way to keep track of what to do. Some prefer planners because of their ability to be carried almost everywhere. Others prefer calendars that can be hung on the walls because of their more organized and easy to read look. Think about what you have to do each day. Not specifically studying, but generic chores that you've learned to do on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. It's important to take into consideration everything that consumes extra time in your day. [1] X Research source Try to categorize your tasks by importance and urgency. For example, studying for tomorrow's test would be considered important and urgent. [2] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. Distractions and other time-wasting activities would be considered less urgent and important. [3] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 18 June 2020."

      "content": "Look at what you've made and change it. You have to learn to edit what you do as you learn. You may use this schedule for a day or two and discover that it doesn't work for you unless you color code what needs to be done for school and what needs to be done for personal reasons. Another option is using stickers that symbolize activities. For example, a soccer ball sticker is the equivalent to a notice reminding you that you have soccer practice. Be flexible and willing to change your schedule. Rome wasn't built in a day, and your schedule won't be, either. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a place to study that works for you.",
      "content": "Find a place to study that works for you. It's important to choose an environment that is quiet, comfortable, and a good size. Working in a huge environment with empty space can be incredibly distracting, whereas working in a small area can get claustrophobic and stuffy. Open windows are a good attribute to a study area. Playing music or leaving on the tv can be helpful to some people, however keep in mind that it can get distracting. Switching music, watching the TV, and spacing out in general can all happen when you use electronic devices to 'help' you work. [5] X Research source Choose a study spot that caters to your learning style. For example, a kinesthetic learner might study in a place where you can walk around and write on a whiteboard.

Reader Poll: We asked 374 wikiHow readers which study space they found most effective for staying focused and productive, and 47% of them said, a quiet library cubicle. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Find a method to study. This doesn't mean that you should do only your homework-If you're having trouble in a subject, you will surely have to do more than just work off of the classwork. Get some material, whether it be notes or another wikiHow article explaining how to do work, or maybe something else entirely. When you read through your notes, don't feel like you can't mark them. Write questions and tips on the notes. From here, you mainly should just work through trial and error to find the method of studying that works for you. You can allot your own time to the subjects according to the level of difficulty in the subjects. [7] X Research source"

Studying is best done when you work no more than an hour followed by a break lasting no more than 10 minutes. If you feel the need to, change your schedule to consider these breaks by adding extra time studying to each subject. [8] X Research source"

By changing your schedule and organizational habits, you're also changing your study habits . Those are most important when it comes to school organization, as good study habits result in success in class. [9] X Research source"
