      "content": "Find the area under a curve by doing a definite integral with A = ∫a,b f(x) dx . This is the standard formula you’ll use to determine the area under a curve. It tells you that you’re finding the differential ( dx ) of the integral ( ∫ ) of a function ( f(x) ). ∫a,b indicates that this is a definite (not indefinite) integral with known limits (for example, if you’re asked to find the area between x=0 and x=4 ).

To help you visualize the curve and the area you need to determine, consider graphing the function . [2] X Research source If you do graph it, you’ll see that y=x^2 looks like a big smiley face with its vertex (the point where the curve changes direction) at x=0, y=0 . For this sample problem, you need to calculate the area (in square units) between the vertex ( x=0 ) and an imaginary straight line drawn from x=4 along the x-axis up to the curve."

As mentioned in the “Summary” section of this article, you need to do a definite integral between two points (limits) in order to determine the area under a curve between those two points. In our example, the function ( f(x) ) is y=x^2 , and the limits are x=0 and x=4 ): [3] X Research source A = ∫a,b f(x) dx → A = ∫0,4 x^2 dx"

In this case, that means x^2 becomes (x^3)/3 . Place a vertical bar afterward to designate the limits: [4] X Research source A = (x^3)/3 |0,4"
