[2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The lump is located low on the front part of the neck, near where the neck meets the collarbones. The lump may be visible, or you may be able to feel it when you touch your neck. See your doctor immediately if you develop a lump in your neck. In some cases, you may notice an overall swelling of the lower front part of your neck, instead of a well-defined lump. The lump may appear suddenly or grow rapidly. Most neck lumps are caused by non-cancerous conditions, such as an enlarged thyroid gland or goiter. The lump is more likely to be caused by cancer if it is hard or firm to the touch, does not move easily when touched, and grows over time.

They can also help determine whether, and how far, the cancer may have spread. If your doctor suspects that you have thyroid cancer, they may order a variety of imaging tests, including: [14] X Research source A thyroid ultrasound. An ultrasound can determine if nodules in the thyroid are fluid-filled or solid. Solid nodules are more likely to be cancerous. A radioiodine scan. For this type of scan, your doctor will inject you with a small amount of radioactive iodine, or ask you to swallow it in pill form. A special camera then detects concentrations of radioactivity in your thyroid. “Cold” areas (with low radiation) may be cancerous. A CT, MRI, or PET scan. These types of scans create detailed images of internal organs. They can be useful for detecting tumors in the thyroid, as well as cancer that may have spread beyond the thyroid."

      "content": "Get a biopsy to detect cancer cells in your thyroid. If other tests show that thyroid cancer is likely, your doctor will order a biopsy to make the final diagnosis. This involves taking a small piece of tissue from the thyroid for laboratory testing. The most common type of thyroid biopsy is fine needle aspiration (FNA). [15] X Research source FNA biopsies can typically be performed in the doctor’s office under local or no anesthesia. The doctor will insert a fine needle into 3-4 points on the suspected tumor and pull a small amount of tissue into a syringe. The FNA may need to be repeated if the samples do not contain enough cells for a clear diagnosis. If the diagnosis is still unclear after a second FNA test, your doctor may recommend a surgical biopsy or lobectomy, in which some of your thyroid tissue is surgically removed under general anesthesia."

Your doctor will refer you to a team of specialists who deal with cancer and thyroid conditions. Appropriate treatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer you have and how far it may have spread. Common treatments include: [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid. Sometimes it is necessary to remove affected lymph nodes, as well. Radioactive iodine treatment. This is usually used together with surgery to destroy any remaining cancerous cells. Radiation therapy. This treatment is typically used if surgery and radioactive iodine therapy are ineffective. Targeted therapies, in which the cancer is treated directly with medications that destroy or slow the growth of cancer cells. [17] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source Thyroid hormone replacement medications. Since many thyroid cancer treatments destroy or damage the thyroid itself, you will need to take supplements to replace the hormones produced by the thyroid.

Thyroid cancer is 3 times more likely to occur in people who are biologically female than in people who are biologically male.

[19] X Research source The risk of age can vary based on the type of thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer, which is the most common type, can occur at any age while the most aggressive form, [20] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source anaplastic thyroid cancer, is more common in people over the age of 60.
