Opposites may be more attractive on a superficial level or at the start of a relationship: someone with opposite traits may seem more exciting or interesting, or they may be attractive because they seem “forbidden.” However, many studies indicate that while superficial differences may make a relationship more exciting, it’s typically shared values, goals, and ethics that solidify a couple’s bond for the long haul.

[2] X Research source By \"complementary personalities,\" we mean one person's traits challenge their partner in a positive way, \"make up\" for a quality their partner might lack, or enhance their partner's opposite quality. People may also be subconsciously drawn to partners with similar physical features.

But the more different your partner is, the more likely you are to have to learn how to compromise. If this sounds like a downside, it can be—but it’s also a great opportunity to grow and cultivate character. Being able to drop your shields and find common ground is never a weakness."

Dating someone with a different view of the world may be tough, but it’s a challenge that’s likely to leave you with a greater understanding of how and why other people think and operate the way they do. For instance, you may have once wondered how anyone could possibly hold certain political views, but by regularly talking to someone with a different perspective, you’re likely to expand your mind a little—even if you don’t change your own views."

When you first meet someone you're into, you experience a boost in PEA (or phenylethylamine), which releases dopamine and norepinephrine, the \"feel-good\" neurochemicals behind lust and the feeling of being in love.

Babies whose caregivers were present, reliable, and comforting tend to have more stable relationships later on. On the other hand, babies whose caregivers were not reliable or attentive are more likely to have trouble forming healthy relationships as adults. There are 4 basic attachment styles: [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Secure attachment : People with a secure attachment style were raised with reliable caregivers, and therefore as adults, they're more likely to be attracted to people with secure attachment styles. Anxious attachment : People with anxious attachment styles were raised with inconsistent caregivers and may therefore grow up to be more needy and mistrustful in relationships. They may be subconsciously drawn to partners with avoidant attachment styles. [16] X Research source Avoidant attachment : These ultra-independent \"lone wolves\" likely were raised in a home with dismissive caregivers, and they grew up learning that they can't rely on others. Avoidant people tend to be attracted to anxiously attached partners. Disorganized attachment : This type of attachment is usually formed during an especially tumultuous or traumatic childhood in which the person had an erratic or confusing relationship with their caregiver. People with a disorganized style tend to crave close relationships, but push people away when they get too close.

While some people wear fragrances in an attempt to be more attractive or alluring, science suggests it's still your specific bodily scent mingling with the fragrance that makes it alluring or not: the same fragrance applied to another person's body will smell slightly differently.
