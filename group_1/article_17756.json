If it works on another USB port, the problem is most likely with the USB port. Avoid using a USB hub to connect the drive; connect it directly to your computer. Many Mac models only have USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 ports, so if you have a standard USB connector like a 2.0 or 3.0, you need to use an adapter. If this is the case, make sure that your adapter is not defective."

If the USB drive works on another computer but doesn't work in any of your USB ports, then there is something wrong with your computer's hardware or USB drivers. Also, check what type of computer the USB drive was formatted on. Computers running a different operating system or different bit processor may format the drive in a way that is not compatible with other computer types. A USB drive formatted on a Mac using Apple's APFS or HFS+ file system will not be read on a Windows computer. However, there are third-party applications, such as UFS Explorer that allow Windows to read Mac-formatted USB drives. If the drive was formatted on a Linux using a Ext 2 file system, you can install FS-driver ] to read Ext 2 file system on Windows. If a USB drive was written by a computer that uses a different bit system (i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit), it may only work on computers that have the same bit system. You can check your computer's bit system in both Windows or Mac If a USB drive is encrypted, it may only work on the computer it was encrypted on."
