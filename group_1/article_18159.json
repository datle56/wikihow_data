      "content": "Pay attention to pacing. In most cases, jokes are only funny if they’re delivered well, so practice your joke a few times to get your pacing down. Don’t rush to say the punchline immediately. Wait for a beat, then deliver it. This gives your friends time to process that you’re making a joke. [8] X Research source"
