      "title": "Seeing a crow is believed to be a good omen overall.",
      "content": "Seeing a crow is believed to be a good omen overall. Since crows represent change and transformation, the appearance of one (or a flock) can indicate temporary and unexpected changes are coming. This is why some cultures see the appearance of a crow as a “bad” omen. However, crows also symbolize the ability to adapt successfully. As long as you embrace the changes rather than fight against them, these changes will result in good luck, success, and abundance. [8] X Research source In Japanese culture, crows are symbols of good luck because it’s believed that their black feathers can ward off evil spirits."

Since crows are social birds, some people believe their appearance means that there are people in your life who care about you and want to help you. If you’ve been feeling lonely or disconnected lately, the flock of crows is a message that you’re not alone. [9] X Research source Alternatively, some cultures believe that seeing a flock of crows means that the soul of someone close to you who died recently is watching over you. FYI, a group of crows is actually referred to as a \"murder of crows.\""

      "title": "Seeing a crow in a dream is a sign of forthcoming change.",
      "content": "Seeing a crow in a dream is a sign of forthcoming change. This change might be a little bumpy at first, but keep in mind that this is temporary—ultimately, the crow promises a positive outcome. Dreaming of a crow can also mean that your connection to your higher self is getting stronger and you’re embarking on a spiritual journey. The meaning can also depend on what the crow is doing in your dream: If you see a crow in flight, it means you're repressing something in your subconscious that needs to come to light. If you see a crow eating, it means you'll come into great wealth if you stay on your current path. If you hear a crow cawing, it means someone in your life may soon try to take advantage of you. If a crow attacks you, it means that your waking life feels out of control and it’s time to address the reasons why. If you see a dead crow, it means you’re in the middle of changing and evolving in your waking life and you’re on the right path. [10] X Research source If you see multiple crows in your dream, it means positive change is coming."
