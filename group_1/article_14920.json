      "title": "Drink a cappuccino before 11 in the morning.",
      "content": "Drink a cappuccino before 11 in the morning. In Italy, it’s frowned upon to order or drink a cappuccino after 11 am or noon. The reasoning behind this is that cappuccinos have lots of dairy in them, which doesn’t settle well in the stomach in the afternoon or evening. Drink your cappuccino in the morning to avoid indigestion. While Italians never drink cappuccinos in the afternoon or evening, it’s safe to drink regular coffee any time during the day. You might instead opt for a macchiato in the afternoon, or an espresso after dinner."

      "title": "Pay for your cappuccino first at the cashier if you’re in Italy.",
      "content": "Pay for your cappuccino first at the cashier if you’re in Italy. If you’re ordering a real Italian cappuccino, head straight to the cashier at the bar to order. You’ll pay for the cappuccino first and then wait while your drink is made. [1] X Research source Keep your receipt so you can hand it to the bartender if needed."

    {
      "title": "Tell the bartender of any special needs relating to your cappuccino order.",
      "content": "Tell the bartender of any special needs relating to your cappuccino order. If you want your milk lukewarm instead of scalding, or you’d like your cappuccino served in a different type of cup, these types of requests can usually be accommodated. Tell the bartender of any specific instructions before they start making your drink. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Stand at the bar while drinking your cappuccino.",
      "content": "Stand at the bar while drinking your cappuccino. Unless you really need to sit down, Italians drink their cappuccinos and other types of coffee standing at the bar where their drink is made. If you want to seem like a local Italian, find a spot at the bar and sip on your cappuccino while standing. [3] X Research source ”Bars” in Italy are similar to “cafes” in other places. Ordering and drinking your cappuccino at the bar allows you to pay the normal price. If you sit down at a table, the price is usually higher."

      "title": "Add sugar to your cappuccino if you want your drink to be sweeter.",
      "content": "Add sugar to your cappuccino if you want your drink to be sweeter. Cappuccinos don’t come with sugar in them, so if you’d like to add some you’ll need to do it yourself. Use a sugar serving spoon to scoop out as many spoonfuls as needed into your drink, stirring it well to mix it together. [4] X Research source If the sugar comes in packets, rip open one end and sprinkle the sugar into your drink. Many people drink cappuccinos without adding any sugar, so don’t feel like your drink needs sugar for it to taste great."

      "title": "Have a glass of water with your cappuccino to cleanse your palate.",
      "content": "Have a glass of water with your cappuccino to cleanse your palate. Take a few sips of water before and after drinking your cappuccino. While this isn’t necessary, it helps to get rid of the coffee or milk taste left in your mouth after you’ve finished your drink. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a cappuccino using equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam.",
      "content": "Create a cappuccino using equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. A cappuccino is made with a base of espresso that consists of roughly one-third of the drink. After pouring in espresso, steamed milk is added into the coffee, creating a foamy top coat. [6] X Research source Cappuccinos have a velvety consistency."

      "title": "Use a moka pot or espresso machine to make espresso.",
      "content": "Use a moka pot or espresso machine to make espresso . If you have a moka pot, fill the lower section with water and the strainer with espresso-ground coffee, heating the pot until the water boils. If you have an espresso machine, follow the directions for your specific machine to create a shot or two of espresso. Pour the espresso into a cup big enough to hold the coffee, milk, and foam. [7] X Research source You can also make espresso using an aeropress. You’ll need roughly two shots of espresso for your cappuccino."

    {
      "title": "Steam the milk",
      "content": "Steam the milk before pouring it into the cup of espresso. If you have a steam wand, this is the easiest way to steam your milk. Otherwise, you can try heating up the milk in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Heat up half a cup or jar of milk until it begins forming froth, and slowly pour it into your espresso to fill your cup. [8] X Research source Many espresso machines also have a steam wand attached to them, making it easy to heat up the milk and create foam."

    {
      "title": "Pour more steamed milk into the drink for a wet cappuccino.",
      "content": "Pour more steamed milk into the drink for a wet cappuccino. If you want your cappuccino to have more steamed milk than any other ingredient, add more milk to the drink once you’re finished making it. This is referred to as a “wet cappuccino.” [9] X Research source If you’re ordering your cappuccino in a coffee shop or Italian bar, ask for a wet cappuccino."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add more foam to the drink to create a dry cappuccino.",
      "content": "Add more foam to the drink to create a dry cappuccino. This means that your cappuccino will have less milk in it than normal. As you're steaming the milk, it will create more and more foam. When making the cappuccino, just pour a small amount of milk in and let the rest be foam. [10] X Research source This is difficult to do at home because it can be tricky to create perfect foam, so order a dry cappuccino at a professional establishment if possible."
