If you'd like a rustic look, tear the material so it has rough edges. Decide if you'd like to place just a few pieces of material or if you'd like to overlap several pieces. For example, if you're covering a dresser, you may just want to cut 3 large pieces of paper that fit 3 drawers perfectly. If you're decoupaging a small box, you might want to rip a variety of materials and overlap them on all sides of the box."
