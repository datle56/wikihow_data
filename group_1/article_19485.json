[4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Oatmeal baths are usually best for hives that are spread over a large area of the body, but you can make a smaller preparation in a large bowl and soak your face by holding your breath and immersing your face in the water, or soaking a towel in the water and laying it over your face. You can also try making an oatmeal face mask. Use uncooked colloidal oatmeal, which is specifically made for use in the bath. Place a cup of rolled oats in a clean knee-high nylon stocking. Tie this over the water tap so that the water runs through the oats as it enters the bathtub or a bowl to make an oatmeal bath. Putting the oatmeal in a nylon stocking will make for easier cleanup and won't clog your drains. If you are using colloidal oatmeal, you can just sprinkle it in the water. Use cool water, as warm, hot, or cold water can make hives worse. Soak a towel in the oatmeal bath and apply it to your face. Repeat as often as needed. To make an oatmeal mask , mix 1 tablespoon of colloidal oatmeal with 1 teaspoon of honey and 1 teaspoon of yogurt. Apply the mixture to your skin and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse the mask off using cool water."
