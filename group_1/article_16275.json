      "title": "Check for a high-quality and durable canvas material.",
      "content": "Check for a high-quality and durable canvas material. Authentic Goyard bags are crafted from a specially made coated canvas material called Goyardine. The material is soft with a slightly bumpy texture. Fake bags might be made of stiff, synthetic plastic or a noticeably lower-quality canvas that is rough and flimsy. [1] X Research source The Goyardine canvas fabric is made of cotton, linen, and hemp. Authentic Goyard bags develop a patina over time, which gives them a glossy sheen as they age. On the other hand, fake bags might fade or discolor as they age."

    {
      "title": "Look for tight and straight stitching.",
      "content": "Look for tight and straight stitching. Real Goyard bags are hand-made by highly trained artisans. The stitching is tight, straight, and even all along the bag’s bottom, top, and sides. On fake bags, the stitches might be uneven, loose, and far apart. There also might be frayed thread and broken stitches. [2] X Research source Pay special attention to the stitches on the handles. Goyard artisans usually double-stitch the handle to ensure it’s firmly attached while still maintaining their impeccable stitching. The handle stitching on fake bags typically looks messy and less tight in comparison. Check the stitching on the pochette inside the bag, too. The stitching on the small pouch attached to the bag is also even and tight. If the bag is fake, the pochette may have messy, loose, and uneven stitches."

      "title": "Determine that the lining is made of unbleached canvas.",
      "content": "Determine that the lining is made of unbleached canvas. The inside of authentic Goyard bags is made of an uncoated Goyardine canvas fabric that is also soft and durable. The canvas is unbleached, so it has an off-white color. A fake Goyard bag’s lining might be a lower-quality canvas, very rough, and the wrong shade of white (too dark, too light, or very bright white). [3] X Research source Some Goyard handbags and luggage bags are lined with yellow leather. Always compare the bag you’re looking at to images of authentic bags to ensure you’re getting the real deal."

    {
      "title": "Look for a precisely stamped “GOYARD” logo inside the pochette.",
      "content": "Look for a precisely stamped “GOYARD” logo inside the pochette. Goyard tote bags come with a pochette (small pouch) that’s sewn to the handle and stays inside the bag. On authentic bags, the inside flap of the pochette is stamped with 3 lines reading “GOYARD,” “PARIS,” “MADE IN FRANCE.” The stamp is centered, and the letters are crisp and easy to read. On fake bags, the stamp might be off-center, poorly stamped, or stamped too deeply, and hard to read. [4] X Research source On real bags, “GOYARD” and “MADE IN FRANCE” are evenly spaced and stacked right on top of each other. Fake bags might not get this detail right. Look at the pochette itself, too . The pochette is made of the same coated Goyardine canvas on the outside and unbleached canvas on the inside. Fake pochettes might be made of plastic or a flimsy, low-quality canvas. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Check that the Goyardine pattern is crisp and made of oval points.",
      "content": "Check that the Goyardine pattern is crisp and made of oval points. Goyard bags are famous for their Goyardine print, which is made of colored oval dots that form a “Y” chevron pattern. The pattern is crisp and precise but painted by Goyard artisans, so it has a clear hand-made touch. On fake bags, the pattern might be messy and careless or obviously look like it was printed on the bag, giving it a pixelated or blurry appearance. [6] X Research source The oval dots on the top of the “Y” are vertical, while the dots on the bottom are angled. There are usually 14 to 16 dots on each line of the “Y” pattern. Fake bags might add too many or too few dots. Check that “GOYARD,” “HONORE,” and “PARIS” are painted into the pattern . These words form the “Y” shape in several places on the bag. The font is rounded and loose, but on fakes, it might be too square or pointed."

      "title": "Ensure a 9-digit serial code is stamped on the bag.",
      "content": "Ensure a 9-digit serial code is stamped on the bag. All authentic Goyard bags are stamped with a serial code made up of 3 letters and 6 numbers. The code corresponds to where and when the bag was made. Fake bags might not include the serial code. Even if they do, the code might not match up with the bag you’re looking at. [7] X Research source 3 letter code : Goyard has a short list of letters they use for the first part of the serial code, including “BAE,” “MAE,” “PIR,” “AAS,” “ARO,” “BAL,” “ABA,” “ADM,” “SUT,” “VAE,” and “SAL.” Any other sequence of letters may mean the bag is fake. 6-digit code : The middle 4 numbers correspond to the year the bag was made while the first and last numbers correspond to the month. So the code “020217” means the bag was made in July of 2021. Make sure the date on the serial code matches the date your bag was made. The serial code is usually stamped on the leather strap that connects to the pochette, the lip of the leather lining inside the bag, or the leather tab inside the interior pocket. The stamp itself is thin, clear, and in a simple sans-serif font. It is also subtle and not deeply engraved. If the code is a serif font, thick, or deeply stamped, the bag is likely fake."

      "title": "Check that the bag stands upright and is a standard size.",
      "content": "Check that the bag stands upright and is a standard size. Authentic Goyard bags are known for their ultra-chic and structured designs, so they easily hold their shape and stand up straight. The bags also come in standard sizes and are always uniform. Fake bags might lose their shape, flop over, and come in non-standard sizes (i.e., too large or too small for the style they’re replicating). [8] X Research source For instance, Saint Louis bags come in 2 sizes: PM (34x15x28 cm) and GM (40x20x34 cm)."

      "title": "Look for upright and sturdy leather handles.",
      "content": "Look for upright and sturdy leather handles. The handles on authentic Goyard bags are made of a soft, durable, and high-quality leather. They stand straight up and don’t flop over. The handles on fake bags might be made of plastic, feel flimsy, and flop over easily. They might also be significantly longer or shorter than the handles on a real bag. [9] X Research source Pay attention to the construction of the handles. Again, the stitching is tight and neat, where it connects to the bag and along the strap. There is no exposed, raw leather or loose, frayed stitching."

      "content": "Confirm that the hardware is shiny, durable, and stamped with “GOYARD.” The buttons, clasps, zippers, and other hardware on Goyard bags are usually made out of gold or silver. The hardware is bright, shiny, and durable. The front of the buttons and claps are usually engraved with a “G” while the underside is engraved with “GOYARD PARIS.” [10] X Research source The end of the zippers typically form a “G.” The bag might be fake if the hardware is made out of plastic or low-quality metal. The hardware might also look dull and feel flimsy or breakable."

      "content": "Ensure the dustbag is yellow and made of high-quality cotton. Goyard bags usually come in a deep, mustard-yellow dust bag that’s made of soft, high-quality cotton. The front of the bag is printed with Goyard’s “G” logo and their address in Paris. The words are centered on the bag and printed in a clear, sans-serif font. If the bag is fake, the bag might be the wrong shade of yellow, the logo might be uncentered and blurry, and the font size and type might be incorrect (i.e., too small, uneven spacing, uses serifs). [11] X Research source Note : If you’re buying a pre-owned Goyard bag, the owner may have lost the dust bag it came in. So, check out other aspects of the bag to ensure it’s real."

If you’re shopping for a pre-owned Goyard bag on eBay, Depop, Poshmark, or a luxury bag forum, ask the seller to send you detailed photos of the bag so you can authenticate it yourself. Also, read reviews from other buyers who’ve bought from them to determine if they’re trustworthy. If people report buying fake items from them, you probably want to buy a Goyard from someone else. Compare the images of the bag you’re looking at to images of the bag on Goyard’s website . Make your purchase with a credit card, if possible. If it turns out that your Goyard bag is fake, you can dispute the charge with your credit card company to get your money back if the seller refuses to refund you.

If a website or seller is only asking a couple hundred dollars for a Goyard bag, stay away—a huge deal on one of these luxury bags is almost always a sign that it’s fake."

      "content": "Goyard makes a limited amount of bags and only sells them in stores. One of the biggest reasons Goyard bags are rare and difficult to buy is that they only make a small amount of bags each year. Every bag is hand-made with luxury materials, so it takes a long time to produce new bags. Additionally, Goyard does not sell their products online; you have to purchase their products from one of their boutiques. [13] X Research source Check Goyard’s website for a list of their boutique locations . Goyard sometimes makes sales online if their buyers aren’t close to a boutique. Simply fill out the form on their website to request a distant sale."
