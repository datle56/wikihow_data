Relationships will last longer if both partners are healthy, stable, and confident in themselves.

If you work on yourself in this way, you might find that you end up meeting somebody who shares your interests and desires. Moreover, if you do not end up meeting your soulmate in this way, you will still have improved yourself and learned new skills."

However, all strong, close, lasting relationships will involve conflicts and disagreements. Studies show that couples tend to be more satisfied with their partners when they think of their love as a journey or pathway. Try to frame your own search for a soulmate in these terms: you're not looking for a perfect, harmonious match. Instead, you're looking for a partner to walk the journey of life with, including the positives and negatives. [12] X Research source Another way to phrase this is that you should be looking for somebody to grow with, not just somebody who was destined to meet you. Framing your love as destiny instead of as a journey is especially harmful during conflicts or arguments. During happy periods, there is not as much of a distinction.
