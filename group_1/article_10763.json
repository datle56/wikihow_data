You can download SQL Server from Microsoft's website . For a free option, choose Developer or Express . You can also choose Windows , Mac , or Linux , but these versions of SQL Server are not free. You can, however, get a free trial by filling in your information on the respective download page for each version. If you are connecting to an SQL Server hosted on a different computer, you don't need to install SQL Server yourself."

Note: Once you get to the last page (after SQL Server is installed), note the instance name. By default, it should be something like SQLEXPRESS , but yours may be different. You'll need that to open up the instance in SQL Server Management Studio. Before closing the installer, click Connect to connect to your instance. If you want to create another SQL Server instance easily, simply re-run this installer."

This software is available for free from Microsoft and allows you to connect to and manage your SQL server from a graphical interface instead of having to use the command line. You can download it from Microsoft's website . In order to connect to a remote instance of an SQL server, you will need this or similar software. Mac users can use open-source programs such as DbVisualizer or SQuirreL SQL. The interfaces will be different but the same general principles apply.

If you already have a server up and running and have the permissions necessary to connect to it, you can enter the server address and authentication information. If you want to create a local database, follow these steps: Ensure that Database Engine is chosen in the \"Server type\" dropdown. Enter .\\[instance name] in the \"Server name\" field. For example, if your instance is named SQLEXPRESS , you'd write .\\SQLEXPRESS . Choose Windows Authentication in the \"Authentication\" dropdown. Check the box next to Trust server certificate .

To create this, enter \"ID\" in the Column Name field, type int into the Data Type field, and uncheck the \"Allow Nulls.\" Click the Key icon in the toolbar to set this column as the Primary Key. You don't want to allow null values because you always want the entry to be at least \"1\". If you allow nulls, your first entry will be \"0\". In the Column Properties window, scroll down until you find the Identity Specification option. Expand it and set \"(ls Identity)\" to \"Yes\".

Setting a limit ensures that your database size stays manageable. Phone numbers should be stored with this format, as you don't perform mathematical functions on them. int - This is for whole numbers and is typically used in the ID field. decimal(x,y) - This will store numbers in decimal form, and the numbers within the parentheses denote the total number of digits and the number of digits following the decimal, respectively.
