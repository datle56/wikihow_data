      "content": "Work in a well-ventilated area. Your lighter still has a small amount of butane in it, which is combustible and can irritate your eyes and skin. Purge and refill your lighter in an open space or work in a well-ventilated room with an open window or fan to improve air circulation. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a flat, sturdy surface to work on. Use a clean and stable surface like a desk, countertop, or table. When you purge your lighter, the remaining butane in the lighter’s tank may spray out onto your working surface, so lay down some newspaper or a drop cloth when you're refilling it. [2] X Research source If you're working outside, make sure you use a surface that's clean and dry so you don't get any dirt or moisture in your lighter."

      "title": "Allow the lighter to cool off completely before refilling it.",
      "content": "Allow the lighter to cool off completely before refilling it. Don't refill your lighter immediately after you've used it. Butane is highly combustible, so allow enough time for your lighter to completely cool off before you try to fill up the tank. [3] X Research source If you recently used your lighter, wait at least 30 minutes before you refill it."

      "title": "Turn the flame adjuster knob to the lowest height with a screwdriver.",
      "content": "Turn the flame adjuster knob to the lowest height with a screwdriver. Use a small screwdriver to turn the dial clockwise as far as it will go. Putting your lighter at the minimal height setting keeps the refilling opening tight and helps reduce the amount of air that could get into the tank. This adjusting screw is a larger brass screw with a slot for a screwdriver, and it’s usually on the bottom of the lighter. [4] X Research source Some butane lighters come with a special key to turn the adjusting screw. Your lighter may have a wheel to adjust the flame height instead of a screw, so you don't need to use a screwdriver to set it to the minimum setting. Don't force the screw. If it isn't turning any more, it may already be set to the minimum setting."

      "title": "Push the refilling valve with your screwdriver to let out the gas inside.",
      "content": "Push the refilling valve with your screwdriver to let out the gas inside. This valve is usually right next to the height-adjusting screw and looks like a small hole in the bottom of your lighter. Hold the lighter away from your face and press down on the valve with the end of the screwdriver to open it. Keep the valve open until you no longer hear a hissing sound. [5] X Research source Any leftover air or gas in the lighter can prevent the butane from being injected into it and can break your lighter. Any long, sharp tool will work for this step, including something like a pen or pencil."

      "title": "Hold the lighter in an upside-down position.",
      "content": "Hold the lighter in an upside-down position. To avoid accidentally injecting air into the lighter, always refill it in an upside-down position. Injecting air into the lighter can dilute the fuel inside of it and can cause the lighter to malfunction. [6] X Research source Holding the lighter upside-down means you’ll also hold the can of butane upside-down when you refill your lighter."

      "content": "Shake the butane refill can to prime it. Inside the can of butane is the butane as well as a propellant. The heavier butane will settle at the bottom of the can so shake the bottle 5 or 6 times to prime it and mix up its contents. [7] X Research source"

Don't hold the lighter at an angle or it could bend the stem of the can and possibly let air in. It should fit snuggly over the valve. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Pump butane into the lighter in 3-second bursts. Press the stem of the butane can into the refill valve in 3-second bursts to inject the butane. Depending on how empty the lighter is, it may take 2-3 bursts to fill it. When the lighter is full, the butane will start to leak from the stem and won't go into the lighter. [9] X Research source Some lighters have a gauge that shows the fuel level. Check the gauge to see if it’s full. Don't overfill the lighter. As soon as it feels full, stop adding butane. If you notice a high-pitched hissing sound or see butane leaking out even before the tank is full, this might be because you’re holding the can or lighter at an angle instead of straight up and down."

      "content": "Turn the flame adjuster back up to your desired height. Now that the lighter has been refilled with butane, use your screwdriver to turn the flame height adjusting dial back up. You don't need to turn it up all the way, but you do want to increase the height so the lighter can be tested properly. [10] X Research source If you spilled any butane on your fingers or the outside of the lighter, wipe it off before testing the lighter. Keeping the lighter set at the minimum setting can make it harder to start, especially if it was completely out of fuel."

      "title": "Wait 5 minutes to allow the butane to reach room temperature.",
      "content": "Wait 5 minutes to allow the butane to reach room temperature. You’ll probably notice that your lighter feels cold to the touch when you fill it with butane. This is because the butane in the can was compressed. However, butane at room temperature burns best. Waiting for these 5 minutes also allows any excess butane that could catch fire on the exterior of the lighter to evaporate. [11] X Research source"

Adjust the flame height to your desired setting, then hold the lighter a safe distance away from you and activate the mechanism that ignites the lighter. There should be an even burning flame. Start and stop the lighter a few times to make sure it flows smoothly. [12] X Research source If the lighter doesn't produce a flame or the flame is really weak, you may need to add more butane. Repeat the steps for filling your lighter and continue to test it until you get a nice, even flame."

      "content": "Store the butane in a secure location that is cool and dry. When you're finished refilling your lighter, put the can of butane in a place that's safe and away from heat. Butane is highly combustible, so you don't want to risk an explosion or fire. [13] X Research source A secure drawer is a safe place to store butane. If you have small children, be sure to store the butane in a hard-to-reach area."
