      "content": "Gather your materials. Before you start your straw set, make sure you have everything you need. Both methods will require the same items: drinking straws, bobby pins, scissors, and a water spray bottle. You will also need a wide tooth comb and a few hair clips for sectioning. Cut the bendable top off of each straw you plan to use. If your straws are already straight throughout with no articulated ends, you can use them as-is. When using straight straws, scissors are no longer required. If your hair takes a long time to dry, you will also need a silk headscarf to sleep in. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow your hair to dry.",
      "content": "Allow your hair to dry. Your hair doesn't need to be clean when styling it, but if you do wash beforehand you will need to let your hair dry first. Avoid using a blow dryer to prevent heat damage. This hair roller method can prevent hair from drying completely. If your hair type retains moisture and you are styling ringlet curls, try to get your hair as dry as possible before you style. [5] X Research source This isn't as important for the poofy look, however, since you will be removing the straws before your hair dries completely. If you have natural textured hair, drying it completely before styling isn't necessary. You can start your straw set while your hair is damp or wet if you choose. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Moisturize and use setting products.",
      "content": "Moisturize and use setting products. This step will keep your hair bouncy and help it last longer, particularly if it tends to dry out. First, use a moisturizing product, like leave-in conditioner. Combine it with one of the setting products below, depending on your hair type. If you have fine hair, use a mousse or spray. If you have medium to thick hair with a natural wave, opt for a gel or cream. With relaxed hair, try a trio of leave-in conditioner, wrapping lotion, and castor oil."

    {
      "title": "Detangle",
      "content": "Detangle your hair. Run a wide tooth comb through your hair to work out any tangles. Tangles will ruin the sleek look of ringlet curls but will not detract from the messy 1980s style. However, incorporating tangled hair into either method can result in knots that are even harder to remove."
    },
    {
      "title": "Section",
      "content": "Section your hair. Separate a 3 inches (7.6 cm) “mohawk” section down the middle of your scalp, around your part and down the back of your head. This will divide your hair into thirds, which are generally good for hair rolling. Comb your hair out and away from your scalp and clip each section in place. Leave the first section you plan on styling loose. How many parts you will section your hair into will be determined by hair length and thickness as well as the amount you feel comfortable working with at a time. You can do a few more sections if your hair is very thick or long."

      "title": "Select and moisten a strand of your hair at the back of your head.",
      "content": "Select and moisten a strand of your hair at the back of your head. With your fingers, separate a small section of hair at the back of one of your side sections. This will let you work forwards towards your face, getting easier and easier as you go. Moisten the strand slightly with the water spray bottle. Remember that the thicker the strand, the bulkier each curl will be. Use a lot of hair per roller if you want only a few curls. [7] X Research source For thin coils, use sections that are roughly an inch wide. These will be separated into smaller pieces later on. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll your hair tightly onto a straw. Start with the bottom tip of your hair and wrap it around near one end of the first straw. Roll the straw up your hair until the entire strand is coiled or you run out of space on your straw. Be sure to keep the strand taut on the straw without pulling your hair to the point of discomfort. For the tightest ringlets, roll your hair flat onto the straw. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source If you are going for long, lean spiral, coil the strand around the straw. Instead of flattening your hair against the straw, keep the section rounded. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure the straw in place with a bobby pin. Take a bobby pin and clip the straw-wrapped hair strand near its roots. Slide the bobby pin across the center of the straw and through the hair you're securing it to. Later on, you may start to run out of space and may need to clip to a different wrapped strand instead."

      "title": "Wrap the next strand around a new straw.",
      "content": "Wrap the next strand around a new straw. Secure each new finished strand with a bobby pin. Work your way around your head until all of your hair has been wrapped. Keep the sections at a consistent size and coil pattern. While this method works with many different ringlet sizes and styles, you want each strand to be as similar as possible. Multiple curl types may be used by an experienced stylist when creating more adventurous hairdos, but it is a difficult look to pull off."

      "title": "Leave the straws in your hair until it is completely dry.",
      "content": "Leave the straws in your hair until it is completely dry. Depending on your hair type, this may take anywhere from three hours to overnight. When drying overnight, wrap your hair with a silk scarf or a bathing cap. If you remove the straws while your hair is still damp, your hair will look more similar to a messy 1980s-style perm. While this is another great look, it's very different from the ringlets you were probably going for. Don't waste all the time you spent rolling and waiting by rushing at the end."

      "content": "Carefully remove the straws. Free each curl one at a time. Start by unclipping its bobby pin. Next, simply unwrap your hair by rolling the straw in the opposite direction. Depending on your hair type, just unclipping the bobby pin may cause the strand to unwrap itself. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Style your hair as desired.",
      "content": "Style your hair as desired. After removing the straws, your hair is likely to be a single layer of a relatively few strands. To add depth and fullness to your hair, use your fingers to carefully separate each large coil into multiple smaller ones. Slide your hands under your hair and gently shake the strands up to make the curls looser. Keep in mind that the hair texture you begin with will impact your hair's final look. However, it's not always possible to predict how this style will come out in your hair until you try it. If your hair is naturally straight and doesn't tend to hold shape well, a little hairspray will help your curls to last longer. You must also be careful to avoid brushing out your new curls as you style. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Select and moisten the first strand of hair. Spritz water onto the section you'd like to start with. The smaller the sections, the more volume your hairdo will have. Keep in mind that this method works best for long, straighter hair that lacks natural volume."

      "content": "Remove the straws while your hair is still slightly damp. Wait about two to three hours first to allow the curls to set. Unclip the bobby pins and then unravel the strands by hand. Use your fingers to gently fluff out your coils into \"big hair.\" Add a small amount of hair oil to soften your hair to make it easier to work with. Keep in mind that this method intentionally adds tangles and frizz to create volume. Combing it will be difficult. Use your fingers to arrange your hair for any final styling."
