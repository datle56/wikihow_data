      "content": "Cut the paw hair if it’s covering the paw pads or you see them slipping. The fur on your dog’s paws helps to protect their skin. You generally do not need to cut the paw fur unless you notice the fur covering up the paw pads on the bottom of their feet. When this happens, the hair can trip your dog up and cause them to slide around on slicker surfaces. This is a common sign that you need to cut the hair on its feet. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Short-haired breeds may only need a slight trim once every 2-3 years. Long-haired breeds may require paw trimming every 4-6 months. It really depends on the specific dog breed and the quality of its coat. Trim your dog’s paws when it’s in a docile and pleasant mood. If it’s extremely excited or especially agitated, it will be much harder to get it to hold still while you trim its paws.

      "content": "Grab the first paw up while your dog is standing or lying down. If your dog is standing up, pull the back foot up away from its body and angle it gently towards you. If your dog prefers lying down, roll it onto its back or side to keep its paw raised up and facing you. If it’s on its side and won’t stay on its back, angle the paw up gently towards you. [3] X Research source Give your dog lots of praise if it cooperates! Don’t forcibly grab and hold your dog. If it becomes distressed or resists when you try to hold its paw, work up to it slowly. [4] X Expert Source Lancy Woo Certified Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. First touch your dog on a part of its leg that it’s comfortable with, then gradually work your way closer to its paw. Praise your dog when it accepts your touch. It should get used to having its paws handled over time. Do the back feet first. Your dog may nip at you if you start with the front paws and it isn’t in the mood for some grooming, but it’ll likely relax by the time you get to the front paws if you start in the back. If your dog loves belly rubs, enlisting a friend to give your pup some gentle pats while you’re trimming is a great way to keep it still."

      "content": "Raise the hair up with a small, soft-bristled comb. Get a small, soft-bristled brush or comb designed for dog grooming. Hold the paw steady and brush the hair in between the paw pads away from the center of the foot to lift it up. On top of the foot, spread the toes out by hand and brush the hair up towards the ankle. Lifting the hair up makes it much easier to cut any matted hair or clumps of fur that are hiding between the pads and toes. [5] X Research source The smaller the comb, the easier this will be. At the pet store, look for combs designed for small dogs with fine coats. These tend to be the best option when it comes to combing up the paw hair."

Carefully trim the hair sticking out past the paw pads. Start in the center of the foot and work the blades in between each paw pad to cut the excess hair. Work slowly and use your free hand to spread the paw pads out away from the hair that you’re trimming. [6] X Research source Professional groomers usually use electric clippers to trim the hair between the pads, but it’s much easier to use scissors if you’re doing it yourself. The wide comb on the tip of a shaver is pretty difficult to navigate around the pads if you don’t have any experience."

Trim the exposed hair back far enough so that the fur in between the pads sits flush with surface of the paw pads.

      "content": "Remove mats, knots, and tangles by brushing or cutting them off. If you find any clumps of knots, mats, or tangled fur, first try brushing the problem area 3-4 times. If you can remove the issue with your comb, cut the hair back the same as the rest of the paw. If the problem can’t be combed out, cut the problematic fur off completely using your scissors or a small set of electric clippers. To use the clippers, turn them on, set them to the lowest power setting, and gently brush the fur you want to cut with the flat edge of the clippers. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Mats and tangles are particularly problematic when they’re in between the paw pads since they tend to cause pain when they get too big. It is better to use an electric clipper for particularly difficult mats. Cutting a really tough mat with scissors may irritate your dog’s skin as the blades tug the hair out of the skin."

Grab some dog-safe nail clippers and trim back the front 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of the first nail. Only trim the very tip of the nail to avoid cutting into the nerves and blood vessels inside of the dog’s toenail.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source It’s best if you cut the tip of the nail at a 45° angle towards the back of the paw. This will dramatically decrease the odds that you cut the nerve inside of each nail. You really only need to dull the very tip of the nail. Dogs have nerves and blood vessels that run through the center of their toenails and it’s essential that you do not damage them. Be extra careful while cutting your dog’s back nails, since it can be very difficult to see the quick (the bundle of nerves and blood vessels) in the rear nails. If you have any doubts, take your dog to a vet or groomer for a trim, or just file the nails down with an emery board."
