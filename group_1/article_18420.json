If you have a preexisting condition like high blood pressure or high cholesterol, your doctor may advise against gaining weight. Always take your doctor's advice seriously before making this kind of change. Certain medical conditions will require you to keep your weight up. Thyroid problems, digestive health issues, diabetes, and cancers may all lead to severe weight loss that may endanger your health. Being underweight can lead to health risks like a weakened immune system, anemia, hair loss, and decreased bone density.

      "content": "Set your goal. You'll need a clear plan as you proceed with your weight-gain plan. How much do you want to gain? By when? By figuring this out and drawing up a schedule, you'll be able to gain weight more effectively. Start by figuring out how much weight you want to gain. This can either be a personal goal, or one you've worked out with your doctor or dietitian. Either way, you need a concrete number in mind to start your progress. Remember, the basic way the body gains weight is when you take in more calories than you burn. So when drawing up your plan, you should figure out how much you need to eat every day to offset the amount of calories you burn. There are various ways to calculate this.

      "content": "Plan to start slowly. Flooding your body with hundreds of more calories than it's used to is dangerous for your heart, blood pressure, digestion, and other body systems. Work your way up gradually to acclimate your body to the increased caloric intake. Start off with 200 extra calories a day for a week or so, then increase to 300, and so on. This will help you avoid an initial shock when you start your weight-gain regimen. Break your weight-gain down into stages. Determine how much you would like to gain per week or month. That way, you can ease your body into the weight increase instead of starting off too quickly. Just like with losing weight, gaining weight should come gradually. Gaining about 1/2 to 1 pound per week is a healthy way to go (done by adding 250 to 500 more calories to your daily intake).

Saturated and trans fats will help you gain weight, but they'll also increase your cholesterol and your risk of heart disease. Unsaturated fats, however, help reduce your risk of heart disease and boost your immune system. Make sure every meal you have includes some fat. [8] X Research source When gaining weight, you'll want to focus on these \"good fats\" to help beef up your body fat while still getting necessary nutrients that your body needs.
