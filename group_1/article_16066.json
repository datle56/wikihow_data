      "title": "Say you simply missed their text.",
      "content": "Say you simply missed their text. With the constant stream of notifications coming through on phones nowadays, it’s completely plausible that their text got lost in the mix. In fact, 18.7 billion texts are sent worldwide each day, and this doesn’t even include direct messages in apps! [1] X Research source If you tell someone that their text got buried in your notifications, they’ll likely understand, and chances are they’ve even been in the same situation themselves. What to say: “Hey, I’m so sorry for the late response! I completely missed this text somehow.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you were multitasking and you just forgot to hit the “send” button.",
      "content": "Say you were multitasking and you just forgot to hit the “send” button. This excuse may seem far-fetched, but it’s actually super plausible. Multitasking takes up a lot of mental energy, and it increases the likelihood of mistakes when you’re trying to do a relatively complex task, like texting. [2] X Research source If you were trying to do two things at once, it would be possible to write out a response but forget to press “send.” What to say: “Oh my gosh, I wrote out a response to this text while I was doing my workout this morning, but I got distracted and forgot to press send. My bad!”"

      "title": "Spotty cell-phone reception is a super common problem.",
      "content": "Spotty cell-phone reception is a super common problem. In fact, cell phone reception has been getting worse recently, with users reporting more coverage problems in 2023 than they did in previous years. [3] X Research source As a result, an issue with your reception is a completely plausible excuse. The only caveat is that this excuse works best for a delay of a few hours, rather than a few days, since you probably wouldn’t be stuck in a location with bad cell reception for a prolonged period of time. What to say: “I’m so sorry for the delayed response! I was on a hike and didn’t have reception.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say your phone ran out of battery and you didn’t have a charger.",
      "content": "Say your phone ran out of battery and you didn’t have a charger. This has happened to most people who have cell phones, so the other person will likely understand. Like the previous excuse, this one works best for a delay of a few hours, rather than several days, since it’s unlikely you wouldn’t have access to a charger for that long of a time. What to say: “Hey! Sorry for taking so long to get back to you. My phone died in the middle of the day and I didn’t have a charger with me.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Most people understand that you need to put your phone away at work.",
      "content": "Most people understand that you need to put your phone away at work. This is especially true during meetings, when you need to respect people who are speaking and give your full attention to the discussion at hand. If you tell the other person that you were in an important meeting when they texted, they’ll probably get why you weren’t able to respond right away. What to say: “Sorry for the delayed response! I was in an important meeting at work all morning.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Classrooms often have no cell-phone rules.",
      "content": "Classrooms often have no cell-phone rules. In fact, some teachers even collect students’ cell phones at the start of class, and some schools ban cell-phone use during the whole school day. [4] X Research source If you’re a student, this makes the perfect excuse for a delayed text response. What to say: “Hey, sorry I missed your text! My phone was off because I was in class.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you silenced or turned off your phone to focus while studying.",
      "content": "Say you silenced or turned off your phone to focus while studying. This is a super common practice, since phones can be so distracting and prevent you from being productive during study sessions. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The other person will likely understand this excuse, especially if you actually do have a big test coming up. What to say: “Sorry for taking all day to text you back! I turned my phone off so I could focus on studying for the test on Monday.”"

    {
      "title": "When you have a super busy day, it’s easy to forget to reply to texts.",
      "content": "When you have a super busy day, it’s easy to forget to reply to texts. The other person will probably understand this situation because they’ve likely been in the same situation themselves before. Simply let them know that you had a hectic day, and you weren’t able to reply to their message until you got home. What to say: “Hey, so sorry for not getting back to you until now! I was running around doing errands all day, and I finally just made it back to my place.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you were driving somewhere, and it took a long time.",
      "content": "Say you were driving somewhere, and it took a long time. Texting and driving is incredibly dangerous (and illegal), so the other person will understand why you weren’t looking at your phone while you were in the car. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. government agency responsible for writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Go to source Just make sure you come up with a story about where you were driving to or from, in case they ask. What to say: “Sorry it took me so long to text you back! I was driving back from a doctor’s appointment that was pretty far from my place.”"

      "title": "It’s bad etiquette to text while seeing a movie at a theater.",
      "content": "It’s bad etiquette to text while seeing a movie at a theater. Since this is such a widely known fact, being at the movies is the perfect excuse for a delayed text response. The only downside is that this excuse only works for a delay of a few hours, since most movies don't last longer than that. What to say: “My bad! I was seeing a movie with my sister so I didn’t see this text until now.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you were seeing a ballet, opera, or musical.",
      "content": "Say you were seeing a ballet, opera, or musical. The theaters where these shows take place usually instruct attendees to silence their phones during the performance. [7] X Research source Since they have intermissions, operas, ballets, and musicals often last longer than movies as well, so this excuse works for a delay of several hours. What to say: “Sorry for not getting back to you until now! My grandma took me to see an opera this evening and my phone was off.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you were at a party and you weren’t looking at your phone.",
      "content": "Say you were at a party and you weren’t looking at your phone. If you were trying to live in the moment at a social gathering, it would make sense that you weren’t paying much attention to your phone. Just make sure that the other person wouldn’t be offended by being left out of the “party.” For example, you could say that it was a family member’s birthday party, or a party thrown by friends the other person doesn’t know. What to say: “Hey, sorry for missing this text last night! I was at my cousin’s birthday party and didn’t get home until super late.”"

      "title": "Say you silenced your phone to give all your attention to your date.",
      "content": "Say you silenced your phone to give all your attention to your date. It’s considered good dating etiquette to put your phone away so you can be fully present in the moment and get to know the other person. [8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source As a result, it would be pretty understandable if you took awhile to respond to a text while you were on a date with someone. What to say: “So sorry for the late response! I was on a date (it went well 🥰) and I wasn’t looking at my phone.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If they sent the text at nighttime, say you were already in bed.",
      "content": "If they sent the text at nighttime, say you were already in bed. Most people understand that they’re less likely to get an immediate response to a text if they send it late. [9] X Research source Even if they did send it at a reasonable hour of the evening, you can say that you were extra tired that night, so you went to bed earlier than usual. What to say: “Sorry I didn’t reply to this last night. I was exhausted after work and ended up falling asleep super early.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say that you didn’t reply because you were sick.",
      "content": "Say that you didn’t reply because you were sick. If you had a migraine, food poisoning, cold, or the flu, it would be completely understandable that you weren’t on top of replying to texts. This excuse works well if you didn’t respond to the other person for a few days, but just make sure to keep up with your story. It's a good idea, for example, to make sure you didn’t post any photos of yourself out and about while you were supposed to be \"sick.\" What to say: “Hey! Sorry for going missing for the past couple of days. I caught a terrible cold and I’ve been sleeping it off.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If you still live at home, say your parents took your phone away.",
      "content": "If you still live at home, say your parents took your phone away. This is a pretty plausible excuse, as parents often take away their childrens’ phones when they’re grounded. [10] X Research source This excuse works well if you didn’t reply to the other person for a week or two, since it’s possible to get grounded for that long. If you do use this excuse, just make sure the other person hasn’t seen you being active on social media when you were supposed to be “grounded.” What to say: \"So sorry I didn't reply to this earlier. I was grounded for this past week and my parents took my phone away.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you’ve had a lot going on in your life recently.",
      "content": "Say you’ve had a lot going on in your life recently. When someone is dealing with family issues, work stress, or friend drama, it may be harder to stay on top of their texts. As a result, these types of personal problems make good excuses if you haven’t replied to someone in awhile. Since these things can be sensitive topics, the other person will likely accept your excuse at face value without prying. What to say: “I’m really sorry it’s taken me so long to reply to your text. I’ve been dealing with a lot of drama with my family recently, but things are finally starting to calm down.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you were taking time to process what they said.",
      "content": "Say you were taking time to process what they said. This excuse works well if the other person sent you an emotionally charged text and you didn’t reply right away. For example, if your ex texted you saying that they want to try to be friends, you could say that you needed to figure out how you felt about the situation before texting them back. What to say: “Hey, I apologize for taking a while to text you back. To be honest, I was surprised to hear from you, and I needed to take a second to process my feelings and decide what I wanted to say.”"

      "title": "In this digital age, it’s common to get anxious or overwhelmed by texts.",
      "content": "In this digital age, it’s common to get anxious or overwhelmed by texts. People are expected to be available through their devices almost 24/7, and this can easily lead to stress and digital burnout. [11] X Research source To combat this, many people go on temporary digital detoxes . For some, this means taking a break from their phone for a couple hours. Others do more extreme cleanses from their devices for a few days. As long as you weren’t publicly active on your device, you can easily use a digital detox as your excuse. What to say: “Sorry for being gone for so long! I was doing a digital detox over the past few days because I've been feeling a bit anxious lately.”"
