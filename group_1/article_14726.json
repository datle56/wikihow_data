      "content": "Your baby will be comfy in a long-sleeved bodysuit, sweater, jacket, and hat. For the first layer, you could also swap a bodysuit with a long-sleeved shirt and pants. On top of those clothes, throw on a light jacket to protect your baby from wind or unexpected chill as needed. Make sure your little one's feet are covered, too—so if you're not using a footsie bodysuit, dress your baby in socks and booties. Heat escapes most through your baby’s head and feet. So even if it doesn't feel too cold to you, hats are a must as well."

      "content": "Dress your baby in one more layer than you're wearing yourself. This is a great rule of thumb if you're unsure how much bundling your baby needs. Walk outside and determine how many layers you need to feel comfortable in the cold. Then, dress your baby in one additional layer. Babies can't regulate their temperatures as well as adults can, so if you're cold, then your baby definitely is too. [1] X Research source So, for example, if you’re in a sweater and pants, dress your baby in a t-shirt, sweater, pants, and a jacket. If you’re in a jacket, dress your baby in a thick coat. You get the idea!"

      "title": "Pack a few light layers just in case the temperature drops.",
      "content": "Pack a few light layers just in case the temperature drops. Because your baby has trouble regulating their internal temp, layers will be super helpful while you're outdoors together. As the weather gets colder, throw on new layers to ensure that your baby remains comfortable. [2] X Research source Some layering options are onesies, sweaters, light jackets, coats, gloves, hats, and even snowsuits. When the two of you head outdoors together, blankets are a great idea. If clouds or wind cause a temperature drop, swaddle your baby for warmth."

      "title": "For temps under 50 degrees, dress your baby in a thermal base layer.",
      "content": "For temps under 50 degrees, dress your baby in a thermal base layer. Wool and polyester make for the perfect material choice, but cotton should be avoided. Wet skin can lead to hypothermia on chilly days, so to keep your baby safe, keep them as dry as possible. Merino wool, for instance, absorbs 40% humidity, and on top of that, it can regulate your baby's temperature. [3] X Research source For additional protection, check that your baby's diaper is dry regularly."

      "content": "Protect your baby from wind, rain, and snow with rain guards and jackets. Throw a rain guard over your baby's stroller to keep them warm and dry in the case of unexpected chill or precipitation. Rain jackets, coveralls, or suits can do the job as well. [4] X Research source Note that these products, rain guards especially, will warm your baby up quickly. Because of that, look out for signs of over-heating. Remove a layer from their outfit and pay close attention to their comfort level afterward."

      "content": "Watch your baby's skin and behavior to determine if they're cold. If you’re worried that you haven’t dressed your baby in enough layers, look out for signs that they're chilly. If you notice these signs, throw on another blanket: [5] X Research source They're fussy or irritable Their hands, feet, and back of the face feel cold to touch Their skin turns red or pale They're shivering Hypothermia can also cause lethargy. If your baby is unusually silent, still, or low-energy, that could be a sign that they’re dangerously cold. Get inside and perform skin-to-skin cuddling ASAP. Call your doctor right away."

      "content": "Dress your baby in a single layer when the temperature warms up. Though it never hurts to bring along extra layers in case of temperature shifts, when it's 70 degrees or above outside, you should be more concerned with overheating and dehydration than you are with bundling them up. [6] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source As such, your baby will be comfortable in a single layer of clothing, like a long-sleeved onesie (long-sleeved to protect them from sun exposure!)."

      "content": "Pick fabrics that are lightweight and breathable—like cotton. Your baby should be dressed in loose material that can easily trap perspiration. So in addition to cotton, muslin would be favorable over synthetic fibers like polyester. [7] X Research source To allow for more breathability, make sure to dress your baby in sandals. Heat is lost mainly through the head and feet, so as long as their toes are safe in the shade, leaving their feet uncovered would be a great way to cool your baby down."

      "content": "Keep your baby out of direct sunlight as much as possible. On hot days spent outdoors, be sure to equip your baby with sun protection. Either use a wide-brimmed hat with a long flap in the back, a sunshade on their stroller, natural shade, or even an umbrella. Apply sunscreen of at least 30 SPF and keep applying regularly throughout the day.
