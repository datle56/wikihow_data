      "content": "Position your hair into whatever style ponytail you like. You could do a low ponytail at the base of your neck for a sleek, elegant look, or try out a fun side ponytail for a cute, hip style. Create a preppier vibe with a high ponytail, or try parting your hair before you pull it back for a more stylized look. [1] X Research source This look works with every ponytail you could think of, so feel free to try out as many different styles as you like. You can also use this method with braids—just cover the elastic with hair first, and then finish the braided style."

      "title": "Wrap an elastic around your ponytail so that it’ll stay securely in place.",
      "content": "Wrap an elastic around your ponytail so that it’ll stay securely in place. Depending on how thick your hair is, you may need to use a thicker elastic. Wrap it around your ponytail 2-3 times or until it’s tight enough that your hair will stay exactly where you want it. [2] X Research source Since the elastic will be covered with hair, it doesn’t matter what color it is. Avoid using a scrunchie or other types of puffy, textured elastics."

      "title": "Separate a 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) section of hair from the bottom of the ponytail.",
      "content": "Separate a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) section of hair from the bottom of the ponytail. Gather a section that is about as big as the circumference of a pencil. Pull it away from the rest of the ponytail and smooth it out so there aren't any stray hairs pulling from either side. [3] X Research source You could also gather hair from the side of your ponytail instead of from the bottom. Sometimes when you start wrapping the hair around the elastic, a little bump might form; using hair from the bottom of the ponytail guarantees that bump would be hidden. If you have long hair, you shouldn’t have to worry about being able to cover the elastic completely since you can wrap the hair around multiple times. If you have shorter hair, try using a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) piece of hair so that the entire elastic will be covered even if you can only wrap it around 2-3 times."

      "title": "Wrap the hair around the elastic until there is a 1 inch (2.5 cm) tail left.",
      "content": "Wrap the hair around the elastic until there is a 1 inch (2.5 cm) tail left. Depending on how long and thick your hair is, you may have to wrap the elastic with your hair quite a few times. As you wrap, layer the hair so that it isn’t just stacked on top of itself—instead, it should cover about 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of the base of the ponytail. [4] X Research source Pull the hair tighter for a neater, more polished look. Wrap the hair loosely for a more relaxed, natural style."

      "title": "Secure the ponytail by tucking the end of the hair underneath the elastic.",
      "content": "Secure the ponytail by tucking the end of the hair underneath the elastic. It can be helpful to push the hair with the same finger that is holding it rather than trying to use 2 hands. Push it through the elastic closest to your scalp so you don’t risk messing up the layering you just did. [5] X Research source If possible, try to tuck the tail underneath of the ponytail for the neatest look. If it’s tucked through the top of the ponytail, it could stick up and look out of place."

      "title": "Hide any remaining hair by burying it underneath the base of the ponytail.",
      "content": "Hide any remaining hair by burying it underneath the base of the ponytail. If the tail end is noticeably visible, you can tuck it into the hair on your scalp that’s surrounding the ponytail. If you’re worried it will fall out, spritz it with a little hairspray for some extra staying-power. [6] X Research source Once you know what you’re doing, you should be able to create this chic look in just a few minutes, making it a great hairstyle to have in your back pocket."

      "title": "Gather your hair into a loose ponytail and secure it with an elastic.",
      "content": "Gather your hair into a loose ponytail and secure it with an elastic. This style looks great with a low ponytail, but it can also be done with a side ponytail, high ponytail, or even pigtails. Just make sure to not put on the elastic too tightly, as you need a little bit of wiggle room to complete this look. [7] X Research source This look is going to work the best with medium to long hair. If your ponytail is shorter than 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm), it might not fall quite right. The reverse ponytail is great because all you need is a hair elastic."

      "title": "Poke 2 fingers between the elastic and your head to create a hole in your hair.",
      "content": "Poke 2 fingers between the elastic and your head to create a hole in your hair. Essentially, you want to divide the 2 sides of your hair with your fingers to create space for the ponytail to pass through. You can do this from either the top or underside of the ponytail—once you get used to doing this style, you’ll probably have a favorite way that works best for you. [8] X Research source Do your best to make sure there are no stray hairs in the space you created. If there are, they’ll get pulled when you flip the ponytail, which could be painful."

    {
      "title": "Flip your ponytail through the top of the hole you just created.",
      "content": "Flip your ponytail through the top of the hole you just created. Grab the hair right at the base of the hair elastic and pull it through the empty space until the entire ponytail has been pulled through. It helps if you stick 2 fingers through the bottom of the hole and wrap them around the entirety of the ponytail while you pull—that way, there won’t be any loose hairs left behind. [9] X Research source Doing this creates a cover over the hair elastic."

      "title": "Tug on your ponytail to tighten it and smooth it out.",
      "content": "Tug on your ponytail to tighten it and smooth it out. If you have flyaways, use a little spritz of hairspray to keep them under control. For a bigger poof in the back, leave the ponytail fluffed and loose rather than pulling it down and tightening it. [10] X Research source You could add curls to your ponytail or even braid it to create a different look, or just leave it as-is. There’s a tool called the Topsy Tail you can buy to create this look, but you can also mimic the results without purchasing anything new."
