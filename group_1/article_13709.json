      "content": "Know what the VIN looks like. A \"Vehicle Identification Number\" (VIN) is 17-digits and made up of numbers and letters; the number is unique to that specific car. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Try looking for the number through the car's insurance information (vehicle insurance card or insurance policy). Almost every state in the US requires that a car be covered by insurance to drive it on the road. So, if somebody is currently driving it, they will most likely have insurance and an insurance card with the VIN. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the car's registration card or sticker.",
      "content": "Check the car's registration card or sticker. These stickers usually go on the front windshield, on the driver's side (the left side in the US). [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the car itself.",
      "content": "Check the car itself. The number can be located in many places, so you may need to hunt around. Look in such places as on the driver's side below the windshield, driver's side door/door jamb, the front of the engine block and the front end of the frame. It may look like a sticker, a small metal plate or an engraving. Where the VIN number is placed depends on the year and manufacturer of car, so it might be good idea to do an internet search for the VIN using the manufacturer and year."

      "title": "Use a government based title search.",
      "content": "Use a government based title search. In some countries, such as the United States, you can check a used vehicle's history through an online database. For example, in the USA, you can use the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, at http://www.vehiclehistory.gov/ . Click on \"Check Vehicle History\" to find an approved provider. Some US States offer title search databases. Be aware that this search may have limitations if the car has a history outside of the jurisdiction in which you're searching."

    {
      "title": "Choose a car title provider, carefully.",
      "content": "Choose a car title provider, carefully. These services aren't free, so it is important to find a site that you trust, since you're giving them your information. This is why it's recommended that you use a service that has been approved through a government body's site (a government site will have \".gov\" somewhere in the URL). Follow through with the directions on the title search site. This will require you to have your VIN number ready (see step 1). Checking a provider's reputability through the Better Business Bureau is also recommended."

      "title": "Expect to receive a report.",
      "content": "Expect to receive a report. This report should give you information concerning whether the car has been rebuilt, salvaged, spent time in a junk yard, returned to the manufacturer or had its odometer changed to an incorrect mileage."
