      "title": "Start with clean, dry, straight hair.",
      "content": "Start with clean, dry, straight hair. Shampoo your hair, but don’t use any conditioner if possible. Then blow dry your hair or allow it to air dry. If your hair is wavy or curly, straighten it when you blow dry it or use a flat iron before installing the extensions. This will make it easier to section your hair. [1] X Research source If your hair is unmanageable without conditioner, only use it at the ends of your strands. This will help to ensure that the roots of your hair won’t be slippery and will be easier to work with. If your hair is very curly and you cannot get it to stay straight, you may want to have a professional install your extensions."

      "title": "Comb your hair to remove all tangles.",
      "content": "Comb your hair to remove all tangles. Pass through all of your hair with a wide-toothed comb or brush, and then switch to a fine-toothed comb to ensure that your hair is tangle free. If you locate any tangles while combing your hair, start combing near the ends to detangle your hair and move up the shaft as you work through the knot. [2] X Research source If you didn’t already use conditioner, spraying a leave-on conditioner may also be helpful if your hair is very tangled. Just make sure to apply it midway down the strand and below. Don’t apply it to the roots or it will be harder to install the extensions."

      "title": "Divide your hair into 2 equal sections going from ear to ear.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into 2 equal sections going from ear to ear. You won’t be adding extensions to the hair on top of your head, so it’s helpful to put it up. Secure the hair that’s on top of your head with an alligator clip, hair tie, or barrette to keep it out of the way. Then, secure the hair that’s leftover with an alligator clip. [3] X Research source Using an alligator clip will make it easier to undo your hair and pull out new sections of hair as you add the extensions."

      "content": "Comb out a section of hair 1 in (2.5 cm) above the nape of your neck. Use a rattail comb to create a straight line going across the back of your head. Comb through the hair again to remove any tangles. [4] X Research source If you want to start adding the extensions up higher, comb out a section from higher up, such as 2 in (5.1 cm) from the nape of your neck instead."

      "title": "Grasp a bundle of hair the same diameter as the extension.",
      "content": "Grasp a bundle of hair the same diameter as the extension. Select this hair from the top part of the section you combed out at the nape of the neck. Ensure that the first bundle you choose is at least 1 in (2.5 cm) in from your hairline. Use the pointed end of a rattail comb to gather this hair and detangle it again if needed. Hold one of the extensions next to your natural hair to check and then add or remove hair as needed to match them up. [5] X Research source If you have thick hair, this section may need to be smaller than if you have fine hair. Compare the hair to the extension to be sure. Extensions are available in different lengths. You can get extensions that are longer than your natural hair if you want to make your hair seem long as well as fuller, or choose extensions in the same length as your hair if you’re only trying to add volume."

      "content": "Slip your natural hair through the loop at the end of the extension. Micro ring loop extensions have a clear nylon thread loop and a metal ring attached to the top end of the extension. These two components work together to attach the extension near the root of your natural hair. The loop is wide enough to easily slip the section of your hair through it using your fingertips. Bring the loop up the length of the hair section until the ring at the top of the extension is about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) away from your scalp. [6] X Research source For best results, make sure that the extensions you’re using are made from 100% human hair. Synthetic hair looks unnaturally shiny and you cannot use heat styling tools on it.

The end of the loop is located near the ring on the extension and pulling on it will bring your hair down through the ring. Position the extension about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) away from your scalp as you do this. Keep pulling until the entire section of your natural hair is through the ring.

Look for rings that match the color of your hair at the roots as closely as possible. [10] X Research source For example, if your hair is black, then opt for black rings. If your hair is light brown, go with light brown rings."

This is important so that the extension will lie flat. Otherwise, the ring may stick out from the scalp and be noticeable among your natural hair. Then, insert the end of the extension into the ring so that the extension is on top of your natural hair.

Don’t place the extensions right next to each other or they will not blend in with your natural hair as well. Space them out so that there’s a section of hair without an extension attached to it between each of the extension sections. [15] X Research source Repeat this each time you add an extension."

      "content": "Care for hair extensions by keeping them clean, dry, and tangle-free. Shampoo and condition your hair extensions along with your natural hair 1-2 times per week. Use a blow dryer after washing your hair to dry them out, which may take longer than it takes to dry your natural hair since hair extensions are treated to hold in moisture. Put all of your hair into a loose braid or in a loose bun on top of your head before you go to bed to prevent the extensions from getting tangled. Micro ring hair extensions require adjusting every 8-12 weeks, but the hair will last for years if you care for it properly. You should adjust your extension when it's around 1 1 ⁄ 2 to 2 in (3.8 to 5.1 cm) away from your scalp.
