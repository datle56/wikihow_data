Some people find that joining a gym helps them stick to this schedule. That said, it's certainly possible to strength train at home. While traditional weight equipment such as dumbbells and barbells are a common choice, they are not required. Any form of resistance training will help build muscle."

      "content": "Train with heavy weights in the gym. Don't worry about getting too bulky. It is much easier to build muscle with heavier weights. Here's one approach you can use: [5] X Research source Choose a weight that you can perform 5 to 6 reps with per set. The exact weight you choose will depend on your strength when starting. Perform the main 3 weight training exercises regularly. These include bench presses, dead lifts and squats. Do 3 sets of 5 to 6 repetitions. You should rest for 2 to 3 minutes between each set. If you're lifting correctly, you should need those 2 to 3 minutes to recuperate. There are many other exercise plans you can follow with weights. Other weight trainers and gym staff are often happy to suggest approaches as well."

      "content": "Push yourself to the limit in the gym. Go as hard as you can every time. You won't build muscle, lose fat, or achieve many fitness goals if you don't push yourself hard. Consider using a personal trainer, even if it is only to help you make sure that you are doing the right exercises and doing them properly. Consider finding a workout partner who can push you in the gym. Working out as a team can produce greater results than working out alone."

      "content": "Snack healthily throughout the day. The need to eat often may be one of the more enjoyable aspects of muscle gain for many, but be careful. Keep an eye on how many snacks you are eating, and what kind of food it is. You can get many of the muscle-building nutrients you need from regular food, but protein shakes are an acceptable substitute. Sugars are fatty and only supply you with energy in the short term, so shy away from sweet empty calorie snacks. Eat well and often between larger meals. Snacking keeps your metabolism going, allowing you to burn more calories when you're not working out. Whey protein shakes are a healthy post-workout meal that help build your muscle mass."

If you are starting a new muscle-building routine after menopause, start with light weights or relatively low-intensity exercises that tire you after about 12 repetitions. You will be able to increase the weight as you get stronger, but stay within a comfortable range. Menopause causes bone loss and muscle loss, so use caution while you discover your limits. The good news is that regular exercise helps with both of these issues. If you started lifting before menopause, you can continue your usual exercise plan as long as you are comfortable and enjoying the results."

      "content": "Form a balanced exercise plan. Focusing on weight training during and after menopause is a great plan, since it helps maintain bone density. That said, this is also a good time to review the other types of exercise you get, and consider some adjustments: High-impact exercise such as running can be hard on your bones and joints, potentially risking fractures or other injuries. If you have joint pain, consider moving to low-impact aerobic exercise such as biking or swimming. Balance and coordination become more important with age, as weakened bones can make a fall more dangerous. Improve these skills with step classes, dance, or a sport like tennis that requires rapid movement."
