Supportive shoes are especially important when you are doing an activity that causes your foot to strike against the ground, such as walking or running. Look for thick-soled shoes that provide a stable base. The shoes should fit well and offer arch support. [2] X Research source It’s best to shop when your feet are sore and puffy, such as at the end of a long workday. This ensures that your shoes won't be too tight. If you can, get your gait analyzed at a running store or your podiatrist’s office. This can help you find the best shoes for you. [3] X Research source"

You can also buy them online."
