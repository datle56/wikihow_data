      "content": "Turn off the water supply, turn on both handles, and plug the drain. Look under your sink for one or two small valves. Turn the valves clockwise to shut off the water supply to your sink and prevent water from spurting out while you work. [1] X Research source Turn on the faucet so any remaining water runs out. Insert a plug into the drain or pull up on the stopper behind the faucet. Plugging up the sink prevents any screws, parts, or tools from falling down the drain. If you can’t turn off the water under the sink, turn off the water main in your home. Jones says “You’ll likely find the main water shutoff valve on a basement wall facing the front of your house” or “hidden from view inside a closet or wall access panel near the front of the house.” [2] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021."

Use a small flathead screwdriver or utility knife to pry off the cover on the top or side of the handle. Remove the screw underneath with an Allen wrench or screwdriver. [3] X Research source On some two-handled faucets, you may need to unscrew the handle before you can pry off the cap. If the leak is coming from under the tap, unscrew the tap from the base.

[5] X Research source Jones says if the nut “has a chrome or metallic finish… put electrician tape or a rag around it to protect the finish, then use pliers to remove it.” [6] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. This nut holds down the cartridge, a metal and plastic piece inside the handle that turns the water on and off and controls the water flow. Some models may not have a nut. If the nut won’t come off, apply penetrating oil around the screw and let it soak for 10 minutes before trying again."

If the O-ring is worn, Jones says to take it to the hardware store to match it with a new one. If the cartridge is broken, you may have to get “a new replacement cartridge from the faucet’s manufacturer.” [7] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021.

If the faucet stops leaking, that means the hot water handle is the source of the leak, so that’s the side you’ll need to repair. If the faucet keeps leaking, the cold water handle is to blame. [12] X Research source Even if you’re sure the leak is coming from the hot water side, it’s a good idea to turn off the cold water, too—just to avoid getting sprayed if you accidentally turn on the cold water tap. Close the sink drain or cover it with a small towel. That way, if you drop a screw or another small piece, it can’t go down the drain."

Coat the new washer in waterproof grease, push it into place, and replace the screw. [17] X Research source Pop off the old O-rings as well. Get a new O-ring that’s exactly the same size, coat it in waterproof grease, and slide it into place. [18] X Research source Run your finger inside the hole where the valve stem sits.

Compression faucets aren’t as common anymore but can still be found on older sinks. They always have 2 handles and require some pressure to turn them. Ball faucets have a single handle that sits on a dome-shaped base, or cap. Disk faucets have a single handle that sits on a wide cylinder."
