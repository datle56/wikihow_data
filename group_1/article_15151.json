      "content": "Cover a broom with a towel. With your broom’s head pointed up and its handle pointed down, lay a rag or towel over the broom head. Ensure as many of the bristles as possible are covered by the towel. To prevent the towel from falling off during use, wrap a piece of string around the broom head at its thickest point. [2] X Research source If possible, use a microfiber towel."

      "content": "Dust a vertical strip down the wall. Place the broom head against a corner of the wall where it meets the ceiling. Drag the broom down along the wall in a slow, steady motion. After you’re done, evaluate the section of the wall you just dusted. If any dust remains, run the broom along the strip again. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Switch the towel out as needed.",
      "content": "Switch the towel out as needed. At some point, the towel will become too dusty and dirty to be effective. Evaluate the towel after moving about one-third of the way across the wall. If it is excessively dusty, unbind it from the broom and shake it out over the rubbish bin. Toss it in your laundry basket and cover the broom with another towel just as before.

      "title": "Remove dust from the rest of the wall.",
      "content": "Remove dust from the rest of the wall. Move to the space on the wall next to the area you just cleaned. Just as before, place the broom head against the top of the wall and move it down the wall in a vertical strip. [5] X Research source Continue in this way long the entire wall. When you’ve finished the first wall, move to the one next to it and continue the process until the walls have all been dusted."

      "content": "Move the damp mop up and down along the wall. You could start on the left and move to the right, or the other way around, but always start at the top of the wall and move to the bottom. This will ensure that the dust from the upper area of the wall will not fall down to cover an area you already cleaned. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Move along the direction of any wallpaper seams. If you’re dusting a wall that has wallpaper on it, move along the direction of the seams. Typically, this will also mean moving along an up-down axis. But if the wallpaper seams run horizontally across the wall, move the mop along the wall from side to side. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Equip a flat head mop with a dry dusting head or cloth. Ideally, the mop head or cloth will be made of microfiber. The exact process by which you change the dusting cloth or mop head depends on the manufacturer. Generally, however, the process is as simple as laying the new cloth over the flat head of the mop, then moving the clips that bind it to the top of the mop head. [9] X Research source Other flat head mops have replaceable heads that simply slide on. Microfiber cloth excels at collecting dust and is minimally abrasive."

      "content": "Dust the wall with a lambswool duster. A lambswool duster is one of the best options for dusting walls. Because of its elongated design, the best way to use the lambswool duster on walls is to place it in a vertical orientation in the leftmost corner of the wall, then drag it across the wall to the other corner. If necessary, use a ladder as you move across the room. [13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source After dusting the first horizontal strip of the wall, drag the lambswool duster back across the wall in the opposite direction. Dust along a path just below that of the first. Continue in this way until the wall is completely dusted."

      "content": "Use a vacuum to dust the wall. Attach a wall brush extension to your vacuum. Then, vacuum the entire surface of the wall. Move the vacuum’s wall brush extension from the top edge of the wall where it meets the ceiling down to the base of the wall. This will allow you to clean the wall in a complete and consistent manner. [14] X Research source A wall brush extension is a long tube which links the suction end of your vacuum to bristled opening on the other end. Using the wall brush extension will prevent your wall from being damaged as the vacuum tube moves across it."
