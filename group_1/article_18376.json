      "content": "Wait for the right moment. Just throwing out a funny saying that has nothing to do with the situation might work, but it’s just as likely to drop like a lead balloon. Muñoz suggests you try to stay in the moment and react to what’s going on around you. Stay in the flow of the conversation, and wait for a break in the conversation to share a funny saying that fits the topic. This can take practice, though, so you might not get a laugh at first. You’ll get better the more you do it. Payne explains, “You just have to develop a little bit of a tough skin, and know that somebody not laughing at your jokes isn't a personal attack on you or your personality.” He adds, “You start to get the confidence and… you'll get laughs eventually."

      "content": "Use the element of surprise to get a laugh. People love being surprised with the perfect funny line. [7] X Research source If you want your funny saying to land, defy the other person’s expectations. If they think you’re going to say something predictable, they’re more likely to laugh if you say something completely different. Some of the best ways to take advantage of the element of surprise in a funny way are: Keep your funny saying short. The longer it goes on, the more time people have to figure out where you’re going… which can be annoying instead of funny. Misdirect the other person. Starting to say something cliche and then twisting it at the end. For example, famous wit Dorothy Parker once said, “A girl’s best friend is her mutter.” She keeps it short and defies expectations by saying “mutter” instead of “mother.”"

You either have to know someone well enough to know what will make them laugh, or you have to pay attention to the types of things they do laugh at. Do they like clever barbs or subtle references? [8] X Research source Or maybe fart jokes are more their speed. Figure it out and try to match it. Even if they share your sense of humor, they may not laugh if the general mood is more serious or they can’t relate to what you’re saying.
