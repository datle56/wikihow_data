If you enter the bank's name, the country it's located in, the city it's based in (if possible), and the phrase “BIC code” into a search string, you'll almost certainly end up with several results that provide the code. For instance, a Google search for “PNC Bank Pittsburgh USA BIC code” gives numerous results with the correct code of PNCCUS33 for PNC Bank, N.A., based in Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A."

Even if it just mentions a SWIFT code, the two codes are interchangeable. [2] X Research source A BIC code will be either 8 or 11 characters long. They always start with 6 letters, then a mix of letters and/or numbers for the next 2 or 5 characters. PNCCUS33 and PNCCUS33XXX are interchangeable, because \"XXX\" is just a placeholder anytime it's at the end of a BIC code."

There are several websites, such as https://www.iban.com/search-bic.html , that enable you to search for a BIC code if you know the bank's name and location (nation and, if possible, city). Alternatively, you can scroll through alphabetical lists of banks by country to find a BIC code at https://www.theswiftcodes.com/ . For example, both of the above websites give the BIC code for Bank of China's U.K. operations as BKCHGB2L."

For example, the BIC code for the Manchester (U.K.) branch of the Bank of Baroda is BARBGB2LMAN — that is to say, BARB + GB + 2L + MAN. [9] X Research source"
