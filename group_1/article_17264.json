To make it easier to square commonly used single digits, try to memorize basic times tables . [1] X Research source For example, learn how to multiply single digit times tables."

If you read word problems asking you to square a number, keep in mind that they may also ask you to raise the number to the 2 power or factor. This is just another way of asking you to square the number. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source You may also see a problem written as 6^2. This is another way of asking you to square 6."

      "content": "Distinguish between squaring and finding the square root. It's easy to get these terms mixed up, but remember that finding the square root of a number is the opposite of squaring a number. Finding the square root means that you're looking for the number that can be multiplied by itself to get the number in the square. [4] X Research source For example, 9 2 {\\displaystyle 9^{2}} means 9 x 9 = 81 while âˆš9 = 3 because 3 2 {\\displaystyle 3^{2}} is equal to 9."
