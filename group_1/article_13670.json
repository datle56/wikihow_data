When you file a return using electronic filing — or using tax preparation software —your return is much less likely to have errors. The IRS estimates that there's about a 20% error rate with tax returns filled out by hand, whereas tax preparation software only has a 1% error rate. [6] X Research source If you're worried about making mistakes on your tax return, stick with tax preparation software. If you have a complicated tax return, you may benefit from filing manually because you will be able to provide the IRS with 100% of the information rather than the 40% that a tax software program would transmit. Therefore, if you have a complex situation requiring lots of extra forms and schedules, a paper form might be better for you.
