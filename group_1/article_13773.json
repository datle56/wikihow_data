      "content": "Do a \"Google Test\" by taking a selection of 5-20 words of the suspected copyrighted submission, and enter it into a Google search box with quotes around it. By entering the selection of words in quotes , Google will locate any other document on the Internet with those exact same words. If no matches come up, then the document is probably not a copy and paste from a copyrighted source on the web. If Google shows one or more matches for the search, then look at the document to see if it is the source of the submission on wikiHow. The image below shows an exact match of two full sentences between a wikiHow article and another article. This almost certainly indicates that one was copied from the other."

      "content": "Research title ideas to determine which one is most commonly searched. There are two tools that can be used to figure out which phrases people are searching for: Google Suggest. Check your title ideas with Google Suggest or the Google Toolbar search box: In the example given here, the editor is looking for a good title for a wikiHow on \"drifting a car\". The editor types in \"how to drift\" into the Google toolbar and Google suggests several searches with those words. The phrase at the top of the list is the most commonly searched. This inquiry shows that \"How to Drift a Car\" is more likely to be searched--and is therefore more likely to be found by people who seek these instructions--than, for example, \"How to Drift in a Car\" which is lower down the list. Pay no attention to the number of results on the right side of the phrase. The phrases that are most frequently searched are listed at the top, and the lower you go down the list, the fewer people are searching it on Google. Choose the phrase that's highest on the list while still fitting the content of the article appropriately. Google Ads Keyword Tool. This tool is more complex but can be useful when dealing with more diverse phrases. Visit the Google AdWords Keyword Tool if the phrases you're considering don't start off similarly, which is what is necessary to use Google Suggest as a comparison tool. For example, which of the following phrases is more popular? How to make a website How to create a website How to make a webpage How to create a webpage Type in all of the phrases in the search box, as shown. Type in the captcha security code, if necessary (you normally only need to do it for your first query). Press the \"Get Keyword Ideas\" button. Scroll down to see the list that's generated. Click on the \"Avg Search Volume\" heading (circled in red in the image) so that the phrases are re-ordered with the most commonly searched phrase at the top of the list. When the phrases are ordered so that the ones with the highest average search volume are at the top, choose the phrase that's highest on the list while still fitting the content of the article appropriately. In this case, that's \"How to make a website\"."
