      "content": "Add the highlight and shading. The light and shade are on either side of an object in a drawing. For example, if the highlight is on the top right, shade the bottom left. Get inspiration from other artists to keep improving your hearts. If you find a drawing you particularly like, trace over it or copy it to get the feeling of how to draw it."

      "title": "Draw two overlapping circles.",
      "content": "Draw two overlapping circles. To make the heart look like it’s at an angle, draw the top with perspective . That means one part will look closer and one will look further away. Make the circle you want to be “closer” larger than the circle that’s “further away”."

    {
      "title": "Put a slightly curved triangle under the middle of the circles.",
      "content": "Put a slightly curved triangle under the middle of the circles. To keep with the perspective, connect a convex line from the outside of the big circle to a concave line from the outside of the smaller one. A convex line is a curve that pushes out and a concave line is a curve that pushes in. So if your big circle is on the left, the left side of the triangle will bend out to the left. The right side of the triangle will bend towards the center before meeting the other line."

      "content": "Trace over the outline of the heart and erase the sketch. Trace the upper arc of the big circle, starting close to where the bottom of the circles overlap. This will make it seem closer than the smaller circle. Draw another curve starting at the cleft (the dip in the top of the heart) down over the side of the smaller circle. Round the point of the triangle, then erase the inner lines."

Draw a diamond over the lower end for the arrowhead, then draw two parallel lines slightly overlapping either side of the high end. Make the fletching (feathered part) of the arrow by connecting the parallel lines to the end of the shaft. [3] X Research source The fletching should look like two mirrored parallelograms, or two rectangles that are leaning over."

      "content": "Put two curved lines over the middle of the arrow. The lines make the heart pucker where it’s been shot through. Alternatively, you can just drawn one curve to make it look like the arrow’s coming through from the back of the heart."

      "content": "Trace the outline of the actual arrow. Draw over the entire sketch of the arrow except between the curves—if you only used one curve, stop drawing between it and the back edge of the heart. Erase the end of the stick where it overlaps with the diamond, and draw diagonal lines on the back of the arrow parallel to the fletching’s connecting lines. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Layer colors to create highlights and shadows.",
      "content": "Layer colors to create highlights and shadows. Color in each part of the drawing with your lightest color. Use a slightly darker color to start shading the drawing, leaving round areas at the top of the heart uncovered. [5] X Research source Use your darkest color to shade at the very bottom of the heart and behind the largest cheek at the cleft. If you’re painting the heart, make the colors for your shading by mixing small amounts of the opposite color wheel color in the paint. For example, if your heart is red, mix a small amount of green in to make it darker. Make the highlights pop by dotting them with white ink or paint."
