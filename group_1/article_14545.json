    {
      "title": "Draw the body by drawing an oval.",
      "content": "Draw the body by drawing an oval. Draw a bean-shaped elongated oval for the body. Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch, so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add joints and head.",
      "content": "Add joints and head. Draw a circle at the one end of the bean, this will be the head. For the hind joints, draw two overlapping circles. One should be smaller because it’s for the hind leg that is not in full view from the angle. At around the chest part of the wolf, add a slightly elongated circle for the fore legs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Finish the neck and add the ears.",
      "content": "Finish the neck and add the ears. Draw two-pointed curves on top of the head for the ears. Unlike foxes, wolf ears are smaller. To work out the neck (or the scruff) just draw two slightly curved lines and connect both sides of the head to the bean-shaped body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add muzzle and legs.",
      "content": "Add muzzle and legs. For the hind legs, start by drawing curved lines from the leg joint. The lines should bend outwards towards the tail part of the wolf. For the fore legs, you can just add 2 thick lowercase “l”. Since one of the wolf’s legs is hidden, only a small part of the other leg could be seen. For the muzzle, add a small letter “U” at the head."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add eyes and tail and finish the hind legs.",
      "content": "Add eyes and tail and finish the hind legs. For the eyes, just add two small tear-shaped figures above the muzzle. Finish the hind leg by adding a similar shape to the one you did earlier but this time, add some small paws at the end of the legs. The tail is hardly seen because it’s hidden behind the hind legs. Because of that, you can just add a long curvy line at the end of the bean-shaped body. You should have the basic drawing skeleton now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Using a pen, draw on top of your sketch.",
      "content": "Using a pen, draw on top of your sketch. Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden. Remember to use fuzzy-looking crooked lines to get the wolf’s furry look. The line art might not look perfect and crisp, but it should look neat when the pencil is erased."

      "content": "Add the 2 ovals. One oval should be bigger and longer and should point slanted upward. This is the wolf’s neck and head. The other oval should be drawn on the other end of the body. A long, thinner, vertical oval will be added for the tail."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the muzzle and joints.",
      "content": "Draw the muzzle and joints. Just beside the tail and at the base of the slanted oval, add two circles for the leg joint. For the muzzle, add a smaller oval pointing in the same direction as the neck/head oval. Add a tear-shaped figure below the muzzle this would be the jaw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add ear and legs.",
      "content": "Add ear and legs. Because of the angle, only one ear is visible. And to draw this, just draw a small rounded triangle pointing the opposite direction as the muzzle. Add the legs by drawing lines below the leg joints. The hind leg should bend towards the tail."
    },
    {
      "title": "Complete the legs.",
      "content": "Complete the legs. Add similar lines to define the width of the wolf legs. The bottom part of the legs should look flat into the ground. Add another pair of legs behind the ones you drew before. Because they are only slightly visible from the view, just draw a small part of them, peeking behind the legs"
