      "content": "Look for a function in the form of y = a x 2 + c {\\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c} . If you have the “right” kind of function to begin, you can find the inverse using some simple algebra. This form is something of a variation of y = a x 2 + c {\\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c} . Comparing this to a standard form quadratic function, y = a x 2 + b x + c {\\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+bx+c} , you should notice that the central term, b x {\\displaystyle bx} , is missing. Another way to say this is that the value of b is 0. If your function is in this form, finding the inverse is fairly easy. Your beginning function does not have to look exactly like y = a x 2 + c {\\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c} . As long as you can look at it and see that the function consists only of x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} terms and constant numbers, you will be able to use this method. For example, suppose you begin with the equation, 2 y − 6 + x 2 = y + 3 x 2 − 4 {\\displaystyle 2y-6+x^{2}=y+3x^{2}-4} . A quick examination of this equation shows that there are no terms of x {\\displaystyle x} to the first power. This equation is a candidate for this method to find an inverse function."

Taking the sample equation, 2 y − 6 + x 2 = y + 3 x 2 − 4 {\\displaystyle 2y-6+x^{2}=y+3x^{2}-4} , the y-terms can be consolidated on the left by subtracting a y from both sides.

The range of a function consists of the values of y that will result. To determine the domain of the function, look for values that create a mathematically impossible result. You will then report the domain as all other values of x. To find the range, consider the values of y at any boundary points and look at the behavior of the function. [1] X Research source Consider the sample equation y = 2 x 2 + 2 {\\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2} . There is no limitation on allowable values of x for this equation. However, you should recognize that this is the equation of a parabola, centered at x=0, and a parabola is not a function because it does not consist of a one-to-one mapping of x and y values. To limit this equation and make it a function, for which we can find an inverse, we must define the domain as x≥0. The range is similarly limited. Notice that the first term, 2 x 2 {\\displaystyle 2x^{2}} , will always be positive or 0, for any value of x. When the equation then adds +2, the range will be any values y≥2. Defining the domain and range at this early stage is necessary. You will use these definitions later in defining the domain and range of the inverse function. In fact, the domain of the original function will become the range of the inverse function, and the range of the original will become the domain of the inverse."

Because the square root function is not defined for any negative values, the term x − 2 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {x-2}{2}}} must always be positive. Therefore, allowable values of x (the domain) must be x≥2. Using that as the domain, the resulting values of y (the range) are either all values y≥0, if you take the positive solution of the square root, or y≤0, if you select the negative solution of the square root. Recall that you originally defined the domain as x≥0, in order to be able to find the inverse function. Therefore, the correct solution for the inverse function is the positive option. Compare the domain and range of the inverse to the domain and range of the original.

The numerical terms a, h and k will be developed as you transform the equation through a process known as completing the square. [6] X Research source Notice that this standard format consists of a perfect square term, ( x − h ) 2 {\\displaystyle (x-h)^{2}} , which is then adjusted by the other two elements a and k.

When you perform this multiplication, you get a result of x 2 + 2 b x + b 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}} . Thus, the first term of the quadratic is the first term of the binomial, squared, and the last term of the quadratic is the square of the second term of the binomial. The middle term is comprised of 2 times the product of the two terms, in this case 2 ∗ x ∗ b {\\displaystyle 2*x*b} . To complete the square, you will be working in reverse.

[7] X Research source For example, consider the quadratic function f ( x ) = 2 x 2 + 6 x − 4 {\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x-4} . You must simplify this by dividing all terms by 2, to yield the resulting function f ( x ) = 2 ( x 2 + 3 x − 2 ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=2(x^{2}+3x-2)} . The coefficient 2 will remain outside of the parentheses and will be part of your final solution. If all terms are not multiples of a, you will wind up with fractional coefficients. For example, the function f ( x ) = 3 x 2 − 2 x + 6 {\\displaystyle f(x)=3x^{2}-2x+6} will simplify to f ( x ) = 3 ( x 2 − 2 x 3 + 2 ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=3(x^{2}-{\\frac {2x}{3}}+2)} .

By taking that coefficient to be whatever value it is, you will add or subtract whatever number is necessary to create a perfect square quadratic. Recall from above that the required third term of the quadratic is this second coefficient, divided by two, and then squared. [8] X Research source For example, if the first two terms of your quadratic function are x 2 + 3 x {\\displaystyle x^{2}+3x} , you will find the needed third term by dividing 3 by 2, which gives the result 3/2, and then squaring that, to get 9/4.

As noted above, you will use the first two terms to work on completing the square. Using the middle term of -4x, you will generate a third term of +4.

Recall that a parabola is not a function with a definable inverse, because there is not a one-to-one mapping of x-values to y-values, as a result of the symmetry of the parabola. To resolve this problem, you need to define the domain as all values of x that are greater than x=h, the apex point of the parabola. Continue working with the sample function f ( x ) = ( x − 2 ) 2 + 5 {\\displaystyle f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+5} . Because this is in standard format, you can identify the apex point as x=2, y=5. Thus, to avoid the symmetry, you will only work with the right-side of the graph, and set the domain as all values x≥2. Inserting the value x=2 into the function gives the result of y=5.
