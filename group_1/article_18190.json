Interior Designer Kanika Khurana shares that \"it will enhance your artwork. Immediately, it will look like you bought [the poster] somewhere in a showroom, [giving] a slightly higher end look than just sticking it onto a wall with thumbtacks.\" You may not want a mat when framing a vintage poster or a poster of a classic work of art but that is completely your choice."

It is usual to put a white or light colored map on top of an accent color. The accent color would be a color that matches the general tone of the poster. [1] X Research source There can be multiple general tones of the poster so you can choose whatever looks best to you and fits the rest of your room. It is also your choice whether you use two mats or only one. Black and white pictures will do best with cool whites or grays, or even black. You do not want to upstage the poster if using a mat. Choose colors that work well with a width of at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Smaller widths can easily be used for posters because they are so large to begin with. As always though it is your personal choice. You also do not want the top mat to be lighter than the lightest color in the picture or darker than the darkest color in the picture."

Knowing where you will put the poster will help you decide on the particular frame you should purchase because you will know the general color scheme and theme of the location. If you do not know where it will be placed or it is a gift then that is not a problem. There are plenty of generic frames that will look good in a variety of locations."

      "content": "Measure your poster's length, width and thickness with a measuring tape or a ruler. You will need the length and width to determine the size of the frame you must purchase. The thickness is important because many frames will only accommodate very thin posters and you should be aware of the required depth before buying. [2] X Research source If you are using a mat be sure to include the dimensions (width, length and thickness) of the mat when measuring."

      "content": "Choose a frame that is bigger than your poster's dimensions if you are using a mat. The extra space in the frame can allow for the decorative or protective background mat and prevent the frame from damaging the poster's edges. The frame must accommodate both the poster and mat. [3] X Research source Measure the dimensions of the area where you will insert the frame rather than the exterior size of the poster. If you measure only the exterior of the edges of the frame then you will have a hard time fitting the poster into the space."

      "content": "Choose a frame with the right style. Choose a frame will enhance your artwork. Choose a frame that has the appropriate style for the room in which it will be placed as well as your personal preferences and the particular poster. Wood frames usually have a more elegant and classy look while metal frames show a more modern or clinical look. Some plastic frames have been finished to give the appearance of wood or metal. These plastic frames are often cheaper and lightweight, which can be useful when framing posters. Acrylic frames can also be useful in that they might be clear, which means they won't cover up any of the graphics. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider a frame that is quite thin.",
      "content": "Consider a frame that is quite thin. Posters are usually quite large so it is best to choose a frame that is thin to balance out the shapes. Thinner frames will also emphasize the poster, making it stand out more. If you want to create a more dramatic or bold look then choose a standard or wider frame."

      "title": "Buy a frame with plexiglass.",
      "content": "Buy a frame with plexiglass. Interior Designer Kanika Khurana confirms that \"you should get a poster frame with high quality glass to prevent damage to your artwork, especially if you get a lot of sun in the room [you are hanging it].\" Look for a poster frame that has higher-quality plexiglass, such as Acrylite OP-3, that is 1/8 inch (0.31 cm) thick. Although regular glass is always an option, it can break or trap moisture inside the frame, damaging the poster. Lower-quality plexiglass may not prevent the poster from yellowing over time. Higher-quality plexiglass can also be made so that it is glare-free and is much lighter weight than glass can be, making it ideal for large frames such as for posters. Plexiglass can also be UV-resistant, which is important if you are hanging the poster in an area that receives a lot of sunlight. Plexiglass is more prone to scratches, even though there are scratch-resistant types. [5] X Research source"

You may find frames that have pictures in them that you can remove to repurpose for your poster.

It is important that the poster backing is acid-free, to avoid quickly fading and damaging the poster. Some frames come with the backing already inside the frame."

Making your own frame allows you to customize options without paying the expensive costs of a professional framer. This frame might not be particularly strong so it might not work with a glass piece in front."

You will want a type of trimming that looks like a frame edge and hopefully has a ledge on one side, such as might hold a poster as a picture frame would. [6] X Research source You will need enough to cover the length of all four sides of your poster, plus extra if you are using a mat (the width of your mat times four) and some more (8-12 inches or 20-30 cm, depending on width of wall trimming) for the corners. You might only find a plain moulding that has a ledge in it, but do not worry, you can always customize colors later to add some decoration."

Mitering involves cutting the edges of the wall trimming at 45 degree angles so that they fit together to form a 90 degree angle in the corner. Measure carefully so that you make the edges the correct length. [7] X Research source You will want each outer edge to be as long as that side of the poster plus the width of the other side of the frame times two. Make sure your opposing pieces on the top and bottom or left and right are equal lengths so that the frame can be squared properly. Make allowance in the lengths for the mat width as well as the poster size."

These will be L-shaped and should be the right size, not too big or too small, to fit on your corners. Make sure the wood screws you use are not too long so that the poke out the front side of your frame. Use short screws. Drill the screws in carefully so that the wood does not crack or become damaged. You may wish to use a band clamp to hold the corners together but it is not necessary. A band clamp is a long piece of nylon with a clamp on one side to wrap around pieces and hold them together."

This frame is not incredibly strong so glass might be a bit heavy, but plexiglass will work well. Have a piece of plexiglass cut to the correct size at your local hardware or framing store. Alternatively you might find a piece as part of another picture frame at a thrift store or hobby store on sale. Higher quality plexiglass such as Acrylite OP-3 that is 1/8 inch (0.31 cm) thick will work well. Higher-quality plexiglass can also be made so that it is glare-free and is much lighter weight than glass can be, making it ideal for large frames such as for posters, although it is more prone to scratches than glass.

Peel back a few inches of the adhesive foam board's protective film and line up the print with the edge of the board. Unroll the poster onto the board slowly, unrolling a few inches at a time and applying to the poster. Smooth out any air bubbles using a credit card or the spine of a hardcover book. [9] X Research source Use a pin to poke a hole in any large bubbles from behind (through the foam, not the poster). Once you let the air out, smooth it down completely. Trim excess foam from the board using a knife and metal ruler to make crisp edges. You can also pay for someone to apply a foam board for about $20 (depending on the area) if you would like. Remember that a foam board will increase the thickness of your poster and can affect the frame that you choose."

      "content": "Fit your mat on top of or behind your poster. If you are using one, your mat can be placed either on top of or behind your poster. Putting the mat behind your poster is easiest, because then you will not have to cut the mat. If you choose to put the mat on top of the poster, then you may have to cut out the inner shape so that the poster can be seen inside. It can be difficult to cut the edges of a mat accurately and without damaging the mat so you can usually have this completed at a framing store for just a few dollars."

Moisture will damage the poster so it is also very important for the piece to be dry. You do not want any fingerprints or other oils on the side touching the poster. Plexiglass is prone to scratches so be sure to clean it only with a microfiber cloth rather than paper products."
