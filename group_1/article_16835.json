      "content": "Examine the work for a copyright notice. Many works state whether or not they have been copyrighted, although it is no longer legally required, even in the USA. [1] X Research source You will know that the work has been copyrighted if it includes a \"copyright notice,\" which is marked either by a \"c\" in a circle (Â©) or the word \"copyright\" followed by the date of first publication and the name of the copyright owner. [2] X Research source If the work is a book, look for a copyright page. It is typically found on the back side of the title page. On older works it may be on the title page or on the last page of the book. If the work is a film or a television show, the copyright is usually included at the end of the credits. If you have a physical copy of a DVD or tape, the label or package may have a copyright notice. If the work is a cassette, CD or LP, look for a reference to the copyright on the label or packaging. It may include a \"circle-P\" mark for \"phonograph copyright\". If the work is a magazine, the copyright will likely be found near the Table of Contents at the beginning of an issue. If the work is a digital photograph, the copyright will be indicated by a tag. If it is a print photograph, the copyright will be on the back of the image."

      "title": "Look at the date.",
      "content": "Look at the date. All copyrights have a statutory duration. Some works have entered the public domain because the copyright on them has expired. This applies to: All works published in the U.S. before 1923 Some works published with a copyright notice after 1922 if, for example, the copyright was published before 1964, but never renewed. To find out whether a copyright was renewed, you will likely have to search the records of the U.S. Copyright Office. Published works were required to carry a \"copyright notice\" only until 1989. [3] X Research source Works made for hire that were published more than 95 years ago All works published more than 95 years ago, beginning in 2019. Unpublished works for which the author is known and the author died more than 70 years ago, or 120 years from its date of creation, whichever expires first. [4] X Research source Phonographs (sound recordings) created or published in the US prior to 1972 currently have no statutory copyright protection under US federal law, but certain exclusive rights may be covered by relevant state laws, at least until preempted in 2067. It is quite possible that even sound recordings more than 120 years old may still have copyright protection under state laws. [5] X Research source In 2018 the US Congress passed a new law granting specific, retro-active, copyright protections to pre-1972 sound recordings published in the USA: either 95, 96, 100 or 110 years, depending upon its publication date. [6] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source For example, sound recordings published prior to 1923 now have copyrighted performance rights until 2021; those published after 1956 have 95-year copyright protection, during the \"transition period\" ending in 2067."

These include: Titles, names, short phrases and slogans, familiar symbols, numbers Ideas, concepts and facts (e.g., the date of the Gettysburg Address) Processes, methods of operations, and systems Works and documents created by the US government. Note that the US government also publishes works created by others, for which there may be a valid and enforceable copyright."

      "content": "Look for the \"CC0\" Public Domain mark. Some owners of copyrighted works choose to waive their interests and place their works in the public domain through the website \"Creative Commons.\" You can identify a work that has been dedicated to the public domain through the \"CC0\" mark. [7] X Research source When searching for images online, look for small print under the image that reads: \"Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.\" [8] X Research source Authors are also allowed to simply \"disclaim\" their right to enforce their own copyright, but it must be done in writing and in a way to make it unambiguously irrevocable, without regard to the \"Creative Commons\" procedures."

      "content": "Determine whether a work is unpublished. Unpublished material may be protected by copyright law, even if it contains no reference to a copyright and has not been registered with the Copyright Office, provided it has not expired. [9] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source The law only requires that such works be fixed in a tangible form. For this reason, you need to be even more careful about using material that has never been published. [10] X Research source To be clear, any copy you have found qualifies as being \"in tangible form\", even if it is in computer memory or encoded in a form that you cannot read or understand. To determine whether or not a work has been published, find out whether or not it was intended for public distribution. If only a few copies were created and distribution was limited, it is likely unpublished. If you believe a work is unpublished, find out whether the author is deceased. Copyright in an unpublished work will expire 70 years after the death of the last surviving author. If an author is anonymous, or the date of the author's death is unknown, or it was a work made for hire, the copyright will expire 120 years after the date on which the work was created. Avoid using unpublished material found in archives or manuscript collections unless you are certain the copyright has expired. Much of this material is likely still protected by copyright. As mentioned above, Congress changed the copyright law in 2018 to grant 95-year protection to pre-1972 sound recordings. Unpublished pre-1972 sound recordings now have federal copyright protection for 95 years from \"date of fixation\", subject to many of the same exceptions and limitations of other copyrights.

      "content": "Be wary of \"orphan works.\" Many works published (with copyright notice) after 1922 are presumably still protected by copyright, but their owners cannot be found. Such works are referred to as \"orphan works.\" You should be wary of using material from orphan works, as the true owner may eventually come forward and accuse you of violating his copyright. [12] X Research source Mass digitalization projects, like Google Books, are replete with untraceable photos, letters and text that are technically still protected by copyright, even though their owners cannot be found. Until Congress passes legislation authorizing the use of such works, you run the risk of violating copyright law in taking material from them."

First, a private company can deliver reliable results more quickly than the Copyright Office staff, within two to ten days of your request. Second, in addition to determining whether a work is in the public domain or whether you can obtain the rights to use the work, a private company can provide other services, such as tracing the copyright history of a fictional character or locating similarly titled works.

If the material is used in a way that is transformative, meaning that it alters the fundamental character of the original work, the use is considered fair. However, if the new version merely copies or supersedes the original work, then the use is not fair. [30] X Research source For example, a poet who uses a line from a T.S.

If only a few copies were made and it was never intended for public distribution, it is likely unpublished and any use of it could be risky.
