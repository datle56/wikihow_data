      "title": "Space your feet out about 1½ times your shoulder width.",
      "content": "Space your feet out about 1½ times your shoulder width. Take a stance that is a little wider than your shoulder width so you have an even stronger base. Extend the foot of your non-dominant side in front of you and the foot of your dominant side behind you so you’re facing your opponent with a staggered stance. [1] X Research source The standard fighting stance is to have your left foot forward and your right foot back. However, if you’re left-handed, you can take a “southpaw” stance by placing your right foot forward and your left back."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your knees slightly.",
      "content": "Bend your knees slightly. In order to drop your weight and rotate properly to move your head and throw punches, take a slightly lowered posture by bending your knees. Take a comfortable stance with your knees slightly bent and bob up and down a few times to make sure your weight is centered. [2] X Research source Don’t lean your weight forward or backward. Shift from side to side to feel the balance of the stance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your weight centered over your hips and feet.",
      "content": "Keep your weight centered over your hips and feet. Stack your shoulders directly over your hips so you aren’t leaning forward or backward. Keep your weight centered directly in the middle of the space between your feet so you’re balanced and will be able to rotate and move your upper body. [3] X Research source Leaning forward will make your head an easy target for your opponent. If you keep your weight shifted back, you won’t be able to generate as much power in your strikes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck your chin and keep your eyes centered on your opponent’s chest.",
      "content": "Tuck your chin and keep your eyes centered on your opponent’s chest. Lower your chin just enough so it’s not sticking out as an easy target for your opponent’s punches. Keep your eyes focused on the center of your opponent’s torso so you don’t telegraph your movements and so your periphery vision will see all of his movements. [4] X Research source Don’t tuck your chin so much that your neck is stretched."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a step to the side so you’re facing your opponent at an angle.",
      "content": "Take a step to the side so you’re facing your opponent at an angle. Boxing is all about making angles that open up your punches and catch your opponent off-guard, so take a quick step either to your left or your right to move off-line of the front of your opponent. Move so you’re facing your opponent diagonally. [5] X Research source Keep your knees slightly bent so you maintain a strong base. Make sure your weight stays balanced! Take your step offline when you’re about to throw a punch so your opponent doesn’t have time to adjust."

    {
      "title": "Load up all of your weight onto your lead foot.",
      "content": "Load up all of your weight onto your lead foot. Keep your feet planted on the ground and your knees slightly bent and shift all of your weight onto your lead foot, or the foot that’s out in front of you. Your rear foot, the foot behind you, will feel light, but keep it planted on the ground. [6] X Research source Don’t lean forward or you’ll expose yourself to an easy punch from your opponent."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift your lead foot quickly to shift your weight on to your rear foot.",
      "content": "Lift your lead foot quickly to shift your weight on to your rear foot. With all of your weight loaded up on your lead foot, quickly raise it up from the ground. You’ll feel like you’re starting to fall and your body will try to catch itself using your rear foot. [7] X Research source Think of the motion as a fast combination. Load your weight on your lead foot then quickly pick it up to shift your weight onto your rear foot almost instantly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spring forward using the momentum from your rear foot.",
      "content": "Spring forward using the momentum from your rear foot. In the split second that you raise your lead foot, you’ll feel your body compensate and try to stabilize itself by shifting all of your weight on your rear foot. Use that built-up energy to launch yourself forward. Keep your weight centered as you move forward and stay off-line of your opponent so you’re at a slight angle facing them. [8] X Research source Move so you’re within range of throwing a punch that will hit them."

    {
      "title": "Bob and weave to avoid your opponent’s punches as you advance.",
      "content": "Bob and weave to avoid your opponent’s punches as you advance. As you close the distance, your opponent is likely to try to throw punches at you, so use bob and weaving movements to avoid them. Keep your knees bent to keep your head low and move your head in a figure-eight motion to dodge your opponent’s punches. [9] X Research source Don’t lean so far forward that you’re off balance or your opponent will be able to land a strong punch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the shoulder of your punching arm backward to load it up.",
      "content": "Roll the shoulder of your punching arm backward to load it up. Whichever fist you plan to throw at your opponent, start loading it up by rotating the shoulder of your punching arm behind you. Your other shoulder will come out in front of you slightly. Keep your chin tucked and your eyes on your opponent. [10] X Research source Rotation is key to building punching power. Rolling your shoulder back will cause your hips to rotate slightly so you’re engaging your legs and core muscles in your punch."

    {
      "title": "Stretch your punching arm until your muscles are taut.",
      "content": "Stretch your punching arm until your muscles are taut. The “Shoulder Whirl” invented by Jack Dempsey involves stretching the muscles of your punching arm so that they build up kinetic energy. As you roll your shoulder back, extend your arm until your muscles are stretched and taut and ready to spring forward. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Whip your arm forward and strike your opponent with your fist.",
      "content": "Whip your arm forward and strike your opponent with your fist. Make a proper punching fist by curling your fingers, folding your thumb over them, and squeezing tightly. With your shoulder rolled back and the muscles of your punching arm stretched, whip your shoulder forward and allow your arm to spring forward as well. Make contact with your opponent using your fist and re-establish your stance so you’re balanced and are able to protect yourself or throw more punches. [12] X Research source Avoid going wild and throwing punches while you’re off balance or you could be hit with a counter strike from your opponent."
