      "content": "Verify that the information on the check is correct. Before you endorse the check, make sure it's one that your bank will accept, and that all the information on the front is correct. If the person who gave you the check spelled your name wrong or made a mistake, you may want to give it back to them and have them write you another check. [1] X Research source While some banks will accept a check that has been changed as long as the person who wrote the check initials the change, many banks are suspicious of this. It's better to have the person write you another check. A valid check has a line at the bottom with the routing number and account number. If that line isn't present, the bank will not be able to process the check."

      "title": "Determine who must endorse the check.",
      "content": "Determine who must endorse the check. If only your name is listed on the payee line of the check, your signature is all that is needed to cash or deposit the check. If someone's else name is also listed, they only have to sign the check if the word \"and\" or the symbol \"&\" appears between the 2 names. [2] X Research source The default rule is that a check with 2 or more names can be cashed or deposited individually by any of the people listed on the check. If the check says \"or,\" or includes ambiguous language or symbols (such as a dash or a slash), either of the people named can cash or deposit the check. If the check is written to you \"℅\" (meaning \"care of\") someone else, only your signature is needed. They generally cannot cash or deposit the check without your signature. However, if you have a joint bank account, they may be able to deposit the check in that account on your behalf without your signature."

      "title": "Find the gray lines on the back of the check.",
      "content": "Find the gray lines on the back of the check. If you flip over the check, you'll see 3 to 5 gray lines. These typically appear on the upper short side of the check. You'll also see a solid line with instructions not to write below the line. [3] X Research source The bank needs the remaining blank space under the endorsement area to document the processing of the check. Make sure your signature doesn't extend into that space, or the bank may refuse the check."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sign your name on one of the gray lines.",
      "content": "Sign your name on one of the gray lines. To endorse a check, you typically only have to sign your name in pen using blue or black ink. If your name on the check differs from your name on your government-issued photo ID, or on your bank account, you may want to print the correct spelling of your name under your signature. [4] X Research source If you're signing a business check, include the business's name on the line above your name. You may also want to add your job title to show you are authorized to cash or deposit the check in the name of the company."

    {
      "title": "Cash",
      "content": "Cash or deposit the check immediately. Once you've signed the check, it becomes a \"bearer instrument,\" meaning anyone who finds it can cash it. If you're traveling to the bank, don't sign your check until you get there. If you go to a bank to cash the check and you don't have an account with that bank, you typically must show a government-issued photo ID. You may also have to provide a thumbprint for identification services. Check cashing services will charge you a fee to cash the check. Banks typically charge a fee as well, unless you have an account with that bank. If you don't have a bank account, you may want to take this opportunity to open one , using the check is your initial balance. Otherwise, you can get the check cashed at a check-cashing service available at discount or grocery stores. You can also go to the bank that issued the check. That bank will have its name and logo printed on the front of the check."

If someone finds your check, they won't be able to do anything with it.

      "title": "Include your bank account number.",
      "content": "Include your bank account number . Some banks require you to include the account number where you want the check's funds deposited. Even if it's not required, it might be a good idea if you have more than one bank account at the same bank. For example, if you have a checking account and a savings account, you would typically want to include the account number for the account you want to use. While you'll also include this information on the deposit slip, it helps to also put it on the check in case the two get separated. Additionally, checks deposited using an ATM or a mobile app may not have deposit slips. Because it's a security risk, if you're traveling to the bank to deposit the check in person, wait until you get there to write your account number on the check."

      "title": "Sign the check below your restrictions.",
      "content": "Sign the check below your restrictions. Once you've included the deposit restriction, sign the check as you normally would, using a pen with blue or black ink. Signing below the restrictions gives them effect – if you sign above the restrictions, they aren't considered valid. You can place your account number below your name. The account number just tells the bank where to deposit the funds from the check. Some banks prefer that you put your account number under your name."

      "content": "Deposit the check at your bank. Once you've completed a restrictive endorsement, you can deposit it at any time. There's no worry of someone else taking the check, because a bank won't process it for anyone other than you. [6] X Trustworthy Source US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau U.S. government agency for protecting consumers in the financial sector Go to source If you give the check to someone else to deposit for you, put the check in a sealed envelope only to be opened by the teller. Make sure the person taking the check to the bank for you is someone you trust. When using a mobile banking app to deposit your check, some banks require this restrictive endorsement. Without it, someone could take the check to another bank and attempt to cash it."

      "content": "Find out the bank's policy on third-party checks. Banks don't have to accept checks signed over to someone else (called \"third-party checks\"), and many banks refuse them. Before you sign your check over to someone else, call the bank where the person is going to take the check and make sure they accept checks endorsed this way. [7] X Research source Talk to the person you're going to sign the check over to and find out what bank or check cashing service they plan to use to cash or deposit the check. Generally, the person will have better luck getting a third-party check accepted if they go to a bank where they have an account and present the check for deposit. You may also have to go with them to validate your signature."

Make sure you leave enough room for both you and the other person to sign in the endorsement area.

However, some banks are cautious about third-party checks and may want to get confirmation from you before they accept the check. Some banks may be willing to call you and get your confirmation that you intended to transfer the check to the other person. You may also have to go to the bank with the person, especially if the check is for a large amount."
