      "content": "Pour some room temperature water into a glass. Take a drinking glass and fill it up halfway. Make sure that there’s enough water to observe a strand of hair floating or sinking. If the water is cold initially, wait a few minutes so it can settle to room temperature. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a glass on hand, consider using something tall and see-through, like a large glass bowl."

      "title": "Place 1 strand of your hair into the glass.",
      "content": "Place 1 strand of your hair into the glass. Stroke a comb or brush through your hair to remove some hair without needing to pull it out. Don’t worry if you don’t have a lot of loose hair, since you only need one strand for the float test. Take a single strand and drop it into the glass. [4] X Research source Make sure that you’ve washed your hair with dry shampoo and nothing else. And there is no product on your hair.

If you’ve conditioned your hair with a lot of products, then the results of your float test could be negatively affected. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch the hair to see if it floats or sinks. Keep an eye on your hair to see what it does. If your hair floats, it likely has low porosity—in other words, your cuticle cells are tight and don’t have a way to quickly absorb the water in the glass. High porosity hair, on the other hand, will rapidly absorb the water and fall to the bottom of the glass. [7] X Expert Source Kana Ishii Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 22 December 2021. Medium porosity hair won’t immediately soak in or reject the water, causing it to fall more slowly. [8] X Research source The float test isn’t always conclusive.

      "title": "Spray your hair with water if you don’t want to do the float test.",
      "content": "Spray your hair with water if you don’t want to do the float test. Spritz some water over your hair if you don’t have time to do a full float test. As a rule of thumb, low porosity hair won’t absorb any of the water right away, leaving the droplets to sit on top of the hair. High porosity hair, however, will absorb the water immediately. Medium porosity hair falls somewhere in the middle, and tends to absorb water at a moderate pace. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply heat to low porosity hair to make it easier to condition.",
      "content": "Apply heat to low porosity hair to make it easier to condition. Use a dryer or heat cap when adding a deep conditioner to your hair. If you don’t want to take those extra steps, try conditioning your hair in the shower with hot water. If there’s more heat present, it’ll be easier for low porosity hair to absorb any conditioners. [10] X Research source Heat forces the cuticle cells to separate, which makes them soak in more conditioner."

      "title": "Invest in natural, lighter products to wash and condition low porosity hair.",
      "content": "Invest in natural, lighter products to wash and condition low porosity hair. Purchase shampoos, conditioners, and other products that contain natural oils like grape seed, argan, and almond. These oils naturally provide a lot of moisture to low porosity hair, which helps to condition your hair more effectively. [11] X Research source Since an excessive amount of hair product might leave some gunk in your hair, try using an apple cider vinegar mixture to cleanse your scalp."

      "content": "Use a mix of moisturizing and strengthening products for medium porosity hair. Don’t worry about changing your hair care routine if you have medium porosity hair. Keep your hair products well-rounded, and be sure to have an equal amount of conditioners and protein-heavy strengthening products. [12] X Research source Talk to a salon specialist if you have any questions about striking the perfect balance with your medium porosity hair."

      "title": "Rinse out high porosity hair with cold water at the end of a shower.",
      "content": "Rinse out high porosity hair with cold water at the end of a shower. Wash out any products thoroughly using cold water, as the colder temperature helps the conditioning and moisturizing products to have a more lasting effect. Unlike hot water, cold temperatures force your hair cuticle cells to close, which keeps the newly-added conditioner inside of each hair strand for longer. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase a variety of moisturizing products if your hair is high porosity.",
      "content": "Purchase a variety of moisturizing products if your hair is high porosity. Buy a number of items ranging from conditioning butters to moisturizing hair creams. When purchasing a new shampoo and conditioner, look for products containing coconut oil. Additionally, aloe vera gel is another great moisturizing agent that you can use to rub through your hair. [14] X Research source Aim for products that have a lot of protein in them—this helps your high porosity hair become stronger. [15] X Research source"
