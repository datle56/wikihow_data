      "content": "Add (or decrease) volume. Side buns need the right amount of volume to look good. Thin buns will fall out quickly. Thick buns could end up protruding too much. To manage these issues you could: Treat fine, limp hair, by curling it before you begin. Then, scrunch it with a small amount of mousse or gel. Just don’t let it get \"crunchy.\" Treat thick, curly hair by applying an anti-frizz serum from the ears down to the ends."

Don't leave too much hair down, or your final look will look sloppy. This step is optional, but sometimes wisps fall down by themselves. If you don’t want your hair to hang over your face, pin it to the side of your head with a bobby pin or discreet barrette. [3] X Research source"
