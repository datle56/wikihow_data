Use an ice pack and place it on the part of your neck that feels stiff (usually the back of your neck at your hairline). Hold the pack there for 10-15 minutes every 2 hours. [4] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source [5] X Research source You can also try a more comfortable position to ice your neck. Sit in a comfortable chair and rest your head back. Place the pack between your shoulders and the bottom of your head. Lean back against it so your neck gets the full benefit of the cool temperature. Some experts feel that ice will contribute to increased stiffness in the neck because the cold will contract your muscles. [6] X Research source Try what feels good to your neck. Use a cold treatment for acute pain in the first 48-72 hours, and then switch to heat. [7] X Research source"

Because it produces light bruising, it often looks unappealing, and it may not feel soothing or produce results for some patients.
