      "content": "Recognize the signs. The first step to overcoming any kind of addiction is recognizing that you have one, in this case a Twitter addiction. Some general warning signs that you may have an addiction to Twitter are: [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Having trouble completing tasks at work or home. You often find yourself behind at work because you have been too busy checking Twitter, for example. Isolating yourself from family and friends. You spend more time tweeting than talking with friends face-to-face, or you cannot put your phone down while visiting with friends and family. Lying to your friends and family about the amount of time you spend on Twitter. When you are asked about how much time you spend on Twitter, you often lie to conceal how much time you really spend on it. Fearing that you are missing out if you are not on Twitter 24/7. You wake up in the middle of the night to check your Twitter account to see what others are doing, for example. Feeling anxious, restless, angry, or irritable when you cannot check your Twitter because your phone's battery is dead, or because you accidentally left your phone at home."

      "title": "Acknowledge your addiction.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your addiction. Admit to yourself that you have an addiction. Also recognize how the addiction is affecting your life. Recognize that you lost your job or are failing school because of your Twitter addiction. Tell yourself, “My addiction to Twitter has had negative consequences on my health and life. I am ready to change my behavior because I am tired of feeling so dependent on Twitter.”"

      "title": "Recognize the triggers.",
      "content": "Recognize the triggers. You may have become attached to Twitter because it soothes stress, anxiety, loneliness, or depression. Feeling socially awkward is another common reason people become attached to social media like Twitter. Once you recognize the triggers, you can try to change your behavior for the better. To find your triggers, ask yourself: [2] X Research source “What am I trying to avoid when I use Twitter?” “What do I tend to think about before, during, and after I have checked my Twitter account? Are there any patterns?” “When I indulge in my addiction, what benefits do I get from it?”"

      "title": "Join a support group.",
      "content": "Join a support group. Realize that you are not alone. There are hundreds of people out there who are addicted to social media just like you. Support groups, like Internet & Tech Addiction Anonymous (ITAA), exist to help people overcome their addiction to the Internet, including social media. Join one of these groups, preferably a face-to-face group. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help you learn how to cope with anxiety, stress, and depression in a healthy way."

      "title": "Disable alerts and notifications.",
      "content": "Disable alerts and notifications. Twitter alerts and notifications may be triggering you to check your Twitter more often than you need to. Go to the application’s settings on your phone or computer and disable the alert notifications. This way, you are more likely to check Twitter when you want to, not when Twitter wants you to. [4] X Research source If you want to be really brave, try deleting the Twitter application from your smartphone."

    {
      "title": "Time your Twitter use.",
      "content": "Time your Twitter use. Cut the amount of time you spend on Twitter in one sitting in half. Time how much you usually spend on Twitter and then cut this in half. The next time you get on Twitter, set the timer on your phone. Log off when the timer is up. [5] X Research source For example, if you typically spend an hour on Twitter in one sitting, then set a timer for 30 minutes. Once the timer is up, don’t just exit the application, but log off. Keep reducing this by 10 to 15 minutes each week."

    {
      "title": "Sign off of Twitter.",
      "content": "Sign off of Twitter. If you are addicted to Twitter, then you probably never sign off completely. Make a habit of signing off of Twitter once you are done. This way it is not as accessible to you. [6] X Research source Additionally, limit the number of times you log on. Set a goal to log on only three to five times per day. Keep reducing this number each week until you do not feel the need to sign on at all."

      "title": "Have a purpose for checking your Twitter.",
      "content": "Have a purpose for checking your Twitter. Before you log on, ask yourself, “Do I have a good and specific reason for logging on?” Legitimate reasons to sign on are catching up with a close friend or family member, or seeing what your professor posted for class. [7] X Research source Be wary of signing on just to pass time like when you are bored or have nothing else to do. If you feel you are avoiding something, start a list or make a journal entry about what you are avoiding and why."

      "title": "Reward yourself.",
      "content": "Reward yourself. Do not beat yourself up if you fail to stick to your goals the first month. Overcoming any kind of addiction is hard and will require work. Make sure to reward yourself when you do stick to your goals, both short and long term. For example, go out for ice cream, meet up with a friend, or engage in another rewarding activity when you stick to a goal, like only signing on once a day for a week. Try to make long term goals, too. Consider something like putting a certain amount of money aside for every day you don't log in. Then, treat yourself to a nice meal or something you've had your eye on once you hit a certain mark."

      "title": "Spend more time with your friends and family.",
      "content": "Spend more time with your friends and family. Each week, set aside time for friends and family. You can begin by going out to lunch once a week with your best friend, or your mom or dad. Discuss with them what you did during the week, including positive and negative experiences. To keep the conversation going, remember to ask them how their week went as well.

Go to source Alternatively, you can join a volunteer or church group, or join an intramural sports team to fulfill your weekly face-to-face interaction time. Look for groups or situations where the intention is to be fully present. This way, you don't end up around others that have a Twitter addiction."

      "title": "Practice breathing exercises.",
      "content": "Practice breathing exercises. Breathing exercises are particularly helpful if you are struggling with stress and anxiety. Whenever anxiety or stress triggers you to check Twitter, practice breathing exercises instead. Sit down and close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose, filling your stomach with air. Then breathe out through your mouth, contracting your stomach. Practice this for one minute, or until the urge to check your Twitter subsides. As you exhale, imagine that you are dispelling any and all negative thoughts and behavior."

      "content": "Go take a walk outside. Whenever you feel the urge to check your Twitter, take a break from whatever you are doing and go outside. Take 15 minutes to walk around and breathe in the fresh air. [9] X Research source You can even ask a friend, family member, or coworker to join you on your walk. The company will distract you and help you pass the time."

      "content": "Find a new hobby. Fill in any extra time you have with a new hobby instead of Twitter. Begin a novel, get a gym membership, or take a class at your local community college. You could also take up writing, or learn an instrument or a new language. Once you make your new hobby a habit, you will have a much easier time overcoming your Twitter addiction."
