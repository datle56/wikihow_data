      "content": "Be aware of the task. Often, what we think is daunting turns out not to be such a big deal. You might think that there's too much to study for your public exams when actually you can still find time to enjoy yourself. Write down what it is you have to do, ask people who've gone through it before and evaluate how bad it truly is.

      "content": "Identify what it is that you don't like. There are some things that are near-universally unpleasant, but in certain cases, we simply don't want to do something based on a minor factor. I knew a person who hated going on school trips because of homesickness, but had no problem doing sleepovers with friends. It rested simply in the fact that he associated one with \"school\", while the other with \"friends\". When he realised that school trips are no worse than going on a slightly more rigorous sleepover, his fear went away and he ended up enjoying them. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Prepare yourself in advance.",
      "content": "Prepare yourself in advance. Once you've identified what it is you have to do, plan ahead and get ready. If it's public exams, write yourself a timetable; if it's for going on a dreaded trip, find things which can make it more enjoyable. Make sure you are organised and emotionally ready for what you have to do - you'll get there feeling far less stressed or unhappy. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Try to enjoy it!",
      "content": "Try to enjoy it! This sounds trite, but even the dullest of things can be minimally enjoyable if we have a positive attitude and open mind. Try to find the good in every situation - for instance, see exam study as an opportunity to spend time with friends if you revise together; be aware that what you're learning will make you a more cultured person, and find a way to make a boring subject interesting through witty mnemonics or background stories.

      "content": "See the goal/end. We all have to go through hard times in life, but often our greatest joys come as a consequence of our worst pain. Visualise the achievement you will feel once you've finished the task, think about what you're going to do afterwards, and use this as an incentive to keep on going. If in certain cases there isn't any overall achievement, try to imagine the good things you can regain once it's over. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't be too harsh on yourself. Don't be overly hard on the way you're coping with the task. If you're trying your best, get over any lapse - we're only human after all. Of course, try to see where you can improve, but excessively high standards are just counterproductive. You should feel worse about perfectionist expectations than anything that goes wrong.

      "content": "Reward yourself. Give yourself treats where you can - buy the odd sweet you have once in a while, watch a funny film, do something you enjoy. Perhaps you can avoid doing certain things you love in your everyday life and save them for such moments - making them even more special. [7] X Research source"

If you are in the position of having them nearby, take the opportunity to talk and share your experience. If you're far away, the glories of the internet and mobile phones allow us to keep in contact, so make use of these precious tools! And, if even that doesn't work, try the good old-fashioned method of letter-writing. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Let it out! Don't bottle up your emotions. If one day you feel like crying, have a good sob. If you want to shout, go somewhere private and blurt it out. It may not make the problem go away, but at least it will relieve you of some of the stress building up inside. In certain studies crying has been proven to help reduce anxiety levels.

      "content": "See the bigger picture. Going through a set of public exams lasts a few months, a dreaded trip probably won't be more than a few weeks, a bad job may take up a few years of your life. Remember first of all that you should have a long life and whatever you have to do won't last forever, but also try to remind yourself that things could (nearly) always be worse. While you may hate to sit through a huge set of papers, think of people who are going through the same thing but might also be suffering from cancer or having family problems. Note the good things in your life, and always, always remember that you're never alone."
