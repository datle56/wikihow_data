Changes are made for women and men. Women have larger hips, but thinner torsos and waists. Men have more angular faces and features, while women's are more round. [2] X Research source Women also tend to have thinner necks. Make sure that you aren't sketching the people in your drawing at eye level. This looks very unrealistic; instead, try to adjust their head and/or posture a little bit."
