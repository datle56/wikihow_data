      "content": "Locate the release button. The Jumperoo has a button at the base of one of the legs that, when pressed, allows the whole Jumperoo to be taken apart. Find this button. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the release button.",
      "content": "Press the release button. As you press the release button, one of the base tubes should detach from the leg. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the detached base tubes toward the center.",
      "content": "Fold the detached base tubes toward the center. The legs should fold into one another. Think of this as if you are closing a book, and the legs and base tubes are the covers. They should come together neatly. [3] X Research source At the end of this step, the base tubes should resemble an oval with pointed ends."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn or collapse the seat sideways.",
      "content": "Turn or collapse the seat sideways. This will happen as you fold the base tubes in on themselves, but you should also guide the seat as the tubes are collapsing. [4] X Research source The seat should hang perpendicular to the floor."

    {
      "title": "Follow the instruction manual if you have one.",
      "content": "Follow the instruction manual if you have one. Though Jumperoos have a general design, some specific models may have different pieces or work in different ways from others. Take care to look over the instruction manual if possible."

    {
      "title": "Put the Jumperoo in a closet or other narrow space.",
      "content": "Put the Jumperoo in a closet or other narrow space. When it is completely folded up, the Jumperoo is much skinnier than when it is set up. Take advantage of this decrease in size by putting it in an unfilled closet or between a wall and piece of furniture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the Jumperoo under a bed or sofa.",
      "content": "Place the Jumperoo under a bed or sofa. Because the Jumperoo is thinner when folded up, you might be able to turn it sideways and store it under a bed, crib, sofa, or other piece of furniture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the Jumperoo in a large bin or chest.",
      "content": "Keep the Jumperoo in a large bin or chest. If you want the Jumperoo completely out of sight, or if you plan on keeping it in storage for a long period of time, it could fit folded up inside of a large container of some sort. Keep it in here until the next time you need it."
