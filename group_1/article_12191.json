      "title": "Eat raw garlic to decrease the number of platelets in your blood.",
      "content": "Eat raw garlic to decrease the number of platelets in your blood. Raw or crushed garlic contains a compound called \"allicin\" which affects the body's ability to make platelets, therefore decreasing the number of platelets in the blood. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Your body responds to the lower platelet level by improving its immunity, which helps to protect the body from any foreign objects (such as viruses and bacteria) that enter the system. The allicin content of garlic decreases rapidly with cooking, so try to eat it raw. Eating raw garlic causes stomach upset in some people, so be sure to eat the raw garlic with food."

Gingko biloba contains substances called “terpenoids” which reduce blood viscosity (making it thinner) and prevent the formation of clots. [3] X Trustworthy Source U.S. National Capital Poison Center Independent poison control center providing resources to prevent poisonings and save lives Go to source Gingko biloba also help to improve blood circulation and increases your body's production of warfarin, which helps to dissolve clots. Gingko biloba is available as a supplement in liquid or capsule form. You can buy these supplements at the drug or health food store. If you can get your hands on gingko biloba leave, you can boil the leaves in water for 5 to 7 minutes, then drink the water as a tea."

These flavonoids prevent the overproduction of cells in the lining of artery walls (a process caused by too many platelets in the blood). This reduces reduces the chances of clot formation.

      "content": "Quit smoking to prevent blood clots. Smoking puts you at increased risk of developing blood clots, due to several harmful compounds found in cigarettes (such as nicotine). Smoking causes the blood to become thicker and the platelets to clump together. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Serious health issues such as heart problems and strokes often occur as a result of clots forming in the blood. Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do to avoid these blood clots from forming in the first place. Quitting is difficult, and is not something that can be done overnight.
