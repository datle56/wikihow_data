Writing it out can help you get a better handle on what's going on. Try writing a first draft to just \"let it out.\" Then, a few days later, organize your thoughts so you’re ready for a conversation.

[1] X Research source Use \"I\" language instead of \"you\" language to focus on your emotions. For example, saying \"I feel ignored\" is better than saying \"you're ignoring me.\" Here are some examples: \"I feel left out lately. Sometimes I feel like you're so busy taking care of the baby that you don't have enough time for me, but when I try to get attention, you yell at me.\" \"I feel hurt sometimes when I try to make plans to spend time with you, and they get canceled, and then I see you hanging out with Arthur. It makes me feel like I don't matter as much to you.\" \"I know that Kaja is going through a rough time lately, and I'm glad you're there for her. I don't know if you realized that I'm struggling too. I would like to be able to talk to you about it, but sometimes I worry that you don't have time for me.\""

But if they seem confused or if they ask you to explain, you might bring up an example or two. \"You went to almost all of John's football games last season, but you only attended one of my volleyball games. Why is that?\" \"The last time Imani got sick, you were always bringing her food, comforting her, and checking in on her. When I got sick last week, you left me alone. It made me feel like I didn't matter.\" \"Lee got to use the car right away when he turned 16. But when I asked, you said no. Did you have a specific reason for that?\" \"I saw that you gave Olivia an expensive gaming laptop for her birthday. And on my birthday, you gave me a cheap tablet. I don't mean to be materialistic, but at the same time, I felt let down.\""

This lets them know how they can try to fix it, and it allows them to see how much you care. Propose an idea that could help; be willing to change the details based on what works for your parents. \"Could you please try to show up to more of my games? I feel so happy knowing you're there to cheer me on.\" \"I would like to be closer to you. Maybe we could take more walks in the evening? What do you think?\" \"I understand what you mean when you say you've been really busy lately. Would it be nicer if I kept you company and helped out when you did chores?\" \"If I helped Annie with her homework more often, would that help give you time for your to-do list so there would be time for us to play games sometimes?\" \"I agree that Tom's music lessons are good for him, and I'm glad he's getting them.

It's hard to have a useful conversation if one or both people are too upset to think straight. If you see this happening, take a break. If you feel upset by the conversation, then try taking a break and do some deep breathing . Try saying something like, “I will be right back.

Sometimes talking about your feelings and/or making a plan is enough for them to change their behavior; other times it isn't—this is typically not your fault. The way they react to an honest conversation reflects on how good they are at parenting, not how good you are at being their child. You can't change other people. [2] X Research source You can only control your own behavior. They may need time to think about it first—give it to them. You can talk about this again another time. Sometimes people are willing to change their behavior. If your parent starts treating you more fairly, accept that this is a genuine choice and be willing to start forgiving."

These feelings are normal, but they aren't forever, and they don't have to define your life. \"Scapegoating\" is when people act like something is your fault even though it isn't. They may even convince you that you're to blame. Remember that you control your behavior, and that other people control their own behavior. Try visualization exercises. For example, if you think a negative thought about yourself, imagine it written on a balloon. Then picture letting go of the balloon and watching it float away into nothingness."

[5] X Research source If your parents spent years acting as though your other sibling(s) are smarter, funnier, or more interesting than you, you might start to believe them.

Remove yourself from the situation or at least limit your time there, i.e., family favoritism situations. Stop talking and thinking about favoritism. Place your energy and efforts into changing the situation. Change your attitude and story about the situation. Surround yourself with people who value you. Encourage yourself and ignore favoritism.

A good relationship tends to feel good. Hanging out with the person usually makes you feel happy or calm, not stressed. It isn't scary or confusing. Remember, others should love you for who you are , without any expectation of anything in return. Stay far away from cults , gangs, romantic relationships with much older people, and other unsafe situations.

[8] X Research source If your sibling is old enough to understand what’s going on, talk to them about how your parents are mistreating you.

If you're struggling with that, talk to a parent, mentor, or school counselor about what to do. Follow the family rules. Don't break them just for fun. If the rules feel unfair, talk to them about it. Try not to pick fights or yell at people. If you get upset, walk away and say you need a break. Be assertive when you feel upset. Say \"I want,\" \"I feel,\" and \"I need\" instead of yelling or acting out. Ask for help when things go wrong. If you can't fix it yourself, tell someone what's happening. Ask for their advice and support. Apologize when you mess up. You'll make mistakes. (Everyone does.) Be fair, say you're sorry, and try to do better next time. Try to be fair to everyone.

While sometimes it's favoritism, in other cases, differences in treatment are a result of parents adjusting to their child's needs and behavior. Asking yourself a few questions might help you figure out what's really happening here. Have punishments and privileges been earned? If one kid breaks more rules, they might get punished more. A kid who acts more responsibly might get a few more privileges because they've proven they can be trusted. See if the behavior explains (or doesn't explain) the consequences. Are expectations and privileges age- and ability-appropriate? Older kids might get more freedom and responsibilities because they're ready for it. But if a younger kid reaches the same age with the same skills and is treated very differently, that might signal a problem. Do the same principles apply to different activities? If one kid has theater performances and one has football games, do parents try to attend both? Are all kids getting decent access to opportunities? Are all kids getting equal access to opportunities that are appropriate for their skills and interests? Does one kid have higher needs right now? Things like illnesses, bullying, disabilities, social problems, and other issues might mean that one kid needs more attention for some time. (Of course, parents should still make time for other kids, too.)"

Gender: Sometimes parents prefer kids who have the same gender as they do. In a patriarchal society, sons may get more attention and privileges while daughters get more chores. Some parents are harsher with sons while being gentler and more affectionate with daughters.
