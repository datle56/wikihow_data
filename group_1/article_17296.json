      "title": "Confirm that all of the diamonds are in the right spot.",
      "content": "Confirm that all of the diamonds are in the right spot. Once you seal the painting, you won’t be able to move any of the diamonds anymore. Check the painting carefully and make sure all the diamonds are in the right spot. This way, the painting will be perfect when you seal it. If any diamonds are in the wrong spot, simply pull them up with a pair of tweezers and place them in the right spot. Be careful not to disturb any of the surrounding diamonds. [1] X Research source If only 1 or 2 diamonds are in the wrong spot, some pros recommend ignoring them. They probably won’t even be noticeable when the painting is done."

      "title": "Press all of the diamonds down with a roller.",
      "content": "Press all of the diamonds down with a roller. If the diamonds aren’t all completely flat, you’ll get an uneven finish. First place the painting face-up on a flat, solid surface. Then use the roller that comes with most diamond painting kits and roll it over the entire painting. This should press all the diamonds into place. [2] X Research source You can get a roller from an arts store if you don’t have one. If you don’t have a roller, you could also pile some books onto the painting overnight. This presses the diamonds down evenly. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick any hair or lint off the painting.",
      "content": "Pick any hair or lint off the painting. If any hair or lint gets stuck under the sealer, it could ruin the finish. Check the painting and pick out any hair or lint with a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to knock any of the diamonds out of place. Especially check between the diamonds. Hair could be hiding in those spaces. If you have trouble seeing lint or hair on the painting, try using a magnifying glass to help."

    {
      "title": "Wipe the painting with a cloth or toothbrush to remove dust.",
      "content": "Wipe the painting with a cloth or toothbrush to remove dust. Be gentle and wipe the entire painting. This should get rid of any dust so it doesn’t get trapped under the sealer. [4] X Research source Also try to get rid of any leftover wax or glue between the diamonds. Scrub a bit harder to remove this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a waterproof paint sealer to protect the painting.",
      "content": "Choose a waterproof paint sealer to protect the painting. You have a few choices for the type of sealer to use. Any type of clear varnish should work fine. You can easily find these online or at an arts store. Pick up a bottle to get started. [5] X Research source Some popular sealers include Mod Podge, Matisse, and Liquitex. [6] X Research source Some hobbyists also say that clear nail polish can work as well. You can also use a glossy or glittered finish for a more decorative approach. While all paint sealers will give your painting a bit of a shine, glittered types will really make the painting sparkle. Mod Podge makes a glittered finish. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wet a paintbrush with sealer.",
      "content": "Wet a paintbrush with sealer. Open the jar and dip in a normal paintbrush. Let the brush drip over the bottle for a few seconds, then wipe off any excess sealer on the edge of the bottle. [8] X Research source Any type of brush will work, but a wider one is best for getting a nice even finish. You could also pour some of the sealer into a plate instead. That way, you don’t have to keep dipping the brush into the bottle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply an even layer of sealer onto the painting.",
      "content": "Apply an even layer of sealer onto the painting. Start in any spot and simply brush the sealer onto the painting. Spread the sealer around so it covers the entire painting with an even coat, and re-wet the brush as needed. [9] X Research source A thin coat is best, because using a thick coat will make the painting look more dull. Brush over each spot from at least 2 different directions. This way, the sealer will get between the diamonds for a better finish. [10] X Research source Sealers usually look white when they first go on. Don’t worry, you didn’t ruin the painting! They’re designed to be completely clear when they dry."

    {
      "title": "Let the sealer dry overnight.",
      "content": "Let the sealer dry overnight. Place the painting on a flat surface where it won’t be disturbed. Leave it overnight so the sealer dries fully and gives the painting a nice finish. After that, you can display your new painting however you want! [11] X Research source The exact drying time might be different, depending on which sealer you use. Follow the instructions on the brand that you use."

    {
      "title": "Get a spray-on paint sealer.",
      "content": "Get a spray-on paint sealer. These are similar to brush-on sealers, but come in a spray bottle instead. This is quicker and easier to apply. Look online or in a crafts store for a clear, spray-on paint sealer. [12] X Research source Mod Podge makes spray sealers, so this is a good product to start with. Some hobbyists say that while spray sealer is quick and easy to apply, it’s not as durable as brush-on sealers. Keep that in mind if you want your painting to last a long time."

    {
      "title": "Shake the bottle well before using it.",
      "content": "Shake the bottle well before using it. Keep the bottle capped and give it a good shake. This should even out the spray and give you a nicer finish. [13] X Research source There may be other instructions for preparing the sealer, so always check before using it."

    {
      "title": "Spray a thin, even layer all over the painting.",
      "content": "Spray a thin, even layer all over the painting. Hold the bottle 3–5 in (7.6–12.7 cm) away from the painting. Spray in short bursts and move around the painting so none of the sealer pools. If the layer is too thick, the finish will look dull. Continue spraying until you’ve covered the painting with an even layer of sealer. [14] X Research source Keep the painting flat while you’re spraying so none of the sealer drips."
