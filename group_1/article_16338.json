      "title": "Illness is typically considered the most valid reason to take time off.",
      "content": "Illness is typically considered the most valid reason to take time off. You cannot predict when loved ones get sick, so most people will understand if you have to miss a prior engagement or responsibility. Mention your family member caught a severe case of the flu or food poisoning if you need a believable excuse. “My child got food poisoning last night. I apologize for the late notice, but I need to take the day off to look after her.” “I have to miss your party because my dad caught a serious case of the flu. I need to stay home and monitor his symptoms.” “I’m so sorry, but I can’t attend your screening tonight. My husband just started vomiting uncontrollably, so I need to take him to the ER right now.”"

      "title": "Covid exposure can disrupt the entire office or classroom.",
      "content": "Covid exposure can disrupt the entire office or classroom. The virus spreads quickly, and symptoms can take days to appear if you’ve come into contact with someone positive. Develop a backstory of how you were exposed, and provide a timeline of when you can safely return to the office or classroom. “I’m sorry to cancel on you at the last minute, but my husband just tested positive for Covid so I cannot attend the event tonight.” “My wife just got her Covid result back, and it’s positive. I won’t be able to work at the office for the next few days until I’m sure I don’t have any symptoms. I don’t want to risk spreading it to anyone else.”"

      "title": "Injuries are a universal struggle that most people understand.",
      "content": "Injuries are a universal struggle that most people understand. Increase your believability by explaining what type of injury. If you need more time to create a story , simply state there’s been a “freak accident” so you can develop the details during your time off. “I apologize in advance, but my husband has just been in a freak accident. I need to leave right now to go to the hospital.” “I’m sorry for such short notice, but I have to cancel our date tonight. My dad sliced his hand open while making lunch, and I’m still at the ER.” “I just received a call that my mother fell down a flight of stairs. I need to leave immediately to make sure she’s ok.”"

      "title": "Motor accidents allow you to bolt the office without questions.",
      "content": "Motor accidents allow you to bolt the office without questions. It’s common knowledge that motor accidents are unexpected and potentially fatal. Use this excuse if you need to leave in the middle of an event , but prepare yourself for follow-up questions when you return. Your boss might ask what happened and how your family member is doing. “I just got a call from my husband that he’s been in a car accident. I’m sorry, but I need to leave now to go to the hospital.” “There’s been a car accident, and my child was driving. I need to leave immediately to make sure she’s ok.” “My dad was in a car accident last night and I’m still with him at the hospital. I’m sorry for the short notice, but I need to take the morning off.”"

      "content": "Most people empathize with emergencies involving children. Whether your babysitter is unavailable or your child’s school ends unexpectedly, use this excuse if you need to get out of something at the last minute–it’s almost impossible to verify, and most people have a soft spot for kids!

I’m sorry, but I need to leave immediately to find out what happened.” “My daughter is being let out of school early, so I need to leave at 1 PM to pick her up.” “My nanny just tested positive for Covid. I apologize for the short notice, but I need to leave the office early to look after my child. I can’t find a replacement!”"

      "title": "Most people understand that home issues are unpredictable.",
      "content": "Most people understand that home issues are unpredictable. Severe home issues like gas leaks or burst pipes can be dangerous if left unattended. To increase the importance of the situation, you could also mention that other parties (neighbors, police) are currently waiting on you. “There was a burst pipe at my parents’ house, and their kitchen is completely flooded. I’m sorry for the late notice, but I have to help them so I can’t attend the event tonight.” “My husband just told me there’s been a gas leak at my house. I need to leave work immediately to take care of that.” I just got an alert that someone broke into my grandma’s home. I apologize, but I need to leave right now – my neighbors and the police are waiting on me.”"

      "content": "Appointments are personal, so most bosses won’t expect extreme detail. This excuse is perfect if your family member doesn’t have transportation or cannot speak the national language. It’s unlikely that you’ll need to provide specific details, but it may seem more plausible to state the appointment type.

Go to source “My mom has a green card appointment coming up, and I need to be present because she can’t speak English. I’ll need to take the day off to attend her interview.” “I sincerely apologize for the late notice, but my child could only schedule a DMV appointment at 10 A.M. Thursday morning. I’ll have to come in late because she doesn’t have her driver’s license and my spouse cannot take her.”"

      "content": "Most people recognize that moving can be challenging for the elderly. Use this excuse if you need to take several hours or the entire day off – moving is time-consuming! It’s more legitimate to say the moving company only operates during business hours so your boss doesn’t question why you can’t help outside of work hours. “My grandmother is moving next week, and I need to take the day off to help her move all the furniture. I apologize, but there were no other delivery times available.” “My dad injured his wrist recently, but he’s also in the middle of a move. I’m sorry, but I need to leave early on Friday to carry his belongings. He can’t lift any heavy objects right now.”"

      "content": "Most people can sympathize with a poor financial situation. Money is a sensitive topic, making it the perfect excuse to avoid burning bridges with people. Express an unfortunate financial situation if you need to back out of an event like a reunion, party, or concert. Let the other person know that your family member needed unexpected financial help, so you don’t have the funds to purchase tickets or cover travel.

Go to source “I’m so sorry, but I don’t think I can go to the concert with you anymore. My dad needed to borrow money from me last minute, and I don’t have anything to spare for tickets.” “I won’t be able to make it to the reunion next weekend. My sister couldn’t pay her bill last month, so I had to help her out. I’m sorry, but I just don’t have enough to pay for the flight at the moment.”"
