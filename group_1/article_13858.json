      "content": "Have hair that is long enough to pull into a ponytail. This style is meant for those whose hair is the same length all around. It may not work as well for undercuts or fades. Ideally, your hair should be long enough to gather back into a ponytail, about 8 inches (20.32 centimeters). [1] X Research source If you have an undercut but also have hair that is about shoulder length, you should be able to make the ponytail. However, your hair will not look as full if you choose to do a half-up, half-down look since your hair isn't as thick."
