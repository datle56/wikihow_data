      "title": "Cut 4 ft (1.2 m) of wire.",
      "content": "Cut 4 ft (1.2 m) of wire. You will need to use 0.012 stainless steel wire to string the beads onto your barrette base. This type of wire is the strongest option and it will give you the best results. Cut the wire with a pair of wire cutters or very strong, sharp scissors. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "String 1 round bead onto the center of your wire.",
      "content": "String 1 round bead onto the center of your wire. Choose a bead that is larger than the hole at the end of the barrette base so that it won’t slip through the hole. This will be your anchor bead. Then, string the bead onto the wire by inserting 1 of the wire’s ends through it. Slide the bead down until it is in the center of the wire. [2] X Research source You can use a plain or fancy bead to anchor the other beads onto the barrette base. It’s up to you and your design!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the ends of the wire through the hole at the end of the barrette.",
      "content": "Insert the ends of the wire through the hole at the end of the barrette. The barrette should have 2 holes in it with 1 hole on each end. Insert the ends of the wire through one of the holes. Then, tug the ends until the bead is positioned over the hole. [3] X Research source It doesn’t matter which end of the barrette you start stringing the beads on. However, you might find it easier to secure the crimp beads at the end if you start stringing beads at the hinge of the barrette rather than at the clasp or opening of the barrette."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the left wire through the right side of the bead and vice versa.",
      "content": "Insert the left wire through the right side of the bead and vice versa. Cross the wires under the hole so that they are going in the opposite direction of the side of the bead they are on. Then, insert the end of each wire into the opposite side of the bead on the top of the barrette. Pull the ends through the bead and pull them taut to secure the bead over the hole. [4] X Research source Your first bead is now anchored to the barrette base and you can continue to string beads onto it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick up 1 bead with each end of the wire.",
      "content": "Pick up 1 bead with each end of the wire. You might want to make a small pile or fill a dish with the first type of beads you want to string onto the barrette. Insert 1 end of the wire through each of the beads and let the beads slide all the way down to the barrette base. [5] X Research source An added bonus of using wire filament is that it is stiff, so you don’t need to use a needle to string your beads like you would use when making a beaded necklace or bracelet."

    {
      "title": "Insert both ends through 1 bead from opposite directions.",
      "content": "Insert both ends through 1 bead from opposite directions. Next, insert both ends of the wire through the same bead, but going from opposite directions. For example, insert the right end from the right side of the bead and the left end from the left side of the bead. Tug the ends to slide the bead against the others. [6] X Research source The ends should cross each other inside of the bead and form a diamond shape with the first 4 beads attached to the barrette base."

      "title": "Press the beads down against the barrette and wrap the wires under it.",
      "content": "Press the beads down against the barrette and wrap the wires under it. Once the beads are in a diamond-shape against the barrette, press it down to help make it lay even flatter. Otherwise, the wire may stick up from the barrette base slightly. Then, slide the ends of the wire under the barrette base going from opposite directions. [7] X Research source"

Then, insert each end of the wire through the side of the bead that the wires come up on. Tug he ends of the wires until they are all the way through the bead. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat the process to add more beads. After you have finished securing the fourth bead, repeat the process to add more beads in the same manner. Insert the ends of each wire through 1 bead each, and then insert them through the same bead to anchor those beads. Continue to do this until you reach the end of the barrette."

      "title": "Insert the ends of the wire through the end hole.",
      "content": "Insert the ends of the wire through the end hole. Once you reach the end of the barrette base, you can anchor the beads to the barrette base. Push the ends of the wire down through the hole on the end of the barrette base just as you did to anchor it at the beginning. Tug until the last bead is pressed against the hole. [10] X Research source You can use the same type of bead you started with or a different bead depending on your preferences and design."

After you bring the ends of the wire down through the hole, wrap them under the barrette base going in opposite directions and then bring them up along opposite sides of the barrette base. Insert each end through the bead on opposing sides and pull the ends through the bead until the wire is taut. [11] X Research source If you’re finished adding beads, then you can secure the ends with crimp beads. If not, then repeat the process going back over the last row with a smaller size bead.

Tug the wires tight to get the beads as close to the barrette as possible. Then, use you chain-nose pliers to squeeze the beads tightly around the wire. [13] X Research source You may want to open the hair clip before you do this to make it easier to access the bottom of the barrette."

      "title": "Cut the ends of the wires off right next to the crimp beads.",
      "content": "Cut the ends of the wires off right next to the crimp beads. Use the wire cutters to do this. Cut the wire as close to the crimp bead as you can to minimize the amount of wire that is sticking out. Cut straight across the wire to prevent any sharp or jagged edges. [14] X Research source You can also use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the wire, but with scissors it might be more difficult to cut as close to the barrette base as is needed for a clean finish."
