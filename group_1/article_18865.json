      "content": "Amazon Vine is invitation-only, meaning you can’t apply. Vine Voices—the name for their program members—are selected by Amazon to become reviewers because of their high-quality reviews, influence, or both. There’s no official criteria or timeline for receiving an invitation to Amazon Vine . [1] X Research source Amazon Vine members aren’t paid, but they receive free products in exchange for honest reviews. If you want to be invited, your best bet is to review products you purchase through Amazon and wait to get selected."

      "title": "Create an Amazon account.",
      "content": "Create an Amazon account. If you want to receive an invitation to Amazon Vine, you need an Amazon account. Use one account to order products and leave reviews in order to build a presence and a reputation as a trusted reviewer. Signing up for Amazon Prime isn’t necessary to become a Vine Voice , but it may be worth it if you order from Amazon regularly. With a Prime membership, you get free shipping on eligible items."

      "title": "Leave honest, helpful reviews for products you buy.",
      "content": "Leave honest, helpful reviews for products you buy. If you want to receive free products from Amazon, you’re probably already a shopper on the site. Go through past purchases and leave helpful reviews that honestly assess the quality and value of the product. Start leaving reviews for all future purchases, too. [2] X Research source To make your review as helpful as possible, be specific about what you liked and disliked about the product. Be honest—an overly positive or negative review isn’t usually the most accurate or helpful. Include pictures or videos of the product. This will make your review stand out, which helps you get noticed by Amazon for the Vine program. Follow Amazon’s guidelines to make sure your reviews aren’t removed."

      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. It might take months or even years before you’re invited to join Amazon Vine. Even if you’re tempted to give up, keep reviewing. Your feedback will help other customers make informed purchases—and honest reviews can bring much-needed exposure to new sellers. Not every reviewer will be invited to join Amazon Vine, but there are alternative ways to get free products to review on sites outside of Amazon."

    {
      "title": "Select items you want to review.",
      "content": "Select items you want to review. Check the Vine Voice web page frequently to request products you actually want to test and review. [3] X Research source If you’re not a gamer, but you request a video game, you may have a hard time providing a helpful review. If you love makeup, however, select makeup products that you know you’ll be able to fairly evaluate. Adhere to program guidelines for how many items (and what maximum product value) you can request to receive each day. You must pay taxes on the free products you receive through Amazon Vine. Amazon sends Vine participants a 1099-NEC form which you can use to report the proper “income” (estimated total product value) you received from the program that year when filing your taxes."

      "title": "Test and use products before reviewing.",
      "content": "Test and use products before reviewing. To provide the most accurate review, use the products thoroughly and test out all their features or applications. Inspect them to see if they resemble the seller images on Amazon. Check that they’re functional and have all the features the seller promises. [4] X Research source Ask yourself: if you were considering buying this product, what would you want to know about? For example, if you’re testing a pair of shoes, are they true-to-size, comfortable, and durable? Are they the right color and material that you ordered? Take notes as you test or use the product so it’s easier to remember everything you want to say about it."

      "title": "Write an honest, thoughtful review.",
      "content": "Write an honest, thoughtful review. Don’t give a product five stars just because you received it for free. Be honest about its positive and negative aspects. Additionally, be thoughtful about the information you include—you want other shoppers to find your reviews helpful. Stay focused on the product and keep your review as concise as possible. [5] X Research source Sellers may try to contact you if they suspect you’re a Vine Voice to bribe you or otherwise sway your review. This is against Amazon’s Community Guidelines on compensated reviews. [6] X Research source Ignore them or report them to Amazon Vine’s support."

    {
      "title": "Include pictures or videos in your review.",
      "content": "Include pictures or videos in your review. People want to know what a product looks like in real life, not just in the seller’s photos. Take high-quality, well-lit pictures or videos of the product from multiple angles. Show the product in action, if relevant. Adding this media will make your review more helpful and trustworthy. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Disclose that you got the product for free.",
      "content": "Disclose that you got the product for free. The FTC requires reviewers to clearly state that they received a product for free, so shoppers are aware of how this may influence your review. [8] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Independent U.S. government agency focused on consumer protection Go to source Include a line at the top of your review stating that you received the product for free through the Amazon Vine program. For example, write “I received this product for free through Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review.”"

      "title": "Give your review a short, relevant title.",
      "content": "Give your review a short, relevant title. When shoppers are scrolling through a product’s review, help yours stand out with a brief, on-topic title. Instead of relying on all-caps or exclamation points to get attention, highlight your key takeaways about the product. Again, keep it short. For example, if you’re reviewing a spatula that was flimsy but otherwise fine, you might title your review: “Flimsy but satisfactory for casual cooks.” Don’t put a generic title like “I love this!” or “This product sucks!” Be specific about what your review discusses. Focus on why you gave the product the review and rating you did."

      "title": "Review products within 30 days.",
      "content": "Review products within 30 days. The Amazon Vine program gives you about one month from receiving a product to leave your review.

      "title": "Wait six months to sell or dispose of products.",
      "content": "Wait six months to sell or dispose of products. While you might be tempted to flip the free products you receive for quick cash after you leave a review, this is against the terms of the program. You must keep the products you receive for a minimum of six months. After that, you can sell, donate, or dispose of them. [10] X Research source Because of this waiting period, Amazon Vine isn’t the best way to make fast money as a reseller. You also have to pay taxes on the products you receive."

      "content": "Flag broken products to Amazon Vine support. If you receive an Amazon Vine product that arrives broken, it’s hard to fairly review it. Contact Amazon Vine’s support or Amazon support to see if you can either get the product replaced or have it removed from your expected reviews. [11] X Research source If you think it wasn’t broken in transit, but is in some way not functional, leave an honest review describing the product’s problems."

      "content": "Review bad products honestly and fairly. Chances are, you won’t love everything you receive from Amazon Vine. You’re not expected to—but you are expected to leave an honest review to help other shoppers. Follow the same process you would to review a good product. Find pros and cons, and be specific about why you found the product unsatisfactory. If sellers try to get you to change your review by contacting you, report them to Amazon. Sellers cannot remove Amazon Vine reviews. Only Amazon can do that."

      "content": "Amazon Vine products are free, but taxed. You don’t pay anything for the products you review or the shipping, and you don’t pay to be invited to or take part in the program. However, Amazon sends out a 1099-NEC form with the estimated total value of all the products you received during the tax year, which you report when you file taxes.
