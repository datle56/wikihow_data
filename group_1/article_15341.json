      "content": "Eat chicken with utensils. Usually, sautéed or boneless chicken is eaten with a fork and knife. Use the knife to cut the meat into smaller, bite-sized pieces. If you’re eating chicken with bones in it, use the knife to hold the chicken in place while you pull the meat off with the fork. Americans usually hold their knife in their right hand and fork in the left while cutting food. To eat it, they move the fork to their right hand. European diners usually hold their fork in their right hand and the knife in their left. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use your fingers to eat chicken. In most cases, fried and roasted chicken can be politely eaten with your fingers. To do so, pick the chicken up with both hands and take a modest bite. Avoid sucking the chicken off the bone or licking your fingers in public. This is seen as rude and unsanitary.

      "content": "Roast a whole chicken. First, rub the chicken with a seasoning blend. Next, cook the chicken in the oven at 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) for about an hour. Use a cooking thermometer to check the temperature of the chicken. When the thickest part reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (75 degrees Celsius), the chicken is done cooking. Standard chicken seasoning includes 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 crushed garlic clove, a tablespoon of salt, and a tablespoon of pepper. For an aromatic roasted chicken, create a seasoning by combining tablespoons of celery flakes, salt, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. [4] X Research source Create an herbal seasoning mix from ¼ cup chopped mint, ¼ cup chopped parsley, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon ground pepper, and the juice from a lemon."
