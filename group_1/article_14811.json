    {
      "title": "Pick out a black dress or all-black outfit.",
      "content": "Pick out a black dress or all-black outfit. Classic witches are usually seen in long, black dresses, while modern witches could go for ripped black jeans and a black long-sleeve shirt. Pick out your main attire based on what you’ll feel comfortable in and what you already have in your closet. [1] X Research source You can turn a plain black dress into a witch’s dress by distressing the hem and sleeves with scissors so it looks tattered and torn. If you’re going for a classically evil witch, try to find a full-length all-black gown. If you’re on a budget, check out thrift stores or costume shops nearby so you don’t have to break the bank."

      "title": "Slide on a pair of black stockings to keep your legs warm.",
      "content": "Slide on a pair of black stockings to keep your legs warm. Tights or stockings are optional, but they can help you out if the weather is chilly (especially if you’re wearing a mini dress). Stick with black tights to complete your all-black theme, and spring for fishnets or patterned tights if you want to make your costume a little fancy. [2] X Research source Spiderweb tights would be a great addition to your evil witch character. It’s okay if your tights are ripped! You’ll look like you just came back from a rough fly around town on your broomstick. If you’re going for the ripped jeans look, you can always throw on a pair of fishnets underneath for a pop of pattern peeking out. You could also wear some striped stockings or tall socks for a more classic look."

    {
      "title": "Go with black boots or shoes to complete your look.",
      "content": "Go with black boots or shoes to complete your look. Classic witches usually wear pointed boots, but you can go with any black shoes you’d like. If you’re going for a more modern witch, consider wearing some black sneakers or high tops. If your witch is from the olden days, some black heels could complete your outfit. [3] X Research source If you’re going out trick or treating, stick with flat shoes so you’re comfortable walking in them. If you’re heading to a party and you want to look a little more fancy, slip on some black stilettos."

    {
      "title": "Pop on a black witch’s hat.",
      "content": "Pop on a black witch’s hat. This is the part of your outfit that people will recognize the most. You can pick up a cheap black witch’s hat from a thrift store or costume store to wear on Halloween. [4] X Research source If you’re going for a Maleficent look, put on a pair of horns instead of a tall hat. If you’d like to make your hat your own, use hot glue to add fake spiders or leaves for an extra fall look. Make your hat a little more glam with gold spray paint or glitter glue."

    {
      "title": "Add a cape or a cloak for an impressive entrance.",
      "content": "Add a cape or a cloak for an impressive entrance. Not every witch wears a cape, but it can add a little more evil elegance to your outfit. Tie a black cape around your neck and watch it drape behind you to make everyone stop and stare when you enter the room. [5] X Research source A black velvet cape would work well with a Victorian-era witch, while black cotton cloaks could complete a more modern outfit. You can look for black capes at a costume store near you. If you can’t find a black cape, tie a black blanket around your neck instead."

    {
      "title": "Paint your face green if you’re going for a Wizard of Oz look.",
      "content": "Paint your face green if you’re going for a Wizard of Oz look. The Wicked Witch of the West is known for her all green face and neck. If you’d like to go for her look, grab some green face paint and carefully pat it over your face, ears, and skin. [6] X Research source Use a light green for your all over base, then add contours and shadows with a darker green color. You could also add a few large moles to make your face look more evil."

    {
      "title": "Stick with a black smokey eye and lipstick for a more modern look.",
      "content": "Stick with a black smokey eye and lipstick for a more modern look. If going green isn’t your thing, pat on some black eyeshadow, then blend it up toward your eyebrow with an eyeshadow brush. Add some long, winged liner and a coat of black lipstick to complete your dark, evil look. [7] X Research source Go glam with a little glitter eyeshadow and some false lashes. Makeup is totally optional! If you don’t want to wear it, you don’t have to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear a long black wig or make your hair look messy.",
      "content": "Wear a long black wig or make your hair look messy. If you don’t want to mess with your hair, slide a wig cap on and put on a long, black wig (the frizzier the better). If you don’t have a wig, use a small comb to tease your hair by brushing it backwards to make it look messy and frizzy. [8] X Research source The goal is to look like you just flew in on a broomstick, so the messier, the better! You could even add small sticks or leaves to your hair for a super lived-in look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint your nails black.",
      "content": "Paint your nails black. All witches love the color black! Emphasize that by painting your nails super dark to match your outfit. [9] X Research source If you want to go for the dirty, unkempt witch’s look, rub coffee grounds on your hands to stain your fingers. You could even paint small spider webs onto your nails using white or silver nail polish. If you have fake nails, consider filing them into long, pointed claws to make your outfit even scarier."

    {
      "title": "Grab a broomstick for a fun prop.",
      "content": "Grab a broomstick for a fun prop. Classic witches were always carrying around broomsticks to get from place to place. Look for an old broom with a wooden handle and bristles that look messy, and carry that around as you party the night away. [10] X Research source Look for old-fashioned broomsticks at thrift stores in your area. Or, make your own by gluing pieces of straw to a long wooden staff."

      "title": "Gaze into a crystal ball to see the future.",
      "content": "Gaze into a crystal ball to see the future. Remember in the Wizard of Oz when the Wicked Witch sees Dorothy’s future? Or in Sleeping Beauty when Maleficent looks for Aurora in one? You can channel your inner evil witch by pulling out a crystal ball at parties or out trick or treating. [11] X Research source Your crystal ball doesn’t have to be large! Find a small plastic one from a costume store and shove it in your purse before you head out. When you look into your crystal ball, rub it slowly and cackle like you’re seeing something truly evil."

    {
      "title": "Hold a tall staff to look intimidating.",
      "content": "Hold a tall staff to look intimidating. Who says staffs are just for wizards? Grab a long stick and glue a fake skull to the top to show what happens to your enemies. Carry that around all night to scare your fellow party-goers. [12] X Research source You can also glue on a few fake flowers to spice up your staff and make it look more evil."

    {
      "title": "Carry around a plush or rubber animal as your witch’s familiar.",
      "content": "Carry around a plush or rubber animal as your witch’s familiar. Legend has it, witches used to use animals as their little helpers, or familiars. If you have a stuffed black cat, owl, or rat, you can carry it around with you and tell people it does your bidding. [13] X Research source Evil witches could also carry around rubber toads, spiders, or even a raven. You probably don’t want to take care of a real animal all night, so leave your live pets at home."
