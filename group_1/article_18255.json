      "content": "Cut the pizza apart into individual slices, if needed. If you have a lot of pizza left over, cut it apart into individual slices with a pizza cutter. Skip this step if you have only 1 slice to freeze. Most pizzas already come pre-sliced, but they are still connected along the crust. You need to separate the slices from each other completely."

      "content": "Wrap each slice individually with plastic wrap. Tear off a piece of plastic wrap and set it on the counter. Place a pizza slice on top of the plastic wrap, making sure it's centered. Fold the edges of the plastic wrap over the pizza to cover it completely. Do this with all of the slices."

      "title": "Wrap each slide with aluminum foil or wax paper to prevent sticking.",
      "content": "Wrap each slide with aluminum foil or wax paper to prevent sticking. Plastic wrap tends to stick to everything, so you need to create a barrier around it. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil or wax paper, then wrap it around the pizza slice. If you don't have aluminum foil or wax paper, you could try freezer paper or parchment paper."

      "title": "Place the pizza slice(s) into a plastic freezer bag and label it.",
      "content": "Place the pizza slice(s) into a plastic freezer bag and label it. You can put more than 1 pizza slice into a freezer bag, as long as the bag is big enough. If you don't have any freezer bags, you can use another freezer-safe plastic container. Write the date on the bag or container with a permanent marker. If you don't want to ruin the container, write the date on a piece of masking tape, then put the tape on the container."

      "content": "Thaw the pizza in the fridge for 2 to 3 hours, then bake it. When you are ready to eat your pizza, take it out of the freezer and unwrap it. Let it thaw on a plate in the fridge for about 2 to 3 hours. Bake it in a preheated oven at 350 °F (177 °C) for 5 minutes. You can thaw and cook the pizza in the microwave, but you may not get that freshly-baked taste. For a well-done pizza, try 375 °F (191 °C) for 12 to 15 minutes instead. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Transfer the dough to a round baking sheet. A baking sheet meant for pizza will work the best. If you are making a small pizza, then you can use the bottom from a spring-form cake pan instead. Simply find a spring-form cake pan that is the same size as your pizza. Open up the latch on the side of the pan, then pop the bottom of the pan out."

Place the pizza onto a round baking sheet, if you have not already, then tuck it into the oven. Bake the pizza for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the dough looks puffy and dry. [2] X Research source Do not add the toppings or bake the crust all the way. You will finish baking the crust when you are ready to eat it. Par-baking the crust is the key to keeping the crust from turning soggy when you thaw and bake the pizza."

      "content": "Take the crust out of the oven, let it cool, then add the toppings. Once the crust looks puffy and dry, slide it out of the oven. Allow the crust to cool down to room temperature. Add your desired toppings, such as pizza sauce, cheese, and veggies. [3] X Research source How long the pizza takes to cool depends on how big is it and the temperature in your kitchen. Expect this to take around 10 to 15 minutes. Do not remove the pizza from the baking sheet. You will freeze the pizza while it is still on the sheet."

Next, wrap it with aluminum foil. Once again, use as much foil as needed to cover the pizza. This double-layer of plastic wrap and aluminum foil will help prevent freezer burn.

This will make it easier to store."

Don't worry about covering the baking sheet. This is just the initial freezing; you will transfer the dough into a bag once it is completely frozen.

How long this takes depends on whether you froze the dough as a ball or as a disk; the ball will take longer to thaw. If you didn't let your dough rise all the way before putting it into the freezer, let it rise another 1 to 2 hours before baking it (or turning it into a pizza crust). [14] X Research source"
