      "title": "Determine if you need to do it again.",
      "content": "Determine if you need to do it again. Your hair needs to be a very pale blonde color before you apply the silver dye in order to get the silver color you desire. If it is a shade of orange or light brown, you will need to bleach your hair again, by following the kit's same steps. Remember to wait at least a week or so after the first bleaching process to lighten your hair again. Rinse your hair when it is pale blonde then use toner to remove the last bits of yellow. Avoid letting the bleach process for so long that your hair turns white, as this is a sign of damage. You might even want to wait longer than a week to bleach your hair again if it's in poor shape after the first bleaching. Since you have black hair, you'll probably have to bleach it at least twice. Be wary about bleaching your hair multiple times. Bleach can cause extreme breakage. If your hair isn't reaching that pale yellow color and the bleach seems to be damaging it, consider talking to a professional hair stylist."
