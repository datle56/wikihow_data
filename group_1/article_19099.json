If you (or your parents) are willing to pay for a core membership for DeviantArt, you will have advantages: including options to make your page more interesting, and the option to request critiques on your artwork. For your profile, you can add all of the widgets available and choose to show however many thumbnail pictures you want to be displayed. Not to mention that you can choose from over hundreds of journal skins to make your journal entries more decorative.

If your deviations aren't being seen, even if you have a fair amount of watchers, submitting your art to a few well-known groups might help your artwork get noticed. A lot of people join and contribute to groups on DeviantArt, and there's a chance a lot of people will notice what you've submitted if your art is accepted into a group. Choose a set of groups that are themed to your particular piece you are going to submit. If you have a picture of a Gothic castle for example, you can submit it to Dark Art, Gothic Souls Club, Madmen Asylum, DisturbingArtHorror, or Bloody Sanctuary."

This is also a good way for other deviants to see your name. As you scroll down to the comment section on their page, take notice of the art they have on their front page, and their likes and interests, or if they have something funny. If you can, try to comment on something you saw or noticed, in addition to saying thank you. Always be nice and try to say something positive."
