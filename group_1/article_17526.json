      "title": "Scrub the container with a paste made of baking soda and water.",
      "content": "Scrub the container with a paste made of baking soda and water. Baking soda is a powerful natural deodorizer, and it’s great at absorbing lingering food smells. Simply mix 1 tbsp (17 g) of baking soda with 1 cup (236 mL) of water to create a paste, rub the paste onto the interior of the Tupperware, then let it sit overnight. Wash out the container the next day with water and dish soap, and that’s it! It should now be odor-free."

      "title": "Fill the container with a solution of vinegar and water and let it soak.",
      "content": "Fill the container with a solution of vinegar and water and let it soak. Pour 1 tbsp (15 mL) of white vinegar and 1 cup (236 g) of hot water into the container, and mix it up thoroughly. Let the vinegar solution sit in the Tupperware for at least an hour, or several hours for a deeper clean. Next, wash out the container with some dish soap and running water. The vinegar should neutralize the odors, and it will also break up any lingering stains or grease. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub the inside of the container with lemon juice or a cut lemon slice.",
      "content": "Rub the inside of the container with lemon juice or a cut lemon slice. The citric acid in lemon juice is great at neutralizing odors, and it will leave your Tupperware with a fresh, citrus-y scent. Scrub the Tupperware with lemon juice, or rub a cut lemon slice around the interior of the container for the same effect. The lemon can even help lighten any lingering food stains, too!

      "title": "Place coffee grounds in the container and let them sit overnight.",
      "content": "Place coffee grounds in the container and let them sit overnight. Coffee grounds are surprisingly great at absorbing unpleasant odors. You can use fresh coffee grounds or the ones you used to make your morning coffee, just make sure they’re completely dry by the time you put them in the container. Seal the container with the lid, and leave the grounds to sit overnight. In the morning, remove the grounds and rinse out the container, and that's it! [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place a piece of charcoal in the container for a day or two.",
      "content": "Place a piece of charcoal in the container for a day or two. Like coffee grounds, charcoal is great at absorbing odors. Just put one piece of charcoal into the Tupperware, seal the lid, and let it sit for 1-2 days. It should soak up all the bad food smells and leave your container fresher than ever. [4] X Research source If you go with this method, just make sure to use plain charcoal, not mesquite or easy-light variations."

      "title": "Put some crumpled-up newspaper into the container.",
      "content": "Put some crumpled-up newspaper into the container. It may sound strange, but newspaper is actually great at absorbing unpleasant odors that may be lingering in your plastic container. Just grab a few sheets and crumple them up so they fit into the container easily, then put the lid on and let it sit for 24-48 hours. The paper should soak up the bad smells and leave your Tupperware odor-free. [5] X Research source Make sure to give the Tupperware a quick wash with dish soap and water afterward, since the newspaper may have been a bit dirty."

    {
      "title": "Let the container sit in direct sunlight for a few hours.",
      "content": "Let the container sit in direct sunlight for a few hours. Sunlight works surprisingly well to eliminate odors. Just place your Tupperware container (with the lid off) in direct sunlight on a windowsill in your home. You can even leave the window open, so the fresh air can help cast out the bad smells. This method will help lighten any food stains in the container, too! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Put some water and a few drops of vanilla in the container.",
      "content": "Put some water and a few drops of vanilla in the container. Vanilla extract has a powerful, pleasant smell that can mask bad odors. [7] X Research source To make use of this, just pour 2-3 tbsp (15-30 mL) of water and a few drops of vanilla extract into your container and seal it with the lid. Let the mixture soak for a few hours, then rinse the container out thoroughly with water. You can also pour the vanilla extract on a clean dishcloth, put it in the container, and leave it to soak for several hours with the lid closed."

      "title": "Store your Tupperware containers with a pinch of salt in them.",
      "content": "Store your Tupperware containers with a pinch of salt in them. If a plastic container has a bit of a lingering odor after your regular washing process, try placing a large pinch of salt in it. The salt should absorb the odor overnight, but if you’re not planning on using the Tupperware for a while, you can simply store it with the salt inside until you're ready to use it again. [8] X Research source Just don’t forget to pour the salt out the next time you use it!"
