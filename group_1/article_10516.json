      "content": "Choose a simple design if you are new to embroidery. It is best to start with basic designs while you get the hang of hand embroidery. Draw your own simple design, or find a design online to use. Go with art you can complete with 3 or fewer colors of embroidery thread. [1] X Research source Find a design like a smiley face, yin yang sign, or cherries. Or, use a short word or phrase like “peace” or “love.” While previous sewing experience is helpful, you can embroider your own patch even if you’ve never sewn before. If you already have embroidery experience, choose any design you like!"

      "title": "Transfer your design onto a piece of fabric.",
      "content": "Transfer your design onto a piece of fabric. Once you pick out your design, draw it onto your fabric with a pencil. If the design is drawn on a piece of paper, place the paper behind your fabric and trace over the lines. [2] X Research source If you still can’t see the design through the fabric, hold both layers up to a nearby window so you can see the lines clearly. While any type of fabric will work, canvas material in a neutral color often works best to create durable, attractive patches."

      "content": "Place the fabric inside an embroidery hoop and tighten the screw. Embroidery hoops come with 2 wooden circles. Place the circle with the metal screws on the outside of your design and put the other circle underneath your fabric. Then, secure the hoop in place by screwing the fastener at the bottom. [3] X Research source Keep your fabric tight when you secure your hoop. It will be more difficult to complete your designs if the fabric is loose in your hoop."

      "content": "Make basic embroidery stitches to fill in your design. Pick a starting point and poke your needle through the fabric. Stick the needle back through the front of the fabric to make a basic embroidery stitch. Continue stitching until you fill up your artwork. [5] X Research source When you run out of string, simply cut another and thread it through your needle. Do the same when you want to use a different color of thread. If you prefer, you can also make patches using an embroidery machine . After digitizing your design, adjusting your settings, and inserting your thread, the machine will do the embroidering for you. Embroidery machines are expensive, however, and might be a bit complicated for beginners."

      "content": "Remove the embroidery hoop and cut out your patch. When you finish hand-embroidering your design, loosen the screw on the embroidery hoop and pull the hoops apart to remove your fabric. Then, use fabric scissors to cut around the edges of your design to create your preferred size and shape for the patch. [6] X Research source For example, cut your patch into a square, rectangle, circle, or triangle. Remember to reassemble your hoop once you take the fabric out so it’s ready to go for next time!"

      "title": "Apply a Peel ‘n Stick Fabric Fuse sheet to the back of the patch.",
      "content": "Apply a Peel ‘n Stick Fabric Fuse sheet to the back of the patch. Peel ‘n Stick Fabric Fuse is a double-sided fabric adhesive used to attach patches to other fabrics. Remove the backing from the Peel ‘n Stick sheet and place the back of your patch onto the sticky side. Smooth your fingers over the sides of the patch, using firm pressure to secure it. Use a pair of scissors to trim around the shape of your patch and remove the extra Peel ‘n Stick sections. Your patch is now ready to be ironed on! [7] X Research source Another option is to use Heat Bond . Heat Bond works the same way, though you have to iron it to get it to stick to the patch. Typically, one sheet of Peel ‘n Stick makes 1 patch. If you have multiple small patches, they might be able to fit on the same sheet. Purchase Fabric Fuse sheets at most craft stores or online. Iron your completed patch onto your jacket, backpack, baseball hat, or whatever you like! Craft expert Joy Cho says it’s important to consider the fabric of the item you’re ironing the patch onto: “There are certain materials that absorb and stick to iron-ons better than others,” like cotton rather than polyester."

Cut a piece of fabric, like canvas, to about 4 by 4 inches (10 cm × 10 cm), or use a scrap piece. If you want, draw your design directly onto the fabric or print it out and trace it on. [8] X Research source Any design can be made into a patch, though it’s best to start with a simple design if you haven’t made a patch before. Avoid designs with complicated linework or intricate details until you master this method."

      "title": "Adjust your stitch length to 0 and your stitch width to 2.",
      "content": "Adjust your stitch length to 0 and your stitch width to 2. Adjusting the stitch length and width creates very different stitches. These specific settings create thick, bold lines, perfect for patches, as they’ll allow you to fill in your design quickly and easily. Use a higher numbered stitch length if you want a longer, flatter stitch. Use small numbers if you want your stitches to be close together. Change the width to a higher number if you want bigger zigzags, and try smaller sizes to create tighter ones."

      "title": "Start sewing at a corner of one of your lines.",
      "content": "Start sewing at a corner of one of your lines. Thread the needle of your sewing machine, following the machine’s instructions. Choose a starting point and lower the presser foot to your fabric using the adjustment lever. Gently press down on your foot pedal and hold the fabric with your hands to guide your stitches. Lift up on the foot control when you reach the end of your line, and continue sewing until you complete your design. Working from your longest edge is a good place to start, but choose anywhere you’d like! Guide your stitches along the lines of your design to create the zigzag stitches. Sew your line until you reach about 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) from the edge of your fabric."

      "content": "Pivot the needle as you reach a corner. When you sew your line and reach an intersection with another line, lift your foot off the pedal to stop stitching. Raise the lever of your presser foot and leave the needle in your fabric. With the needle inside the machine, rotate the fabric in the direction of your next line. Then, lower the presser foot back onto your fabric and continue your stitches. Make sure your needle remains in the sewing machines as you change the direction of your stitches."

      "title": "Trim the patch and apply Peel ‘n Stick Fabric Fuse.",
      "content": "Trim the patch and apply Peel ‘n Stick Fabric Fuse. When you’re done sewing, cut off extra fabric around the edges of your design with fabric scissors. [10] X Research source Peel the back covering off of a Peel ‘n Stick sheet , and place the back of your patch on the sticky side. Use your fingers to smooth over the patch so all the edges are adhered. Then, trim away the extra Peel ‘n Stick from your patch and it’s ready to be ironed. Cut your design into any shape you want, like a triangle, oval, or square. If you’re making multiple small patches, stick a few to a single sheet of Peel ‘n Stick. Heat Bond is another adhesive option; it works the same way as Peel ‘n Stick, but it needs to be ironed to stick to the patch. Cho says it’s important to follow the iron-on instructions carefully so the patch doesn’t come off the fabric: “If you don’t do it right, it could come off. Make sure that your fabric is pre-washed and that there’s no residual anything on there. Make sure that it’s flat, and that it’s ironed in advance.” Cho also recommends holding your iron relatively still when applying the patch: “Sometimes people tend to move the iron around while they’re doing it, as if they’re ironing a shirt. You do want to keep moving, but for this, hold it and press it. Make sure there’s constant heat, as that’s really what’s binding the iron-on to the shirt.”"

      "content": "Select an image to use for your patch and resize it if needed. Take a picture of a hand-drawn design or select an image from the internet. To change the size, use a photo editor program (or a program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs) and go to the “Resize” settings. Change the size in inches or centimeters to find the best dimensions. [11] X Research source The patch can be any size you like. For a small patch, go with a design that’s about 2 by 2 inches (5.1 cm × 5.1 cm). For bigger patches, use designs 4 by 4 inches (10 cm × 10 cm) or larger."

      "content": "Place the sheet face down on your fabric and iron it on. For best results, use a thick piece of fabric, like canvas or muslin, about 4 by 4 inches (10 cm × 10 cm). Place the Inkjet sheet so the artwork faces the fabric, and let your iron warm up for about 2 minutes to reach maximum temperature. Then, place it on top of the Inkjet sheet and move it in small, circular motions all over the image. Iron for about 1–1.5 minutes, then remove the heat from your patch. [13] X Research source Make sure to cover every edge so the entire image transfers properly."

Place your patch onto the adhesive side of the Fabric Fuse sheet so that the back of the patch meets the sticky side. Then, simply trim away the extra parts of the Fabric Fuse, and your patch is ready to be ironed onto clothing or whatever fabric you prefer. [15] X Research source Another adhesive option is Heat Bond. It works the same way as Peel ‘n Stick, but the only difference is it must be ironed to stick to your patch."
