      "content": "Grading on a curve is a relative grading method. Instructors use a flat or bell curve to adjust individual grades relative to the class’s overall performance. Teachers typically do curved grading when they feel that too many students scored poorly, either because of inadequate instruction or a poorly designed test or assignment. [1] X Research source In most cases, a curve will benefit every student by raising their grade somewhat, but in systems like bell curve grading, some student’s curved grade may be lower than their standard letter grade would be. Not every way to curve grades is relative. Curves that involve a minimum F policy only adjust the grades of failing students. Curving using a square-root method means each student’s grade is adjusted differently, and some students benefit more than others. A standard curve (where every student’s grade is curved by the same amount of points) is seen as the most fair because everyone benefits the same amount."

      "title": "Standard Curve",
      "content": "Standard Curve A standard curve sets the highest score achieved as a “100%” and raises all other grades accordingly. To use this method, educators subtract the highest score in the class from the hypothetical \"perfect\" score. They add the difference to every student’s score, including the highest-scoring one. Using this method, every student gets a better grade after the curve. [2] X Research source For example, say the highest grade on a test was 95%. In this case, because 100-95 = 5, a teacher would add 5 percentage points to everyone’s grade. This makes the 95% score an adjusted 100%, and every other score 5 percentage points higher than it was. This method also works using absolute scores, rather than percentages. If the highest grade was a 28/30, for instance, a teacher would add 2 points to the score of every student."

      "title": "Flat-Scale Curve",
      "content": "Flat-Scale Curve A flat-scale curve boosts every student’s score on an assignment or test by the same number of points. This can be the number of points that an item most of the class missed was worth, or it can be some other (arbitrary) number of points that the teacher thinks is fair. [3] X Research source For instance, let's say that the entire class missed one problem which was worth 10 points. In this case, a teacher might choose to add 10 points to every student's score. Because this method doesn't specifically set the highest score in the class as a 100% maximum score, it allows for the possibility that none of the assignments receive a perfect score. It even allows for scores over 100%. An educator can put a cap on the highest possible score to avoid going over 100%, but high-performing students may find this unfair since they are then receiving fewer bonus points than low-performing classmates. [4] X Research source To do a flat curve targeting a mean, an educator would add the number of points that’s equal to the difference between the target score and the class average.

      "title": "Minimum F Curve",
      "content": "Minimum F Curve A minimum F curve, also known as a minimum F policy, curves low grades by raising them to an arbitrary minimum score. To do this kind of curve, a teacher defines a lower limit for failing grades—a minimum score that is higher than zero, such as 50 (out of 100). Even if students score lower than the minimum on an assignment, it will be the lowest score they can receive, effectively curving their grade. [6] X Research source This policy makes it so that very low-scoring assignments have a less drastic effect when averaged with a student's good scores. For example, let's say that a student bombs his first test, scoring a 0. However, since then, he's studied hard, receiving 70% and 80% on his next two tests. Un-curved, he has a 50% grade right now—a failing score. If his teacher sets a lower limit on failing scores of 40%, his new average is 63.3%—a D. It's not a great score, but it's probably fairer than failing a student who's shown real promise. Educators may choose to set separate lower limits for assignments that are turned in vs. assignments that are not. For example, they may decide that for failing assignments, the lowest possible grade is 40%—unless it's not turned in at all, in which case 30% is the lowest possible score."

      "title": "Bell Curve",
      "content": "Bell Curve On a difficult assignment, a class’s average could be surprisingly low. A bell curve grading method shifts grades closer to the teacher’s desired average by fitting grades to a normal distribution. They set the class's mean grade as a C—even if the actual average score was lower than a C. Scores to the left and right sides of the distribution will earn other letter grades, depending on how many points the teacher uses to separate letter grades. [7] X Research source To grade on a bell curve, educators determine the class's mean (average) score by adding up all the scores in the class, then dividing by the number of students to find the mean. For example, say they find an average score of 66%. They set this as a mid-range grade. The precise grade is at their discretion—it could be a C, C+, or even B-. Say they set 66% as a C. Next, they decide how many points separate the letter grades in the new bell curve. Generally, bigger point intervals mean that the bell curve is more forgiving to low-scoring students. Let's say they separate grades by 12 points. This means that 66 + 12 = 78 becomes the new B, while 66 - 12 = 54 becomes the new D, etc. They can also calculate the standard deviation and add it to or subtract it from the mean test score to decide where letter grades fall. The mean test score is the lower cutoff for a C grade. One standard deviation above the mean test score is the cutoff for a B. One standard deviation below the mean test score is the cutoff for a D, and so on. [8] X Research source Finally, they assign curved grades according to the bell curve system."

      "title": "Square-Root Curve",
      "content": "Square-Root Curve A square-root curve method raises low scores significantly without increasing the highest scores by much. This method is time-consuming, as educators have to manually curve each individual’s score. Students may perceive it as unfair because poor performers receive a greater boost on the curve than high-scoring students. However, every score below a 100 will improve. [9] X Research source To use a square-root grading curve, a teacher takes the square root of each individual score. They multiply the square root by 10 to get the curved score. For example, say a student’s score is 65. They take the square root of 65 to get 8.06. Next, the teacher multiplies 8.06 by 10 to get 80.6. This is the student’s new score after curving, bringing them from a D to a B-. If a student’s score is 99, a square-root grading curve would shift their score up to a 99.4."

Without a curve, a difficult test could tank many students’ grades without accurately reflecting their overall performance in the course. With a curve, educators feel empowered to include more difficult questions knowing not everyone will get a D or an F. It may also be easier to tell who high and low performers are based on the outliers in the curve’s distribution. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Bell curve grading puts students in competition with one another. Bell curve grading forces students to compete for the highest grades on assignments (or in a class, if final course grades are curved). On a bell curve distribution, even if you get a high score, only the highest scores will earn As and Bs. Your individual performance isn’t enough to earn a certain grade, since the curve makes everyone’s grade relative to the class’s performance as a whole. [12] X Research source This competition may cause students to focus on beating each other in the final distribution rather than learning the material. [13] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source In assignments or courses where most students would not perform well regardless of the curve, the perceived unfairness of the limited amount of high grades is not as much of an issue. The best students should earn As on the curve. Class size is another factor to take into account. A bell curve grading system will likely be more fair when applied to a larger class than a smaller one. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Grading on a curve can cause grade inflation.",
      "content": "Grading on a curve can cause grade inflation. Obviously, when an instructor uses a curve, they’re artificially inflating grades. However, when used sparingly, students’ final grades should still reflect their performance and mastery of the material. Extreme or systematic grade inflation occurs when curving is very frequent and generous, such that low scores earn average grades and average scores earn high grades. [15] X Research source Grading on a curve can devalue letter grades as a tool for judging understanding and mastery. Students may have done very well, but not earned an A because other students scored slightly higher than them. Other students may have done very poorly, but earned a passing grade anyway because others did worse than them. For example, if every exam is curved so a D score earns a B, grades for that course may be inflated compared to the same courses run on the standard grading system."

      "content": "Students may feel that curving grades is unfair. When teachers use a bell curve or other method to adjust students’ grades, everyone may not benefit equally. In some cases, students with high scores will get a lower grade on the curve than they would have on a standard grading system—mostly with bell curve grading, where there are limited numbers of each letter grade to distribute. When this happens, they could feel the grading system is unfair and lose motivation. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Re-do Assignments",
      "content": "Re-do Assignments Instead of curving, teachers can offer students an opportunity to re-do sections of an assignment they did poorly on. Then, the teacher grades the problems they re-did and offers the students some percentage of the total points they earned on their re-do attempt. They add these points to their first score to get their final grade. Let's say that a student scored 60 points out of 100 on a test. The teacher gives the test back to the student, offering half-credit for any problems she re-does. She re-works the problems she missed, scoring 30 more points. The teacher then gives her 30/2 = 15 more points, making her final score 60 + 15 = 75 points."

If, after grading, they find that there are one or two particular items that most of the students seemed to struggle on, they may want to disregard these questions and grade the assignment as if they weren't included. Note that this method gives extra weight to the questions they choose to include. It may also anger students who did well on the questions you chose to eliminate. Teachers can off-set this by turning the tough question into an extra-credit question."
