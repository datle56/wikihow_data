      "content": "Remove the back. You may need to pry open the controller with a flat head screwdriver. Open it from the bottom and carefully tilt it towards the top shoulder buttons. Be very careful that you don't accidentally dislodge the R2 or L2 trigger buttons while removing the back. They can be pain to put back on."

      "content": "Remove the battery. The battery is the grey square piece on the back of the motherboard. You don't need to disconnect the battery. You can just pull it up out of it's holder and move it to the side. If you do decide to disconnect the battery, pull on the white plastic part that the wires are connected to. Do not pull on the wires."

      "content": "Lift the green ribbon and pull it back. The green ribbon is located at the top of the controller front. It's above the hole where the left analogue stick goes. Place a flat head screwdriver under the ribbon and carefully lift it up over the two plastic pins that are sticking up out of the controller. Be careful not to tear or damage the ribbon. You will see a strip of black foam underneath the ribbon."

      "title": "Remove the black foam strip.",
      "content": "Remove the black foam strip. Over time, the foam strip gets compressed and the connectors on the ribbon aren't able to make contact with the motherboard. This is why the controller is not working properly."

      "content": "Place tape on the bottom of the black foam strip. For the best results, cut a strip of thick double-sided tape the same length and width as the black foam strip. Place it under the foam strip. Use scissors to cut off any excess tape from the sides. If you don't have thick double-sided tape, you can cut about an inch-and-a-half of black electrical tape and roll it up into a tube. [1] X Research source"
