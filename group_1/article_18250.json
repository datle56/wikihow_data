Peel off the papery skin, and then chop the onion to the size you prefer. [1] X Research source . It’s not a good idea to chop the onions any smaller than into ½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces because they may wind up becoming encased in ice when you freeze them if they’re too small. You can slice the onions instead of chopping them if you’re freezing them for use in dishes such as fajitas."

      "title": "Place the onions in a freezer bag.",
      "content": "Place the onions in a freezer bag. When you’ve chopped the onions to your desired size, transfer them to a plastic freezer bag. Make sure to place them in the bag in a single, flat layer to prevent them from clumping together when they freeze. Squeeze all the air out of the bag, and seal it. If you’re freezing a large number of onions, prevent them from sticking together when frozen by placing them in a single layer on a shallow baking dish. Freeze them like that for two to three hours, and when they’re partially frozen, you can place them in the freezer bag without worrying about them clumping together. Be sure to use plastic bags that are thick enough to protect the onions from freezer burn and keep the onion scent contained in the bag. If your bags seem too thin, double them up."

      "content": "Label the bag and freeze. Before throwing the onions in your freezer, use a pen or marker to label the bag with the date, type of onion, and when you should use them by. Place the bag flat in the freezer, making sure that the onions are still in a single layer as you position them. You can keep onions in your freezer for up to 6 months. If you have multiple bags of onions that you’re freezing, you can stack them on top of one another to save space in the freezer. Just make sure that the onions in each bag are in a flat, single layer."

      "content": "Bring a pot of water to a boil. Fill a large stockpot with water, and place it on the stove. Set the burner to high, and allow the water to come to a full boil, which should take approximately 10 to 20 minutes depending on how much water you’re using. [3] X Research source The amount of water that you should boil depends on how many onions you’re blanching. For every pound (373 g), use 1 (3.8 l) gallon of water."

Cover the pot, and allow the onions to cook for 3 to 7 minutes, depending on how many you’re blanching. [4] X Research source The more onions that you’re blanching, the longer you should leave them in the boiling water. With chopped onions, it’s easier to place them in a wire basket or perforated metal strainer and then set them in the boiling water. That way, you can quickly and easily remove them when they’re done. If you don’t have a basket or strainer, remove them from the boiling water with a slotted spoon."

Let the onions sit in the cold water for the same amount of time that you boiled them to stop the cooking process. [5] X Research source The ice or cold water that you place the onions in after boiling shouldn’t be more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius). While the onions are in the cold water, stir them several times to ensure that they’re cooling evenly."

      "content": "Peel and cut the onions into pieces. Use a knife to trim off the top and bottom of the onions so you can easily peel off the papery skin. Next, cut the onions into pieces to prepare them for pureeing. You don’t need to chop or dice the onion, but cut it into chunks that are small enough to fit in the blender. [7] X Research source Use the pitcher from your blender as a guide for how small you should cut your onion. If it’s not very large, you should cut the onion into small pieces. In a large pitcher, cutting it into eighths may be sufficient."

Use the puree setting, and hold down on the button until the onions are ground into a thick but smooth puree. [8] X Research source If you’re freezing a large number of onions, you’ll probably need to puree them in batches. Overfilling the blender’s pitcher makes it more difficult for the appliance to puree effectively. If your blender’s motor isn’t very strong, you may need to push down on the onions as you’re pureeing to bring them into contact with the blades. To do so, set the handle of a metal ladle through the opening in the blender’s lid before placing it on the pitcher. The rounded end of the ladle should be inside the pitcher, so when you start pureeing, you can press down on the onions with the ladle. Because the bottom is rounded it won’t get caught in the blades. [9] X Research source"

These pureed onion cubes are ideal for adding to sauces, gravies, and soups."
