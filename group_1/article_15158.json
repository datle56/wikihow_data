      "title": "Purchase brown hair dye that is designed for dark hair.",
      "content": "Purchase brown hair dye that is designed for dark hair. Most hair dyes are designed to darken your hair, however, a few types are specifically made to lighten dark hair. Check the package for words like \"lightening dye,\" \"fade-out\" or \"lightens dark hair\" when you pick out your dye. Take a look at the before and after pictures to double check that you've chosen the right type of dye. [1] X Research source If you have warm-toned skin, use an ash brown or a cool dark brown. If you have a cooler skin colour, try a lighter brown or a redder brown. This will help to compliment your skin. For a more natural option, try using a henna dye on your hair instead. Most henna dyes will give your hair a red-brown hue, but won't turn your hair light brown. If you're going for a specific look, or if you have particularly dry hair, it might be worth visiting a hairdresser to get your hair dyed. Similarly, if you've dyed your hair black, it's best to visit a salon because putting dye on top of dye may not produce the light brown color you want."

      "title": "Wash your hair with shampoo 24 hours before you dye it.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with shampoo 24 hours before you dye it. This allows the natural oils in your hair to build up which makes it easier for the dye to attach to your hair. The colour will look more even and last longer if it binds well to your hair. If you have dry or frizzy hair, wash your hair 48 hours before you dye it instead. Avoid using conditioner before you dye your hair as it closes your cuticle, making it harder for the dye to penetrate your hair."

    {
      "title": "Protect your skin and clothing from the dye.",
      "content": "Protect your skin and clothing from the dye. Wear an old shirt that you don’t mind getting dye on. The dyeing process is fairly messy so your shirt is likely to get stained. Place an old towel or scarf around your neck to protect it from the dye and wear disposable gloves to stop the dye from staining your fingers. Rub a thin layer of petroleum jelly around your ears and hairline to stop them going brown from the dye. [2] X Research source If you don’t have an old shirt, wrap an old towel around your shoulders instead. If you dye your hair often, it's helpful to get a hairdressers cape, which will protect your skin and clothes from the dye. Dye is almost impossible to remove from fabric, so choose your clothing wisely! Dye will eventually fade off skin and nails after a couple of washes, so don't worry too much if it does get on you."

      "title": "Brush your hair.",
      "content": "Brush your hair. Use a comb or a hairbrush to remove any knots from your hair. This will make it easier to apply the hair dye and will help the colour to spread evenly across the strands. [3] X Research source If necessary, use a detangling spray to help remove the knots. You can usually find a detangling spray or cream at a local pharmacy or hairdresser."

      "title": "Mix the dye with the developer in the supplied container.",
      "content": "Mix the dye with the developer in the supplied container. In the dye box, there will be sachets or bottles containing hair dye and developer. Follow the directions in the box to combine the packets into the mixing bottle. Combine the packets over a sink so that any spills can easily be cleaned up. Check that the lid is firmly on the mixing bottle and then shake the bottle for 5 seconds. [4] X Research source If no mixing bottle is provided, combine the dye ingredients in a disposable plastic bowl instead."

      "title": "Separate your hair into 2 sections.",
      "content": "Separate your hair into 2 sections. Run your hand down the middle of the back of your scalp and secure each section of hair with a hair tie or clip. You should find it much easier to achieve a quality finish if you are only concentrating on one half of your hair at a time. [5] X Research source If you have very thick hair, divide each section of hair in half again so that you have 4 sections in total. It can be helpful to use a comb to separate your hair if it's especially thick or tangled."

      "title": "Unclip one section of hair and grab a .5 in (1.3 cm) strand.",
      "content": "Unclip one section of hair and grab a .5 in (1.3 cm) strand. Dying small sections of hair will make it easier to ensure that the hair is thoroughly saturated with dye, which will help your dyed hair to look even and natural. Work in these small .5 in (1.3 cm) sections to ensure you get dye on every part of your hair. [6] X Research source After you've applied the dye to your hair, it can help to push your hair into a tight bun and move it around a little to make sure the dye gets on every strand."

    {
      "title": "Paint the dye onto your hair until all the strands are completely saturated.",
      "content": "Paint the dye onto your hair until all the strands are completely saturated. Dip the brush into the dye and use it to paint the strands of hair. Start at the top of each strand and work your way to the bottom. Try to evenly saturate each strand of hair with dye as this will help the colour to look even. [7] X Research source If your hair is thick, you will need to lift up the top strands of hair in order to reach the hair at the nape of your neck. Use a hair clip to attach these to the top of your head. Ask a friend to help you or use a mirror. Most dye boxes will come with a brush. If your box of dye didn’t come with a brush, purchase one from a beauty store or pharmacy. Alternatively, use an applicator bottle and your gloved hand to apply the dye directly to your hair. It generally takes about 1 hour to cover all of your hair with dye. If you have very thick or long hair, it might take even longer, so plan accordingly!"

      "title": "Set an alarm to remind yourself when to wash out the dye.",
      "content": "Set an alarm to remind yourself when to wash out the dye. Follow the time instructions on the back of the box as each dye will have a different soaking time. Don’t leave the dye in for longer than the directed time as this can damage your hair. Similarly, don’t rinse the dye out early as this can leave the colour in your hair looking patchy. [8] X Research source Place a shower cap over your head to stop the dye dripping onto your clothes or carpet. You should keep most standard, store-bought dyes in for about 45 minutes. Some dyes will require more or less time, though, so double check before you set your timer."

      "title": "Rinse the excess dye out of your hair in the shower.",
      "content": "Rinse the excess dye out of your hair in the shower. Take off your shower cap and hop into the shower. Allow the pressure of the water to rinse any excess dye from your hair. Don’t be alarmed if you see colour going down the drain, that's just the excess dye coming off of your hair! Keep rinsing your hair until the water runs clear. [9] X Research source Rinse your hair with warm or room temperature water to preserve the color."

      "title": "Condition your hair with the conditioner provided in the dye box.",
      "content": "Condition your hair with the conditioner provided in the dye box. Open the packet of conditioner and apply it to the ends of your hair. This will help to soften your hair and clarify the colour of the dye. Leave the conditioner in for 2 minutes before rinsing it out. [10] X Research source If your box of dye doesn’t come with a conditioner, use a sulphate-free conditioner instead. Wait 24 hours before shampooing your hair. This will help to stop the colour from fading."

      "content": "Remove any dye from your skin using makeup remover. Dip a cotton pad into makeup remover and rub it over the areas that have been stained by the dye. Rub the area vigorously until the dye is gone. [11] X Research source If the dye doesn’t come off with makeup remover, don’t worry too much as it will fade over the next few days."

      "content": "Use a “coloured hair” shampoo and conditioner to keep your dyed hair looking bright. Look for words like “dye-friendly”, “colour-safe” and “coloured hair” on the bottles. These products will help to stop the dye from fading when you wash your hair. [12] X Research source Rinse your hair in cold water after you have shampooed and conditioned it. This will help to keep the moisture in your hair and keep the colour looking bright."
