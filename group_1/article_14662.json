      "content": "Check out fan sites for Jade West and research her style. Look on blogs, social media sites or even simple search engine queries for images of Jade West’s outfits on the show. Her character dresses simply but with a distinct sense of style favoring dark colors over pastels or light colors, balancing a feminine yet gothic sensibility [1] X Research source Notice how Jade combines a solid yet detailed bottom -- like blue jeans -- with a patterned top. She keeps the focus on the details by pairing the distressed denim with solid colored checkers. The large squares prevent the outfit from looking too busy while providing a fun and edgy look. By keeping the shirt unbuttoned, the look remains casual and young. Using the solid black tank top underneath plays up the black in the buttoned shirt without being too dressy. Examine how she accessorizes using variety. Jade will choose a basic accessory color and run with it by applying the color and it's neighbouring shades to her belt, shoes, and jewelry. In order to keep her look polished, she maintains the desired shades into her nail polish. Her accessories have clearly been thought of as a finishing piece to her outfit, and are put together carefully. Note that less can be more when pairing accessories, such as wearing a chunky ring with a minimal necklace. Brainstorm where the inspiration for Jade West's style comes from. Often wearing hair extensions, studs and thick-soled boots harken to punk and motorcycle fashion inspirations."

      "content": "Stick to dark colors and cool tones in versatile pieces. When choosing key pieces for your Jade West wardrobe, look for items that are fashionable yet adaptable. Especially while working within a budget, choose items for their versatility so that you can style them in many different ways. A pair of dark denim skinnies with distressed details can be used as a focal point to several outfits. Choosing a well-fitted black pair will allow you to get many different styles from a single pair of jeans. Jade is often seen wearing leggings. A soft, comfortable legging can be dressed up or down, while being worn with conventional tops, skirts or tunics. [2] X Research source A tutu style skirt layered with tulle can be a welcomed change from West's more body-hugging styles. [3] X Research source Cotton t-shirts are an inexpensive way to keep variety in your outfits while being cost effective. Aim to fill your drawers with solid dark colors such as forest green, navy blue and grey. These fairly neutral colors can be interchanged with many different overlays."

      "content": "Pick out comfortable and flat military-style boots. Jade West doesn't shy away from combat looks and stays away from frills and ribbons. Instead, she often favours more sturdy footwear like laced combat boots or black riding boots. Check military consignment shops because they often have a variety of military style boots. Look for a rounded toe with grommets up the entire boot as well as long laces. Go simple with tall black boots. Watch for small details such as buckles, to give a motorcycle-like feel. Buckles and studs will add dimension to an outfit and give a more personalized look. Be careful not to choose an overly-studded style so as to prevent an outfit from looking overwhelming."

      "title": "Choose accessories that are simple and bold.",
      "content": "Choose accessories that are simple and bold. Jade always wears plenty of accessories and it's important to have accessories that can be matched together with ease. Choose accessories within a color range that work for you, such as mostly silver or gold. Jade often layers her necklaces. By choosing several necklaces in solid metallic hues, they can be mixed and matched together. A bellybutton-length necklace can be easily paired with several shorter necklaces. Don't be afraid to look for geometric pendants, stones and feathers. Watch out for bangles and bracelets composed of leather. Jade often wears her bracelets similar to her necklaces: layered. Pick up a twenty pack of solid colored, skinny bangles for an easy accompaniment to a single focal bracelet. Use simple earrings. Jade mostly wears studs in black and grey. Encourage yourself to expand your horizons from studs by checking out faux pearls and glass studs. [4] X Research source Dangly earrings may look beautiful however they can be heavy. Starting with a simple stud is a sure way to let your earlobes adjust to the weight. If you don't have your ears pierced, opt for stick-on or clamp earrings. Small stickers make an easy earring substitute and clamp earrings are a gentle alternative to having your lobes pierced. Wear statement rings. Go for large dark stones on a simple band, or several thin silver bands that you can stack on top of each other on one finger. Explore all your fingers and watch for smaller bands to fit before your second knuckle, higher up on the fingers, to create a unique look."

      "content": "Stay casual with jeans and t-shirts. For simple day to day looks at school or work, go Jade-simple. Pair your skinny jeans with a loose tank top and a leather jacket or a simple sweater with a plain skirt. To get more out of your outfit, try layering a patterned, button-up shirt over top your tee. Tuck your jeans into your boots for a final finish on your Jade look. If you don't have a patterned button-up, try a graphic t-shirt in dark colors. Another variation is a dark legging with a tunic-style top or long sweater. If it feels too boxy, try adding a skinny belt around your waist. Pump up your accessories. When going with a casual outfit, explore your accessory collection. Try pairing layered necklaces with a chunky ring, or stud earrings with an armful of bangles. In the colder seasons, try adding a dark-colored scarf. The scarf will add a new dimension of texture to your casual outfit."

      "content": "Go for a full goth look with tights and a skirt. Jade isn't afraid to wear a skirt and she often pairs it with leggings. Try wearing a solid black skirt with mesh leggings. Finish the outfit off with a burgundy or any dull-colored top. When pairing tights with a skirt, try to stick to a neutral top to prevent the outfit from looking too busy. It can be easy to get carried away with color. Skirts and boots aren't a faux pas! If it feels comfortable, wear it. Remember to stay classy. Jade doesn't show large amounts of midriff or cleavage. Keep yourself covered and classy like she does. For a different look, try tucking your shirt into your skirt. This can look especially cute with a skirt that sits at the waist."

      "title": "Wear a dress layered with a button up.",
      "content": "Wear a dress layered with a button up. Jade tends to keep her shoulders covered in a strappy dress. If you have a simple black dress at home, you can do the same by simply picking your favorite West-style button up and wearing it under or over the dress. Experiment with what feels comfortable to you. If the button up doesn't feel right, try a pull-over sweater. This can also add warmth to an outfit in Winter. Another option to add to a dress is a black jacket. Military boots with a zippered and studded jacket can make even the frilliest girl dresses look punk rock. Wear a dress that suits your body shape. You can create the illusion of shape with a cut that adds volume to the bust and hips for a rectangle body shape. A dress with a full skirt in an A-line cut is suitable for an apple shape or inverted triangle body shape. A form-fitting option that hugs the curves is suitable for an hourglass body shape."

      "title": "Add temporary color to your hair.",
      "content": "Add temporary color to your hair. Avoid your parent's punishment by investing in inexpensive, clip-in hair extensions. Clip-in extensions are available in many colors and are an easy way to change up your look. The extensions are an easy way to prevent your hair from being damaged and dry from coloring. If you can't find the length you like, don't be afraid to clip them into your own hair and carefully cut to your desired length. Focus on adding color to the back and ends of your hair. Jade's extensions lie between and behind her curls, so make sure to not show too much. If that feels too brave, try starting in the back of your hair. Be cautious when styling extensions. When inexpensive, they are often synthetic and can melt when heat is applied."

      "content": "Keep your eye makeup classic and simple. Regardless of your eye color, Jade's neutral yet bold eye makeup will look stunning. Don't be discouraged if it takes many attempts; makeup is about experimentation. Apply a small amount of neutral shadow all over your lid. Keep in mind Jade's lids often look skin-toned and you want to keep a natural look. Try using a thick eyeliner pencil to get Jade's eyes. While maintaining a dull end, use the pencil to softly line your entire eye. When first learning, you might find it easiest to apply to eyes and tidy with a cotton swab. Use the swab to remove excess makeup and prevent a black-eye look. When detailing the lower portion of the eye, only apply a small amount of liner and gently smudge using the cotton swab. When applying mascara, rotate the brush outwards from the roots of your lashes. Gently wiggle the brush back and forth horizontally to get a thorough coverage. This keeps your lashes looking thick and natural. If your lashes end up stuck together, gently and carefully separate them with a cotton swab or toothpick."

      "title": "Apply a soft lip color.",
      "content": "Apply a soft lip color. Jade's makeup favours neutral and pink lips. Traditional lipstick can be hard to maintain and manage, therefore try using a colored gloss or balm. Lip balm will keep your lips looking fairly matte and only add a tint of color to your natural tone, while keeping you moisturized. Gloss will add plenty of shine and pucker to your pout. If you'd like to attempt Jade's red lip look, you may need to experiment depending on your skin tone. Red tones can be finicky and it may take experimentation to find what works for you. Try cherry, fire-engine or coral colored glosses. To prevent color from appearing on your teeth after applying, make a sucking “O” shape with your lips around your finger. Quickly pull your finger from your mouth while maintaining the shape. Next kiss your lips onto a flat piece of paper towel. The “O” shape will allow your finger to remove any lip color on the inside of your lips, and the paper towel removes excess lip color to prevent it from moving back into your mouth."
