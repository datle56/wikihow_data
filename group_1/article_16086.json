      "title": "Resist short-term temptations.",
      "content": "Resist short-term temptations. Willpower must be exercised in order to not give in to all sorts of small temptations that face us everyday. If you practice resisting these small temptations, you will lay the foundations for greater willpower in other areas of your life. For instance: Replace sweets and salty nibbles with healthy, regular snacks. Do not buy snacks or processed food. Instead take time preparing your fresh, organic fruits, or nuts or seeds. Become a conscious eater, a healthy eater or a vegetarian, or a vegan. Taking care of your diet, daily, not only makes you healthier but improves the willpower. Go for a regular walk every morning instead of checking your email or social media accounts first.' Switch off your mobile, TV or Radio at home. Give your-self a mental space from all that noise. Don't buy an item that you want on impulse yet don't really need, such as a coffee, CD, or new shirt. Instead, save your money. Commit to health and natural healing. Remove any stimuli, such as: alcohol, cigarettes, medication. They are damaging to long-term health and very expensive. Practice sport or play an instrument or learn a new language. Studying strengthens the willpower."

      "title": "Create “if-then” plans.",
      "content": "Create “if-then” plans. Knowing ahead of time what you will do in a situation to avoid temptation or to practice willpower can help you succeed. When faced with such situations, commit to “if-then” statements. For instance: If you are trying to avoid junk food: “If I go to the grocery store and I can't stop looking at unhealthy snacks, then I'll pick up a mix of nuts instead.” Enter only the green grocery store, avoid supermarkets. You will shop locally supporting your local producers. If you are trying to avoid drinking alcohol: “If someone offers me a drink, then I'll just ask for a soda.” If you are trying to control your temper: “If I start to feel mad, then I'll immediately close my eyes, take a deep breath, and count to ten to calm down.” Go for a walk. Do not stay in the same environment. A brief change of scene, will create miracles."

Waiting 5 minutes before you eat, even when you are hungry. Do a short prayer, or create a table ritual where the family or friends share thoughts before the meal.

However, you are more likely to succeed at practicing and improving your willpower if you focus on one goal at a time. Prioritize your goals and determine substeps to decide where to begin. For instance: Suppose you have an overall goal of being more successful in life, and you have decided that being better at your job is the place to start. You have been chronically late to work, and determine that getting to work on time is the first step you should take. Do you sleep well at night? Is the first step, bringing back healthy sleep into your life? Removing an internet addiction, re-introducing healthy habits. Going back to the habit of sleeping in time. Focus on exercising willpower by waking up earlier, introduce an early morning jog, so that you get to work on time. Experiment with your goals, sometimes they are fully interconnected. Re-introducing plenty of water and fresh veggies, with a healthy work-out, buying a dog, or a creative endeavor, falling in love, might boost your energies to such an extend that you will become successful in all other projects too."
