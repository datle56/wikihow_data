      "content": "Train your lower body. Broad shoulders create the appearance of a smaller waist. With this logic, bulk up your lower body and give the illusion of smaller shoulders with strength training. Avoid upper-arm workouts, which will define your shoulders more, and incorporate a lower-body routine at least twice a week. [2] X Research source"

Tighten your core as you push your hips down, keeping your heels and toes on the ground. Look straight ahead to keep your chest up and shoulders back. Sit further back so your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Press into your heels and return to an upright standing position.

      "content": "Draw attention away from your shoulders. The right clothing can make or break your confidence. Instead of trying to hide your broad shoulders, focus on other areas of your body to create an optical illusion that draws the eye elsewhere. “Create width in your bottom half by opting for a wide leg, bootcut, or flare leg pant,” says Image Consultant and Co-Founder of True Image Group, Elle Monus. “If skirts are more your thing, try an A-line cut that skims your curves and provides a bit of outward structure.”"

      "content": "Incorporate v-necks and lower necklines into your wardrobe. When dressing for broad shoulders, go for tops that draw the eye towards the chest. Tops like v-necks, collarless shirts, and lower necklines are your friend in these situations. [10] X Research source Fashion expert Elle Monus also recommends Dolman sleeve tops. “[It’s] a great casual option…the shoulder seam[s] fall further down the shoulder…[giving] you extra room to avoid any pulling in the fabric at your shoulders or bust.”"
