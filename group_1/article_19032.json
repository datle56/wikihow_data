      "title": "Have Mario unlocked.",
      "content": "Have Mario unlocked. To get Luigi, you'll need to have Mario unlocked already. There's no exception to this rule — you simply can't get Luigi as Wario, unless you do a glitch, since he's the last character you can unlock. Don't forget to switch to Mario before starting this process if you haven't already done so. To unlock Mario, you'll need to have eight stars. Jump into the Mario portrait in the room connected to the minigame room as Yoshi, then battle the Goomboss in the level you're transported to. Once you defeat him, you'll get the Mario key."

    {
      "title": "Enter Big Boo's Haunt.",
      "content": "Enter Big Boo's Haunt. As Mario, head to the castle's courtyard. From the castle foyer, this is located through the plain wooden doors and down the long hallway. You'll know you're going the right way if you see a Boo (ghost) in the hallway. Once you're in the backyard, start killing Boos until one drops a metal cage. Then after you've already beaten the Big Boo, bump into the cage to enter Big Boo's Haunt. Note that you'll need to collect the first star in Big Boo's Haunt before you can get Luigi. The stairway to the second floor of the mansion (where the entrance to Luigi's level is located) only appears from the second star onward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Head to the second story of the mansion.",
      "content": "Head to the second story of the mansion. Select the second star (or, if you have access to them, one of the stars after it). When the level starts, run into the mansion in front of you. Climb the staircase to the second floor and enter the door on the far right. You should enter a room with a raised wooden platform and a red \"?\" block."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your way to the attic.",
      "content": "Make your way to the attic. Break open the red \"?\" block. Mario should swell up like a balloon and start to float toward the ceiling. Float into the enclave and head through the door. Note that you can press the \"R\" button on the DS to cancel out of the floating move. In the Nintendo 64 version, getting up here proved quite challenging — many first-timers weren't aware of this door at first and had trouble getting to it once they found it. However, in the DS version, the balloon block makes this much, much easier."

      "title": "Jump into the Luigi portrait.",
      "content": "Jump into the Luigi portrait. In the next room, you should see a large portrait of Luigi. You know what to do — hop into the painting!"

      "title": "Listen for the sound of Big Boo's laughter near the doors.",
      "content": "Listen for the sound of Big Boo's laughter near the doors. After jumping into Luigi's portrait, you'll appear in a room with a large wooden carousel spinning in the center. You've entered Big Boo's Maze! The trick to making it through this maze is to listen near each door for the sound of Big Boo's laughter. The door that it's loudest next to is the door you'll want to go through! Note that there are eight red coins scattered throughout the maze. Though they're not required, finding all eight will win you a star."

      "title": "Proceed through the maze.",
      "content": "Proceed through the maze. In each room of the maze, follow the sound of Big Boo's laughter. If you make a mistake (or fall off a cliff), you'll be brought back to the beginning of the maze. Precise directions for the maze are listed below: From your starting position, enter the door on the right side of the room. In the next room, carefully run past the eyeball and go through the door on the left side of the room. In this room, get the \"?\" block if you wish to collect the coins on the ceiling, then head through the door on the right. Use the platforms to make it to the door on the left side of the room. Finally, run across the collapsing bridge and use the platforms to scale the wall. Head down the chimney at the top."

      "content": "Beat Big Boo! You'll fall into a room with a large mirror in front of you. Run up to the mirror and you'll see Mario's reflection turn into Luigi. After this, a battle with Big Boo will begin. Defeat Big Boo to get the Luigi key! He's not especially difficult, but you'll need to keep an eye on both Mario and Luigi to win. During the fight, Big Boo will switch back and forth between the reflection in the mirror (where Luigi is) and \"real life\" (where Mario is). When he's in the mirror, attack him with Luigi, and vice versa. Use the same strategy as you use for other Boos — kicks and ground pounds should blow him away when you're behind him. If you look at him, he'll hide his face. Watch out for his fireballs!"

Run back to the castle foyer and enter the character selection room — it's the door on the far right of the top floor. If you've played the original Super Mario 64, the door you want is the one that led to the Princess's Secret Slide in the original game."

      "content": "Get a feel for Luigi's features. Compared to the other characters in Super Mario 64 DS, Luigi has several unique abilities. He's better than the other characters in most ways and worse in some others — you may want to take a moment to play around with him in the castle before proceeding to get a sense for these differences. You might use him the most. Luigi's attributes include: [1] X Research source Being able to run on water for several seconds Being able to do a spinning fall after a backflip (which deals damage) Being able to Scuttle Jump, which is similar to Yoshi's Flutter Jump, to reach further distances, but not as high Being able to long jump the farthest Being tied with Mario on the triple jump height Being a slightly faster runner than Mario, except on an extra star speed run Being tied with Mario in power, but moves a little slower when carrying objects Being the fastest swimmer in the game Being able to turn invisible and pass through certain substances when he collects his power flower"
