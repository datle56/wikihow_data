      "content": "Do not have caffeine four to six hours before your bedtime. Caffeine is a known stimulant that can be found in coffee, non-herbal teas, chocolate, soft drinks, diet drugs, and some brands of pain relievers. It takes your body awhile to process caffeine once you consume it. For example, if you drink a caffeinated beverage at 7 pm, about half of the caffeine will still be in your body by 11 am. To get a good night’s sleep, you should avoid consuming caffeine four to six hours before bed or try to eliminate caffeine from your diet completely. [2] X Research source You should also cut down on the amount of alcohol you consume before bed. Limit your consumption to one to two drinks 1-2 hours before bedtime. Alcohol will only allow you to maintain a light sleep, causing you to possibly wake up and then have a harder time falling back asleep. [3] X Research source"

Calm down your body and brain by putting up heavy curtains or shades to block out light from your windows. You can also cover any electronic displays like televisions or computers so the light from the screens does not cause a glow in your room.

To keep your room cool, avoid putting space heaters in the room or using one heavy blanket. Instead, layer with blankets and sheets so you can shed layers when you get hot at night.

      "content": "Choose a comfortable sleep position. If you tend to snore at night , you may want to reduce your snoring by elevating your head with pillows. Use one to two pillows to raise your head four inches off the bed. This will help you to breathe properly as you sleep. You can also buy specially designed pillows to encourage proper breathing and relaxed neck muscles to reduce your snoring. [7] X Expert Source Marc Kayem, MD Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 24 October 2019. Most people who sleep on their left or right side, with their legs bent towards their chest will not snore as much as people who sleep on their backs. Consider sleeping on your side rather than your back or your stomach to ensure your body is relaxed, comfortable, and breathing properly as you sleep. If you are pregnant, you should sleep on your left side with a body pillow and lots of supporting pillows. Lying down when you are pregnant should be done with care and awareness, as you do not want to put your body or baby at risk. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about sleep positions during pregnancy. If snoring is an ongoing problem for you, then talk to your doctor. You might have sleep apnea, which can increase your risk for heart disease if left untreated. [8] X Research source"
