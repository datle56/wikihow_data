      "content": "Wash your face , then wait 15 minutes. Your skin should be clean and free of makeup, lotion, or toner. Your skin needs to rest for about 15 minutes before proceeding, as your skin may appear pink from scrubbing and make it difficult to see your true undertone."

      "content": "Find a natural light source. Different lightbulbs can affect your skin differently--they may give it a yellow or green cast, and interfere with the appearance of your skin tone. Choosing a sunny spot to look for your undertones will prevent you from misjudging your undertones. Try sitting next to a window. If you have an outdoor seating area, go outside."

Hold up your arm in the natural light and determine the predominant color. [2] X Research source If you can't tell if your veins are green or blue, you may have a neutral skin tone. If you have an olive complexion, you likely fall into this category. [3] X Research source If your veins appear green, you have a warm skin tone.

The amount of melanin in your skin determines how it reacts to sun exposure and can help you determine your skin tone.

      "content": "Hold a white piece of paper up to your face. Looking in a mirror, try to see how your skin looks in contrast to the white paper. It may appear to have a yellow cast, a blue-red or rosy cast, or it may not appear to be either, but a gray color instead. If your skin appears yellowish or sallow beside the white paper, you have a warm skin tone. If your skin appears pink, rosy, or blueish-red, then you have a cool skin tone. If your skin appears gray, your skin probably has an olive complexion with a neutral undertone. The green from your complexion and the yellowish undertone combines to create this effect. [10] X Research source You can experiment with neutral and warm tones since you fall somewhere in between. [11] X Research source If you can't determine any cast of yellow, olive, or pink, you have a neutral skin tone. Neutral tones can look good in foundations and colors on both ends of the cool/warm spectrum. [12] X Research source"

Note whether it makes your face look grayish or washed out, or if it enhances your skin. Then try with a sheet of silver foil. If the gold foil looks best, you have a warm skin tone. If the reflection from the silver foil makes your skin glow, you have a cool skin tone. If you don't notice a difference (both silver and gold are flattering), then you likely have a neutral skin tone. [13] X Research source If you don't have gold or silver foil, try laying gold and silver jewelry on your wrist, and notice which one is more flattering. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask a friend to look at the skin behind your ear. If you have acne , rosacea, or another condition that might mask your skin tone, you can have a friend look at the skin directly behind the shell of your ear, as this area is less likely to be affected. Have them examine the skin right in the little crease behind your ear. If your skin is yellowish, then your skin tone is warm. If your skin is pink or rosy, then your skin tone is cool If they have difficulty, they can try holding a white piece of paper near the skin. That should help them see if it appears yellow or pink."
