Collect a sample in a sealed plastic bag, and bring it with you to the vet appointment. [4] X Research source Even if you cannot see visible worms (which can appear as spaghetti-like, hair-like, or as round, segmented worms, depending on the species) in the stool, they may still be present. Some species of worms are microscopic. Making a trip to the vet's office can be an easy way to get rid of your puppy’s worms. If the vet can visually identify worms in your puppy’s stool, they may start deworming treatment on the spot by administering an oral medication to your puppy."

      "content": "Purchase deworming medication. Many veterinary offices will sell deworming medication in the front office, which will save you a separate trip to a pet store. Talk to the vet about whether or not you'll need a prescription, or if you should use an over-the-counter option. [5] X Research source Deworming medication will be sold at all pet shops and many large home-supply stores. The medication comes in both liquid and chewable forms. Your vet may ask that you bring the puppy in for a visit before they'll give you a prescription. Different worms require different types of medication for proper treatment. Ask your vet which brand and type of medication your puppy needs. Most over-the-counter forms of deworming medication treat a variety of worms such as tapeworm, roundworm, gut worms, and hookworm. At most pet shops or retail stores, this medication is sold for around $35 USD."

If you give the wrong kind to your dog, it may be ineffective against the parasite that's infected your dog. Make sure that you've identified the worm before you choose a dewormer. You can identify the worm by either looking at it yourself to see what kind of worm it is or by consulting the vet. It's always best to talk to your vet. [7] X Research source There are products available on the market that you can apply to your puppy's neck each month to control for multiple parasites, including worms. For example, Revolution and Advocate can both be used monthly to fight parasites. Talk to your vet about using these medications on your puppy. [8] X Research source"

If you must fill your own syringe, dip the top into the liquid medication and pull the plunger back to fill the vial with liquid. Fill it to the amount prescribed by your vet or suggested on the packaging. If you’re giving the puppy a pill, or if the syringes come pre-filled in the packaging, you can skip this step. Check to see if the medication should be given on a full or an empty stomach. For the medication to be effective, you need to follow these guidelines."

[9] X Research source Puppies are highly distractible, so once you have its attention, move quickly to give the pup its deworming medication. You may find it easiest to give the dog medication while it’s sitting on your lap. You’ll be able to hold it in one place using one arm, and use the free hand to get the dog’s attention and put the medication in its mouth."

If you’re giving the pup liquid medication via syringe, stick the tip of the syringe at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) inside of the puppy’s mouth, and dispense the liquid. The puppy should swallow it down quickly. [11] X Research source If you’re giving the puppy a medicated pill, set it back about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in the dog’s mouth, so that it will swallow the pill and not spit it back up."

[12] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. The number and frequency of dosages will differ based on the brand and type of medication the pup has been prescribed. Although they are effective after a single dose, they have no residual effect. This means the puppy needs more dewormer to kill each generation of worm as they hatch. For example, a typical dosage schedule involves medicating your puppy for 1–3 days in a row, and then giving the dog another 1–3 dosages 2 or 3 weeks later."
