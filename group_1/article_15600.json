      "content": "Eldest daughter syndrome is the burden felt by oldest daughters because of their unique childhood experience. Extra duties are often given to the oldest girl in a family, leading to a shared 'syndrome' of being responsible but overburdened. Other effects include perfectionism, anxiety, and burnout, as well as leadership and organizational skills. [1] X Research source For example, oldest daughters often have to do household tasks, take care of their siblings, assist their parents, and forge their own path in their family and the world. When they’re given tasks to do that parents normally do, it’s called parentification. [2] X Research source You might have eldest daughter syndrome if you’re always the one to organize the siblings’ gift for your parents or coordinate a family gathering, but you’re also trained to be a people-pleaser that fears failure. Other effects of being a parentified oldest daughter include having trouble with boundaries in relationships, not being able to let loose to have fun, and always wanting to be in control. Sometimes it can lead to lashing out and being rebellious."

      "content": "The trauma of parentification lasts a long time. If someone is forced to act like an adult before it’s appropriate for them, they can miss important social and emotional development. Some responsibility is a good thing, but too much can make a person feel anxious about pleasing their parents and covering all their tasks. [3] X Research source Parentification can prompt insecure attachment styles, stress and anxiety, and self-blame or guilt. Asking a nine-year-old kid to do the dishes isn’t parentification, but asking them to cook all the family’s meals or be a full-time carer for a sibling is."

      "content": "Birth order influences someone’s personality. Some people claim that every firstborn child is more dutiful and more unstable because they were ‘dethroned’ from their parents’ attention when a younger sibling was born. That might not always be the case, but being the oldest means that they were usually the most capable child when their parents needed help, so they were more likely to go to the oldest than any other sibling. [4] X Research source Birth order theory is old-fashioned and partially debunked in psychology. Most experts agree that while your position in sibling order impacts your experiences and your personality, it has a different effect in every family depending on their context."

      "title": "Many families give different chores to girls than to boys.",
      "content": "Many families give different chores to girls than to boys. Because of the way that girls and boys are treated differently in lots of cultures, childcare and household tasks often get given to the girls in the family, while the boys are given other tasks or none at all. This makes daughters much more likely to be overloaded with responsibilities than their brothers. [5] X Research source Gender also influences eldest daughter syndrome through role modeling. If a daughter sees her mom overloaded with house tasks and organizing for the family, she may think that that’s how she should act, too. The oldest daughter is sometimes forced to be a substitute for the mother. When the mom is too busy, the daughter steps in for her, leading to too many tasks for a kid to handle."

      "content": "Write a letter to your inner child. Some therapists say that there’s a part of you–your inner child–that’s still childlike and hurting from what happened to you as a kid. By thinking about who you were then and writing to them, you can process what you went through back then. Forgive your younger self, apologize to them, and think about how you can treat them better now. Bringing out your inner child also helps you bring back some of the childhood spirit you may have lost. [10] X Research source If you don’t want to write a letter, just imagining yourself as a kid and thinking about what you would say to them now can help a lot. By reflecting on your childhood self, you can learn more about your own lost inner child and potentially, help to heal your soul."

Listen without judgment. Ask her how she feels about the responsibilities she has in her family and your relationship, how her parents and siblings treated her as a child, or what tasks or events make her feel overwhelmed. Express your love and affection frequently, not just when she achieves a milestone or does something for you. This shows that your love is not conditional on anything she does."

Share tasks evenly across the whole household, including cleaning, laundry, errands, and childcare, and have a conversation about what splitting tasks looks like for you. [12] X Research source Having both partners alternate the same tasks as opposed to having completely different duties from each other can make the relationship feel more fair. [13] X Research source Another option is to have each person do the chores that they enjoy, and trade off on who does the tasks no one likes. That way, everyone shares the burden."

Be willing to do extra tasks some days in order to prioritize her mental health. For her to heal, it’s important for her to experience a more understanding attitude towards responsibilities than her parents had. Make an arrangement that she has a 'free pass' that she can cash in periodically to get out of a responsibility she doesn't feel like doing that day.
