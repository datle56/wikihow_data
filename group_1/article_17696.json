If your screen is scratched to the point where it impairs the visual presentation--but the actual LCD display is unharmed--then purchasing a new screen cover is practical. If the LCD display has been damaged (parts of the screen are black or rainbow-colored), however, your item is likely beyond repair and you will need to purchase a TV/phone/computer."

You'll need this number to make sure you purchase the correct type of screen. Make sure you have your manufacturer's name as well (e.g., Sony or Toshiba)."
