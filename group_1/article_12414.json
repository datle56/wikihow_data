      "content": "Make sure that your account is in good standing. To prevent vanishing from being use to hide vandalism, disruptive editing, or conflicts of interest, you can only have your account vanished if there are no current discussions about your behavior (or arbitration cases), active sanctions, or blocks (temporary or permanent) on your account. Check the administrator noticeboard , the arbitration requests page , and your talk page for current discussions. Check the block list and editing restrictions for currently active sanctions."

      "content": "Place the \"{{retired}}\" template on your user and user talk pages on Wikipedia (or Meta-Wiki). This will inform users leaving messages that you are leaving Wikipedia permanently (This step only works for the English Wikipedia, if you are registered on other Wikimedia wikis, you may want to skip this step) To do so, go to your user page and talk page and click on \"Edit\". Copy the template tag from above, paste it at the top of your user page on Wikipedia, and click on Publish changes . You can place \"{{db-u1}}\" template instead on your user page if you want it to deleted instead of showing a retired message. Note that your talk page will not be deleted unless there are exceptional circumstances. In most cases, you might need to contact the Arbitration Committee if you really want to have your user talk pages deleted."

Once the request is approved, your account will be randomly renamed to a randomly-generated string of characters, such as \"Renamed user 157yagz5r48a5f1a1f\", and locked. Please note, that the courtesy vanishing procedure is for users that want to leave Wikipedia PERMANENTLY. If you sign up for a new account at any time after the procedure is carried out, and are then discovered, the vanishing procedure may be reversed."
