There’s likely no getting the job back if you change your mind after declining it, so consider your decision and make sure it’s the right move . [1] X Research source If you’re having trouble with a final decision, make a list of the pros and cons of rejecting the job—it may help you figure out whether you want to proceed. There are plenty of reasons you might decide to decline a job offer even after accepting. For example: You may have gotten a better offer from a different employer. You may be dealing with other circumstances beyond your control, like a family emergency or illness. The employer’s company culture may not align with your values. The salary or benefits being offered may not be enough to meet your needs. You may simply feel, after reflection, that the job isn’t the right fit for you."

      "content": "Contact your employer quickly. Take time to consider the job carefully, but get back to your employer with a final decision as soon as possible. Your employer will need time to find a replacement for the position—so prompt notice is usually appreciated. The faster you let them know what’s going on, the more likely you are to get a positive and accepting response to your decision. [2] X Research source While turning down a job after already accepting it may feel understandably awkward, it’s definitely possible—and it doesn’t have to be a negative experience. In fact, declining a job quickly is best for you as well; if you start a new job despite knowing it’s not a great fit, you may waste the energy you could spend searching for a better job. It’s important to make sure the job you accept is a good fit!"

      "content": "Be honest and polite while explaining your reasons for declining. Honesty is the best policy, but be careful not to insult the company. Even if you’re nervous about declining the job offer, it’s always wise to tell your employer the truth about your reasons for it. Be professional, and put a positive spin on your reasoning to leave a good impression on your would-be boss. [3] X Research source If you don’t like the atmosphere at the office, try: “After careful consideration, I have decided to decline your generous offer, as I do not feel I am the best fit with the company’s culture.” If you got a better job, try: “Unfortunately, I have decided to decline your offer. I have been offered a job that I feel is more in line with my skill set and abilities.” If you’re declining because of a family emergency, try: “Due to unforeseen circumstances, I have decided to decline your offer. My father has become unwell, and I’ll be returning to New Jersey soon to take care of him.”"

      "title": "Give the employer a concise response.",
      "content": "Give the employer a concise response. Regardless of your reasons for declining the job, keep your explanation short and sweet. [4] X Research source Your employer doesn’t need to know all the details of a family emergency or an in-depth explanation of why you don’t like that company’s culture. Too much information can make the process more difficult, so be as concise as possible. You only really need to spend a sentence or two explaining your reasons for declining a job. For example, all you need is something as simple as, “My family’s circumstances have changed, and my commitments to them make it impossible to accept the job at this time.” Another concise response could be, “Another company has made me an offer that would be more practical for both my family and myself at this time.”"

Let your employer know that you enjoyed speaking with them during your interview, that you appreciate their offer of employment, and that you were very impressed by their company throughout the hiring process. [5] X Research source After all, it’s possible you may want to work with this employer in the future—so leave a positive impression! For example, say something like, “Thank you very much for the opportunity to work with ABC Publishing, and best wishes for the future.” “I very much enjoyed meeting you and getting to see what your company does firsthand. Thank you again for the offer of employment, and I wish you continued success.” “I’m very grateful for the time you spent considering and interviewing me—and for the opportunity to work with your company.”"

Not every employer will try to negotiate when you decline a job, but it’s possible—so before you reach out to them, make sure you know exactly what you’d need to continue with the job, and keep those requirements in mind if you end up negotiating. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Some employers may also be more flexible than others, so if there’s something that might make a job more doable for you, ask your employer about it before declining outright. For example, if you want to decline because of the long commute, ask about the possibility of working from home part-time (or full-time) if the job allows. If you’re currently in college or taking college courses, try asking if the company can accommodate your schedule. If you need a higher salary or fewer hours, consider renegotiating the terms of your employment to see if you can get a better offer."

It can be tough to break bad news over the phone, but calling your employer is more personal and gives you a chance to explain the situation clearly. [7] X Research source That way, you’ll have a better chance of maintaining a positive relationship with them going forward—especially if you want to work there in the future. Talk to your employer in person, alternatively. Whether you meet in person or talk over the phone, direct contact is the ideal way to go when breaking the news."

      "content": "Take the time you need to fully consider job offers in the future. After declining a job you’ve already accepted, learn from the experience and remember that it’s okay to ask for time to think over an offer in the future. You may feel awkward asking a potential employer for time, but it’s your right to ask! You deserve to feel empowered, take the time you need, and make informed career decisions. [9] X Research source Remember, many people need a couple of days to think, even if they’ve been offered their dream job, so prospective employers likely won’t find your request unusual. Before accepting a job in the future, consider the offer carefully and ask yourself questions to make sure it’s a good fit. For example: Is the salary acceptable? Will it support my lifestyle? Do I like this company’s work culture? Does the job provide opportunities for growth or promotions? Will the job help me fulfill my career goals, both in the short and long term? Will I be doing something I’m interested in? Does the job align with my skills and abilities?"

      "content": "You can legally turn down at-will employment any time you need to. Employment is usually presumed to be at-will, which means you can quit at any time for any reason. However, in some cases, you might be asked to sign a work contract, which may contain conditions related to your employment. If you’ve already signed a contract, look it over to make sure there won’t be any legal consequences for declining the job. [10] X Research source It’s possible that you may still be able to decline a job even after signing a contract. The contract may allow for it, or your would-be employer may simply let you out of the contract if you ask."
