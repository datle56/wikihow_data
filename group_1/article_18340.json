      "content": "Use active listening so you can give good responses. The main reason to be an active listener is to show the other person you’re paying attention and interested in what they have to say. Jean says the best way to do this is to smile, make eye contact, and listen more than you talk during the conversation. Another way to let someone know you’re listening is to nod occasionally or say something like, “That’s interesting.” The idea behind active listening is to show you’re really thinking about what the other person is talking about instead of just waiting for your turn to talk. Even when they pause for you to talk, take a few seconds to consider or summarize what they just said."

Gottesman says when you let the other person talk about themselves, they’re more likely to think you’re extremely interesting and entertaining. Other open-ended follow-up questions you can ask to keep your conversation going are: “Can you tell me more about that?” “How did you feel about that?” “What did you do next?” “How did that turn out?” “Why did you decide on that?”"

By heading off an awkward pause, you avoid rambling or just uncomfortably standing there staring at each other. Easy questions like asking if they’ve seen a popular movie or TV show are a great way to get out of awkward silences or steer the conversation in a new direction to keep it going. [8] X Research source If you’ve run out of things to talk about, end the conversation gracefully to leave the other person with a good impression. Excuse yourself to get a drink or say something like, “I have to go, but it was nice talking with you.” Another way to end a conversation without being rude is to make a plan to meet in the future. For example, “Hey, I have to head out. Let’s have lunch next week. I’ll text you to set something up.” [9] X Research source"
