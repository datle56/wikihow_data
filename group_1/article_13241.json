      "title": "Remember what you told the police officer.",
      "content": "Remember what you told the police officer. Before you can craft a defense, you need to remember what you told the officer when you were pulled over. If you in any way admitted that you were speeding, then it will be very difficult for you to dispute the speeding ticket. You can admit that you were speeding in various ways. For example, the officer may have asked if you were speeding. If you said “Yes,” then you will have a hard time getting out from under that admission. The officer also may have asked you how fast you were going. If you gave a number that was over the speed limit, then you have effectively admitted that you were speeding. If you don’t remember what you said, then wait until you get a copy of the officer’s notes. The officer may have made a notation that you admitted that you were speeding. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn the weaknesses in different technology.",
      "content": "Learn the weaknesses in different technology. You need to know how the officer measured your speed. The most common methods of gauging speed are “pacing,” radar, laser, and VASCAR (Visual Average Speed Computer and Recorder). Each are vulnerable to different criticisms: Pacing. Here, the officer follows behind you for a length of time and then looks down at his own odometer to measure your speed. You can attempt to discredit this speed reading by pointing out the officer was too far back to adequately follow you at a consistent speed. You could also argue that hills, curves, and traffic lights prevented the officer from following you for a sufficient length of time to get an accurate reading. [2] X Research source Radar. Radar technology employs radio waves. These waves reflect off a car and then are picked up by a receiver. You can challenge a radar reading in a few ways. For example, radio waves can hit more than one car, so you can argue that it hit a car that was closely following you. Also, you could argue that the radar’s calibration was off. Furthermore, you could argue that rain, wind, and storm clouds sent back erroneous speed readings. [3] X Research source Laser. Laser technology sends 40 beams of light over the course of a second toward the vehicle. The rate at which the light reflects back is then translated into a reading of the car’s speed. One weakness with laser technology is that all of the beams need to hit the same spot on the car. Also, like radar, light beams could reflect off other cars. Accordingly, you could argue that the officer didn’t know how to properly use the laser, or that the officer actually picked up a different car’s speed. [4] X Research source VASCAR technology. With this technology, the officer measures the distance between two points (say, for example, a telephone pole and a mailbox). Then, the officer uses a stopwatch to measure the amount of time it takes cars to pass between the points. The time will then be mathematically calculated to produce a miles-per-hour reading. You can challenge a VASCAR measurement by pointing to possible human error—specifically, the officer didn’t start and stop the stopwatch accurately. Also, you could argue the officer did not accurately perceive when you crossed one of the markers. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Identify witnesses.",
      "content": "Identify witnesses. If you had someone in the car with you when you were pulled over, then that person could testify as to what speed you were going. You should contact these people and ask them if they are willing to testify as to how fast you were driving. [6] X Research source You may also want to get a written affidavit from them. An affidavit is a statement signed under oath in front of a notary public. If you need to compel a witness to attend trial, then you should ask the court clerk to issue subpoenas. These should be issued free of charge."

      "content": "Request the officer’s notes. You have the right to request the police officer’s notes. [7] X Research source You can do this by filing a “Request for Discovery.” In your request you should cast a wide net and seek as much information as possible. For example, you can ask for the officer’s notes in addition to instruction manuals for how to operate any laser or radar technology. You may also want to know when the officer last had training operating the technology. The discovery request should be mailed to the police agency that ticketed you as well as the local prosecuting attorney. [8] X Research source A sample discovery request is available at Nolo’s website here . Revise it to suit your particular situation. If you do not hear back in three weeks, then you should call the court clerk’s office and ask about scheduling a hearing where you can present a “Motion to Compel Discovery.” At the hearing, you should show the judge a copy of the written request sent to the police department.

      "content": "Take pictures. Pictures might help your case. For example, if you were pulled over for speeding on a stretch of highway that had many twist and turns, then you could argue that it would be impossible for a car to go as fast as the officer claimed. You could also photograph the area where the officer was hiding and measuring speed. If the officer’s view was obstructed, then you could raise this issue as part of your defense. [10] X Research source Take pictures of any possible obstruction. Try to take pictures at the same time of day (and in similar weather conditions) as when you were stopped."

If you think that you can rattle a police officer, then a court trial might work best for you. Be mindful, however, that police officers are served with subpoenas to come into court and defend the ticket. Accordingly, you might want to seek a Trial by Declaration, since the odds are greater that the officer will not respond in writing and your case will be dismissed."

Contact the Superior Court for the county where the ticket was issued to find out acceptable payment methods. In some counties you can pay online. Online payment is limited to tickets received in El Dorado, Mono, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz counties. [11] X Research source The e-pay system is accessible here . In other counties, you can send a check or money order (payable to the Superior Court) to the court clerk. In the letter, ask for a trial date. [12] X Research source You can also have an in-person arraignment. To schedule one, visit the court clerk. If you choose this option, then you won’t have to pay the fine ahead of time. [13] X Research source"

You should probably start by setting the scene: where you were pulled over, what the conditions were like, and how fast you were driving. Then move onto focusing on the weaknesses in the state’s evidence that you were speeding. To make the best impression, you should dress professionally. [15] X Research source Try to wear your “Sunday best” and avoid shorts, sandals, or loud jewelry. Always address the Judge as “Your Honor” and stand when speaking.

A judge will be most impressed with evidence other than your own memories of the event. If you have photographs or witnesses, then use them. One strong piece of evidence is to read the operator’s manual for whatever form of technology was used to catch you. Operator’s manuals often point out the weaknesses or limitations with their technology. For example, the manual for a radar gun might state that it is best not to use the gun on multi-lane highways. If you were pulled over on a multi-lane highway, then you can use this evidence to cast doubt on the accuracy of the speed reading.

Whether you are the only source of evidence. If you do not have a witness, then you might need to testify.
