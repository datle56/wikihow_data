[1] X Expert Source Kirsten Thompson, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 1 October 2021. Find materials on and around you that will make the wet spot less visible. Don't be afraid to get a little creative—look for a sweater to wrap around your waist or a purse, bag, or hat that you can place over your lap area. You can also use your body to hide the spot to the best of your ability. Change up your posture or discreetly place your hands over the most visible areas. If there are any liquids nearby (e.g., juice, soda, etc.), consider “accidentally” spilling them on top of the wet spot to conceal it. The new liquid will cover up any smell or stain and provide a credible excuse for why you have a wet spot on your pants (but may further stain your clothing). Take a deep breath. The best way to discreetly handle this situation is to do so calmly and without bringing too much attention to the situation. Take a few long, deep breaths (if needed) to calm yourself down before proceeding."

      "content": "Make a credible excuse if someone notices. If someone notices the wet spot and points it out or asks what happened, offer a simple and rational excuse like “I sat in something” or “I spilled something.” Avoid rambling—the more detailed explanation that you offer, the more questionable it will seem. The truth is never a bad option, especially if it’s obvious what has happened—urinary incontinence is more common than you might think, and most people will understand and be willing to help you out if you’ve had an accident."

Ask the people around you what you think is happening across the room, or make an outlandish statement that will require them to look away before they answer. Here are some examples of potential phrases you could use to create a distraction: “What kind of food are they serving?” “Why are Anna and Ben hugging? I thought they got a divorce.” “Look, Jennifer Lopez's new music video is on!” “That guy really doesn't know how to play basketball.”"

[2] X Expert Source Kirsten Thompson, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 1 October 2021. Casually look around and go to the closest bathroom—once there, you’ll be able to privately and calmly analyze and deal with the situation. Walk casually to the bathroom and try to draw as little attention to yourself as possible. If you can’t find a bathroom, look for any other sort of private room or space where you could clean up. “Even if it feels a bit uncomfortable, if you are with someone you trust, it may help to employ their help,” says Dr. Thompson. [3] X Expert Source Kirsten Thompson, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. They may be able to cover you as you walk to the bathroom and they’ll likely be able to help you clean up in the bathroom as well. If you know that a friend is nearby, call or text them once you get to the bathroom. They can provide you with clothes, towels, a hair dryer, or any other items that you need that you can’t get yourself. If you can't find someone else to rely on, remember that you are your best ally. Trust in your capabilities that you can get through the situation independently and successfully."

You may find that the spot isn’t very large or visible—in these cases, you may be able to just leave it for now or use a bathroom hand dryer to dry it out sufficiently. If you do need to thoroughly clean the spot, however, use whatever you can find in the private space that you’re in. Most bathrooms will have soap, water, and paper towels—remove the damp item and scrub it with soap and cold water in the sink (cold water is more effective for urine stains than warm water). [4] X Research source Then, soak up the moisture with paper towels or a hand dryer. The quicker you address the stain, the easier it’ll be to remove. [5] X Research source If you feel uncomfortable removing any clothing, scrub out the urine as best you can and dry afterward with your clothing still on. A simple excuse of “I spilled something on myself” would also serve as an understandable explanation. If you have any on hand, use perfume, aftershave, or a body spray to cover up any potential odor. If you are wearing dark-colored pants or leggings, the wetness may not be noticeable!"

Soak up the mess with some dry towels, wipe it down with the wet towels, and dry the spot with the remaining dry towels. In order to do this discreetly, use a foot to wipe down the mess if needed.

If you’re feeling yourself start to panic, breathe deeply with your diaphragm and distract yourself with little games like counting the outlets in the room or which objects are the color blue. [7] X Research source If it helps, remember that going into panic mode will only draw more attention to a bathroom accident that could’ve otherwise gone unnoticed. It’s possible that the accident was induced by stress in the first place (a situation called Stress Urinary Continence), so avoiding placing any additional stress on yourself may help. [8] X Research source “Most of the stress and embarrassment in accidentally wetting yourself in public comes from the thought that others may see it, not necessarily from the accident itself,” explains Dr. Thompson. [9] X Expert Source Kirsten Thompson, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 1 October 2021. “A good reminder to keep in mind in any embarrassing moment taking place in public,” continues Dr. Thompson, “is that you will likely never see the people around you ever again.

If you are in a situation where bathrooms will be hard to access, regulate your liquid intake as much as possible. Keep in mind that formal events, like operas and plays, may not let you leave and reenter the theatre if you need to use the bathroom.

Persistent UI is caused by a change in bodily function, e.g., pregnancy, childbirth, aging, neurological disorders, urinary stones, and tumors. Temporary UI is typically caused by certain stimulants and temporary medical conditions (e.g., alcohol, caffeine, heart and blood pressure medications, urinary tract infections, and constipation). Temporary UI is further broken down into the following types: [19] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Stress urinary incontinence: Results from weakened or damaged pelvic floor or urethral sphincter muscles. Urine leaks usually occur when coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising, or lifting. Urge urinary incontinence: Involves a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by a loss of urine. Often includes frequent nighttime urination. Overflow urinary incontinence: Manifests as the frequent leakage of urine, resulting from some urine remaining in the bladder after typical urination. Typically caused by an obstruction in the bladder that prevents it from being emptied. Functional urinary incontinence: Results from a physical or mental impairment that prevents a person from making it to the bathroom on time (e.g., severe arthritis). Mixed urinary incontinence: Refers to when a person experiences more than one type of UI. Most frequently, mixed UI involves a combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence."
