      "title": "Plan out your print's design.",
      "content": "Plan out your print's design. Before you begin, think about how you want the print to turn out. This is especially important if you're making an artistic print, rather than simply recording a catch. Ask yourself questions such as: \" What angle will my subject to be viewed from?\" (eg., side, top, bottom) \"Do I want my subject in a specific pose?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Procure a subject.",
      "content": "Procure a subject. Gyotaku traditionally uses fish and other forms of sea life as subjects, so you'll need to buy or catch one in order to print it. Note that plants, objects and other animals can also be used. Don't be afraid to experiment! If you plan on printing a fresh fish, choose one that you'll enjoy eating once you're done; that way nothing gets wasted. Beginners should practice on smaller subjects as the larger you go, the harder it'll be to print."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean your subject.",
      "content": "Clean your subject. Dirt and grime can transfer to the print and ruin it, so be sure to thoroughly wash and dry your subject before you begin. Most fish coat themselves in a thin layer of mucus that helps to remove drag while they're swimming and protect against bacteria. This must be thorougly washed off beforehand, or else it'll dirty the print. The subject must be thoroughly dried off before printing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stuff your subject (optional).",
      "content": "Stuff your subject (optional). If your subject is dead, you may need to stuff it's orfices (eg., nose, gills, stomach (if gutted), anus) with paper tissues to prevent any bodily fluids from leaking out onto the print."
    },
    {
      "title": "Coat the subject in a light layer of ink.",
      "content": "Coat the subject in a light layer of ink. Using a brush or your fingers, work along the grain and apply a thin, even coat of ink across your subject. Avoid rubbing ink over the subject's eyes. They can't be printed properly as the cornea prevents ink from entering, nor will the ink hold well due to their gelatinous nature."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove any excess ink.",
      "content": "Remove any excess ink. Excess ink can create messy blobs on the print, thus, before applying the paper, use a clean, dry cloth and carefully pat dry any areas that have too much ink. Remove any wrinkles in your cloth before attempting to blot off exess ink, as the lines formed will transfer onto the print. If you've gotten ink on the eyes, wipe it off before proceeding. Try not to remove too much ink, else there won't be enough detail. Learning how much ink is too much/little comes with practice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the paper onto your subject.",
      "content": "Apply the paper onto your subject. Lay the paper over the subject, then, starting in the center, lightly rub the paper into your subject to transfer the ink to onto the paper Avoid creasing the paper too much. Small creases are fine and can add beauty to your print, but it's best to avoid adding too many. Placing a cloth in between your hands and the paper helps to give a more even pressure, while using your hands alone can give a more rustic appearance. Don't allow the paper to shift, or else the ink will smear and make your print look messy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gently peel the paper off of your subject.",
      "content": "Gently peel the paper off of your subject. Hold two corners of the paper and slowly peel it upwards off of the subject, then check the print to see if you're satisfied with it. If you're satisfied, move on to the final steps, otherwise restart the process using a new sheet of paper."

      "content": "Let the print dry. Place your print in a dry, open area, such as on a clothesline, to dry. Congrats, you're pretty much done! At this point, if you used non-toxic ink/paint for your printing, you can wash off the fish and eat it."

      "title": "Place a slightly damp sheet of paper over the subject.",
      "content": "Place a slightly damp sheet of paper over the subject. Lightly spray a sheet of paper with water so it's no longer as stiff, then place it over the fish. DO NOT soak the paper. If you're using rice paper, place the rough side downwards so that it faces the subject."

      "content": "Mould the paper around the subject. Press the paper into the fish such that it takes on the shape of the subject. Take care not to press so hard as to actually tear the paper. Try to avoid creating large creases in the paper. Small creases are fine and can add beauty to your print, but it's best to avoid adding too many. This can be tricky if you're working with a large subject. Ask for assistance if necessary."

Once again, avoid putting ink where the eyes are, as they don't print very well. They'll be painted or drawn on separately later on."

Defining the outline can make your subject stand out more, especially if you choose to add a background. Highlight the underside of the fish by painting it a lighter color than the body. This can make the print appear more 3 dimensional, and suggest a light source."
