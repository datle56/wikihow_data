[3] X Expert Source Supatra Tovar, PsyD, RD Licensed Clinical Psychologist (PSY #31949), Registered Dietitian, & Fitness Expert Expert Interview. 6 October 2021. A broken marriage is almost never entirely one person's fault. Sometimes it can be easy to see how your actions impacted the marriage, like if you had an affair or broke your partner's trust. Other times, it might be more subtle, like having unrealistic expectations of marriage or having a critical attitude toward your partner. [4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Josh Spurlock, MA, LPC, CST Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. For instance, you may have expected your partner to spend every weekend doing fun couple things. If they want to spend time with their friends on the weekends, it could lead to resentment on both sides. Understanding how your expectations impacted that situation can make it easier to compromise with your spouse. If you find yourself frequently snapping at your partner, they may start to feel like there's no point in making an effort, so they might withdraw. You can repair that damage by speaking more kindly and focusing on the positive things they do. Directly stating what you did wrong and how you know your actions were improper can go a very long way to your partner. Show them you care by admitting your mistake.

No matter what your spouse has done to hurt you, you have to forgive them if you want to move forward in your marriage. In fact, in Colossians 3:13, the Bible instructs us to \"Forgive as the Lord forgave you.\" That means forgiving them with unconditional love and completely releasing any resentment toward your spouse.

Set healthy boundaries with your partner so you both know what is and isn't acceptable in the future. For instance, even if you forgive your spouse for cheating, you might still ask them to openly share their devices and passwords with you until you feel comfortable that you can trust them again. When discussing the situation, speak from your feelings. There’s no doubt that a cheating partner knows how much they have hurt you, but stating directly how and why you are hurt, and speaking from your feelings will be most effective.

But prayers like \"God, please help him stay home more often,\" or \"God, make my partner less critical,\" aren't going to heal your marriage. In those prayers, you're prioritizing what YOU want for the relationship, rather than God's design for your marriage. Instead, open your heart to rebuilding a relationship with who your spouse actually is, not who you want them to be.

If you have a pre-set idea of what your healed, healthy marriage will look like, you could actually be working against God's plan for you and your spouse.

But after a while, daily life takes its toll, and you might find it harder to feel those butterflies. The amazing thing about love, though, is it isn't just something that happens to you.

In Ephesians 5:20, the Bible tells us to \"Be thankful.\" It's no coincidence that this comes right before a passage on how spouses should treat each other. When you make it a priority to express gratitude to your spouse each day, it can help restore those bonds of love and trust in your marriage. It's also a way to give your partner positive feedback about the things you like, so they may be encouraged to keep doing them. [14] X Research source When you and your partner are really struggling, it might seem hard to find anything to be thankful for. Start small with something like, \"Thanks for taking out the trash,\" or \"I appreciate you for doing the laundry.\" As you get more into the habit of sharing your gratitude each day, it will get easier to find things to be thankful for."

Don't give up, even if you sometimes feel like you're the only one willing to compromise. In time, your spouse will notice how hard you're trying. If they're still invested in the marriage, eventually they'll try to meet you in the middle."
