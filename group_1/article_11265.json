      "content": "Remove any stickers and wash the lime. Before you cut your lime, remove any stickers on the outside peel. Then, give your lime a 5-10 second rinse in hot water and dry it off completely. This ensures that you have a clean lime for garnishing your drink or plate. [1] X Research source Some people scrub their limes with a brush when rinsing them. This isn't necessary, but it can be helpful if your limes have dirt and debris on them, like those picked straight from the tree."

      "content": "Use a sharp knife to cut the tips off the lime. Use a small, sharp knife like a paring knife or a utility knife to cut the tip off both ends of your lime. The lime should be able to sit flat if you stand it up on either end. [2] X Research source Don't cut deep enough that you expose the flesh of the time. You should just take off the excess, raised peel at either end of the lime."

      "title": "Place each half on a cutting board with the rind facing up.",
      "content": "Place each half on a cutting board with the rind facing up. On a clean cutting board, place each half of your lime so that the flesh is toward the board and the rind is facing you. This gives you better grip as you cut and produces more even wedges. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the lime in half length-wise.",
      "content": "Cut the lime in half length-wise. You don't want to cut around the width of the fruit. Instead, slice it in half between the pointy ends you just removed. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slice each half into 2-3 wedges.",
      "content": "Slice each half into 2-3 wedges. Cut length-wise right down the center of both lime halves to get 4 wedges from a smaller lime. For a larger lime, cut each half at an angle to divide it into 3 even pieces to get 6 total wedges. [5] X Research source You want the wedge to be large enough so that you can squeeze it into your drink or over your food. Try not to make it so small that you won't get any juice from the wedge. If you plan on putting your wedge on the rim of a glass, make a small cut in the center of the wedge's flesh so it can sit on the glass evenly."

Place your knife 1 ⁄ 4 inch (6.4 mm) to 1 ⁄ 8 inch (3.2 mm) back on the peel of the lime and slice across the width of the fruit. This should produce a round, wheel-shaped slice. [8] X Research source Repeat this process with each half of the lime until the wheels get too small for your purposes or until you've reached the end of the lime flesh."

      "content": "Rinse your lime thoroughly. Lime peels are typically submerged in drinks as garnish. That's why it's important to thoroughly clean your lime before peeling it. Remove any stickers on the peel and rinse the lime in hot water for 10-15 seconds. Use a clean dish brush to scrub the lime peel.

Run the knife down the length of your lime to the other point end. Then, pluck the peel from the lime. [11] X Research source Channel knives create deep, clean cuts on citrus peels. You can find these at most kitchen stores and major online retailers."

Hold the lime firmly in one hand and run the edge of your blade down the length of the lime so that you only cut away the peel. Cut away from you to minimize the chance of accidents. [12] X Research source You can also use a sharp vegetable peeler to create your garnish. The thick peel will quickly dull blades, though, so if you plan to peel citrus garnish frequently, a paring knife or channel knife is a better tool."

Twist the peel directly over the glass to release the essentials oils, then drop the twist into the drink.

Filtering just gives you a smoother finish if you're mixing your lime juice into a cocktail or recipe."
