      "title": "Wait.",
      "content": "Wait. As you wait for the music to begin, hold your fedora in your right hand, and prepare your knees to jump. The more ready you are, the easier it will be to spring into action once the music starts, which is very impressive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sweep your fedora on and jump to face left.",
      "content": "Sweep your fedora on and jump to face left. [3] X Research source Once the music starts sweep the fedora on your head. At the same time, jump so that you face left, putting your weight on your bent right leg. Your left leg will be bent and touching the ground a foot in front of your right foot, your toe on the ground. Your left hand should be resting about where a belt buckle would be. Your right hand should be splayed in front of your face after you put the hat on. You can slowly lower your right hand during the first moments of the song for dramatic effect."

    {
      "title": "Start thrusting.",
      "content": "Start thrusting. [4] X Research source When the heavy percussion begins, spring into the first move. Whirl your right arm in a circle, so that it swings behind you on the beat of one. Keep it extended there. At the same time, your left foot and your pelvis should move back, for the beginning part of the thrusting motion. Your pelvis should move back on the downbeat (1 and 3) and up on the upbeat (2 and 4). You will do this for four counts of four."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick your right leg.",
      "content": "Kick your right leg. Exit the thrusting on the third beat of the fourth repetition by jumping the legs closer together. Then kick out your right leg. Hit the top of your leg to emphasize the kick. The kick should come on the downbeat (1). This is about the time the “ch-sh-sh” sound happens on the track."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll your fists around each other and turn.",
      "content": "Roll your fists around each other and turn. This will take one beat, ending on an upbeat (2). Your back should be facing the audience. Once your back is turned, extend your right arm out to the right and your left near your left hip, which should be jutting out to the left to counterbalance your extended arm. Remember to stylize your fingers, splaying them and holding one in toward your palm. You don’t want to look like you’re going for a high five. Don’t hold too long here. Move quickly onto the next step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pose with your left arm and leg out on the next beat (3).",
      "content": "Pose with your left arm and leg out on the next beat (3). Circle your left arm and extend it to your side. Bend both of your legs, with the left leg bent and pointing to the left, resting on its toe. You want the audience to see the profile of your leg. Your right hand should be near your crotch. Keep your left fingers stylized. Hold this for one beat, then move on to the next move."

    {
      "title": "Pelvic thrust forward and look to the left.",
      "content": "Pelvic thrust forward and look to the left. This will be on the upbeat (4). Repeat the kick and spin on the left side, starting on beat 1. Jump your feet together, so that the rest of your body faces to the right. Then kick with your left leg. Roll your hands as you turn to face the audience and shoot your left arm to the left as you completely face forward. Finish with your right arm spinning and extending to the right. Keep your right leg bent and resting on its toe. Remember to keep your hands stylized. The left hand ends on the crotch."

    {
      "title": "Look to the right for a beat.",
      "content": "Look to the right for a beat. Then cross the left leg in front of the right. At the same time, swing the arms across your middle in an X. Bring your head down and swing your arms back to your sides. Keep your elbows tucked and at a 90 degree angle. Your hands should be splayed to either side for jazz hands. This should take about three beats, with the jazz hands posing at 3."

    {
      "title": "Switch sides.",
      "content": "Switch sides. Moving into the fourth beat, step your right foot to the right and cross the left foot behind it and bring your left hand up for jazz hands. This time, bend your head down to the right and grab your hat with your right hand. You should end on the beat of four."
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch once more.",
      "content": "Switch once more. Step your leg out to the left, then cross your right foot behind it. As you land, pull the hat off of your head and throw it to the side. As you throw it, step back so that your feet are no longer crossed. Keep your legs bent for style. Step back to center and clap on the upbeat (4)."

      "title": "Smooth your hair.",
      "content": "Smooth your hair. With the right foot pointing dramatically to the right and either tapping or going up and down, smooth the left side of your head with your right hand. Your left hand should be at your neck, your elbow extended. Do this twice in four beats. Smooth your hair starting at the top of your head and going around. Don’t cross you hand in front of your face."

      "content": "Tap the right side of your chest with your right hand. Extend your arm and leave your right leg bent and on its toe. Then step your legs together and turn 360 degrees to face your audience. This is where Michael Jackson grabs his microphone and begins singing."
