      "title": "Scrape off excess paint with a dull knife or spoon.",
      "content": "Scrape off excess paint with a dull knife or spoon. Use a dull knife or the edge of the spoon to remove as much paint as possible. Depending on the type of paint and how it dried, it may not be possible to remove much at this step. If it seems like it isn’t working, skip to the next step. Don’t risk damaging your shirt by continuing to scrape. [1] X Research source Note: while this method can work to remove most types of paints, it generally works best with water-based paints like acrylic or latex. Even then, some dried paints may need stronger methods to remove the stain completely."

      "content": "Pretreat the garment with liquid detergent. Fill a sink or bucket with water and some liquid laundry detergent of your choosing. Submerge the stained garment in the solution and let it soak for an hour. If the stain seems particularly stubborn, pour some detergent (or dish soap) directly onto the paint and let it sit for 5 minutes before soaking in the solution. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrub the paint stain with a toothbrush. Remove the garment from the sink or bucket, then gently agitate the paint stain with an old toothbrush. This will hopefully loosen some of the paint to make it easier to remove. Rinse the garment in the sink, then apply more detergent or a stain remover directly onto the stain. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash the garment as usual.",
      "content": "Wash the garment as usual. Leave the detergent on the stain to give it some extra cleaning power, then wash the garment in the washing machine as usual, using the hottest temperature safe for the garment. Check the care label if you’re not sure. If the stain is gone after washing, dry your clothes as usual. Otherwise, repeat the process or try one of the methods below. [4] X Research source Do not put the stained item in the dryer if the paint is still there. The heat will set the stain and make it even harder to remove. If your garment is dry clean only, it’s best to take it to a professional dry cleaner to see if the paint can be removed. If you normally hand wash your clothes, Stocker says, “Be careful that you do not over scrub [when washing]. If you do, you can damage the fibers, and even rip the items or make them look threadbare as you will have stretched the material past the point of being able to bounce back into shape.” [5] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019."

      "title": "Soak the paint in rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Soak the paint in rubbing alcohol. Alcohol is a great way to remove many water-based stains, including latex and acrylic paint, and there are plenty of household items that contain it. Grab some rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, or even hairspray and apply it directly to the paint stain. Make sure the fibers of the clothes are saturated, then use an old toothbrush to loosen the paint and scrub it away. [6] X Research source Water-based paint and oil-based paint usually need to be treated differently, so check the label on the container to make sure the paint is water-based. Water-based paints include latex paint and acrylic paint, so if you see either of those, go ahead and try the methods in this section. [7] X Research source Acetone, like nail polish remover, also works the same way. However, do not use acetone if the fabric contains acetate or triacetate, as the acetone could melt the fabric. Do a test on an inconspicuous spot of fabric first to make sure the hairspray or alcohol won’t discolor your clothes. If the paint is acrylic, applying a few drops of an enzyme-based cleaner may also work. Work it in with a soft-bristle brush and let it sit for about 15 minutes before rinsing."

      "content": "Apply a baking soda paste. Mix baking soda and water to create a paste, then apply it directly to the paint stain. Or, mix the baking soda with some dish soap and rubbing alcohol for a stronger solution. As the mixture dries, the baking soda will help treat the garment and lift the stain. After it’s dried completely, rinse the area with cool water to see if the stain is gone. Repeat as necessary, then wash the garment as usual. [8] X Research source Note that baking soda can sometimes discolor fabrics, so be sure to test it on an inconspicuous area first."

      "content": "Soften the paint with citrus, rosemary, or lavender essential oils. If you happen to have any essential oils lying around, they may be able to loosen the paint so it’s easier to remove. This is especially true for lemon , rosemary , and lavender . Simply apply a few drops directly to the stain and allow the oils to soak into the fibers. Then, wash the item as you normally would and see if the paint comes out. As always, test this method on an inconspicuous area first, as essential oils often contain carrier oils like jojoba oil, which can stain fabrics. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply mineral spirits or paint thinner. These products can be used to remove oil paint from paintbrushes, so they also work to remove it from other surfaces, like fabric. Apply the paint thinner or mineral spirits directly to the stain to thin the paint. Then, rinse the garment with water, pretreat it with laundry detergent, and wash as usual. Repeat as necessary until the stain has been removed. [11] X Research source Warning: mineral spirits and paint thinner are highly flammable, so do not put garments treated with these products in the dryer. Instead, allow them to air dry. Before trying the methods in this section, make sure the paint is oil-based by looking for the label on the container. If you don’t have the container, consider how you clean your paint brushes ; oil-based paints require solvents like turpentine or mineral spirits. [12] X Research source If you’re still not certain what kind of paint you have, perform a strip test on a small area of the surface you were painting. Dab a cotton ball in a bit of denatured alcohol and rub it across a tiny area of the paint. If the paint doesn’t come off, it’s oil-based. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Dissolve paint with turpentine. Turpentine works similarly to mineral spirits and paint thinner. Use a sponge to apply a bit of turpentine to the stain to soften and dissolve the paint. [14] X Research source Then, use an old toothbrush to scrub away the paint. Rinse the loosened paint away, then Almani says to “wash separately as normal in the washing machine.” [15] X Expert Source Kamel Almani Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021. Warning: Turpentine is highly flammable, so do not put the garment in the dryer. Allow it to air dry instead. It may help to dab the stain from the back to push the paint out of the fabric rather than deeper into it. If the turpentine didn’t remove the stain completely, pretreat the area with laundry detergent before washing it. In some cases, applying a few drops of an essential oil (like citrus, rosemary, linseed, or lavender) may also help soften oil paint so it can be removed more easily. [16] X Research source"

The longer you take to tackle the stain, the more likely it is to set.

Try to find a paint that’s as close to the original color of the garment as possible. Then, simply grab a paintbrush and paint over the stain. If that doesn’t work, another option is to use paint the same color as the stain and turn it into a design.
