      "content": "It’s important to have a conversation about his cheating if you haven’t already. If you aren’t 100% sure that he’s cheated (maybe you saw some weird texts or messages that made you suspicious), ask him to sit down and chat with you about what’s going on. Hopefully, you two can have an open, honest conversation about what he’s been doing behind your back. [1] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. You can start the conversation by saying something like, “I’ve seen a few things that I’m pretty worried about. Could we sit down and talk?” Then, say something like, “What you’ve been doing isn’t okay, and it makes me feel like you don’t care about our relationship.” The goal here is to get everything out in the open and tell him that you know he’s been unfaithful. If he won’t admit that to you and you know he’s cheating, then you probably can’t continue the relationship. However, if he owns up to it and apologizes, you might choose to work on your relationship and stay together."

      "content": "Getting cheated on is absolutely devastating, but try not to make any rash decisions. Although it can feel tempting to break up with him and leave your boyfriend behind, give yourself a moment to just think. You have a few things to consider, especially when you’re pregnant, and making a decision while your emotions are running high might lead to some regret down the road. If you feel like you can, just take some time for yourself right now instead of deciding what to do about your boyfriend.

      "content": "Ask your boyfriend to leave or head to a friend or family member’s house. If you two live together, figuring out what to do next while you’re in the same house can be tough. Spend a few days (or weeks) apart as you think about the relationship, and really try to figure out what you want to do next. This will give you some space to think about what you want, and also give you some time to reflect on your relationship as a whole. Plus, it gives you a nice break from all the stress, so you have a chance to relax on your own. [3] X Research source Since you’re pregnant, it’s probably easier for you to stay in your home and for him to leave. That way, you don’t have to take a bunch of stuff with you, and you can relax in the comfort of your own home. If neither of you have anyone you can stay with, consider sending your boyfriend to a hotel for a few nights."

      "content": "Although it might feel like it, someone cheating on you is never your fault. It’s easy to blame ourselves when we get betrayed, especially when it’s someone we love. However, keep in mind that your boyfriend had plenty of opportunities to come to you with issues instead of stepping outside the relationship. [4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. If he had a problem with you, he should have talked to you instead of finding someone to cheat on you with. Even if things were strained because of your pregnancy, that’s still not an excuse. Plenty of couples find healthy, loving ways to work through their issues, and it’s not your fault that your boyfriend picked the wrong way to go about things."

      "content": "Stress can affect your health, which can have an impact on your baby. Be sure to do whatever is best for you, and keep up with your prenatal care. Don’t skip any doctor’s appointments, and reach out to your healthcare team if you’re having any issues. And, if you can, try to practice self-care, too. [5] X Research source If you need help getting to and from doctor’s appointments, call a friend or family member for support. Consider telling your doctor about the stress you’ve been going through.

      "content": "Since he’s your baby’s father, you’re probably going to have things to talk about. Even if you don’t want to get back together with him, you might still need to talk about childbirth, visitation, and his parental rights. Try going somewhere neutral, like a friend’s house, to talk things out calmly with each other. [6] X Research source When you two talk, say something like, “I just had a doctor’s appointment, and the baby is healthy. I’m still on track to give birth in about a month. I haven’t decided whether I want you in the room or not yet, so just give me some time.” Or, “Once the baby is born, I think we should split custody 50/50. You can still come and visit, but I’d like someone else to come with you, like your mom or one of my parents.” If you aren’t ready to talk about your relationship yet, that’s totally fine. Make it clear that you’re only here to chat with him about baby stuff, not about the relationship."

If you realize that you’ll never be able to trust your boyfriend again, you’re well within your rights to break up with him. Keep in mind, though, that you’ll still have to keep in contact with him occasionally since you two have a baby together. [7] X Research source If you do break up with him, contact a lawyer to start talking about a custody agreement for when your baby is born. You might also want to think about whether or not you want your boyfriend in the delivery room with you. It’s up to you, and you don’t have to have him in there if you don’t want him to be."

It certainly won’t happen instantly, but if your boyfriend is truly sorry and wants to make this work, he can prove that he’s loyal to you and get you to trust him again.

Things like these might be the last thing on your mind, but it’s super important to keep up your routine during times of emotional stress. Plus, falling back into a routine can help put your brain on autopilot, and it might help distract you from what just happened with your boyfriend (at least for a little while).
