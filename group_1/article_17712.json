      "content": "Remove any polish from your nails. Use a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover to take off any current nail polish. Rub your nails from side to side, making sure to remove the polish on the side edges of your nail. Be careful to not get cotton particles caught in the split of your nail. If you are worried about catching your nail on the cotton ball, remove the nail polish moving in the direction of the split."

      "content": "Cut the teabag to fit your nail. Depending on where the nail split is, cut the tea bag in a rectangle shape to completely fit on your nail, just past the split toward the free edge of your nail. [2] X Research source For example, if the free edge of your nail has the split, cut the tea bag to cover the split and about half of your nail. If the split is vertical, cut the tea bag longer to reach just before your cuticle. Be sure that the sides of the cut teabag reach to the sides of your nail. Once the teabag is applied onto your nail, you can leave the end of the teabag hanging off the free edge of your nail; you’ll remove it later."

      "content": "Apply a clear base coat . Paint a thin layer of a clear nail polish as a base coat. Be sure to cover the split section of your nail. This clear polish will act as glue to hold the teabag in place. [3] X Research source If you have it on-hand, use nail glue instead of a base coat. Nail glue is great for larger or vertical splits, since it will hold your nail in place for longer."

      "content": "Place the teabag on your nail. When the clear base coat is still wet, carefully place the rectangle piece of tea bag onto your nail to cover the split section. Gently smooth the tea bag out with your finger or a cuticle stick , to make sure there are no air bubbles underneath the surface of the teabag."

Wait for the clean base coat to dry, then carefully cut away the rest of the teabag hanging off your nail. [4] X Research source It is okay to leave a little bit of leftover teabag hanging off your nail, because you can file it away later when it is less fragile."

You don’t want to mess up your nail after having the rectangle of teabag paper and three coats of nail polish applied. Swiping along the free edge of your nail helps to prevent lifting or fraying of the teabag."
