      "content": "Use layers of grey shading. If we visualize a light source at the upper left of the image, we can simulate an object as 3 dimensional by adding various layers of grey (one darker than the next). Start by using the lightest gray or white along the area nearest to the light. You can use various shades of pencil or coloring tools to create this effect. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try using lines to shade. This effect can also be done using pen and ink, by drawing intersecting lines drawn on top of one another to simulate the appearance and layers of shading from light to dark. This is commonly used in illustrations and comics. In other print media, the printing process uses \"halftone\" printing, which prints small dots of varying sizes to simulate shading."
