      "title": "Hydrocolloid bandages",
      "content": "Hydrocolloid bandages If you're tuned into TikTok skincare, no doubt you've already heard of the seemingly magical powers of hydrocolloid bandages . The bandages' inner layer, which touches your skin, contains particles that form a gel barrier over your skin. This keeps the area moist and promotes healing while also absorbing the pus and other fluid (called exudate) leaking out of the pimple. Meanwhile, the outer layer, which is made of foam or film, seals the area around the pimple to keep bacteria out. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source How to Use: Cut up a hydrocolloid bandage to a size slightly larger than your pimple. Wash your face with your regular face wash, let the skin dry, then apply the bandage and change it whenever it appears full of fluid. Reapply new bandages for up to 3-5 days. This gives it plenty of time to heal your skin. [2] X Research source Can you put a hydrocolloid patch on a popped pimple? Yes, hydrocolloid patches are actually best used on pimples that are already oozing fluid—aka pimples that have already been popped or picked at. The bandage will be able to help absorb the fluid and protect the area for faster healing. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Bandaids",
      "content": "Bandaids Bandaids can make a good pimple patch in a pinch. They don't absorb pus and exudate like hydrocolloid bandages, but they do protect it from the dirt and bacteria in your environment. They also help the area stay moist, which aids in the healing process. [4] X Research source How to Use: Trim the adhesive bands of the Bandaid with scissors so you don't have an unsightly bandage stretching across your face. Then apply it directly over your pimple. Change it at least once daily until you notice the pimple clears up."

      "title": "Apple cider vinegar",
      "content": "Apple cider vinegar According to Dr. Goldman, apple cider vinegar lowers the pH of the skin when it's applied topically. Lowering the pH level of the skin barrier (and thus raising its acidity) dries it out. That, combined with its antibacterial and antifungal properties, is why some doctors suggest treating your acne with apple cider vinegar . But use caution! Stripping your skin barrier of its natural oils may eliminate the pimple in the short term, but using it too much or on sensitive skin can cause even more acne breakouts. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source How to Use: Make a toner with 1 part apple cider vinegar and 3 parts water and store it in a glass jar. Pour a few drops onto a cotton ball or pad and wipe it onto your pimples. Leave it on for a few minutes (but no longer than 15 minutes), then rinse it off with warm water. Apply a moisturizer after rinsing. [6] X Research source Warning: Consult your doctor before using this at-home pimple patch if you have sensitive skin."

      "title": "Aspirin",
      "content": "Aspirin Studies have shown that aspirin has a positive, anti-inflammatory effect on many skin conditions, leading some people to believe it can also soothe red and inflamed pimples. [7] X Research source It works because it contains a chemical called acetylsalicylic acid, which is very similar to salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is a common ingredient in acne face washes, toners, and leave-in products because it breaks down and dissolves the oil and dead skin cells in pimples. It's also very drying, so beware of that effect and apply aspirin to your face only to treat stubborn acne. [8] X Research source How to Use: Crush 3-4 aspirin tablets and mix the powder with 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of warm water. You can also add a couple of drops of honey or aloe vera if you want it to be more soothing and paste-like. Apply the mixture to your pimples and leave it on for 10-15 minutes. Then rinse it off with warm water. Note: Remember to wear sunscreen with a high SPF to protect your skin when you go outside, as salicylic acid can make it more sensitive to sun damage."

According to Dr. Goldman, \"baking soda may facilitate a drying type of…environment,\" which can be beneficial for people who struggle with overproducing oil and clogged pores. However, she cautions that this home remedy can also completely dry out your skin barrier and lead to more acne. So, use it sparingly as a spot treatment and consider avoiding it entirely if your skin is more dry than oily. How to Use: Mix equal parts baking soda and water to form a paste. Apply the paste with a cotton swab to your pimples and leave it for 10-15 minutes. Rinse it off afterward. [9] X Research source"

Others are large and extremely tender, and you only find relief from them when they're drained by a professional dermatologist.

Papules are small, tender, inflamed bumps with no white or yellow top. Whiteheads are white bumps beneath the skin that come from plugged hair follicles. Blackheads are plugged hair follicles that open up on the skin's surface and turn black from exposure to oxygen. Nodules are large lesions that are solid, painful, and buried deep in the skin."
