      "content": "Use a wide-barreled curling tong to create your Marcel waves. Opt for a curling tong with a barrel size of 1 inch (2.54 cm) or larger, as this will give you a more classic, vintage look than a regular curling iron or crimper. [1] X Research source A modern curling iron or 3-barrel curling iron also work well for this style. Sometimes curling tongs are called “Marcel irons” since this iconic look was created by French hairstylist Francois Marcel."

      "content": "Divide your hair into 2-inch (5.1 cm) by 1-inch (2.5 cm) down sections with your styling comb. Making one small, 2-inch (5.1 cm) by 1-inch (2.5 cm) section at a time will help you achieve your desired 1920s look. Using a section larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm) will give you a less dramatic wave that isn’t historically accurate. [3] X Research source Your hair sections should reflect the size of your iron (the diameter of the iron used)."

      "title": "Place the curling tong upside down on a 2-inch section of hair.",
      "content": "Place the curling tong upside down on a 2-inch section of hair. Hold the curling tong upside down near your roots to create a bend in the hair, rather than adding volume. Holding each section of hair lightly, guide the hair in the direction of the wave pattern for lasting hold and symmetry. Holding the hot tool upside down helps to control volume and give the classic defined wave pattern. If your tongs are on medium heat, you may need to hold them in place for up to 10 seconds. Exercise caution when using heat-styling products. Always use heat protection products, and don't use the highest temperatures for your tools. Instead, adjust the heat according to your hair texture—generally, medium heat works well on most textures."
