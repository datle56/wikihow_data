If you turn it over, you should see screws that you'll need to unscrew to take the mouse apart. Since almost every mouse varies in ways to disassemble it, this article will focus on the general similarities of computer mice. A squeaky mouse most likely means that dust, dirt, or debris has clogged up the axel that the mouse wheel sits on. To stop the squeak, you'll need to clean your mouse . Once you have the mouse turned over and have located the screw(s) holding it together, you can unscrew them and continue. These screws, for example, might be under some padding that helps your mouse move over a mousepad."

Depending on the manufacturer and model of the mouse, you may need to move it forward to unlock it from the base first before you can separate them. Don't yank it apart because there may be wires or cables attached inside that you can break. Depending on your mouse configuration, you may be able to see the wheel axel and be able to clean it. Otherwise, if the axel is still inaccessible, remove the next screw that's holding down the plate as well as the screw right next to the scroll wheel. Once you have all the screws removed, the bottom case should be able to be separated from the mouse's innards. Lift the wheel axel and connected parts away from the case then add a little bit of lubricant to the bottom case where the wheel axel lays (they are indented pieces of plastic and consist of 3 sides that have contact with the wheel axel)."

[1] X Research source To apply lubricant to a squeaky mouse wheel without taking it apart, use something like a syringe to be able to direct the lubricant directly to the parts that come in contact with other moving parts or plastic."

What makes the clicking noise is the metal strip hitting the contact on the other end."

[2] X Research source The point here is that by shortening the distance between the flexible metal strip and the contact, the click will not be as loud. You can test out the clicking sound by pressing on the flexible metal strip. If it's still too loud, you can use the hammer to press the contact lower."
