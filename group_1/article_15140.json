    {
      "title": "Saying something nice about the person helps lessen the blow.",
      "content": "Saying something nice about the person helps lessen the blow. Avoid gushing too much about your partner, or else they’ll get a lot of mixed messages. Instead, reference something about one of the dates you went on or make a vague compliment about their personality. [1] X Research source For example, you could start your text, “Hey Adam, I really appreciated you getting me coffee at the cafe last night.” As another example, you could say, “Hi Zack. You seem like a fun and sensitive guy.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Beginning a sentence this way breaks the news more gently.",
      "content": "Beginning a sentence this way breaks the news more gently. Letting him know that you’re genuine shows that you put some thought into the decision so he’s less likely to get upset. Tell him the truth, but don’t say anything harsh that will hurt his feelings. [2] X Research source For example, the next sentence could read, “But to be honest, I’m not interested in a romantic relationship anymore.” As another example, you might say, “To be honest though, I’m just not feeling the spark we used to have.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Being direct with your breakup avoids sending mixed messages.",
      "content": "Being direct with your breakup avoids sending mixed messages. Tell the guy clearly that you want to end the relationship so he doesn’t get confused. Avoid casually hinting at breaking up or sending vague messages leading up to your conversation. Even though that may seem kinder at the moment to avoid saying it, it’s better to be upfront about it. [3] X Research source For example, you could say, “I just don’t think we’re a good match for the long-term.” As another example, you could try, “I haven’t felt a good connection and think it's time to move on.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Mentioning a short reason keeps the person from questioning your decision.",
      "content": "Mentioning a short reason keeps the person from questioning your decision. You can be as specific or vague as you want with your response, but don’t feel like you need to tell him everything. It’s okay to just let him know you weren’t feeling anything without going into more detail. [4] X Research source For example, you could say, “It doesn’t feel like we’re compatible, so this relationship just isn’t working.” As another example, you might say, “I’ve noticed we’ve argued more and more lately, and I don’t want that in a relationship.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on how you’re feeling rather than shifting the blame on your partner.",
      "content": "Focus on how you’re feeling rather than shifting the blame on your partner. Avoid telling the guy about all of his flaws since it’s only going to hurt him more. Instead, focus the message on how you’re feeling and what you want to do. You’re the one breaking up with him, so take responsibility for your feelings. [5] X Research source For example, instead of saying, “You go out and party with your friends too much,” you could say, “I feel left out and alone when I’m not invited out.” As another example, you should say, “I feel like we’re having trouble talking through things,” instead of saying, “You always start arguments.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Some closing sentiments let them know that you appreciated them.",
      "content": "Some closing sentiments let them know that you appreciated them. Even though you’re breaking up, reflect back on the good times you had with your partner. Bring up how they’ve changed you for the better or how they affected your life. This shows that you care about how the other person feels and that they left an impression on your life. [6] X Research source For example, you could say, “I’ll always appreciate how you made me more patient, and I wish you the best moving forward.” As another example, you might say, “Thank you for all the good times we had even though things didn’t work out in the end.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You can still deliver bad news without being mean or harsh to the person.",
      "content": "You can still deliver bad news without being mean or harsh to the person. The guy might have questions about the breakup, so stay polite as you respond. Look at it from their point of view and show that you understand where they’re coming from, but stay firm on your decision. [7] X Research source For example, you might say, “I know that you’re feeling upset and I completely get why, but I have to be honest with my emotions.” As another example, you could write, “I hear you and I understand what you’re saying, but I still think breaking up is the best decision for us.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Only say as much as you need to so you don’t back out of your decision.",
      "content": "Only say as much as you need to so you don’t back out of your decision. Even though you might be feeling a lot, try to keep it short and avoid listing a lot of reasons why you’re dumping him. Keep your text as short and to the point as possible so your message comes across clear. [8] X Research source For example, your text in full might read, “Hi Alex. You’ve been a really fun and supportive guy, but to be honest, I’m not feeling the spark we used to have. I’m noticing that we’re not talking as much anymore, and it’s probably best if we break up. I enjoyed all the good times we had even though it didn’t work out for us. I wish you the best.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let him know it's over so you don't could lead him on.",
      "content": "Let him know it's over so you don't could lead him on. Avoid saying anything that implies you could get back together in the future or be friends, or else the guy might feel like there’s still a chance. After you break up, avoid reaching out and make it clear that you don’t want to see each other again. [9] X Research source If the guy doesn’t leave you alone after the breakup, block his number and his social media accounts so he can’t reach you."

      "title": "It’s disrespectful to cut off your relationship over text if things were serious.",
      "content": "It’s disrespectful to cut off your relationship over text if things were serious. Even though it may feel easier to send a text to end it with your guy, it’s going to be a lot more hurtful later on. Show your boyfriend some respect and that the relationship was important to you by having the discussion face-to-face. [10] X Research source An in-person break-up gives your partner an opportunity to get closure. If you don’t feel safe seeing him in person, at least do it over the phone or on a video call instead of over text. Note: If there was absolutely no genuine intimacy and the two of you didn't really get to know each other, then most people agree that it's okay to have a break up that isn't in person. Reader Poll: We asked 949 wikiHow readers about how they’d prefer to end a very casual or short-term relationship, and 64% agreed that it’s okay to end these types of romantic connections over text or phone.
