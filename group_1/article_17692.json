      "content": "Let your partner know that things are moving a little too quickly. Tell them how much time you need to spend on your own and how long you’d like to be dating before you jump into major decisions. Stay firm on your boundaries, and don’t let your partner talk you into something you don’t want to do.

      "content": "Spend more time alone and less time together. Instead of planning multiple dates in a week, try to hang out with your partner once or twice, then stay home on your own. It’s fine to hang out together, but you should take some time for yourself, too. Spending too much time together too quickly can rush things, and it might blur your own boundaries a bit. [3] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. For instance, you might spend 3 to 4 days on your own and plan 2 date nights every week. Oftentimes, relationships are rushed because you dive into spending every day together. While this might be fun for now, it’s actually not super healthy in the long run."

Try questions like: [4] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. “What’s your dream job?” “What’s your favorite childhood memory?” “Who are you closest to in your family?” “If you could live anywhere, where would it be?”"

      "content": "Invite your partner to the museum or on a picnic. Spend time out in the world together where you can get to know each other more. There’s no set timeline for how often you should go out on dates, but once or twice a week is a good place to start. [5] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. Try to take turns planning dates so both of you get to pick and choose. When people get comfortable with each other, they sometimes fall into a routine of chilling at home or not doing much at all. While this is fine every once in a while, it’s nice to go out with your partner, too."

      "content": "Try not to set your expectations too high. Instead of worrying about or planning for your future, try to be mindful of the present moment, and enjoy spending time with your partner right now.

      "title": "Staying in constant contact can push you to rush things.",
      "content": "Staying in constant contact can push you to rush things. Instead, save most of your communication for when you two are together in person. It’s fine to text them every now and then to see how they’re doing or what their day is like, but save the deep, personal discussions for your next date. That way, you’ll get to have some time alone for yourself, and you’ll also form a deeper and more meaningful bond with your partner. [8] X Research source You can bring this up to your partner by saying, “I love talking to you, but I’d rather do it in person. Is it okay if we limit our texting a little bit?” Try texting only about logistics, like when you’re coming over or what time your partner is picking you up. That way, you aren’t having full conversations via text."

While it’s fun to think about living together, moving to a different city, or getting married, there’s plenty of time for that in the future. Stick to simply dating each other and having a good time for now until you know each other a little better. [9] X Research source If you’ve already made some major life decisions with your partner, that’s okay. Try not to make any more until you’ve slowed the relationship down a little bit and you’re certain about what you want."

If you notice some red flags or issues you don’t think you can fix, it might be time to call it quits. [10] X Research source People often reveal their true colors after a few months of being together. If your partner starts turning into someone you don’t really like, it might be time to go your separate ways. If you can’t talk to each other without arguing, if your partner pushes your boundaries, or if you realize you’re just not compatible, it might not be a good relationship."
