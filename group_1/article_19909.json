      "content": "Fill a sink or bowl with warm water. The size of the container will depend on the garment size. It should be large enough for you to immerse the garment completely. For larger garments, like jeans, use a bathtub or a large, clean bin instead of a sink. This method is gentle and suitable for many types of fabrics (such as cottons or polycottons [1] X Research source , although delicate and dry-clean-only garments will need other treatments."

      "content": "Add a few drops of liquid dish soap or laundry detergent. Some cleaners recommend using Dawn Dish Soap because of its degreasing qualities. [2] X Research source If using laundry detergent, check the bottle’s label to make sure it’s suitable for the fabric you’ll be treating—and bleach-free! Add just enough for the water to become soapy—no need to pour in more than a few drops. If you’re using laundry detergent, wear gloves during this process to prevent skin irritation."

      "content": "Soak the garment in the water for 20-30 minutes. [3] X Research source Set a timer so you don’t forget about your garment! The sticker residue should be completely immersed in the soapy water. Drain or empty the water when time is up."

      "title": "Dab the sticker residue with a dry microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Dab the sticker residue with a dry microfiber cloth. Do so over the empty sink or tub to avoid dripping on the floor. The adhesive should be soft and pliable from the soap bath. Dab at it with the cloth until the residue is no longer visible. You can also gently scrape at the residue with your fingers. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wash the garment as normal.",
      "content": "Wash the garment as normal. Follow the laundering instructions on the garment tag and run your washing machine accordingly. Air-dry the clothing after washing it so you can inspect the dry garment for any remaining residue. Only put the garment in the dryer if the residue is completely gone after washing. Otherwise, the adhesive can harden and become harder to remove. If residue remains, repeat the process or move on to a more abrasive method."

[7] X Research source Otherwise, you risk damaging the fabric and losing your clothes. You can purchase pure acetone or non-oily, clear nail polish removers containing acetone at most drug stores. Acetone produces toxic fumes. Use it in a well-ventilated workspace (feel free to open a window!), and avoid breathing in the fumes while you work on the residue removal. [8] X Research source"

Start by applying a small dab of acetone to an inconspicuous area, such as an inner seam or an armpit. Touch the dab with a cotton swab and see if the color transfers to it. [9] X Research source If not, you’re good to proceed. If the garment is not colorfast, choose a gentler method to maintain the look of your clothes."

Check the fabric type and care instructions on your clothing’s tag before applying any baby or vegetable oil.

Dry-cleaning solvent is meant for garments that are dry-clean only. If the garment is particularly delicate, such as a silk dress, it’s best to let a professional dry cleaning service handle the sticker residue.
