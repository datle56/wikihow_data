      "content": "Recognize the symptoms. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is very common but can be unpleasant and very uncomfortable. UTIs are an infection of your upper urinary tract (kidney and ureters), lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra), or both. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you develop a UTI you will likely feel a burning sensation when you urinate as well as a need to urinate often. You may also feel pain in your lower abdomen. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source"

      "title": "Know the different symptoms for an upper or lower urinary tract infection.",
      "content": "Know the different symptoms for an upper or lower urinary tract infection. There are different symptoms for the various infections. It can be useful to think about your symptoms so you can explain them clearly if you need to go to the doctor. Symptoms of lower UTIs include: needing to urinate more often, cloudy or bloody urine, back pain, very unpleasant smelling urine, and generally feeling unwell. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you have an upper UTI you may experience a high temperature (over 38 degrees C, or 100 Fahrenheit). You may also be nauseous, and shiver uncontrollably. Other symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea.

      "content": "Know when to seek medical treatment. 25-40%of mild UTIs will spontaneously resolve, but that still leaves more than half which could be putting themselves at risk for a complication by not seeking medical care. Make an appointment with your doctor straight away if you are experiencing a UTI, and you develop a high temperature, or your symptoms suddenly get worse. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you are pregnant or diabetic you should contact your doctor immediately. Going to see a doctor will enable you to get a precise diagnosis. What you think is a UTI could be a yeast infection or something else. [7] X Research source Your doctor will likely have you take a urine test to determine if you have a UTI and what bacteria might be causing it. These cultures usually take 48 hours to complete."

      "title": "Take a course of antibiotics.",
      "content": "Take a course of antibiotics. UTIs are bacterial infections, and as such, doctor prescribed antibiotics are the most thorough, most recommended treatment to consider. Antibiotics are particularly recommended for women who suffer frequent UTIs. Longer-term courses of antibiotics can help prevent the infection recurring. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Antibiotics typically prescribed to treat a UTI are nitrofurantoin (branded as Furadantin, Macrobid, or Macrodantin), and sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim (branded as Bactrim, or Septra). However, ciprofloxacin (known as Cipro), fosfomycin (known as Monurol) and levofloxacin (known as Levaquin) are also prescribed. In addition to antibiotics, AZO is an over the counter bladder analgesic that can help."

      "title": "Complete the course of antibiotics.",
      "content": "Complete the course of antibiotics. Take a one- to seven-day course of antibiotics, with your doctor's prescription and advice. Most women are put on a 3-5 day antibiotic. Men might be put on an antibiotic for 7 to 14 days. While symptoms usually clear up around three days after antibiotic treatment, it can take up to five days for all the bacteria in your urinary tract to die off. It may take even longer for men. It is vital that you finish all of the antibiotics that your doctor prescribes unless your doctor tells you otherwise. If you stop taking your antibiotics before the course is over, you’re not allowing the antibiotics to completely kill the bacteria. [9] X Research source If your symptoms continue after you have taken all your antibiotics, or you don’t feel any better after a few days, contact your doctor again. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Be aware of potential complications. There are potentially serious complications from a severe UTI, which could lead to kidney failure or blood poisoning. These are not common, and they usually only affect people with a pre-existing health problem, such as diabetes. If you have a weakened immune system, you are more susceptible to complications and infections. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Pregnant people with UTIs are at risk for life-threatening complications and should always be examined by a physician. Men who have recurrent UTIs are at risk of developing inflammation of the prostate, known as prostatitis. [12] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You may require hospital treatment for a severe upper UTI, or if there are complications.

      "title": "Drink plenty of water.",
      "content": "Drink plenty of water. Antibiotics are the only way to really treat a UTI, but given that they often pass in a few days, there are things you can do to help ease the symptoms and make it less likely for the infection to recur. The most straightforward of these is just to drink plenty of water throughout the day, approximately a glass every hour. [14] X Research source When you urinate your bladder is cleansed, and this can help flush out bacteria. [15] X Research source Do not hold in your urine. Holding in your urine can cause the UTI to get worse, by encouraging the bacteria to breed."

While there is little evidence that cranberry juice can actually fight an infection, it may help prevent one. [16] X Research source If you have recurring UTIs try taking higher-strength cranberry capsules. [17] X Research source As with water, drinking plenty of fluids helps you to flush out and cleanse your system. Do not take cranberry juice if you or your family has a history of kidney infection. You should not take cranberry juice capsules if you are taking blood-thinning medication. [18] X Research source There is no medically specified dose of cranberry juice to take, as its effectiveness is not proven. [19] X Research source One study found positive results for women who took either one tablet of concentrated cranberry juice a day, or drank 8oz of unsweetened cranberry juice three times a day for a year.

      "title": "Take vitamin C supplements.",
      "content": "Take vitamin C supplements. Taking vitamin C supplements when you first start to feel the symptoms of a UTI can help to limit a developing infection. The vitamin C helps to acidify the urine, which discourages the bacteria from colonizing your bladder while strengthening your body’s immune defences. [21] X Research source Try a 500mg dose every hour, but stop if your bowel movements become loose. [22] X Research source You can combine vitamin C supplements with mild anti-inflammatory teas, such as goldenseal, echinacea, and nettle. If the symptoms persist after a few days, go to the doctor regardless."

The two biggest culprits to avoid are coffee and alcohol. Not only are they irritants, but they also dehydrate you which can make it more difficult to flush the bacteria from your urinary tract. [23] X Research source You should also avoid soft drinks that contain citrus juices until after your UTI has cleared. [24] X Research source Restricting caffeine and alcohol in your diet can also be used as a preventative measure against future UTIs if you are susceptible to these infections."

[27] X Research source To help prevent this, the genital and anal areas should be cleaned before and after sexual activity. People with vaginas should especially urinate before and after sexual activity. Avoid body lotions and massage oils as a lubricant unless it says it's safe. These have chemicals that can lead to an infection. Urinating after intercourse empties the bladder and flushes out bacteria. UTIs are not infectious, and you cannot catch one from somebody else.

      "title": "Wear the right clothing.",
      "content": "Wear the right clothing. Certain clothes can make it more difficult to get rid of your UTI. Tight-fitting underwear which is made of non-breathable materials can enable a moist and bacteria-friendly environment to develop adjacent to the bladder. For these reasons, go for cotton underwear, rather than non-absorbent fabrics like nylon. [29] X Research source Avoid tight-fitting pants or shorts. Tight garments can cause sweat and moisture to build up, creating an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. Wearing the right underwear can help prevent infections developing or worsening, but it won’t cure them."
