      "content": "Don't speed. The speed limits on the motorways are 60mph (96km/h) for goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, 60mph (96km/h) for buses and coaches and 70mph (112km/h) for cars. Be aware that although punishments aren't set until you break the 10 percent rule, 1 kph or mph over the speed limit is legally considered speeding and can warrant a law enforcement officer to pull you over. 35 mph (56 kph) in a 30 mph (48 kph) zone is considered high enough to warrant a £100 fine automatically, while 75 mph (121 kph) in a 70 mph (113 kph) zone is not; but this doesn't mean a fine is not possible.

      "content": "Never drink alcohol, or use drugs and drive. The UK has very strict drink and drugs regulations and many police officers pull over cars to carry out drink and drug tests on random drivers. The view of the police and the courts is that alcohol immediately makes you guilty in an accident, even if it was not your fault. Refusing to provide a breath or urine sample when asked to do so is an offence itself, and will result in your arrest.

Do not attempt to stop them as you will be detained or arrested."
