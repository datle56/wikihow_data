      "title": "Know the purpose of a copyright.",
      "content": "Know the purpose of a copyright. The primary purpose of copyright law is to promote the progress of science and useful arts. In order to promote knowledge (scientific or otherwise), copyright laws give you a temporary monopoly on the work you create. This is intended to encourage you to produce even more. Therefore, while copyright law does grant you and other creators protection of your rights to the work you have already produced, the primary purpose is to encourage a continuing expression of new ideas."

      "content": "Recognize the rights associated with a copyright. When you own a copyright to an original work of authorship, you have the exclusive right to distribute, reproduce, perform, license, and display your work, and also to prepare secondary works based on your work. [3] X Research source Your rights to a copyrighted work are limited by the \"fair use\" doctrine, among other things. [4] X Research source That means that other people can use some or all of your original work for various limited purposes including: Criticism; Commentary; News reporting; Teaching (in a non-profit school); Scholarship; and Research. [5] X Research source Your rights are also limited by \"first sale\", meaning you cannot prevent others from reselling copies of your works, once you have sold them. Many software products are therefore not actually \"sold\", but rather \"licensed\" to end-users, often restricting the right of further resale. Your right to prevent distribution of copies or public performances are subject to other limitations, by statute. For instance, you may not use copyright laws to prevent performance of your non-dramatic songs in a church ceremony, or a certain non-profit performances. You cannot use copyright law to prevent someone from making a backup copy of computer software, provided they follow the rules."

      "title": "Understand the time limit associated with a copyright.",
      "content": "Understand the time limit associated with a copyright. When you own a copyright it does not last forever. The length of time your copyright protections last will depend on when your work was created and whether it was published. For purposes of copyright, a writing is considered published when you make it available to the public on an unrestricted basis. [6] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source Works published in the USA prior to 1923 have no US copyright, other than certain sound recordings covered by state laws until 2067. For writings created after 1977, a copyright will last for the life of the author (or last surviving author of a joint work) plus another 70 years. [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source If your writing was a work for hire (meaning a writing specifically commissioned under a written contract or completed as part of an employment agreement) or is published anonymously, the copyright will last either 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation. [8] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source If your work was published after 1922 but before 1978, it will be protected for 95 years from the date of publication, assuming it was published with the required copyright notice and (if prior to 1964) was properly renewed in the Copyright Office in its 28th year. [9] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source However, if the work was created in this period but not published, the copyright will last for the life of the author plus 70 years. [10] X Research source Note that copyright duration in other countries varies, but is generally not less than 50 years from publication or from the death of the author, by treaty. Some may be 95 or 100 years after the authors' deaths. [11] X Research source"

[13] X Research source In order to fix something, you must express it \"in a tangible form that is perceptible by the human senses either directly or with the aid of a machine.\" [14] X Research source Furthermore, it must be permanent or stable enough to allow for it to be \"perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\" [15] X Research source For example, a writing will be fixed when it is printed on paper or when it is stored on a computer. [16] X Research source Examples of works that are not fixed include speeches that are not transcribed and live, unrecorded performances of music. [17] X Research source In general, all you need to do is create a work of authorship and write it down or otherwise record it somewhere. This will automatically create copyright protections. In theory, you do not need to own the original copy in order to own the copyright. For example, if you publicly perform some original music and an audience member records it, you own the copyright of that recording."

Before 1989, you would have been required to provide notice on your written work in order for it to be copyright-protected. [26] X Research source This notice was typically the copyright symbol (\"Â©\") followed by a date of publication and the author's name. [27] X Research source Lack of a proper copyright notice, including intentional misstatement of the publication date, resulted in the immediate loss of copyright. Similarly, failure to file a renewal notice in the proper year, if published prior to 1964, resulted in loss of copyright at the end of that year. This is one reason the \"Happy Birthday\" song became public domain. U.S. law no longer requires copyright notice upon publication. [28] X Research source A written work, whether published or not, is now presumed to be copyrighted unless the author or copyright owner clearly indicates to the contrary. [29] X Research source [30] X Research source Technically, such a work remains copyrighted, by law, but the owner has waived the right to enforce it to varying extent. To indicate that you will not enforce your copyright, you can note on the work that it can be \"freely copied\" or words to that effect. [31] X Research source As noted in the cited reference, such a disclaimer is effectively a license for the public use, whether or not restricted by its terms (e.g., only for non-commercial use)."
