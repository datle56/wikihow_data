      "title": "GameStop may price match with Amazon, Best Buy, & Target.",
      "content": "GameStop may price match with Amazon, Best Buy, & Target. Only new, full-priced items from these competitors will be matched, and only if it’s sold directly by those companies—third-party sellers don’t count. The item must be in stock at a physical GameStop location where you’re requesting the price match. [1] X Research source Each GameStop location has the right to offer or refuse a price match. The decision is up to the store’s manager. You can’t price match items that are on sale, discounted, or available through special offers like rebates, coupons, or bundle deals. In the past, buyers have reported Gamestop matching prices with Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, but not other retailers. Gamestop doesn’t disclose its official price match policy—and even if they did, they could change that policy at any time, without notice. Unfortunately, online purchases made on GameStop.com aren’t eligible for price matching."

      "title": "Find an item at a local GameStop that a competitor sells for less.",
      "content": "Find an item at a local GameStop that a competitor sells for less. The item must be available at a lower price at Amazon, Best Buy, or Target. Other competitors, like Newegg or local stores, aren’t eligible. [2] X Research source Make sure it’s a new item, like a recently-released game, being sold at full price with no sales or special deals applied. [3] X Research source Call your local GameStop to find out of the item you’re looking for is in stock. If not, try a different location or ask if the item will be available in the near future. Avoid asking about price matching over the phone. A manager might be more likely to offer a price match face-to-face, since they’ll know you’re serious about making the purchase."

      "title": "Visit the store and ask to speak with the manager.",
      "content": "Visit the store and ask to speak with the manager. Cashiers, assistant managers, and other employees may not be authorized to offer price matches, or they may be less familiar with Gamestop’s policies. If the manager is unavailable, ask if there is a better time to speak to them, such as another day of the week. [4] X Research source If possible, visit the store on a day when it’s not busy or crowded, such as a weekday or early morning. Managers will be more likely to be available when their store is less busy."

    {
      "title": "Show the manager the competitor’s lower price and ask for a match.",
      "content": "Show the manager the competitor’s lower price and ask for a match. You could say, “I found this game on Amazon for $34.99. I see you have it available for $39.99. Would you be able to match the lower price?” Show them exactly where you found the lower price, such as the Amazon mobile app or the Best Buy website. Be sure to ask politely and respect their decision, whether they offer you the lower price or not. [5] X Research source They may research the competitor’s price to confirm that the information you’re showing them is correct, that it’s the same item they’re selling, and so on. If they seem hesitant, you could add “If you can’t, I completely understand. But I’d love to buy it from you if you’re able to match the price.” If they decline, simply say “I understand. Thank you for your help!” It’s best not to argue or express disappointment. They’re only doing their job, after all. If they agree, express your gratitude by saying something like, “I really appreciate it! Thank you so much!”"

      "title": "Newegg.com will match full-priced items.",
      "content": "Newegg.com will match full-priced items. The “full price” includes the cost of shipping, which makes sense because Newegg is an exclusively online retailer. The item you’re matching must be identical to the one available on Newegg’s website. Only one price match is available per customer—which implies that Newegg won’t offer a price match to the same person more than once. [6] X Research source Price matching isn’t available during Newegg’s major sales events, like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, even for items sold at full price."

    {
      "title": "Best Buy will price match with any online or local competitor.",
      "content": "Best Buy will price match with any online or local competitor. As usual, the item must be new and completely identical to the one sold by the competitor. Sales and special discounts won’t be price matched. Best Buy stores will match with any competitor store within 25 miles (40 km). So, for instance, if your local Best Buy and GameStop are within a short driving distance of each other, you can be sure that Best Buy will match the other’s prices."

    {
      "title": "Walmart stores will usually match prices with Walmart.com.",
      "content": "Walmart stores will usually match prices with Walmart.com. In other words, if you see a game in a Walmart store for $55, but it’s available at Walmart.com for $50, the store’s manager can authorize a price match. Unfortunately, Walmart doesn’t match competitor prices—but at least its prices are usually low to begin with! [7] X Research source Walmart only offers price matching in the mainland U.S. Sadly, this excludes stores in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Only one item per customer, per day, can be priced matched."

      "title": "Target has an incredibly generous price match policy.",
      "content": "Target has an incredibly generous price match policy. Whereas most retailers only price match on items when you buy them, Target will retroactively apply a price match up to 14 days after your original purchase. This applies to both the Target website and their physical stores. So, say, if you buy a new video game at Target.com and later see it for $5 less on a different website, Target will refund you the $5 difference up to two weeks after you bought the game. [8] X Research source Price matching doesn’t apply to items bought with Target gift cards."

      "content": "Join the GameStop PowerUp Pro Rewards program. For $14.99 a year, you’ll receive $5 each month—or $60 a year—to spend on whatever GameStop merchandise you like. You’ll also receive a $10 one-time welcome reward, plus 20 “points” for every $1 you spend at GameStop. Every 1000 points can be redeemed for $1. And coolest of all, you’ll get early access privileges on new consoles, GPUs, and other items. [9] X Research source You can redeem points at any Gamestop store, or on the company’s website. The $14.99 annual fee can be worth it if you frequently shop at GameStop."

      "content": "Trade in your old games, consoles, smartphones, and other devices. Gamestop will let you trade these devices for store credit, or offer you cash. This can save you money and help you offload gaming equipment and other gadgets you don’t use anymore. Newer items, like the most recent iPhone, will get you more money—just be sure you’re ready to part with them for good! [10] X Research source Gamestop also accepts smartwatches, controllers, and headphones."
