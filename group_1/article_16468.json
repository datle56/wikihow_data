[1] X Research source If you feel yourself getting hungry before bedtime, try drinking a glass of water first, or only snacking on something small. Opt for a few apple slices, some cheese cubes, or a banana rather than something more substantial. Some studies have found that eating less at nighttime and more during the day can help with weight loss and general health."
