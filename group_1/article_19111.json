      "content": "Soak up the oil with a paper towel if the stain is still wet. If the stain hasn’t dried yet, blot up as much of the oil as possible before it sets into the suede. Set the suede down on a flat, solid surface, then hold the paper towel firmly against the oil stain. You may be able to take care of most of the oil before it becomes a bigger problem. [1] X Research source For the best results, tackle the stain when it is fresh. Even if a stain sets in, you will have a much easier time cleaning it later."

      "title": "Cover the stain with a large amount of cornstarch for at least 1 hour.",
      "content": "Cover the stain with a large amount of cornstarch for at least 1 hour. Spread enough cornstarch to hide the stain from view. You can’t use too much of it, so don’t hold back. Cornstarch is absorbent and very effective at drawing oil out of fabrics. [2] X Research source If you don’t have cornstarch, you can also use baking soda or talcum powder. [3] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 14 December 2020. At a minimum, leave the cornstarch on the stain for 30 minutes. However, it's best to leave it on overnight to draw out as much oil as possible. [4] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 14 December 2020."

      "content": "Remove the cornstarch with a damp microfiber cloth. Most of the cornstarch will be easy to brush off by hand. To remove the rest safely, moisten the cloth lightly with lukewarm water. Squeeze it to remove any excess moisture. [5] X Research source Excess water is damaging to suede, so be careful. Rinse the suede under lukewarm water, then let the shoe dry in open air away from heat sources."

      "title": "Raise the suede’s nap by scrubbing the stain with a toothbrush.",
      "content": "Raise the suede’s nap by scrubbing the stain with a toothbrush. Start at the top of the stain and work downwards. Sweep the brush along the treated area gently to avoid damaging the suede. Brushing suede removes any remaining parts of the stain and softens the fibers so they look as good as new. [6] X Research source If you have a suede brush, use that instead. It will help remove any of the oil left behind after you removed the powder."

    {
      "title": "Repeat the treatment as needed to finish cleaning the stain.",
      "content": "Repeat the treatment as needed to finish cleaning the stain. For tough oil stains, you may need to apply cornstarch 2 or 3 times. Alternatively, clean the suede with a grease-cutting liquid dish soap or vinegar to remove any remaining traces of oil."

    {
      "title": "Blot the oil stain with a paper towel if it is fresh.",
      "content": "Blot the oil stain with a paper towel if it is fresh. Hold a clean paper towel against the oil for a minute, absorbing as much of it as possible. This will prevent most of the oil from setting into the fabric and turning into a tougher stain. Even if you’re not able to wash the suede right away, try to sop up the oil before it sets in."

      "title": "Cover the stain with a grease-cutting dish soap for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover the stain with a grease-cutting dish soap for 10 minutes. Most liquid dish soaps will help eliminate oil stains, but ones specifically labeled to cut through grease work best. You can’t use too much soap on the stain, but remember that you will have to rinse it all off when you’re done. [7] X Research source Remember that suede isn’t the best fabric to expose to water, so cleaning with soap and water is best for small, pre-treated stains."

      "title": "Scrub the stained area with a suede brush or toothbrush.",
      "content": "Scrub the stained area with a suede brush or toothbrush. Starting at the top of the stain, brush downwards using short, light strokes. Scrubbing works the soap into the stain. A nylon brush and a nail brush, or a few other scrubbing options you can use to work the soap into the stain. [8] X Research source Keep your touch light while scrubbing. Brushing suede too hard may damage it. If you do it right, the fabric will look fresh and soft when you’re done."

      "title": "Use a damp microfiber cloth to wipe off the soap.",
      "content": "Use a damp microfiber cloth to wipe off the soap. Dampen the cloth lightly in lukewarm water. Squeeze out the excess moisture before scrubbing the stain from top to bottom. This will eliminate most, if not all, of the oil. [9] X Research source If you’re willing to risk getting your suede wet, rinse the soap off under running water. Set the item aside in a spot that is out of direct sunlight but has good air circulation until it dries."

      "title": "Treat the suede with more soap if the stain is still present.",
      "content": "Treat the suede with more soap if the stain is still present. If the stain doesn’t come off after the first attempt, repeat all the steps. Continue scrubbing the spot to bring the oil back to the surface. You may need to do this a few times to eliminate older stains. If you’re having trouble getting rid of a tough stain, getting a suede cleaning kit may help. Try scrubbing the spot with a suede specialty cleaner and eraser."

      "content": "Clear the dirt off the suede with a soft-bristled brush. Set the suede on a hard, flat surface. If you have a suede cleaning kit, use the brush included with it. Start at the top of the stain, then work down to the bottom with short, light strokes. Brush off as much dirt and debris as possible so it doesn’t get stuck inside the fabric. [10] X Research source Try using an old toothbrush or nylon scrub brush if you don’t have a suede brush."

      "content": "Scrub the stain with a suede eraser to lift oil out of the fabric Go back over the stain from top to bottom again, this time with the eraser. A suede eraser is a small bar similar to a pencil eraser. Rub the entire stain a few times until the eraser no longer appears to affect it. [11] X Research source Suede erasers, along with specialty suede cleaners, are often included in suede care kits. Order them online or from retailers that sell leather clothing."

      "title": "Spray a suede cleaner onto the oil stain.",
      "content": "Spray a suede cleaner onto the oil stain. Cover the stain with the cleaner. Many cleaners come in a spray bottle, so all you have to do is point the nozzle at the appropriate area. If yours comes in liquid form, put about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of it on a clean microfiber cloth and spread it over the stain. [12] X Research source Another option is household vinegar. Dampen a cloth or paper towel with about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vinegar and dab it onto the stain."

      "title": "Dab the stain with a microfiber cloth and lukewarm water.",
      "content": "Dab the stain with a microfiber cloth and lukewarm water. Squeeze the dampened cloth to remove excess moisture, preventing it from dripping all over the delicate suede. Wipe the stain from top to bottom. The suede won’t get too wet, but the remaining oil may come right off. Rinsing the suede under running water is safe as long as you dry it appropriately. Set it in a safe spot away from direct sunlight or other heat sources."

      "title": "Brush the suede again until it appears soft and clean.",
      "content": "Brush the suede again until it appears soft and clean. Using the suede brush or a similar soft-bristled brush, work from the top of the stain downwards. Keep your strokes short and light to avoid damaging the fabric. Brushing the suede raises its nap, or fur, making it feel soft and look clean again. If you have tried everything and still can’t get the stain out, take it to a professional. [13] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 14 December 2020."
