      "content": "Remember, there's a difference between stupidity and a bad personality. People with difficult personalities can be smart, and people with lower intelligence can be joys to work with. Determine what exactly is leaving you feeling annoyed, and it'll be way easier to deal with your frustration. Stubbornness, bad listening, arrogance, and closed-mindedness are traits that might make up a difficult personality. Someone with low-intelligence may struggle to keep up, or struggle to understand things you try to explain. Still, they might be kind, cheery, and ultimately, well-meaning.

You may realize that in part, you're getting frustrated with others because you have high standards (which is fair enough). Still, you might find that you're happier in others' company when you're able to tweak your standards a bit. Everyone is different, and not everyone is going to be your cup of tea.

When you get upset, remind yourself: They're probably doing their best. On a related note, if someone routinely struggles with a certain thing, try not to expect them to magically improve. Instead, try accepting them and focusing on their positive qualities instead."

Instead of focusing on how that makes things harder for you, try to remember how difficult it must be for them instead. It may be the last thing you want to do when tensions run high, but trust us: this will make you feel better in the long run. Plus, this way, you've taken a bad situation and turned it into a positive outcome. You've become a more compassionate, flexible person (in turn, making you a better friend and employee), which is huge!"

Say that they struggle with public speaking; but maybe, when you think more about it, you remember that they told you how much anxiety they feel in tough social moments.

But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” People have diverse skill sets. Maybe your disorganized coworker is super empathetic and kind. Maybe your friend who doesn't understand your opinion excels in creative arts. There are a lot of good traits people can have without being intelligent: kindness, creativity, dedication, honesty, et cetera. Would you like to be judged only by your lack of skill in one area? If not, you might decide that it's not fair to do to someone else."

It's probably not actually about what's true , but rather, their own personal satisfaction.

Politics, religion, and other high-tension conversations might end up feeling like a landmine. Instead, stick to pleasantries. Ask about the weather, how they're doing, or how their family has been. It might feel so tempting to try to one up them or prove them wrong, but it could strain your emotions and your relationships. Stick to the basics instead."

Or, it may make them realize that nobody will be on their side if they pick a fight with you. Skip rude or condescending behavior and instead, be exceptionally polite . Remember that it's much easier to be kind and polite than to be mean and nasty. Being mean is bad for your spirit and stress levels, and you're doing your own mental well-being a favor by being as nice as much as you can."

If you want to be the dominant person in a conversation, then you have to keep your cool. Sometimes, rude people will try to use your feelings against you in an effort to make you look silly. This is unfair and unkind behavior, but for your own sake, it's best not to give them the opportunity. Take some deep breaths, focus, and try to be patient. If it gets to be too much, excuse yourself to go for a walk. [7] X Research source Remember that an emotional reaction will reward them by giving them attention."

Try going to someone in charge or another person who can help you. Describe what's happening and ask for help. Lay out the objective facts of how this is affecting you and what you've tried on your own. This shows them that you've tried fixing it yourself.

If someone has low intelligence, then what's more likely: that they're trying to upset you or that they don't know what they're doing? Their \"weird\" or \"rude\" behavior may be their clumsy attempt at doing things well. It's important to stay patient and guide them. This doesn't mean you should never correct them. Decide whether it's really important. Let the small things slide, and take time to explain the most important things. Take a moment to imagine how it would feel to be in their shoes: guessing at how to handle things, struggling and hoping for the best, and then getting yelled at when you didn't even know you had done something wrong? That would be awful."
