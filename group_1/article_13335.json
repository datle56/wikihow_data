Koreans value clear, dewy skin, so set up an extensive skin care routine to make sure your skin is hydrated, clear, and free from oils, pimples, or any other blemishes. Start by removing all makeup. Use an oil cleanser to clean your face thoroughly, then exfoliate with a natural scrub. Use a toner or refresher, an ampoule or essence to brighten your skin, and a sheet mask to hydrate your skin. Pat rather than rub eye cream around your eyes, apply a layer of moisturizer, and then add a night cream to help your skin refresh overnight. [1] X Research source"

Then extend your eyeliner on the inside of the eye no more than 3 mm, just below your tear duct. This will widen and flatten your eyes, which is one of the defining features of Korean makeup. Apply teardrop eyeliner underneath your eyes to give them a sparkling look that is very Korean. Popular colors include: gold, white, and cream. A pencil eyeliner is not recommended if you have oily skin. For longer-lasting results, a liquid eyeliner is recommended.

Despite common belief, there is no stereotypical \"Asian eye\"--however, because double eyelids are generally seen as more desirable than monolids, it's become more and more popular to try to get double eyelids. In fact, it's one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries in South Korea. However, you can still achieve the look without surgery. There are many special glues or tapes available to create it. As with all products, be careful when using tapes or glues for extended periods of time. They can damage your eyes and face if used continually, causing sagging eyelids or eye inflammation. It isn't necessary to change your monolids if you have them, though, because many celebrities and many more average people choose to be happy with the way they look naturally. Some examples of monolid celebrities include: soloists Baek Ah Yeon and Boa, and Minah from Girl's Day."

This is probably the most ubiquitous Korean beauty trend. Despite its popularity, it's sometimes considered a bit weird looking to Westerners, so don't be surprised if you get confused glances."
