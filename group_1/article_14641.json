      "content": "Go for a fitted silhouette. Whether you’re wearing jeans and a t-shirt or a button-up and trousers, choosing clothes that fit you just right will help you make the best impression on your date. Your clothes shouldn’t be baggy, but they shouldn’t be skin-tight either. Wear clothes that fall somewhere in between. [7] X Research source A good rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t need a belt to hold up your pants. If you do, they’re probably too baggy. Slim or straight-leg jeans are a classic, flattering fit. Jeans should have a slim fit around your thighs and then taper gently from your knees down. A button-up shirt shouldn’t be so tight that it’s constricting. If it doesn’t stay tucked into your pants when you put your arms behind your head, it’s probably too small. On the other hand, a button-up shirt shouldn’t be loose and billowing. If the shoulder seams are lower than your shoulder bones, the shirt is probably too big."

      "content": "Choose casual shoes, but make sure they’re clean and scuff-free. Gone are the days where you’re expected to always wear oxfords, tasseled loafers, or other dress shoes on a first date. If you’re keeping things casual on your upcoming date, a clean pair of high tops or sneakers is perfectly acceptable. The important thing is that they’re clean and scuff-free—you still want to look put together even though the date is casual. [9] X Research source Wearing dressier shoes, like oxfords or Chelsea boots, works too. They can help balance out your outfit if you don’t want to look too casual (like if you’re taking your date out to dinner)."
