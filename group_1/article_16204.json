      "title": "Darting eyes",
      "content": "Darting eyes This cartoonish expression can be used interchangeably with shifting eyes and is viewed as a sign of nervousness or insecurity. However, the direction that the eye is darting to could give something more specific away. Looking up tends to be correlated with memory and imagination, with the person trying to conjure up a relevant image. Looking from side to side implies the processing of words and emotions. Looking down is essentially synonymous with looking inward and can be used as a respite from the conversation in order to arrive at an appropriate response. [1] X Research source Darting eyes can hint at other negative emotions like suspicion, intent to deceive, and contempt. Contrary to popular belief, darting eyes are not the only clues to help you spot a liar, as lying is thought to involve several different notable changes in body language."

      "title": "Looking someone up and down",
      "content": "Looking someone up and down This indicates one of three things: that you’re attracted to the person you’re looking at, or that you’re using this sweeping gaze as an intimidation tactic, or as a response to one. When paired with dilated pupils and flared nostrils, often used to take in pheromones, looking at another person up and down is a clear sign that you’re interested in them and like what you see. When this visual sweep is met with crossed arms or otherwise closed body language , it could be a sign of trouble between the two parties. [2] X Research source The “triangular” gaze, or looking back and forth between someone’s eyes and mouth, further suggests romantic attraction. Looking away and then back again is yet another clue that the person is interested in being friends… plus perhaps a bit more."

      "title": "Holding a gaze",
      "content": "Holding a gaze Maintaining eye contact is a tried-and-true method of building rapport and a very important aspect of non-verbal communication. People are more likely to think you like them, respect them, and/or value them if you can hold their gaze for at least 60% of your interaction. Eye contact is also a good way of indicating interest, affection, and attraction. Similarly, it points to certain power dynamics, with employees feeling favored by their bosses after exchanging extended eye contact.

      "title": "Wide eyes",
      "content": "Wide eyes A 2017 study determined that the openness of the eye was one of the main indicators of emotion when reading facial cues. A widened eye, in which the whites of the eyes are clearly visible, may reflect feelings of awe, fear, or surprise. Widened eyes lead to better peripheral vision, so it could also be something left over from our hunter-gatherer ancestors, used to suss out our surroundings for signs of danger. [5] X Research source Scientists and body language experts associate wide eyes with positive or neutral emotions, while narrowed eyes can hint at suspicion, contempt, and even disgust."

      "title": "Dilated pupils",
      "content": "Dilated pupils If you’re speaking to someone and their pupils are dilated, that likely means they’re attracted to you! At the very least, there’s something about you they like or find stimulating. As it turns out, pupils dilate when presented with pleasant, attractive, or arousing information, whether that be in the form of a celebrity photo, a cheesy pizza, or a difficult puzzle. Conversely, pupils have been known to dilate due to a range of other overwhelming emotions, including anger. [6] X Research source A 2019 study showed 2 images of the same person to participants: one image with dilated pupils and one with constricted pupils. Then, they asked participants which version looked more pleasant– the ones with dilated pupils won by a landslide. [7] X Research source Constricted pupils, like narrowed eyes, can be used to “zoom in” on a situation, assessing whether it’s safe or not."

      "content": "Eyebrow arching An eyebrow raise, flash, or arch occurs when someone briefly lifts their eyebrows, often in passing as a greeting. Research has discovered that this expression is universal and used in virtually all cultures and parts of the world. Surprise is another reason behind raised eyebrows, such as when receiving good news. The difference between a pleasant greeting and a look of surprise is the duration of the eyebrow raise, with surprise reactions lasting longer. Additionally, raising one’s eyebrows can also be used to underscore a specific statement or emotion, as well as letting someone know you’re listening and engaged during conversation. [8] X Research source A singular raised eyebrow can be considered a sign of surprise, delight, or suspicion, depending on the body language it’s coupled with. A single raised brow met with open body language and smiling is a good indicator of positive interaction, while a raised brow with closed body language is sure to spell trouble."

      "title": "Winking",
      "content": "Winking This popular expression is mainly used to flirt, conveying feelings of attraction, interest, and cheekiness. Moreover, winking can also be used as a means to take a break from intense eye contact with someone you find enticing, offering a moment of relief. Almost always guaranteed to elicit a smile, winking can serve as a playful reminder of an inside joke, too, or as a sassy way to suggest keeping a secret among friends. [9] X Research source A 2009 college campus study showed that winking was associated with flirtation, gratitude, and general friendliness."

      "title": "Extended blinking",
      "content": "Extended blinking Fast, extended eye blinking tends to take place between two people who are romantically linked, or want to be. Synonymous with “batting the eyelashes,” extended blinking might be accompanied by a lowered head tilt and a seductive smile. On the other hand, this kind of blinking might simply be buying a person time when they don’t know what to say or are under pressure, like at a business meeting or school presentation. [10] X Research source Eye-batting may be used as a flirtation tactic to make one's face appear more feminine, angelic, and baby-like."

      "title": "Touching eyes",
      "content": "Touching eyes Touching or rubbing the eyes or eyelids typically implies that someone is tired, stressed, and may need a break from the conversation. Touching the face is not always a bad thing, however, and hand-to-cheek contact indicates that someone is listening, engaged, and patiently waiting for their turn to speak."

    {
      "title": "Averted eyes",
      "content": "Averted eyes Averting your gaze functions similarly to closing your eyes, allowing a second to process information before having to react. Looking away can also be perceived as shyness after maintaining someone’s gaze for a while. Additionally, averting your eyes to look down may be a sign of weakness, especially when in a position of power, like giving a speech. [11] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Studies show that people on the witness stand who gave their testimony while looking down were viewed as less credible."

      "title": "Looking down at your watch",
      "content": "Looking down at your watch This cue could mean you’re feeling impatient and uninterested and is generally considered a negative sign. In the middle of a conversation, especially an important one, noticing the other person looking down at their watch suggests that they’re disengaged. It could simply mean that they’re checking the time because they have somewhere else to be, and it means no offense to the other person."

    {
      "title": "Squinting eyes",
      "content": "Squinting eyes Squinted eyes are often a sign of suspicion. When someone doesn’t believe something to be true or is questioning another person’s motives, they may squint their eyes in conversation with them, tightening their eye muscles. Moreover, it can mean someone is trying to process information, and it can happen pretty quickly (i.e., for a fraction of a second). Understanding why someone is squinting is a good way to prevent further miscommunication and conflict, as squinting alerts us that we should clarify our intent and/or apologize for any misunderstanding. Squinting can also aid in seeing if the person in question has vision issues."

      "title": "Angry stare",
      "content": "Angry stare This type of stare is often coupled with closed body language, like crossed arms and legs, along with clenched muscles in the face and hands. A clenched jaw, intense eye contact, furrowed brows, and reddened skin are facial signs of anger. You might notice these signs when someone is unable to express anger through gestures or words. When someone’s expressions of anger are limited to their facial expressions, they may be mildly annoyed or trying to contain their emotions. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Eye-twitching Eye-twitching is another common eye reaction to stress. It can also occur as a result of other eye conditions, like blepharitis, light sensitivity, or fatigue. If someone’s eye is twitching during a conversation, they might be stressed or overwhelmed by the information being given to them. Additionally, eye-twitching could be a side effect of certain medications or a sign that there’s an underlying nervous system disorder.

      "content": "Glazed eyes Glazed eyes give that “far off” look that one can get when lost deep in thought, which can signal that you’re bored and checked out of the conversation. After all— your mind is elsewhere! If the other person’s eyes appear glazed over during a first date, perhaps there won’t be a second one. Glazed eyes can come as a result of crying or fatigue, too, especially when paired with puffiness and redness."

      "title": "Eye rolling",
      "content": "Eye rolling Eye-rolling constitutes moving the eyes in a backward motion, typically conveying annoyance, sarcasm, and reluctance to communicate. It’s a non-verbal way to say, “Yeah, right,” or, “Whatever!” Often, the gesture is not meant to be seen by the offending party and is either an involuntary private reaction or some kind of inside joke between the eye-roller and a third party. [14] X Research source This gesture is only appropriate when used among friends, not in a business setting, as it has very negative and disrespectful connotations."

      "content": "Make note of how fast a person blinks. The key to deciphering other peoples’ eye movements is to be able to identify that they’re different from what they normally do. A particularly fast set of blinks might be an indicator that something is troubling them, especially if they tend to blink less quickly on average. When we are faced with an issue, our eyes reflect it, either by closing and remaining closed for a few moments or by blinking rapidly, allowing us a moment to process and take it all in.

      "content": "Look at where their eyes move. If you’re having a conversation with someone who is usually even-keeled and easygoing, and you suddenly notice their eyes darting all over the place, it could be an indicator of stress. It’s instinctual to want to look for an exit if one suddenly finds themselves in an unpleasant or uncomfortable situation, subconsciously or otherwise. So, if the person you’re talking to begins moving their eyes frantically in different directions when you know that they’re normally able to calmly hold your gaze, it may be a sign that something has gone awry in the conversation."

      "content": "Watch how they arch their brows. Eyebrows are some of the most expressive and revelatory parts of our face, accounting for all sorts of emotions, ranging from surprise to suspicion. According to experts, the eyebrows are more honest and authentic to our truest emotions, whereas the lower half of the face is in charge of more polite gestures, like smiling. Even if a person is trying to appear pleasant with their smile, note their eyebrows and see if there’s any change in shape. A high arch could point to shock, while a low-set brow could be to try to assert dominance, and a furrowed brow is typically a sign of disapproval. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Broken eye contact and darting eyes may indicate lying.",
      "content": "Broken eye contact and darting eyes may indicate lying. Some eye signals, like averted or darting eyes, are key giveaways that someone is lying. Looking from side to side can buy someone enough time to try to think of what to say next— very valuable when it comes to fabricating a potential lie. Breaking eye contact is thought to be another way to identify a deceitful person, as the shifting of eyes hints that someone is trying to process information in order to react appropriately. However, eye signals are best read and understood when coupled with other physical cues to paint a more accurate and comprehensive picture. [17] X Research source When trying to figure out if someone is lying, you should take into account the following factors: facial expressions, shifts in bodily movements, tone of voice, and the content of what they’re saying. Liars tend to use their hands after they’re done speaking, as the brain is too busy fabricating a story to do both at the same time. A high-pitched voice is often a result of nerves and, therefore, hints that someone is lying. Experts have not agreed upon a universal method of identifying a liar, causing some conflict in the scientific community as some people believe that the bodily cues we see are still filtered via our own subjective and unique lens of perception.

      "content": "Seduce someone with open body language. Using the body language of eyes for this purpose can sometimes be linked to the Marilyn Monroe effect. This technique is defined by having open body language, making eye contact with people, and tossing them a smile here and there. Research shows that it may take up to 5 glances at someone for them to realize you’re interested, so don’t give up too soon! [19] X Research source Dating expert John Keegan warns against overthinking when it comes to body language. He says, “Overanalyzing yourself can make you very self-conscious, like, ‘Am I standing right? Is this the right way to be? Is this attractive?’— Those things can actually put you in your head and make you feel wooden and unnatural.” Keegan also lists some less attractive displays of body language so you can avoid them. These include invading personal space and being hunched over."

Studies show that people tend to be more convinced by the way you present your argument and how you appear while doing it, than the argument itself. Non-verbal cues, like eye signaling, are crucial to really bring your point home. Maintaining eye contact is one way to assert dominance, especially when coupled with other signals of confidence, such as taking up as much space as possible and improving your posture. [20] X Research source When trying to gain someone’s trust, maintaining appropriate eye contact is still a good idea, but try coupling this with a tilt of the head and open body language."

      "content": "Note that eye contact practices vary across cultures. When attempting to analyze the behavioral cues of others, it’s important to understand that eye signals carry different meanings across cultures. For example, maintaining eye contact is considered a sign of confidence and decisiveness in America. The same is not true in some Asian cultures, as they consider eye contact to be disrespectful, especially if the person being stared at is an elder or an authority figure. [22] X Research source In the Middle East, eye contact between two people of the same gender is held longer and considered more appropriate than prolonged eye contact between opposite genders. In a Western context, lowered eyebrows may be perceived as dominant. In countries like Thailand, raised eyebrows are considered a dominant expression. Understanding the cultural significance of a certain facial expression or movement is critical in deciphering its meaning. It’s also important to note that body language can fulfill several different roles, like repetition to reinforce your message, and complimenting, which adds visual cues to your verbal communication."
