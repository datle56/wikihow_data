      "content": "Slice the avocado in half to expose the seed. Use a sharp chef’s knife to cut the avocado lengthwise until it hits the seed. Keep the knife steady and rotate the avocado, and continue slicing around the seed. [1] X Research source When you have sliced the avocado in half, gently hold each half and twist it to pull them apart."

      "title": "Use a chef's knife to remove the seed if you will be grinding it.",
      "content": "Use a chef's knife to remove the seed if you will be grinding it. Carefully strike the center of the seed with the heel of the chef’s knife. Twist the knife slightly, and then carefully draw both the knife and seed out from the fruit. [2] X Research source Protect your hand with a dish towel as you cut out the seed, in case your knife slips. A chef's knife is safer to use than a kitchen knife in this instance, as it is less likely to slip."

      "title": "Scoop the seed out with a spoon if you want to preserve it.",
      "content": "Scoop the seed out with a spoon if you want to preserve it. Push the spoon around the outside of the seed. Then scoop the seed away from the fruit. [3] X Research source This way of removing the seed may not give a removal as clean as using a knife, as some of the fruit might be removed too. However, it is less risky for your fingers. If you are planning to use the seed to make a carving, definitely use a spoon to remove it as this will keep the seed intact."

    {
      "title": "Wash the avocado seed in cool water.",
      "content": "Wash the avocado seed in cool water. Hold the seed under cool running water. Use your fingers to rub away any fruit that is stuck to the seed. [4] X Research source If there are any stubborn pieces of fruit that are difficult to remove with your hands, use a damp paper towel to rub them off. Don’t use any soap or detergent to wash the avocado seed, as only water is necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the avocado seed in the sun for 3 days to dry it.",
      "content": "Place the avocado seed in the sun for 3 days to dry it. Put the seed on a plate or in a bowl, and choose a sunny spot in your home to let it dry. A windowsill that gets a lot of sun works well. [5] X Research source Avoid leaving the seed in the sun for 5 or more days. This will make the seed too hard and it will be difficult to use. You can tell when the seed is dry because the seed coat will be papery and will start to flake away."

    {
      "title": "Dry the avocado seed using an oven to quicken the drying time.",
      "content": "Dry the avocado seed using an oven to quicken the drying time. Place the avocado seed on an oven proof tray. Bake the seed in the oven at 200 °F (93 °C) for 2 hours. [6] X Research source The avocado seed will be very hot when you remove it. Make sure to use oven mitts when taking it out to avoid burning yourself. The seed may form small cracks if it is left in the oven for too long. [7] X Research source You will know when the seed is dry because the seed coat will begin to peel away."

    {
      "title": "Remove the papery seed coat.",
      "content": "Remove the papery seed coat. When the avocado seed is dry, the outer layer will become papery, thin, and flakey. Peel the seed coat off with your fingers to access the shiny seed. [8] X Research source The seed coat is almost impossible to remove before the seed has dried, which is why waiting until after drying is necessary."

      "title": "Store the seed in a dark spot until you are ready to use it.",
      "content": "Store the seed in a dark spot until you are ready to use it. The avocado seed will store best in a sealed container that is placed in a cool, dark spot in your home. A pantry or cupboard works best. [9] X Research source A glass jar is ideal. This will prevent the seed from germinating under the right conditions, or from drying out too much."
