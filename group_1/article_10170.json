[2] X Research source Identifying the behavior will help you create a plan of action. Once you identify the specific behavior, think about how you feel when this happens.

      "content": "Recognize the difference between flirting and sexual harassment. There is a fine line, but flirting and sexual harassment are different. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission defines sexual harassment as \"unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature\" that negatively impacts your work environment or your work performance. Sexual harassment is illegal. If you are a victim of sexual harassment, immediately report your coworker in accordance with the policies at your workplace. Human Resources is always a good place to start."

      "content": "Examine how your coworker treats others. If you are not sure that your coworker is flirting with you, pay attention to their interactions with other people in your office. Are they touchy with others in the office? Do they make comments on everyone's appearance? Observing can also help you understand your coworker's intention. Your coworker may be very friendly or actually flirting with you. Even if this flirtatious behavior appears to be normal for your coworker, still speak up if you are feeling uncomfortable. Work should be a safe place where you are comfortable and able to focus on doing your job. Just because other people accept the coworker's behavior does not mean that you have to."

      "title": "Address your coworker as soon as it happens.",
      "content": "Address your coworker as soon as it happens. Instead of asking to speak to your coworker after the flirting has happened, handle it right in the moment. When a coworker flirts and you do not say anything, your coworker thinks this behavior is perfectly fine. It is also easier to correct a situation as soon it happens instead of trying to start a random conversation. [6] X Research source For example, if your coworker comments about how great you look that day, say \"I feel uncomfortable when you comment about how I look. Could you keep those thoughts to yourself from now on?\" or \"Thanks for the compliment, but it really makes me uncomfortable when you say things like that.\" If your coworker makes physical contact with you, say \"Hey, could you keep your hands to yourself. It makes me uncomfortable,\" or \"Not to be rude, but I need a little more personal space.\" If you are not comfortable addressing your coworker immediately, you can also speak to them once you get your thoughts together. If your coworker is receptive, thank them for being understanding and let them know that you want to continue to have a good professional relationship. There is no need to bring up the situation again."

      "content": "Do not flirt back. Flirting back may seem like a good way to ease the tension, but it will only make matters worse. End the flirtation with your actions. If the worker makes a comment or inappropriate joke, do not laugh it off. Change the subject to something work-related. If your coworker touches you or gets too close to you, move away and create space before you talk to them. You may have to take action several times before your coworker starts to get the point."

If you are invited, ask another coworker to go with you. If the flirty coworker wants to meet during lunchtime, suggest another time to meet. If a one-on-one meeting is necessary, leave the door open or make sure other people are in the area."

[8] X Research source If your coworker asks you something about your personal life, say \"I try not to discuss my personal life at work. But I would like to hear more about (some work-related issue).\" Be sure to move the conversation to something about work.
