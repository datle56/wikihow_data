      "content": "Learn your muscles' names. Do you know where your Gluteus Maximus is? Probably! What about your Iliopsoas or your Semitendinosus? These muscles are important to your needle! [3] X Research source You have to overextend your back, torso and leg muscles to do a needle. Learning the muscles' names and how they work within your body will make stretching for this position easier. Tighter muscles are typical around the back and torso. These areas will need extra stretching."

      "title": "Identify problem muscles.",
      "content": "Identify problem muscles. Muscles have a long memory. If you have injured a muscle, it might be tighter than the rest. Give it extra love and attention, and extra stretching to prevent future harm. Muscle tears can occur. If they do, they can reduce your motor skills, as well as create scar tissue. Be careful!

      "content": "Warm up your muscles before stretching. Do jumping jacks, brisk walking or jogging to warm up your muscles. Don't stretch with cold muscles. Working on a needle with cold muscles can hurt your posture and form, which may result in injury. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stretching prepares your body for the needle posture. Also, stretching triggers your muscle memory and believe it or not, can remember what to do! [7] X Research source [8] X Research source Remember, stretching is not itself a warm-up. Start with major muscle groups. Shoulders, torso, glutes, thighs, and back."

      "content": "Perfect the splits for both legs. It can take time to perfect the splits while on the floor. It can take even longer to do it with both legs! But, it's important to the needle posture, so don't rush this step. Most people have one leg that is more flexible than the other. But, stretch both legs equally. Your more flexible leg might end up being your supporting leg. If so, this is another reason to stretch both legs equally. Alternately point and flex your front leg's foot while in the splits. Keep your back leg's knee rolled towards the ground, not twisted to the side. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Hyperextend splits for both legs.",
      "content": "Hyperextend splits for both legs. Once you're comfortable with the splits on the floor, you need to move onto to gently hyper-extending your splits. Place your front leg ankle and heel on a few inches of gymnastic mat, rolled up yoga mat, yoga block, or even a rolled up towel, and descend into the split position. Gradually increase the height of the mat, block or rolled towel until you have flexibility and no discomfort while hyperextended."

      "content": "Lay back with hands overhead while in hyperextended splits. This motion results in the posture that you'll have in the needle while standing up, except here you are supported by the ground. Check in with your body and see if how it feels to move into this position slowly, and don't forget to be patient if you encounter tightness in your muscles. Continue leaning backwards until you can do so without discomfort. Remember that this is the posture you must acquire to do a needle."

Do not transform a scorpion into a needle as the way to get into the needle position. Though it may be easier for stretching, moving from a scorpion into a needle will twist and tweak your posture and balance, making injury more likely. Going from a scorpion into a needle also takes longer and shifts your balance. This is not good when you're up in the air!"

Wearing different shoes, including shoes other than your cheerleading shoes, changes the placement of your toes, the ball of your foot and heel, which mimics the movement of your foot while it's in the hands of your bases.
