      "content": "Wrap cotton yarn or string around the bottle where you want the cut. If you don’t have 100% cotton yarn available, use any thick cotton string. [1] X Research source At the location of where you would like the bottle to break, wrap a piece of yarn around the bottle 3–5 times (keeping all of your wraps close together). Tie the ends together and cut off any excess string. [2] X Research source Alternatively, wrap a thin piece of metal wire around the bottle 3–5 times (more on how this works in the next steps)."

      "content": "Soak the yarn in acetone or rubbing alcohol. Slide the yarn off the end of the bottle and place it in a small dish or lid. Pour a bit of nail polish remover or straight-up acetone over the yarn until it’s completely soaked. [3] X Research source You can pour the excess acetone back into the bottle afterwards. Some people opt for lighter fluid if they don’t have acetone, nail polish remover, or rubbing alcohol on hand. However, lighter fluid is more potent and volatile, making it more dangerous."

      "title": "Light the yarn on fire.",
      "content": "Light the yarn on fire. Use a lighter or match to catch the yarn on the bottle on fire. Rotate the bottle slowly so that the yarn burns consistently around the entire bottle. [5] X Research source If you’re using wire instead of yarn, hold the bottle with a candle or lighter underneath the wire. Rotate the bottle continuously so the entire wire starts to heat up around the glass. Wipe your hands clean of any possible acetone or rubbing alcohol before using fire!"

      "title": "Dunk the bottle in cold water.",
      "content": "Dunk the bottle in cold water. Fill your sink or a pot with cold water (add ice to make it even colder). Wait until the fire on the yarn has burnt out, then stick the end of the bottle with the yarn directly into the cold water. The bottle should break cleanly off where the yarn was wrapped around it. [6] X Research source The abrupt change in temperature along the yarn line will cause the glass to shatter. If the glass doesn’t break the first time, add new acetone- or alcohol-soaked yarn to the bottle, burn it again, and re-dunk the bottle in even icier water to widen the temperature difference."

      "title": "Sand the edges smooth with medium-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Sand the edges smooth with medium-grit sandpaper. Sanding the edges makes your new glass craft safer to handle and improves the appearance of rough, jagged edges. [7] X Research source Start with a rough- or medium-grit sandpaper (100- to 150-grit) to smooth down the jagged edges on the broken sections of the bottle. When you have removed all the sharpest edges, switch to a fine-grit sandpaper (about 220-grit or higher) to give the bottle a smooth, soft finish. You’re done! What can you use cut glass bottles for? Sustainability Expert Natalie Kay explains how glass bottles are great for organization. “I use old glass bottles and jars for organization. I have them in our bathroom to organize lipsticks, hair ties, and more. In my office, I'm able to manage all my supplies easily.”"

      "title": "Score the bottle with a glass cutter or glass drill bit.",
      "content": "Score the bottle with a glass cutter or glass drill bit. You need to create a tension line for the bottle to crack along, and you do this by scoring a clean line at the desired breaking point. Drag a glass cutter or a glass drill bit around the bottle to create a single, even line wrapping around the glass. Don’t overlap score lines, as this will make your cut more jagged than a single line. Alternatively, hold the glass cutter steady and rotate the bottle with your other hand. [8] X Research source For a perfectly straight line, use a support system so that you get a perfect line around the bottle. For example, you could place the base of the bottle inside a roll of packing tape and score along the top edge to make a perfect circle. [9] X Research source Alternatively, purchase a specialty glass bottle cutter to stabilize the bottle and make a perfect score all the way around. Lay your bottle in the supports on the cutting board and set the cutter to the precise spot along the bottle where you want to cut. Then, rotate the bottle toward you (applying gentle but firm pressure) until you see a consistent score line all the way around. Some bottle cutters stand the bottle upright, while others hold it horizontally."

      "title": "Heat the score line on the bottle with a small flame or hot water.",
      "content": "Heat the score line on the bottle with a small flame or hot water. Heat the line that you made with the glass cutter to further weaken the glass. You’ve got 2 options depending on what materials you have available: Using a flame: Use a small candle or a small butane torch. Focus the heat directly along the score line, and constantly rotate the bottle to get even coverage. Using hot water: Heat water in a pot or kettle until it’s nearly boiling. Hold the bottle over the sink and slowly pour the hot water over the score line. Avoid pouring it in a wide area, as you want only the score line to be placed under tension from the heat. [10] X Research source Hot water is less precise than a small flame and may heat too much of the glass. If this happens, the bottle is more likely to shatter when you plunge it into cold water."

      "content": "Repeat the heating and cooling process until the glass splits. The bottle might require more stress than a single round of heating and cooling in order to break. Simply repeat the process of heating the bottle and dipping it in cold water until it snaps. For most bottles, 2 to 3 rounds of heating and cooling will get the job done. If you’re using hot water, keep a tea kettle or pot simmering while you chill the bottle so you have a constant supply of hot water."

      "content": "Mark off your cut line with 2 strips of masking tape. The Dremel will be doing all the cutting in this method, but you need to know where to cut. Use two strips of masking tape placed very close together (but not touching!) to form a thin line around the bottle where you want to cut. [13] X Research source Alternatively, place one strip of tape around the bottle and cut immediately above or below it as a guide."

Work your way around the bottle using the Dremel , slowly cutting the glass along the taped line. On your first pass, just aim to make a consistent score line all the way around. [14] X Research source Then, go over the line again to make a deeper cut all the way through the glass in one spot. Once you’ve made a hole, keep cutting on the sides of the hole until the entire bottle splits along the score line. [15] X Research source You may have to go over the same section multiple times in order to get a clean cut. Warning: Glass dust is very dangerous to your respiratory system. Wear a face mask to cover your mouth and nose to avoid inhaling glass particles, as well as goggles to protect your eyes. Splash the cut line with water occasionally to prevent glass dust and particles from flying (and to keep the glass from overheating while you saw it). [16] X Research source"

If you have one and feel comfortable using it, a wet tile saw is the fastest and most precise way to cut a bottle. Start by cleaning your bottle and removing any labels, then place it on the saw table and line up the cutting track with the exact point you want to cut. [18] X Research source Warning: Wear work gloves and goggles to protect your hand and eyes from the saw blade or potential glass shards or particles. If you’ve never used a wet tile saw before, it’s probably best to try another bottle cutting method. These tools are dangerous and take practice to use safely."

Each saw may be slightly different, but the guide is generally a piece of equipment that sits on the side of the saw table so you can hold whatever you’re cutting against it to make sure the cut stays lined up. Attach or adjust your guide so it’s flush with the bottom of your glass bottle. Then, when you begin to saw, keep the bottom of the bottle pressed against the guard. [19] X Research source"

Make sure there is a constant stream of water hitting the spot where the glass meets the blade. [20] X Research source This keeps the saw and bottle from overheating and also dampens glass particles and dust that can pose a breathing hazard. You may be able to saw through the bottle in one go without adjusting it. Some people prefer to rotate the bottle once they cut halfway through it for a cleaner cut. [21] X Research source Once the bottle splits, quickly and carefully remove the pieces from the saw table and power down the saw immediately. Do not pour your glass-dust-infused water down the drain when you’re done. Wait for the water to evaporate and then throw the glass particles in the trash, or dump the glass water into a small dewatering bag to separate the water and glass."

      "content": "Use a flat lapidary wheel to smooth and polish the edges. You can certainly use regular sandpaper to smooth the glass edges, but for a faster and more professional-looking finish (if you plan to sell you work, for example), David Royce of Bicycle Glass Co. recommends a flat lapidary wheel : “The wheel spins, then you hold up the glass [to polish it]. Depending on how smooth you want to go, you can do a rough buff or a more polished edge. It’s just a method of going up grit sizes. An 80-grit is very rough and large, while a 600- or 1,200-grit is very fine.” For the final polish, Royce recommends “a felt wheel and cerium oxide. Once it’s done, all the scratches from the previous steps are out.” He also cautions that “None of this should be done without proper safety gear. Glass could crack and break. If you’re working with your hands, you can easily lacerate or cut yourself.”"

      "content": "Use a diamond core drill to make an initial hole to grind out from. First, use a diamond core drill bit to drill a hole into the glass where you want your design to begin. Then, insert a diamond cylinder bur drill bit into the hole and grind outward into the shape you want to make. [22] X Research source Try to complete your shape in one line, since starting and stopping can make the glass more likely to break. If you can, place the bottle in a snug V-shaped support or very gently clamp it to a work table to hold it in place while you work. The thinner the glass, the easier it will be to cut through it this way."

      "title": "Or, score a shape in the glass and pop it out with a glass tapper.",
      "content": "Or, score a shape in the glass and pop it out with a glass tapper. Royce recommends “creating a score line to break the surface tension [of the glass] and then tapping away the unwanted areas” to create shapes in your glass bottle. Start by using a glass cutter or glass drill bit to score your design. You can freehand it, or use washable marker and masking tape to mark your outline. Royce mentions they make tools for certain shapes, like circle cutters for glass that make perfect circles. Once you’ve scored your design outline, insert a glass tapper tool inside the bottle (it looks like a small metal ball or ring at the end of a stick). Gently tap the scored section of glass with the weighted end of the tapper until the shape pops out along the score lines. Some glass cutters have a tapper ball at the other end of the handle."
