      "title": "Pay attention to which parts of your dog's body are itchy.",
      "content": "Pay attention to which parts of your dog's body are itchy. Is there a certain area on the body that is itchier than others? Does your pet lick his feet, under his tail or along his belly? Discovering the underlying condition to the itchiness is what will give you the best treatment for the issue. The most common areas of irritation for allergic dogs are around the back and tail, the abdomen, and the legs and paws."

      "content": "Look for hot spots on your dog’s skin. It can be common that your dog’s itching is so severe that he chews his skin to the point of creating a “hot spot”. This skin lesion can develop overnight and can get very large very quickly. The skin is pink, moist, hot and painful. You may even see sticky material oozing from the wound created. These are infected open wounds and need veterinary intervention to give your pet relief. Chronic cases of itching might result in the thickening and roughening of the skin so that it looks like elephant hide. Hot spots are often the symptom of allergies to fleas, foods, grass, mold or other environmental substances. There may be more complicated underlying conditions such as low thyroid (hypothyroidism) levels or Cushing’s disease (hyperadrenocorticism). Secondary bacterial and yeast (malassezia) infections are not uncommon and will require specially tailored treatment. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider the timing. There might be a particular time of year that your dog is itchier. Perhaps he is itchy after being on the lawn or after eating a certain food. By noticing patterns, you will help to narrow the focus of your pet’s treatment to help with the itching. [2] X Research source Dogs are usually itchy due to an underlying allergy. If you find that their itching is only seasonal, meaning they're only itchy during certain seasons of the year, then that fits within environmental allergy. However, if your dog is itchy all year round, then that means it could be food or environmental allergies."

      "content": "Check on your dog’s overall health. If your dog has a really strong body odor, seems excessively thirsty or does not seem as lively as usual, you should take your pet to the veterinarian. Your veterinarian will need to do blood tests and evaluate swabs from the skin surface to get more information to help define appropriate treatment."

      "content": "Take notes when you notice the itching. Whenever you notice your dog itching, write down the circumstances, including where your dog has been, what he’s been eating and what part of his body is itchy. This will be extremely useful for your veterinarian, who will rely on this information to narrow down the possible causes for your pet’s itching and skin lesions."

      "title": "Check for fleas.",
      "content": "Check for fleas . The most common cause of itchy skin is fleas. They are most active in warm, humid weather (35°C or 95°F). You may see the fleas on your dog, or you may just notice your dog biting or scratching their skin. Fleas are very quick and can jump very high, so you will need to be fast to spot them. Fleas are most likely to be found in the armpit and groin area and are dark (almost black) with flat bodies. [3] X Research source Check your dog's ears for signs of scratching, redness, blood, or dirt. See if their belly, groin, or the base of their tail has red bumps. One way to check for fleas is to stand your dog over a white surface, such as paper towels or pieces of paper, then comb their coat. Flea feces will fall out when you comb the dog and it will be more visible on the white paper."

      "content": "Check for sarcoptic mange. Sarcoptic mange ( Sarcoptes scabiei ) is a parasitic mite infestation. Mites will usually live in areas of the skin that do not have hair such as the ear flaps, elbows or stomach. The dog may have red, scaly skin in these areas. [4] X Research source Sarcoptic mange can cause significant skin lesions and distress for the dog because the mite causes severe itching. [5] X Research source Sarcoptic mange is contagious and can be transmitted to people and other dogs very easily. Your veterinarian can diagnose sarcoptic mange by collecting skin scrapings from your dog."

      "content": "Check for cheyletiellosis, or walking dandruff. This is caused by the Cheyletiella mite that feeds on the top layer of skin. In addition to excessive scratching, the dog may have scaling on the skin, hair loss, dandruff, lesions on their back. [6] X Research source It is sometimes called \"walking dandruff\" because the mite pushes up scales of skin as it travels, making it appear as though the scales are moving. You might be able to see the mite, which is yellow."

      "content": "Check for lice. Dog lice is different from human lice, so don't worry about infecting each other. Lice survive on either your dog's skin debris or their blood, depending on the species. You should be able to spot adult lice on your dog — they are yellow or tan and about the size of a sesame seed. They can sometimes be mistaken for dandruff, but will not fall off the dog if you shake the hair.

      "content": "Check for demodectic mange. Demodectic (red mange) is caused by small mites found naturally on most dogs. These mites do not generally cause skin problems unless the dog’s immune system is compromised. Demodex is most commonly seen in puppies, because their immune systems are still developing. This mange is most noticeable around the eyes and mouth. It can be diagnosed by your veterinarian collecting skin scrapings from your dog. [8] X Research source Demodectic mange is not very contagious and people cannot contract it. It is generally passed on to nursing puppies by the mother. [9] X Research source A predisposition for this skin problem may be inherited. It is not uncommon for the puppies to have Demodex if their parents also had Demodex at some point in their lives.

It causes itching, small circular scabbing (about a centimeter in diameter), and hair loss (alopecia) in one or more areas on your pet. This typically starts on the face or paws. Ringworm is contagious and easily transmittable to humans (a zoonotic disease) and other pets. Your veterinarian will be able to diagnose ringworm and advise you on the treatment protocol, which will require a fungicide. Some pets with minor infections can be treated topically, whereas other animals will need oral anti-fungal medication. Treatment of ringworm will also include disinfecting your home. It may take months to control. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand what should not be causing itchiness. Your dog may have a condition that resembles a parasite or other condition that might mislead you in determining the cause of his itchiness. Alopecia and Cushing’s disease are two possible conditions. Alopecia, or hair loss, can be brought on by low thyroid (hypothyroid) conditions and is not typically itchy. Low-thyroid dogs tend to have more skin issues than normal-thyroid dogs. [12] X Research source Dogs with Cushing’s disease will drink a lot of water and want to eat all the time. You may notice that the dog’s fur is thinner and has less undercoat. The dog’s belly may even be nearly bald and the skin looks thinner too."

Due to the variety of possible causes of this serious skin problem, there is a range of possible treatments that could be prescribed by your veterinarian. [13] X Research source Unfortunately, antihistamines have a disappointing effect in dogs and most require either short courses of steroids, or one of the modern anti-itch medications now available such at Apoquel or Atopica. There are new products coming on the market all the time. [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Use prescribed medication according to your veterinarian's instructions.

[16] X Research source Eliminating flea bites on the dog is often the first step to addressing your pet’s itching even if you don’t see any fleas. Dogs can develop an allergic reaction to the flea saliva that causes the dog to overreact with severe itching even if only one flea was involved. [17] X Research source Flea control for your dog, all other pets in the household and the immediate environment must be implemented and continued on a monthly basis."

      "title": "Try a prescription shampoo.",
      "content": "Try a prescription shampoo. Prescription shampoos are available from your veterinarian to manage itching as well as treat yeast and bacterial infections. These products may be used in addition to oral medication. Over-the-counter flea shampoos such as medicated or coal tar shampoo risk further irritating open skin wounds. Consult with your veterinarian before trying any over-the-counter treatment on your dog. Bathing is good for itchy skin, but don't use human shampoo. A mild oatmeal-based shampoo specially formulated for dogs may temporarily decrease itching. If your dog’s skin is abraded or infected, do not use any shampoo or topical treatment without talking to your veterinarian. You may make the problem worse by using an inappropriate product. Don't over-wash your dog. A bath once a month is all most healthy dogs really need, and some dogs need even less frequent bathing. Bathing your dog removes oils from the skin. If your veterinarian prescribes a special shampoo, she will discuss with you the recommended bathing frequency for your pet’s condition. Also, bathing is only helpful if the allergic reaction is due to something that the skin was in contact with. Since allergic skin reactions can be manifestations of that the dog ingested, bathing might not do anything."

      "content": "Ask about the steroid Prednisone. The first option for treatment for many moderate to severe cases of itching is the steroid, Prednisone, for the temporary relief of the itching. Decreasing the itch and making the dog more comfortable gives the skin a chance to heal. Steroids do have side effects and need to be used carefully. Long-term use can lead to liver or adrenal gland problems. [21] X Research source [22] X Research source"

[23] X Research source There are many antihistamines available to try, and your veterinarian can recommend over-the-counter options as well as prescription ones. No single product works for every dog, so an “antihistamine trial” will need to be started to find out which medication helps your pet the most. Be aware that antihistamines may not help the super itchy dog, but they are often used after steroids have taken care of the initial problem so that you continue to manage the allergy symptoms."

      "content": "Avoid over-the-counter itch relief remedies. Over-the-counter remedies such as medicated or coal tar shampoos, tea-tree and emu oil, and aloe vera are all part of a last ditch approach that owners will often try in the hopes that something will work. Consult with your veterinarian before trying any over-the-counter treatment on your dog. Home remedies such as turpentine, petroleum jelly, mouthwash or vinegar should also be avoided. However, benign topical treatments such as green tea rinses and coconut oil may be effective for mild cases of dry skin with no signs of infection. Your efforts to help your pet may result in making the problem worse for both you and your pet."

      "content": "Ask your vet about a food elimination trial. If a food allergy is suspected, your veterinarian may suggest a food elimination trial with a completely new and different diet for your pet. This new diet will need to consist of ingredients your dog has never eaten before. For example, if your pet has been eating lamb and rice dog food with treats made of beef and wheat, the new diet cannot contain any of those ingredients. The food elimination trial will typically last for 2-3 months. You need to adhere to the strict diet (including treats) in order to get the best information from your experiment. It may take a few rounds of this food elimination diet to determine which foods your dog is sensitive to. You may be able to get your dog’s food at a pet store, but often a special diet from your veterinarian may be needed to manage a pet’s food allergy. [31] X Research source Once a diet has been found, then you can start challenging the body with small amounts of one ingredient at a time to see if your dog starts itching again after introducing the additional ingredient."
