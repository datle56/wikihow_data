      "content": "Pair cargo pants with a crop top for 90s utility. It’s the “big pants, little top” rule, and it’s both timeless and strikingly 90s. The more pockets, the better. This look is coming back in a big way, so ride the style wave and get in early. [1] X Research source For shoes, go with a chunky sneaker, and strap a fanny pack across your body to add even more throwback-themed pockets."

      "content": "Throw on a big ol’ blazer for ready-made business casual. Even if you’re not hitting the office, a men’s blazer that’s about 3 sizes too big is already half of an iconic 90s outfit. The best part? It’s versatile—any high-waisted pant and small top will do underneath. [2] X Research source Or go with comfy jeans and a turtleneck for a more elevated look. Class it up with heels, or dress it down with white sneakers. And every businesswoman needs a bag, but go small on the clutch to balance the big jacket."

      "title": "Slip into a slip.",
      "content": "Slip into a slip. The 90s were absolutely dominated by silky slip dresses . They hit designer runways year after year, then slipped right into the mainstream. [3] X Research source Wear a slip with spaghetti straps, and layer a plain white short-sleeved T-shirt underneath for a more comfortable look. A slip paired with Converse high-tops is total girl-next-door chic. Accessorize with a plastic watch and matching choker."

      "title": "Get grungy with ripped jeans and a baggy tee.",
      "content": "Get grungy with ripped jeans and a baggy tee. Grunge was the counterculture flavor of the decade in the 90s, and was defined by throwing on whatever you had lying on the floor of your room. It’s a look with an attitude that says, “Effort? No thanks.” If it’s thrifted, it’s fair game. [4] X Research source For max grunge, let your hair get a little greasy, and rummage those old checkered Vans out from your closet. Throw a checkered flannel over the top and you’re ready to hit the skate park."

      "content": "A plaid set screams 90s pop culture. Take a cue from Clueless’ Claire Horowitz and party down in plaid. Commitment is key here, we’re talking plaid blazer , plaid skirt , and even plaid knee-high socks . It’s so tacky it loops right back around to classy, and classic. [5] X Research source Wear a simple low heel and a plain, color-coordinated sweater beneath to break up the pattern and bring the outfit together."

      "title": "Dress like royalty in bike shorts and an oversized sweater.",
      "content": "Dress like royalty in bike shorts and an oversized sweater. Yeah, you read that right. Princess Diana made 90s fashion history when she stepped out in blazing orange bike shorts and a simple too-big sweater. Pay her a much-deserved homage with this comfy, casual, lowkey look. [6] X Research source Athletic sneakers and scrunched-up calf socks complete this sporty look. Tennis, anyone?"

      "title": "Bring your jeans up high… or way down low.",
      "content": "Bring your jeans up high… or way down low. The 90s were something of a renaissance for denim. Mom jeans rode high, while low-waisted jeans fell dangerously low. Either option is best worn with a tank top and a studded belt. Combat boots are a great add to this look, as is a leather jacket—faux or real, your call."

      "content": "Get ready to rave in a neon ensemble. It was the heyday of the PLUR lifestyle (that’s Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, for those studying up on fashion history here), and with ravers came neon. Enough to blind you. [7] X Research source JNCO jeans and a tank top serve as a base here. The rest is all in the accessories: [8] X Research source Mix, match, and layer on beaded bracelets, neon sunglasses , rainbow belts, tie-dye bags, leg warmers, separate sleeves, a tiny backpack. Less isn’t more. More is more."

Pull your hair back and fix it in place with these tiny accessories, or just stick ‘em in there without a plan. Either way, they’re a 90s essential. [9] X Research source"

Pull your hair into a high pony , or twin buns on either side of your head , then secure it with a chunky scrunchie or 2. The chunkier, the better. [10] X Research source"

There’s probably nothing more 90s than this ‘do sported by everyone from Justin Timberlake to Guy Fieri. Commit to the frosted tips, and it almost doesn’t matter what you’re wearing down below. You’re a 90s icon, and it’s as simple as that. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Slap on a slap bracelet. Growing up in the 90s was brutal. Kids would literally have to slap on their accessories, and only the toughest survived.

      "content": "Jump into overalls for any easy 90s look. From Will Smith to NSYNC, denim overalls were the chart-topping look of the decade. Pants and (most of) a top in a single outfit? Genius. A turtleneck or patterned button-up underneath is top-tier Fresh Prince. [17] X Research source For added 90s freshness, leave one strap unfastened, like all the cool kids did. Dungarees are best paired with Converse high tops or basketball sneakers to really hit home the 90s feel."

      "content": "Rule the arcade with a colorful windbreaker and baggy jeans. It’s retro, it’s sporty, it’s surprisingly practical. The key here is all in the design, as not just any windbreaker will do. Bold colors, zany patterns, big sleeves. Some tattered jeans and a T-shirt underneath make this casual but cool. [18] X Research source The only valid footwear option here is sneakers, and we won’t accept less (or more). To finish the look, throw on a snapback and turn that sucker around."

Not just any graphic T-shirt, though—stick with 90s themes like pop-punk bands, video games, movies, or colorful graphic designs. Tuck it into a pair of straight, light-blue denim jeans with the cuffs rolled, and layer a flannel over top for simple 90s streetwear. [19] X Research source Skate shoes like Vans work best with this ensemble, and a bomber jacket drives home the vibe."

If it looks like you’re about to play a mean match of tennis and hit the mall afterward, you’re winning the 90s game. But since this style is somewhat timeless, be sure to go for big, bold colors to sell the decade-specific vibe and avoid the everyday gym look. [20] X Research source Running shoes are the move here, to really sell the sporty outfit."

It’s an entire coordinated outfit in 2 pieces. The brighter, the better. [21] X Research source Your shoe choices are many here, but we recommend white tennies. Finish it off with a headband or snapback."
