Once it is dissolved, then you will not be able to get it back without going through the entire process for a new restraining order. No one can tell you whether your reasons are appropriate, but you should give it considerable thought. Alternately, if you are the defendant, then you may wish to have the restraining order dissolved because you think it was entered improperly or is no longer needed.

      "title": "Understand the factors a court considers.",
      "content": "Understand the factors a court considers. Courts will consider different factors in determining whether there is “good cause” to dissolve the restraining order. The touchstone of the inquiry is whether there has been a “change of circumstances” sufficient to justify dissolving the restraining order. [2] X Research source The factors a court considers may include: The victim’s consent. If the victim voluntarily consents to dropping the restraining order, then the court should lift the restraining order. The victim’s fear of the defendant. If the victim fears the defendant, then the court may consider leaving the restraining order in place, as it helps the victim stand up to the defendant. The nature of the relationship between the parties. Here, the court will consider the capacity of the abuser to continue to control the victim. If the two parties have children together, then a court may find it inappropriate to dissolve the restraining order. Contempt convictions. If the abuser violated the restraining order, then the judge can consider those violations as proof that the abuser has not broken the cycle of violence and circumstances have not sufficiently changed. Other violent acts. If the defendant has acted violently toward third parties (or the victim), then the court may find that the victim needs continued protection. Involvement with drugs and alcohol. In most cases, drugs and alcohol play an important role in abuse. If the defendant continues to use drugs or alcohol, then the court may find that the victim still needs protection. Domestic violence counseling. If the defendant has engaged in counseling, then the court might consider this factor weighing in favor of dissolving the restraining order. Defendant’s age and health. In some situations, the defendant’s age or infirmity would support dissolving a final restraining order. Victim’s good faith. The court will look to see whether one party misused restraining orders as part of a divorce action. Protection orders in other jurisdictions. The court may consider whether courts in other jurisdictions have entered restraining orders protecting the victim from the abuser. Any other relevant factor."

      "content": "Meet with a state worker, if required. Some states require that the victim meet with a state employee to talk. New Jersey requires that you meet with Family Intake to discuss the reasons why you want to dissolve the restraining order. The worker will also counsel the victim on their rights and the ramifications of the dissolution of the restraining order. The purpose of meeting with an intake worker is to make sure that the victim is not seeking dissolution because of coercion or duress."

      "content": "Get the appropriate forms. Most states have “fill in the blank” forms that you can use in order to file a motion to dissolve a restraining order. The name of the form will differ depending on the state and the court. You should visit the court which entered the restraining order and ask for the forms. In Nevada, the form is called a “Motion to Dissolve.” You will also need to fill out a “Confidential Information Sheet.” PDFs for all forms can be found at this Self Help website .

      "content": "Attend a hearing. You may have to attend a hearing. [9] X Research source At the hearing, both parties will be allowed to present evidence. Hearing procedures will vary, depending on the court and on whether the motion to dissolve the restraining order is contested. If the defendant brings the motion to dissolve the restraining order and the victim objects, then the defendant should be prepared to present evidence showing that a change of circumstances has taken place since the original restraining order was entered. The victim will also be able to present evidence as to why the restraining order should not be dissolved. Evidence can take the form of testimony by the parties, witness testimony, and documentary evidence. If the victim brings the motion to drop the restraining order, then the court might inquire only as to whether or not the motion is being brought voluntarily. If the court is satisfied that the victim is acting voluntarily, then in some states the judge has to dissolve the restraining order."
