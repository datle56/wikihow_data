      "content": "Mark the height of your cat’s stomach on your door. Use a ruler to measure the height of your cat’s stomach from the ground. Mark this measurement on the door with a horizontal line using a pencil. Use a spirit level to make sure that the horizontal line is straight. [1] X Research source The measurement for most cats is approximately 4.7 in (12 cm). If you have multiple cats, use the shortest belly height as taller cats are able to crouch. Having the cat flap installed at the right height means that your cat will be able to easily get in and out."

      "content": "Find the center of the width of your door. Use a measuring tape to measure how wide the door is. Divide this measurement by 2 to find where the center point is. Mark this point along the horizontal line that you drew using an “X” symbol. [2] X Research source Measure twice to find the center so that you can be confident that the measurement is accurate. This marking is where the center of the cat flap will be."

      "content": "Stick the cat flap template to your door using masking tape. Follow the instructions that came with the cat flap to fit the template. Line the template up along the horizontal line so that the cat flap will be the correct height. Make sure that you secure the template so that the middle is at the center of the door. [3] X Research source Use the spirit level again to ensure that the template is sitting straight. If your cat flap kit doesn't include a template, photocopy the cat flap to create your own template."

      "content": "Drill 1 hole in each corner of the template. The cat flap template will indicate where you need to drill the holes. Make sure that the holes are slightly larger than the jigsaw blade width. A 3/8 in (10 mm) flat bit is an ideal size to use for drilling the corner holes. [4] X Research source For square or rectangular cat flaps, you will need to drill 4 holes. However, for circular cat flaps, drilling only 1 hole at the top of the template is usually all that’s necessary."

Follow the line as closely as possible and guide the blade around the shape. [6] X Research source Don’t push the jigsaw to make it go faster. Let it work at its own speed as this will result in the best and most accurate cut."

If not, stand on the other side of the door and encourage the cat to walk through. You may need to use treats for this. [10] X Research source Alternatively, place some cat food in a bowl and leave it on the other side of the door, where it can be seen through the open cat flap. This should help to encourage your cat to walk through without you needing to be there holding a treat. You can keep the cat flap propped open using a piece of string. Attach the string to the cat flap using masking tape. Then tape the string to the wall to hold the cat flap open. [11] X Research source"

Once your cat can comfortably walk through the cat flap while it's open, let it shut and encourage the cat from the other side of the door again. This will prompt your cat to push against the cat flap with their head, which will teach it how to open it. [12] X Research source After enough practice, your cat will eventually get used to pushing against the cat flap to open it and won't need to be encouraged anymore. Give your cat a lot of praise and affection when they start using the cat flap on their own. [13] X Research source"
