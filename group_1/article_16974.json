For example, if you show your illustrations to someone and they say they're a bit 2-dimensional, work on making your art more 3-dimensional. Ask the person questions like, \"What does this piece of art remind you of?\" or \"Which elements of this artwork are working and which do you think need improvement?\""

[17] X Research source For example, if you’ve developed a style of painting that mostly only uses bold colors, don’t be afraid to incorporate small amounts of black and white into your artwork to see how it looks."
