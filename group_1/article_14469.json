      "content": "Draw eight concentric circles , leaving a small circle that will serve as the labyrinth's center. (Concentric circles sit one inside the other, like a target in a game of darts.) To make things as easy as possible, label the circles from 1-8, starting with the largest circle as number 1. (There will be references to numbered circles later in the instructions, so even if you decide not to physically label your circles, at least know which would be 1, which would be 2, etc.)"

      "content": "At the labyrinth's center, draw a flower-like pattern. This is the center of most labyrinths. Your flower should be perfectly symmetrical--i.e., drawing a straight line through its center in any direction should yield two identical halves. If this is not the case initially, try to redo your flower so that it is."
