You can either oppose the ban, or apologise, but some common phrases include: I'm really sorry, I've learnt from my mistake and won't do this again That isn't actually what happened, that user faked a screenshot to frame me I don't think this is fair because..."

A permanent ban being made temporary should be seen as a good outcome, because you can return to the community. If the moderator doesn't unban you, you should ask why they rejected you and then explain why that isn't right. But if they refuse to unban you, you must remain respectful and accept that decision."
