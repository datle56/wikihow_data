      "title": "Acknowledge the beggar.",
      "content": "Acknowledge the beggar. Instead of ignoring them, look at them. Nod, smile, or say hello to show you are aware of their presence. This is a compassionate response that won’t cost you any money.

      "title": "Refuse to give money politely.",
      "content": "Refuse to give money politely. A flat “No” to their request might seem rude and uncaring. Instead, try something like, “I’d like to help, but I don’t have any cash.” It’s respectful, and it allows you to avoid feeling like a villain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask the beggar what they need.",
      "content": "Ask the beggar what they need. You could give your spare change, but you can’t control what it will be used for. Instead, if it’s safe to do so, ask what they would like to buy. If they need a bus ticket, offer to buy one for them. If they’re wearing shoes in poor condition or covering themselves with newspapers, ask their shoe size or offer to bring a blanket. This sees to their physical needs and also gives them the dignity and respect that money can’t buy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Offer food.",
      "content": "Offer food. If you’re near a restaurant or café, offer to buy a cup of coffee or a sandwich. This will allow you to address the beggar in a way that’s helpful and open. You also can at least be assured they’ll have food or a warm beverage. Keep in mind some beggars may trade food for other goods or services. You can’t control this once you hand them the food. This doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s good to keep this in mind so you are aware of the possible downsides of giving a beggar food."

    {
      "title": "Direct the beggar to a shelter.",
      "content": "Direct the beggar to a shelter. If you think they might be sleeping on the street, let them know the location of the nearest homeless shelter. This will help them get off the streets, at least for a night. It will also connect them with services that could give them the means to rise out of their situation. To find shelter locations around the world, visit: Street Link [3] X Research source for UK shelters. Homeless Shelter Directory [4] X Research source for shelters in the United States. Homeless Canada for shelters in Canada."

      "title": "Stay where people can see you.",
      "content": "Stay where people can see you. Speak with beggars on busy, well-lit streets. Remain standing, as crouching or sitting makes you less visible. Don’t follow anyone into an empty alleyway or dark corner."

    {
      "title": "Keep your eyes on the beggar.",
      "content": "Keep your eyes on the beggar. If you’re giving directions or handing over some food, don’t look away from the beggar. Distraction is a common tactic thieves use to rob victims with good intentions. [5] X Research source While most beggars aren’t criminals, you should always use caution."

    {
      "title": "Remain in your car.",
      "content": "Remain in your car. While driving, you might be tempted to help a beggar at a traffic light by getting out of your car. This holds up traffic and puts you in danger of a traffic accident. Acknowledge them with a nod or a smile, but do it from your car."

      "title": "Protect yourself from aggressive beggars",
      "content": "Protect yourself from aggressive beggars . If a beggar becomes aggressive, you shouldn’t allow yourself to be bullied. Shout to draw attention to yourself. Walk into a nearby business and ask for assistance. If you see a police officer in the area, tell them about your situation."

      "content": "Give money to a local charity. Look for charities that help people stay off the streets and provide support for the homeless. If you’re concerned about beggars in a country you’re visiting, look for a charity that focuses on a specific need, such as providing school books and supplies for children. This will keep them in school and off the streets.
