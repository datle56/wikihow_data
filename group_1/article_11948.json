One of the key components of burnout is this lack of productivity, which may be out of character for someone like you. You may no longer feel enjoyment from the things you used to, and this can be detrimental to your well-being. This can include self-care tasks, such as washing yourself, brushing your teeth or maintaining your usual routine. Notice if you heavily rely on escapism in some form. Do you find yourself sucked into fantasy or unhealthy coping mechanisms? Escapism may be watching TV shows all day, watching TikTok for prolonged periods, gaming, substance abuse, daydreaming, and just generally finding whatever you can to distract yourself from your lack of productivity."
