      "content": "Store the tube in a protective container or box until you can recycle it. If you purchased the light yourself, simply place the tube back in the box it originally came in. If you don’t have this box, wrap the tube in bubble wrap or newspaper and gently place it in a sturdy box. You may not be able to dispose of the tube right away, so store it in a dry, secure place where it won’t be jostled or moved around a lot (such as a rarely used storage closet)."

      "content": "Take household tubes to a hazardous waste collection center. This is the easiest option if you only have a few tubes to dispose of. However, in some areas, these centers only collect hazardous waste once or twice a year, so be sure to check with your local government ahead of time to confirm you’re able to take the tubes to the center when you plan to. Some local governments will also carry out collection drives, where agents come to your home to take away your hazardous waste. Contact your local government to find out if this is an option for you."

      "content": "Have a lamp recycling vendor come pick up your tubes if you have a lot. If you run a medium-sized or large business and have dozens of tubes to dispose of, this is the easiest and safest way to recycle them. Look on your state government’s website or contact the Department of Energy to find a list of local vendors who you can contact to pick up your tubes for you. Note that some of these vendors may require you have to a minimum number of tubes to be disposed of, such as 10 pounds (4.5 kg) worth. Your local government may also be willing to pick up the tubes from your business, for a small fee. This fee is usually somewhere between $0.50-1.00 per lamp."

      "content": "Contact your lamp supplier about mailing your spent tubes back to them. Many lamp suppliers and lamp recycling vendors will take spent tubes off of your hands if you pay the costs of shipping. If you’re mailing the tubes back to the original supplier, you can normally request a free collection box to ship them in. The cost of shipping will vary based on your area and vendor, but it will probably be about $1 per lamp. For safety, be sure to wrap the tubes in bubble wrap or some other protective wrapping before shipping them."

[2] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Be sure to call the store ahead of time before you bring in your old tubes. Because it can be hazardous to transport the tubes, you’ll want to make sure the store will actually take them off your hands once you get there. Note that some stores may only recycle certain types of bulbs (such as CFLs or 4 ft (1.2 m) fluorescent tubes)."

Then, put all the broken pieces and the contents of the vacuum bag into an airtight container that mercury can’t leak out of. [5] X Research source This can be a glass jar with a metal lid, a plastic food container, or even a sealable plastic bag. Note that you should only vacuum the mess if there is dust or broken glass that you aren’t able to clean up with the piece of cardboard. Vacuuming could inadvertently spread the contaminated dust around the room, so only do this if you don’t have duct tape to use."
