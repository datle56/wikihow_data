      "title": "Save your doc with a helpful name.",
      "content": "Save your doc with a helpful name. For example, you could call it something like “Invoice Template” or “Query Letter Template.” Just choose something that will be easy for you to identify. If you’re making a template for others to use as well, make sure you share it with anyone who needs to have access. Click the Share button in the top right corner to add people or make changes to the permission settings. To make sure nobody accidentally changes the template itself, save the template to a Google Drive folder and set the folder’s permissions so that collaborators can view and edit the contents. Then, set the template file itself to View Only . This should allow anyone else with access to the folder to copy the template but not edit it directly."
