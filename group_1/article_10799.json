      "content": "Use your current schedule for reference, if possible. Look at the way you currently spend your time—how many hours a week you study or attend class versus how many hours you spend on entertainment or friends and family. Use it to identify points where you could be more efficient or any activities you might be able to cut out. [1] X Research source For example, you might find that you spend a lot more time than necessary on entertainment (watching TV or even just scrolling on social media), and you could devote some of that to studying instead. That doesn’t mean you should eliminate all the fun stuff. Downtime and relaxation are important, too!"

      "content": "List and prioritize the subjects you need to study. To create your study schedule, list all the subjects and courses you’ll be studying for to get organized. Then, Libedinsky recommends you figure out, very specifically, what you need to do for each course (like lessons you need to study or exams you’re preparing for ). For example, you might make time for reading, reviewing notes, creating exam guides, or using flashcards. [2] X Research source Once you have your list, prioritizing each subject is also a good idea. What’s most urgent or requires the most time, and what’s less important? Which exam is coming up first? Other factors to consider are the difficulty of the subject or exam and the amount of reading or reviewing time you’ll need to do. Ranking each class in importance will help you determine what subjects you must devote the most time to and which subjects should get your best time slots. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Ensure your study schedule is balanced. While blocking off time for each subject, you should also reserve time for rest, relaxation, friends, and family. Creating a healthy balance between your academic and personal life is crucial to success in your studies. So, when making your schedule, build time to eat, rest, exercise , socialize, and spend time on other things. [4] X Research source Block off times you’ll need for other commitments, like swim practice, work, religious services, or family time. Reserve time for events you can’t reschedule, your grandmother’s birthday, a family reunion, or your dog’s veterinary appointment. If you only have a limited amount of time before a big exam, consider postponing or canceling other social or extracurricular activities."

      "title": "Set aside enough time for each subject you need to study.",
      "content": "Set aside enough time for each subject you need to study. When making your study schedule, divide your available time into study blocks. Then, assign a subject to each block, ensuring there’s a block for each subject. Ideally, each subject should get at least a 30 to 45-minute study block—though shorter time blocks are easier to schedule than longer ones. [5] X Research source If you only have so much time before an exam, it may help to create a reverse calendar instead of a weekly schedule."

      "content": "Design a schedule that’s consistent (the same time and place). Consistency is what matters more than anything, according to Warwick. By studying at the same time daily, you’ll have a plan you can memorize without constantly checking it, and you can build a positive study habit. So, check to see if there are times or days of the week you can always make time to study and use them to your advantage. For example, you may be free from 3 to 4 PM every Tuesday and Thursday. If possible, try to schedule your studying then; a routine can help you get into a studying mindset faster. Warwick's recommendation for a study schedule? \"Take the amount of time you can devote to studying. Cut it in half, and make that your goal for the first week. if you start to develop a good routine, it's a lot easier to slowly increase.\""

      "content": "Study while the material is still fresh in your mind. Reviewing what you learn in class right afterward can be much more effective than trying to study it days later. If possible, set aside time in your schedule to review notes and study materials soon after a class—and the more organized your notes are, the better. In the same way, it’s a good idea to start assignments and projects soon after they’re assigned because it’s when your memory of them is freshest."

      "content": "Make the most of odd or scattered hours for studying. Do you have small pockets of time in between classes or activities—maybe 1 to 2 hours here and there where you usually don’t get much done? You can turn those spare hours into study time, especially to review class notes (as mentioned above). That way, you can get more done during the day and have more time for relaxation later. [6] X Research source Did you know your mind naturally works a little faster during the day? Brains are wired to wind down at night—so you really can get more work and study done during daylight hours."

      "content": "Add planned breaks into your schedule. It’s a good idea to take one short 5 to 10-minute break during each study block. During your break, you can get up, walk around, grab a snack or drink, listen to music, or watch a funny video to decompress. Just ensure you’re following the schedule and only taking breaks for the set time. Extra or overly long breaks can sabotage your study plan! [7] X Research source Try setting an alarm at the start of your break to alert you when the break is over. Use your break time wisely; do something that’ll make you feel refreshed and pumped up for more studying—but nothing that’ll distract you and prolong the break."

      "content": "Switch up what you study after 1 to 2 hours. You can get tired (and struggle to concentrate) after studying for an hour or two, especially if you’re studying the same thing. In your schedule, don’t study the same thing for more than 2 hours; make study periods that are 1 to 2 hours max, then take a quick break and study something different when you go back to work. It can also be helpful to schedule the most challenging work when your mind is freshest, usually in the morning (but it can be late afternoon for some people)."

That way, if something comes up or your timing gets thrown off a little, you can use that unscheduled time to get some studying done anyway. An inflexible schedule can deter many students from sticking to it, since it can feel like there’s no point continuing after something goes wrong. So, be flexible and keep to the schedule!"

[8] X Research source You can buy a daily planner for your study schedule or something similar. A basic notebook will also work. You can even program the schedule into your smartphone using the phone’s calendar app or a task management app of your choice, like My Study Life or Power Planner . Start planning one week at a time until you get a better sense of your schedule. Reader Poll: We asked 168 wikiHow readers if they use a calendar to keep track of their schedule, and 54% said yes .

Anything from social media to friends, TV, or games can be a major distraction, so make sure your study area doesn’t have anything that could potentially distract you. If you’re worried you’ll get sucked into doing something on your phone, you could even download an app designed to block social media for a set amount of time (like Freedom or Session . Warwick also says that studying with friends is rarely effective. \"Most of the time, you're in a position where you need a lot of help, or you're giving a lot of help; you're not getting the maximum benefit out of your study time.\" Solo study works better!"

      "content": "Use a studying technique that’s effective for you. While figuring out how you spend time is one of the most essential parts of creating your schedule, you must also figure out how to study. Developing and using a specific technique can help you learn the study material more effectively—and use your time more effectively, too. Consider the following techniques: [9] X Research source Pomodoro technique. This is a popular study strategy involving studying in 25-minute intervals and taking short breaks in between. This can help keep your mind sharp and avoid fatigue! Active recall. This study technique involves actively trying to remember information (essentially testing yourself) rather than passively reading or listening. You could use flashcards, practice tests, or try explaining each concept to other people. Mind mapping. Mind mapping can be helpful for people who prefer to study visually. It’s all about absorbing complex information by starting with a basic idea and building out from there, adding related subtopics to that original topic. Feynman technique. Try this technique if there’s a topic you’re struggling to understand. It involves breaking down a topic into more basic terms; essentially, it’s like explaining the subject to someone who knows nothing about it."

It can also help you pick areas to focus on while studying! Just make sure you note how much time you have for each goal so you can track deadlines. [10] X Research source Short-term goals could include passing an upcoming test , finishing a paper, or memorizing a presentation. Break up your tasks by day for these. Long-term goals could include getting into a specific college , winning a scholarship, or landing a job or internship. Break up your goals by week and month for these."

There’s no point in making one otherwise. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to keep yourself accountable. For example, get in the habit of looking at your calendar or planner daily and use an alarm or timer on your phone to alert you when it’s time to study. [11] X Research source Additionally, tell other people about your schedule. Sometimes, it’s hard to follow a schedule because other people are distracting you (or, conversely, there’s no accountability partner to make sure you do). If people know when you’re supposed to be studying, they can leave you alone during those times—or even check in on you to hold you accountable for studying! Try posting a copy of your study plan on the refrigerator where your family can see it or emailing a copy to your friends. Once you establish a routine, you may start associating certain acts (like opening a textbook or sitting at a desk) with a study mode."

      "title": "Remind yourself of your work ethic.",
      "content": "Remind yourself of your work ethic. You might design yourself an awesome schedule, but it won’t mean much if you aren’t committed to studying. So, affirm your work ethic and desire to study and excel academically—especially when you feel like you might lose focus or deviate from the schedule. [12] X Research source Try planning your schedule based on your work habits. For example: If you know you procrastinate , build in extra time before any deadlines. This will offer a cushion so you don’t miss one. If you know you have a strong work ethic, give yourself extra motivation to finish your work early. You could make a “bonus” spot in your schedule so you have the opportunity to get ahead."

      "content": "Morning and afternoon schedule Do you prefer getting things done in the morning? In that case, a daytime study schedule may be ideal for you. That way, you can get the most challenging work out of the way earlier and wind down in the late afternoon. For example, you could use the following study schedule: 7 AM: Wake up, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. You could also add in some time for exercise or stretches to wake yourself up. 8 AM - 10 AM: Study time. Prioritize the most challenging or time-sensitive subject here! In this block, remember to specify what you plan to study and how (for example, making flashcards for an exam). 10 AM - 10:15 AM: Take a quick, 15-minute break. Go for a walk, stretch, or find another way to clear your head. 10:15 AM - 12:15 PM: Study time—the second block. Spend this time on another subject, or use a technique like Pomodoro to break it up further into 25-minute sessions with 5-minute breaks. 12:15 PM - 1:15 PM: Lunch. Keep yourself well-fed and hydrated throughout the day! 1:15 PM - 3:15 PM: Study time—the third block. Once again, spend this time on a new subject and figure out what kind of studying you want to do. 3:15 PM - 4:30 PM: Another 15-minute break to try and keep your energy up as the day goes on. 4:40 PM to 6:30 PM: Study time—the final block. Cover any last areas that might need attention and finish your remaining work here. 6:30 PM onward: Free time. Spend the rest of your day doing things you enjoy—and things that relax you. Obviously, you can tweak or tailor this to your needs! For example, you could do 1 or 1 ½ hour study increments instead of the 2-hour increments here."

      "content": "Evening and nighttime schedule Some people prefer getting things done in the afternoon, evening, and nighttime rather than during daylight hours—and that’s okay. Just remember that staying up all night isn't healthy. \"Depriving yourself of sleep doesn't allow you to answer questions any better, and storing things in short-term memory has almost no benefit,\" Warwick explains. 4 PM - 6 PM: Study time—the first block. If you’re starting at this time, be sure to get meals (breakfast and lunch) squared away first, plus any other activities you need to do. 6 PM - 6:45 PM: Have dinner. You can alternatively push this later in the evening if you prefer! 6:45 PM - 8:45 PM: Study time—the second block. Choose your study topic and methods, like the Pomodoro technique or Mind Mapping. 8:45 PM - 9 PM: A 15-minute break to recharge your energy. 9 PM - 11 PM: Study time—the third block. If you still plan to go to bed and sleep for the night, this may be the final study session you do. 11 PM: Wind down for the night and bedtime. However, if you plan to work through more, you could take another 15-minute break and a 2-hour study session afterward; just know you’d be done around 1:15 AM. Want to see even more examples?

Even if you’re already pretty good with time management, having everything written down on a set schedule can help you stay organized and spend your time wisely. You can plan ahead, break down your workload into manageable portions, and give yourself plenty of time to get assignments done. Other benefits include: You can fit your studies in with non-academic commitments (so you can do both). You’ll get a leg up on achieving your goals since you’ll have the time to prepare everything you need to be successful in class. You can avoid conflicts in your schedule since you’ll be developing a weekly plan that’s conflict-free. You can make changes to the schedule as needed once you get a better sense of when your mind is most receptive to learning. For online students, a study schedule can keep you accountable for homework and time management, even without an instructor to do it!"
