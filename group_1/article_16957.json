      "content": "Ask yourself what you would enjoy doing as a career if money weren't an issue. The respected philosopher Alan Watts said that the best way to find what you should be doing with your life was to ask yourself this important question: \"What would you do if money were no object?\" What if you won the lottery and you could do whatever you wanted to do with your life? Sure, you'd want to relax for a while, but eventually you're going to get bored. So what would you do to make yourself really, truly happy? [1] X Research source For instance, maybe you enjoy working with children, creating art, or building things. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Break your dream job down into its most basic components.",
      "content": "Break your dream job down into its most basic components. Take whatever activity or job you discovered in the previous step and break it down into its most basic parts. If you were explaining the job to a 3-year-old, how would you describe it? If that child asked you what was fun about it or how it made someone feel when they did it, what would you say? These basic components make up what you should be looking for in a career."

      "title": "Think about what it really is that makes you happy.",
      "content": "Think about what it really is that makes you happy. [3] X Research source Think about the basic components of that career experience and decide which are the aspects that pull you. [4] X Research source Realize what attracts you to that career. [5] X Research source Do you find happiness in making other people happy? Are you more attracted to the art of acting and the process of creating the work of art that is a film? [6] X Research source You can do this for your current job as well, not just a theoretical dream job. If there's something about your job that you do now, factor that in as well. You might want to take a personality test, such as the Briggs-Myers, to help you determine which jobs match well with your personality."

    {
      "title": "Look into what jobs provide similar feelings and experiences.",
      "content": "Look into what jobs provide similar feelings and experiences. Look for jobs that mimic the feelings that you're looking for from that career. For example, if you were a millionaire and would rather travel, jobs which mirror the experience you have would be a tour guide, a teacher abroad, or a flight attendant position. If you would rather spend all day outdoors in nature, you could consider a job as a geologist, lumberjack, wilderness guide, or park ranger. Or you can try to become a CTO if you want to work in the technology related fields."

      "title": "Consider the upsides and downsides of that career.",
      "content": "Consider the upsides and downsides of that career. When you consider these more-attainable careers, make sure to do your research. Be well acquainted with what life looks like in that career path. You will need to know what the downsides of those jobs are if you want to make an informed decision. Read articles or reviews from people who work the kinds of jobs you want to see what they like and dislike. For instance, if a particular job you would enjoy requires you to travel often but you have small children at home, this could be a downside."

      "title": "Factor in your financial needs.",
      "content": "Factor in your financial needs. If you're really in a job that fulfills you and makes you happy, getting rich off of it really won't matter to you. However, life is full of obligations that go beyond your happiness. If your dream career can't help feed your family or pay your student loans, you might need to look into other options. You should always keep your focus on jobs that provide similar feelings to what makes you happy."

      "title": "Factor in what you're good at.",
      "content": "Factor in what you're good at. Do you have an area where you really excel? Not just something that you do okay but something where you do it better than most people that you meet? This is something that you should factor in when looking for a career. You may not think that you enjoy it too much, but the fact of the matter is that you often won't get good at something unless you enjoy it on at least a certain level. [7] X Research source You may be able to monetize your skill, or even home in on the aspect of it that you enjoy so much (for guidance)."

      "content": "Analyze your hobbies. Many hobbies can be monetized. This often means starting a small business and the headaches that come with it, but you may end up with a career that you really enjoy. Before you dismiss your hobby as being something that you could never make money off of, do some searching on the internet. You may be surprised. [8] X Research source"

It doesn't matter what city they're in (so long as they're in your country or open to members of your citizenship level). Look at what the requirements are. What do the basic requirements seem to be?

You'll probably need some more education (this is to be expected), but don't feel like this limits you. There are many government programs available to help people get the education they need for a job, especially if that job is in demand. You can also find scholarships, internships, and apprenticeships to get the skills you need. Be sure to factor in the cost of acquiring the certifications or degrees youâ€™ll need to land that dream job."

[9] X Research source Look for positions in the same industry, or even volunteer positions that get you working in that position directly.

You can volunteer with their organizations, go to conferences in that field, and even just go to a job fair to meet people.
