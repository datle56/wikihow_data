      "content": "Take your hot dogs out of the package. The packaging on your hot dogs likely isn’t microwave safe, so it can melt and damage your hot dogs. Additionally, the hot dog water inside the packaging can carry bacteria that only dies at high temperatures, not on the defrost setting. It’s safer to transfer the hot dogs to a dish. [1] X Research source Discard the packaging after you remove it, and use soap and water to clean up any hot dog water that spills. This method works best if you're thawing no more than 1 pack of hot dogs."

      "content": "Arrange the hot dogs on a microwave safe dish and cover them. Put the hot dogs in a single layer on the dish. Then, drape a paper towel over the dish to cover the hot dogs and soak up liquids. [2] X Research source You may prefer to wrap the hot dogs in paper towels to soak up the liquids that come out of them. However, this isn’t necessary."

      "content": "Choose the defrost microwave setting or 30% power. Check the controls on your microwave and hit the button that says “Defrost.” If your microwave doesn’t have this button, find the “power setting” button and set your microwave to 30% power. [3] X Research source If you’re having trouble, check the manual for your microwave or do a quick Internet search to learn how this works on your microwave. Every microwave is different."

      "content": "Heat your hot dogs for 30 seconds, then check them. Put the dish of hot dogs into your microwave, then set the timer for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, remove the hot dogs from the microwave and check to see if they’re thawed. [4] X Research source You’ll likely need to thaw your hot dogs for longer than 30 seconds. In fact, an entire package could take as long as 8-12 minutes, depending on your microwave. However, you need to check them often so that they don’t start cooking, as this can trigger bacterial growth. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Rotate the hot dogs every 30 seconds if the microwave doesn't.",
      "content": "Rotate the hot dogs every 30 seconds if the microwave doesn't. You can skip this step if your microwave rotates the food for you. If your microwave doesn’t have a rotating plate, turn the dish 180 degrees every 30 seconds. Otherwise, your hot dogs likely won’t heat evenly and the difference in temperatures may trigger bacteria growth. [6] X Research source You can also roll the hot dogs over to help ensure even heating."

      "content": "Defrost the hot dogs for 30 seconds at a time until they're thawed. Place the frozen hot dogs back into the microwave. Push the defrost button or set the power to 30%, then set the timer for 30 seconds. Check the hot dogs every 30 seconds until they feel thaw. [7] X Research source Make sure to set the microwave on defrost or 30% power each time you heat the hot dogs."

      "content": "Cook the hot dogs immediately after thawing them in a microwave. When you defrost hot dogs in the microwave, it starts the cooking process. This means parts of your hot dogs will be in the temperature “danger zone” for triggering bacterial growth. To keep your food safe, cook it right away, which will kill the bacteria. [8] X Research source It’s safe to cook your defrosted hot dogs in the microwave, in the oven, in a pot of boiling water, or on a grill."

      "content": "Put your hot dogs in a sealed, airtight plastic bag. If your hot dogs are still in their sealed package, you can leave them there. If they’ve been opened, place the hot dogs into a plastic food storage bag that has a zipper. Make sure the hot dogs are airtight so that the cool water doesn’t touch the food. You don’t want the water to touch the hot dogs for food safety purposes. The hot dogs or the water could become contaminated, so it’s best to avoid this risk."

      "content": "Fill a large bowl or dish with enough cool water to cover your hot dogs. You don’t need to be precise about temperature, but the water should feel cool to the touch. It’s generally safe to use the coolest setting on your tap. Add enough water to the bowl or dish to cover the hot dogs you want to defrost. If you're thawing multiple packs of hot dogs, it's best to place them in separate dishes so they defrost faster."

      "content": "Submerge your bag of hot dogs into the cool water for 30 minutes. Place the hot dogs into the bowl or dish and push them beneath the cool water. Make sure they’re totally covered. Leave them to sit on the counter at room temperature. Set a timer for 30 minutes so you can check on them. The hot dogs should stay at the bottom of the bowl or dish because they are heavy. However, they may float if there is air in your bag. If this happens, squeeze out the air and put your hot dogs back in the water."

      "content": "Check the hot dogs and replace the water after 30 minutes. Pour the used water down the sink. Then, feel the hot dogs through the packaging to see if they feel thawed. If they don’t, add more cool water back to the bowl or dish. Set the timer for another 30 minutes. Thawed hot dogs should feel squishy and a little flexible. Additionally, they’ll feel cool and not cold. Your hot dogs may thaw in 30 minutes, but it’s likely that they’ll take an hour if you’re thawing a whole pack or multiple packs."

When they feel thaw, start cooking them. If they still feel frozen, cover them with cool water again. Then, set your timer for 30 minutes. You can do this safely for up to 2 hours or until your hot dogs are thawed. Typically, hot dogs will defrost within 1 hour."

      "content": "Cook your hot dogs immediately after thawing them in cool water. While this is a safer method than using your microwave, you still need to cook your hot dogs immediately. Cool water doesn’t keep the hot dogs below 40 °F (4 °C), which means that bacteria may start growing. Cook your hot dogs immediately to kill the bacteria. For instance, grill, boil, roast, or microwave your hot dogs."

      "content": "Place your hot dogs in a shallow dish. If they’re still in a sealed package, put the unopened package into the dish. If they’re open, line them up in a single layer. The dish will catch any runoff from the frozen hot dogs so it doesn’t contaminate your refrigerator or other foods. For instance, you might use a shallow baking dish or a bowl. If you're thawing multiple packs, don't stack them. It's safe to place several packs in 1 dish as long as you put them in a single layer. You don’t need to cover the dish, but you may prefer to do so if your hot dogs aren’t packaged."

Then, leave the dish undisturbed while the hot dogs defrost. [10] X Research source There’s no need to cover the hot dogs with water. The cooler temperatures of the refrigerator will cause them to thaw."

      "content": "Leave the hot dogs to defrost for at least 24 hours. A pack of hot dogs should thaw within 24 hours. Check the hot dogs to see if they feel cool to the touch, not cold. Additionally, they should feel spongy and flexible. It’s safe to store them in your refrigerator for about 3-5 days before you cook them. However, they’ll be safest if you cook them as soon as they’re thawed. If you’re thawing several packs of hot dogs, you may need to thaw them for longer. Allow 24 hours per 1 to 5 lb (0.45 to 2.27 kg) of food. You may not need to worry about this if you arranged your hot dogs in a single layer."
