Once your hair is damp (but not soaking wet), gently comb it through with a wide-tooth comb and apply a heat-protectant . Rough dry your hair on medium heat until your hair is 60-70% dry. Then, begin to blow-dry your hair in sections with a round brush and a blowdryer fitted with a concentrator nozzle . [1] X Research source Roll each 1 inch (25 mm) section around your round brush and apply medium heat to it. Keep the brush in until the section has dried and cooled down, then unwind it and move onto another section. Once your hair is completely blown dry, add a dime-sized amount of finishing cream onto your strands to prevent frizz and seal in moisture. You can also use “a blowout brush,” adds Chiz. “Different brands have different versions of it, where you can actually dry and smooth your hair at the same time. And it just gives a very simple blowout look without being too done. Also, if you do it that way, it tends to last a little bit longer.” [2] X Expert Source Danielle Chiz Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. Tuesday, 3 August 2021."
