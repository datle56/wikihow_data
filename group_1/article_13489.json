If you experience occasional back pain, you can roll a towel and place it under the arch of your back, just above your hips. Additionally, if you lay on a workout bench instead of on the floor, it will improve your range of motion and allow you to lift/lower your legs farther. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Bend your knees and raise your legs. Position your calves parallel to the ground, with your thighs perpendicular to your calves, forming a right angle with your knee. Keep your toes pointed while you do this, drawing your abdominal muscles toward your spine. [3] X Research source Be sure to contract your abdominals to push your lower back into the floor; there should not be any gap between them. This helps you target the abdominal muscles while protecting your spine. Lift your chin, and keep your eyes and face directed at the ceiling and avoid the temptation to strain your neck to look at your legs. This will help you avoid pain in your neck."

Remember not to let your lower back arch off the ground, or you may injure yourself and you won't be getting as good of a workout. [4] X Research source To make it more challenging: skip Step 2 and raise your legs to the ceiling without bending them. This increases the effort needed to complete the rep, and works both your legs and core harder."

      "content": "Bring your legs down slowly. Bring them down as far as you can while keeping your back flat against the floor. Your eventual goal is to reach about an inch off the floor. Don't just let gravity work for you—make sure you're in control. Hold your arms in the same place, but use them to support you as you lower your legs. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Remember to breathe throughout the exercise, and resist the temptation to let your feet touch the floor. This will ensure you get the best workout possible. Keep your lower back pressed into the floor to engage your abdominals and protect your spine. This will get harder the closer your feet get to the floor, so only lower as far as you can while not arching your back. If you feel your lower back arching up off the floor, don't lower your legs down as far. As your abdominals get stronger, you will be able to lower your feet closer to the floor using proper form."

Slow it down for even more of a challenge, lifting your straightened legs all the way up on a count of ten, and then lowering them down while counting to ten again. Leg lifts like this are a great way to build leg muscles without weights . [6] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source To make it more challenging: practice raising your feet about 20%, holding for one second, raising them 20% more, holding for one second, and continuing this until you get them as high as they need to be. To make it easier: raise only a single leg at a time, while keeping the other flat on the floor. If you opt for this method, do 3 sets of 10 lifts for each leg, for a total of 6 sets."

Remember to keep breathing throughout the exercise, and don’t rush through it. To make it more challenging: wear ankle weights or wrap a resistance band around your ankles to add opposing force, making your thighs, butt, and core work harder in the process. This is a great exercise to build leg muscles , reinforce your hips, and shape your butt!
