      "content": "Determine your body shape to help you choose flattering pieces. [1] X Expert Source Stephanie Fajardo Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 30 April 2019. While everybody is different, most female bodies fall into 1 of the following body shape categories: pear, apple, straight, inverted triangle, or hourglass. Start by measuring around the fullest part of your chest, the smallest part of your waist, and the widest part of your hips. Then, rank your bust, hip, and waist measurements from largest to smallest. [2] X Research source If your bust and waist are smaller than your hips, you are a pear shape. If your bust is larger than your waist and hips, you’re an inverted triangle. If your bust, waist, and hips are about the same, you have a rectangle shape. If your waist is wider than your bust and hips, you're an apple shape. If your waist is smaller than your bust and hips, you have an hourglass shape."

      "content": "Emphasize your bust if you have an apple body shape. If you have an apple body shape , wear tops that highlight your bust and show off your shoulders. Try to avoid clingy materials around the waist area, and gravitate toward thin belts rather than thick ones. Solid colors tend to look better than busy patterns on apple bodies, but feel free to experiment! [3] X Research source You can also choose to emphasize shapely legs with tights and skirts. Keep in mind that these aren't hard and fast rules—there is plenty of room for experimentation."

      "content": "Wear formfitting clothes that accentuate your waist if you're a rectangle shape. For rectangle body shapes , try form-fitting tops and scooped necklines to give your body more curves. Skinny jeans and dresses that emphasize your waist are also great options. [4] X Research source Stay away from shapeless dresses, shoulder pads, and boxy tops and coats. Cinch loose clothes at the waist with your favorite belt so that your shape doesn't get lost in the fabric."

Avoid shapeless and baggy clothing. [5] X Research source Stay away from pieces with extra fabric at the hips or bust to keep your look proportionate.

      "content": "Go with clothes that accentuate your upper body if you have a pear shape. For pears , try wearing tops in bright colors and prints to draw attention to your upper body. Stick to dark pants and skirts to slim your hips and waistline. [6] X Research source Avoid details, like beads or other embellishments, at the hip or rear, since these can draw attention to those areas. Go with wide necklines, like boat-necks, scoop-necks, and sweetheart necks, to broaden your shoulders and emphasize your bust."

      "content": "Accentuate your waist and legs if you have an inverted triangle body shape. If you’re an inverted triangle body shape , opt for tops with vertical stripes, A-line dresses, and bottoms that accentuate your waist and legs. Select wide-legged pants and skirts with bold, horizontal patterns to create the illusion of volume. [7] X Research source Avoid pieces that make your hips look slimmer, like pencil skirts, skinny jeans, and other tapered cuts. Stay away from boxy shoulder pads and other shoulder embellishments that draw attention to this area."

      "content": "Opt for clothes that are comfortable and fit you well. Avoid buying clothes just because they’re on sale! Always try them on first and make sure they fit you well. If the item is too long, loose, short, small, or big for you, leave it on the rack. Also, go through your current wardrobe and get rid of anything that doesn’t fit you well. [8] X Research source If you own clothes that are too small, donate them to charity or give them to a little sister or cousin. Try to avoid keeping something that “might fit you again one day” if it’s already too small. Toss out baggy clothing unless you think it can be tailored to fit you perfectly. It’s usually only worth spending money on tailoring an item if it’s something really nice, though. Keep in mind that some clothes are supposed to be loose or formfitting! However, if your clothes are dragging on the ground, or if you feel like your movements are restricted, the items don't fit well."

      "content": "Wear colors that look great with your skin’s natural undertones . No matter what your skin tone is, your skin’s undertones will fall into 1 of 3 categories: cool, warm, or neutral. Once you determine your undertones, choose clothes in colors that complement your undertones for a simple way to look polished and put-together. People with warm undertones look great in reds, oranges, yellows, ivory, browns, and gold. Cool tones match well with greens, blues, pinks, purples, and silver. If you have neutral undertones, you can pull off almost any color! Go with medium shades of any color you want and avoid pastels."

Wardrobe staples are items that never go out of style, which means you can rock them at any time and feel confident that you look stylish. It’s really easy to build an outfit around staple pieces, especially if they’re solid colors that you can mix-and-match with other items in your closet. [9] X Research source Classic staple pieces are basic white T-shirts, black leggings, neutral-colored cardigans, long-sleeved button-down shirts, blue jeans, and black leather jackets. Don't cater too much to the trends—these usually last just a season. Wear trendy pieces as accents and mix these up with your basic pieces."

      "content": "Opt for pieces in contrasting solid colors to create visual interest. Contrasting colors break up your outfit and keep it from looking uniform. When choosing contrasting colors, try to stay within the same shade range. If you start with a neutral, pair it with a contrasting neutral. [11] X Research source For example, pair a jewel-toned color with another jewel-toned color. If your base piece is pastel, choose a contrasting pastel piece to go with it. Pairing a white top with black jeans is a simple way to make your neutral outfit pop. Neutrals work in any season. Wear a pastel pink skirt with a pastel blue polo shirt for a cute spring look. A burgundy long-sleeved shirt under a sleeveless forest-green corduroy dress would be great for fall."

      "content": "Try a half-tuck so that your shape isn’t swallowed up by a baggy top. You can always tuck in your shirt completely, but if you’re styling a casual outfit with a loose top, experiment with tucking half of the front of the top into your pants. That way, your waist isn’t lost in baggy layers and your outfit looks a little more polished. For example, half-tuck a loose sweater into regular fit blue jeans for a cozy, stylish look that doesn’t swallow you whole."

      "content": "Choose a third layer in a complementary or contrasting color and texture. Layers can quickly elevate any outfit and create a more stylish vibe. Cardigans, hoodies, tights, vests, and jackets are typically considered to be third layers. Select colors that tie into or contrast with your outfit. Opt for fabrics with a different texture than your base items. [14] X Research source For example, pair a pumpkin-colored cable knit cardigan with a burgundy silk top and dark wash skinny jeans. Elevate a basic white T-shirt and blue jeans with a black leather moto jacket. Top off your outfit with a well-cut blazer or fuzzy cardigan in a contrasting color."

      "content": "Go with cuts and styles that flatter each other when building layers. Create a streamlined look by selecting layers that make sense with the cut and style of your base pieces. It can be fun to pair contrasting styles, but wearing layers in similar styles always looks put-together and effortless! For example, avoid wearing bulky or baggy layers on top of fitted pieces. If you're wearing skinny jeans and a fitted shirt, top it off with a slim-cut cardigan or perfectly tailored blazer for a polished ensemble. If you're wearing an edgy graphic T-shirt with your favorite band's name emblazoned on the front, pull on a leather jacket and biker boots to complete your street-ready look."
