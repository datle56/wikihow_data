      "title": "Come up with a theme and a short, suspenseful storyline.",
      "content": "Come up with a theme and a short, suspenseful storyline. One of the key aspects of a great escape room is a “good story and having that ‘wow’ effect,” says Melkus. Pick a theme that’s appealing to most people in your group, advises D’Onofrio, and keep in mind what everyone will be interested and engaged in. If you’re designing an escape room for a specific reason—like a classroom lesson or a friend’s birthday party—then you may want to choose a theme related to your event. [1] X Research source For instance, if your students are learning about astronomy, have a mission where they’re trying to escape the International Space Station and make their way back to Earth. Or, let’s say you’ve bought your friend plane tickets to Edinburgh for their birthday. Set your game in a mysterious Scottish castle and have the final “prize” be their plane tickets! Once you’ve come up with a basic idea for your theme and story, write it out on a piece of paper. Write your story with a beginning, middle, and end, says Melkus, keeping it to about 200 words in length. Make sure that your story includes some challenges, twists and turns, and some element of mystery, fantasy, or suspense. Consider adding some sort of “deadline” that makes sense in the story so that the players feel more pressured to escape the room quickly. Story example: While exploring the ruins of ancient Pompeii, you stumble into a secret room that’s been sealed shut for centuries. As you begin to look around the room, the door suddenly slams shut. You push against the door but realize you’re locked inside before noticing that the walls are beginning to slowly close in on you. You have 60 minutes before the walls crush you, so you have to quickly move about the room to find your way out."

      "title": "Create roughly 8-15 puzzles that connect to your storyline.",
      "content": "Create roughly 8-15 puzzles that connect to your storyline. Try to find puzzles that will match your storyline and “make sense with the theme that you’re doing,” says D’Onofrio. “If you’re doing a bank robbery scene, let’s say, doing puzzles with tennis balls or balloons doesn’t make sense with the theme that you chose. So, try to make the puzzles match the theme.” Similarly, if you have an escape room that takes place in the past (e.g., an “Escape the Disco” game set in the 1970s), avoid using modern-day technology like smartphones, Wi-Fi, or digital watches. Full-length escape rooms are typically about 1 hour long with about 8-15 puzzles. You might tweak the final number based on the skill level of your players and the complexity of each of your clues. Once you’ve put together your list of puzzles, organize them from easiest to most difficult. This step will help you determine if you have too many easy puzzles or too many hard ones; too easy, and the game will fly by, too difficult, and players will get frustrated. “You don’t want to make it too tough where the group always has to ask for help,” adds D’Onofrio. “You want them to be able to do the whole room by themselves…, so make the puzzles solvable—not too easy and not too hard.” For some of the more challenging puzzles, prepare some hints ahead of time in case players get stuck. Keep your hints short and relatively vague, rather than giving the full answer away to players. You could even create rhyming or riddle-like hints to make them more fun and cryptic."

      "title": "Make a chart to plan how the puzzles connect to one another.",
      "content": "Make a chart to plan how the puzzles connect to one another. Once you’ve come up with the types of puzzles you want, you now have to connect them together—which is one of the most crucial but time-consuming parts of building an escape room. The easiest way for most people to visualize how their clues connect is to create a chart out of all the clues on a piece of paper. Then, you can make modifications as needed—adding, removing, or tweaking clues so that they’ll effectively lead players to their final solution; escaping the room! [2] X Research source Draw as many circles or squares as there are clues onto a large piece of paper—space out the shapes well. Write each clue inside a different shape. Then, draw lines and arrows between any clues that connect to each other. For instance, if you have to crack a code in order to get a key that opens a safe, you’d draw an arrow leading from the code-cracking to the safe, since it’s necessary to complete that puzzle before the next one (which is the safe). As you draw your chart, you have the option of creating a simultaneous game or a purely linear game. Linear games are more simple—one clue leads directly to the next, and the next, and the next, etc. In a simultaneous game, D’Onofrio explains, players can work on different challenges all at once, with each one contributing to the ultimate goal of the game. Before finalizing your chart and flow of clues, make sure that no clues can be skipped. In other words, if there are any later clues that players can solve without needing the prior ones, then those previous challenges are worthless and are better changed or left out."

Choose a fairly spacious area in which to build your escape room —this could be a room in your home, a classroom, a backyard, or even a whole apartment! Remove any objects that are not part of the game from the room. You could leave a few random objects behind as red herrings, but if you leave too many false clues, then players will end up wasting time and become frustrated or bored. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a checklist of your puzzles and what you need for them. To keep track of all the details of your escape room and the tasks you must complete to put them together, it’s helpful to create a long to-do list of every single item you need to put together your room. If just one thing is out of place, your whole game could fall apart! Start by dividing your tasks into ahead-of-time tasks and last-minute tasks. [4] X Research source “Ahead-of-time” tasks are things you can do at any time—even hours or days before your players arrive and your game is ready to be played—like creating a secret code or locking a clue in a box. “Last-minute” tasks, on the other hand, must be done right before players arrive—for instance, a Morse code task done with a cell phone should be set up right before the game starts, or the cell phone battery may die before the hour is up. Make sure your checklist includes every single part of your game—go puzzle by puzzle and think through everything you need to buy, collect, and do to put together that puzzle. Add everything you can think of to the list. Once you’ve completed your checklist, complete each item in a timely manner leading up to the date of your final escape room!"

Try to make your game as immersive as possible so that your players really feel like they’re in the story. Play thematic music in the background. Decorate the space with posters, objects, and other pieces of decor that fit the storyline. Serve up some drinks and snacks for players to nibble on as they play. [5] X Research source If you want to go the extra mile, consider sending a themed invitation to your players to invite them to the escape room party ahead of time. You could even ask players to dress according to the theme—that will make your game truly immersive!"

For instance, if you’re doing a Sherlock Holmes escape room, write out one of Dr. Watson’s journal entries so that it fills up the whole page. Identify words (or letters) in the text that would spell out instructions for players to find their next clue. On the second piece of paper, cut small squares or rectangles that align with the “clue” words or letters in your text document. When players position the second paper over the first one, each whole will reveal just one word or letter from the text underneath. Players should be able to connect these “decoded” letters to find their next clue."

Scatter these pieces of yarn throughout the room, and hide a measuring tape somewhere as well. However, players still need to know which order to put the string lengths in so they come up with the correct code. In order to give them the right order, draw three colored dots on a piece of paper that correspond to your yarn colors.
