      "title": "Most guys like \"cute\" if it’s sincere or they think you like them.",
      "content": "Most guys like \"cute\" if it’s sincere or they think you like them. Men enjoy compliments on their looks and personality as much as women, even if they don’t show it. If a guy is trying hard to impress you, he’ll be extra weak in the knees when you call him cute because he’ll feel like he’s winning you over. Chances are he’ll enjoy the compliment more than he’ll let on. [1] X Research source Not all guys are the same. Some might be uncomfortable with cute because it has childish or feminine associations. If a guy is secure in his masculinity, he’ll brush off being called cute without a problem if he doesn’t like it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "It might make him feel softer.",
      "content": "It might make him feel softer. Sometimes, a guy needs to know it’s OK to let his walls down and get in touch with his emotions. The word “cute” might make him feel comfortable and secure enough around you to open up a little bit—he might even tell you something he's never mentioned before. [3] X Research source It seems like a small gesture, but quick compliments like “cute” can really boost his emotional self-esteem and confidence."

      "title": "It could help him realize there’s no shame in being called cute.",
      "content": "It could help him realize there’s no shame in being called cute. “Cute” is stereotypically used to describe girls, children, or pets, so some guys might feel like they’re being friend-zoned, not taken seriously, or effeminate. When you add a brief explanation about why you said the word cute, though, a guy might grow less uncomfortable with that term. He’ll see that it’s a genuine compliment about something romantic or sensitive he did. [4] X Research source “I loved watching you play with those kids. You were really cute.” “I think you’re so cute when you open doors for me.” “You were so nice to that old man at the bakery. You’re so cute.”"

    {
      "title": "It may make him feel loved.",
      "content": "It may make him feel loved. “Cute” is a sign of affection that lets a guy know you like and care about him. Men are usually complemented less than women, so even a one-syllable word like “cute” can make them feel important and good about themselves. It also shows that you view him as kind and caring. A study from the University of Kansas showed that guys called “cute” by their partners were happier in relationships and had less stress and anxiety."

    {
      "title": "It boosts their confidence.",
      "content": "It boosts their confidence. When someone calls a guy cute, it will probably go to his head a little bit (in a good way!). He might feel better about himself or more attractive to others than before. Saying a guy is cute also implies that you find something attractive about him—probably a personality trait of his, like kindness or caring. That will definitely make a guy feel like he’s worthy of affection."
    },
    {
      "title": "It shows that you’re close with him.",
      "content": "It shows that you’re close with him. Calling a guy cute shows that you have a comfortable bond (as friends or maybe as more than friends). Deep down, some guys are afraid they’re being led on and might get hurt, so “cute” is a way to reassure him that you genuinely care for him. It’s a great expression of affection and friendship. [5] X Research source Always call a guy cute sincerely. He may not trust you or feel comfortable around you if he thinks you’re just saying it."
    },
    {
      "title": "It might make him feel small or uninteresting.",
      "content": "It might make him feel small or uninteresting. This usually happens when he’s called cute in front of other people. He may think that onlookers (including female peers) are assuming he’s not attractive, intelligent, or manly enough for other compliments. Instead of standing out, he could end up feeling like just another guy friend with little to offer. [6] X Research source A guy might prefer to feel strong and capable rather than small and cuddly or cute because of the societal expectations put on men."
    },
    {
      "title": "It might not sound very masculine to him.",
      "content": "It might not sound very masculine to him. There’s a stigma around guys being cute because the word is so often used for things like toys, clothing, and “girly things.” For some guys, cute is a bad word because it makes them feel less manly, strong, or imposing than they’d like. [7] X Research source A guy might prefer “tougher” terms like handsome, babe, or big guy. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "“Cute” could make him feel unattractive.",
      "content": "“Cute” could make him feel unattractive. If a guy is self-conscious about his appearance, it might be because he doesn’t feel he has the rugged or masculine look that society rewards other men for. If he’s got that insecurity, being called cute could make him feel physically unattractive or less handsome than other guys. [9] X Research source Guys with slimmer frames or softer facial features may feel this way about the word cute. Men have a wide variety of face shapes, none of which are really more or less “masculine” than others."

    {
      "title": "He might think you’re friend-zoning him.",
      "content": "He might think you’re friend-zoning him. If a guy likes you or wants to get closer to you, “cute” might come off as dismissive or make him think you don’t take him seriously as more than a friend. This could make him feel disappointed or discouraged instead of more confident or comfortable around you. [10] X Research source For example, saying “Aw, that’s cute” when he shows you a romantic gesture to get your attention might come off as condescending."
    },
    {
      "title": "He might be uncomfortable with compliments in general.",
      "content": "He might be uncomfortable with compliments in general. A lot of guys struggle to accept a compliment because of self-doubt or insecurity. He might not be comfortable in his own skin or he could be extra sensitive because he has feelings for you. He may seem awkward or appear less confident after you compliment him or call him “cute” specifically."

    {
      "title": "Test the waters with “adorable” first.",
      "content": "Test the waters with “adorable” first. Adorable has a little more feeling to it, so call him that when he’s being, well, adorable (like if he’s playing with a puppy or making silly faces to amuse you). If he reacts well or doesn’t seem to mind being called adorable, chances are he’s fine with a casual “cute” too. Make sure to use this when he’s doing something actually adorable. It might sound demeaning if you call him adorable while he’s working out, for example."

    {
      "title": "Call him cute and read his body language or facial expressions.",
      "content": "Call him cute and read his body language or facial expressions. If a guy smiles, blushes, or laughs when you call him cute, there’s a good chance he’s into it. He might also stand up straighter or lean in closer to you if he thinks he’s impressing you and wants you to like him. If his expression or body language doesn’t change much or if he starts to look withdrawn or irritated, he may not be into it."

      "title": "Make it clear you’re using “cute” in a positive way.",
      "content": "Make it clear you’re using “cute” in a positive way. Let him know that you’re being genuine or find him attractive when you call him cute. Get specific with what makes him cute to you—is it his style? His jokes? His kindness? He’ll react negatively to it if he thinks you’re making fun of him or dismissing him, but chances are he’ll dig it if he thinks you really mean it or have a real interest in him. For example: “That’s a great jacket. You look really cute!” “I love that you volunteer so much, it’s really cute.” “You’re so cute, your jokes crack me up every time!” Keep in mind that it’s harder to tell what you mean over text than it is during an in-person interaction."

    {
      "title": "Ask him how he feels about it.",
      "content": "Ask him how he feels about it. If you think cute might be making him uncomfortable, pick a time when you’re both free and in a good mood to have a quick chat. Start your conversation positively and ask how he feels when you call him cute. Be an active listener and try to see his perspective on it. Don’t take it personally if he doesn’t care for it—every guy thinks differently about the word “cute.” If he doesn’t like it, work with him to find an alternative compliment he likes or a different solution to the issue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call him attractive with words like handsome, babe, hot, or sexy.",
      "content": "Call him attractive with words like handsome, babe, hot, or sexy. Use a punchier, more masculine word to describe his good looks. Just call him the word (“Hey there, handsome”) or get specific with what you find attractive (“You look sexy when you wear your glasses”). He’ll definitely feel more attractive and confident after hearing compliments like these: “You look so handsome in your new suit.” “Hey there hottie, I like your new haircut.” “Your smile is so sexy.”"

    {
      "title": "Use a variation of his name or give him a nickname.",
      "content": "Use a variation of his name or give him a nickname . Rhyme his name with something he enjoys or just shorten it to sound more casual. Get creative with it and make it as masculine or cute as he likes. A special name that only you have for him will make him feel loved and close to you, no matter what. For example: [11] X Research source “It’s Dan the Man!” “Hey there Robbie Bob!” “You look so handsome today, Big Mike.”"

    {
      "title": "Try something sweet like my love, honey, darling, sweetie, or bae.",
      "content": "Try something sweet like my love, honey, darling, sweetie, or bae. Use these terms of endearment if you’re already in a relationship with a guy (it might come off as a bit too much otherwise). Ask him if there’s one he prefers or doesn’t like (maybe an ex used to call him “honey,” for example). These show you care about him and are in tune with his more sensitive, teddy bear side. [12] X Research source “Hey honey, it was so fun watching you coach those kids.” “You’re my one true bae.” “Sweetie, your smile makes me weak!”"

      "title": "Call him something sporty or animated like tiger, champ, or big guy.",
      "content": "Call him something sporty or animated like tiger, champ, or big guy. Make him feel cool with names that imply he’s active, competitive, or a winner. Think about names you might hear guys call each other—it could feel a bit weird to use them at first, but the satisfaction he gets from getting called something impressive like “tiger” will make up for it. Try things like: [13] X Research source “Whoa tiger, let’s wait until we get home.” “You did it, champ! That was an impressive goal.” “Oh hey big guy, you’re looking good today.”"

      "title": "Give him an honest compliment on his style or personality.",
      "content": "Give him an honest compliment on his style or personality. Pick something you like about a guy, like his clothes or the way he talks, and just tell him. For example, if you want to compliment his eyes , just say “You have gorgeous eyes.” Say what you really think or feel—the less you try to woo or impress him with compliments, the better he’ll take them. Try things like: “Your mind is as sexy as your looks.” “I love your style.” “You’re different from other guys. There’s something about you.” “You make me feel like I can do anything.” “You’re so good at what you do.”"
