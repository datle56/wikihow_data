[10] X Research source For an easy option, follow along with a video workout. If you want to choose your own cardio activity, set a time goal for your workout, like 15–20 minutes. After a 5 to 10 minute warm up , do cycles of hard exercise and recovery. If you're a beginner, you might run or cycle at top speed for 20 seconds, then jog or peddle slowly for 2 minutes to recover. Then, try doing 10 seconds of hard cardio and 20 seconds of rest. Work up to doing 20 seconds of challenging exercise with 10-second rest periods."
