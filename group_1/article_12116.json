      "content": "Check how much time must pass to be presumed dead. A person does not need to be missing for a certain amount of time to be declared dead. Instead, the government may state that after a certain number of years a person is “presumed” dead. This means that you don’t need to submit any evidence showing the person is actually dead once enough time has passed. [3] X Research source For example, your government may state that a person is presumed dead if they have been missing seven years. If you have had continuous lack of contact for more than seven years, then you don’t need to show that it is likely the person is dead. However, you don’t have to wait seven years. For example, someone might have witnessed your spouse be swept over the side of a boat and dragged into the ocean. In this situation, the court might find that there is sufficient evidence to conclude the person likely died."
