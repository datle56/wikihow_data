      "content": "Soak feet in warm water. Use your bathtub, or fill a container large enough to submerge your feet in. Soaking your feet in warm water will benefit your feet in a handful of different ways, such as hydrating your skin, soothing any foot pain, and getting them ready to be exfoliated. Try putting some Epsom salt into your foot bath. Epsom salt is used for a number of conditions, but it can help your dry heels by soothing the dry skin and killing off bacteria or fungi that might be in the skin. Sit in the foot bath for at least 5 minutes. Stay in it longer if you have the time. The longer you let your feet soak, the easier it will be to scrub off dead skin when the time comes to exfoliate. Staying in for a window of 5-15 minutes is ideal. But don’t soak and treat your feet this way more than 3 times a week, as it could ultimately dry out your feet."

      "content": "Use a foot file to remove dead skin. If you don’t already have a foot file, they are easy to find in the beauty or personal care aisle of your local grocery or big box store. One side of the foot file will look a little bit like a grater, while the other side will have a sandpaper surface. You can opt to file your feet while they are still dry, prior to soaking. Sometimes wet skin makes it more difficult to see the driest areas of your heels, so you can file your heels before soaking and scrubbing if you choose. [1] X Research source Be careful not to file your heels too much. Once you notice the skin feeling smoother and softer, move on to another spot or your other foot. Over filing might lead to your skin being more sensitive, or prone to drying out again much faster. Avoid filing your feet more than three times a week."

Make sure you put on a thick layer, then let it soak in before putting on another."

      "content": "Avoid wearing open shoes or walking barefoot. You may have noticed that your heels suffer when you wear very flat and open-backed shoes, like flip-flops or sandals. When you expose your heels by wearing these shoes or walking barefoot, they are more prone to dryness, cracking, and irritation. Walking barefoot or in open-backed shoes will cause your skin to callus to create a protective barrier on your feet. By keeping your feet in closed shoes, your skin will not have to generate this callused barrier. When possible, wear socks and closed shoes, like tennis shoes or sneakers. Not only will this protect the skin on your heels, but it will also help your posture and joint health by supporting your arches."
