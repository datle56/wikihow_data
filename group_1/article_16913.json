When choosing a club, request brochure or URL information on what additional benefits and discounts club membership will bring you and your family or friends. Some key parts of the club to keep in mind are: price--is it an annual fee? Can you be refunded if you are unhappy with the club? Does the club offer useful discounts? Do you get discounts at specific RV parks and, if so, how much are the discounts? Do you get discounts at RV service centers, on RV products, or at RV rental agencies? Does the club provide assistance if you need it? Do they offer roadside assistance, emergency assistance, or RV insurance?"
