The symptoms are general intestinal upset, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. These symptoms usually start or get worse after eating certain, sugar-containing foods. If you experience these symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor to determine the cause. [3] X Research source If your doctor isn’t a GI specialist, then they will probably refer you to a gastroenterologist for more expert treatment. Sugar intolerance symptoms look a lot like other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome. This is why seeing a doctor is important. That way, you can find out the exact cause and treatment for your symptoms. Sugar intolerances usually start during childhood, so pay attention if your child is showing these symptoms as well. An affected child may also grow more slowly because their bodies aren’t absorbing nutrients properly."
