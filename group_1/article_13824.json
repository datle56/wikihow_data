Use a gym mat if you have one, or find a nice patch of soft grass in a park or your back yard. Make sure you have plenty of room, and won't wind up crashing into any furniture, etc.!"

This will be just like a two-handed cartwheel, but place your near-arm (the same arm as your lead foot) behind your back, and practice taking the normal first step you would take, and then placing your far-arm down on the ground 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) from your lead foot and stepping through. Focus on keeping your feet and your hand in a straight line. Do this a few times to help you visualize what it's going to be like. [4] X Research source Putting a line of tape on the floor to use as a guideline can really help you keep your cartwheels centered. [5] X Research source How far out you place your hand depends on your height and how fast your are moving. It might take some experimentation to find just the right distance."

Now put your near-arm out to the side or behind your back to remind yourself not to use it (if your right foot is forward, put your right hand behind your back). If you are afraid of falling, try just bending your arm a bit, instead of putting it behind your back. This way you're still reminding yourself not to put the hand down, but can catch yourself if you start to fall. [6] X Research source"

If you are too nervous about falling to give it your all, ask someone to spot you until you build up more confidence. If your cartwheels tend to go off to one side or the other you may not have your hand positioned correctly, or may not be lining your feet up in a straight line.
