      "title": "Remove the book from its damp environment.",
      "content": "Remove the book from its damp environment. Many books grow moldy or musty due to living in a damp environment, such as a kitchen or bathroom. To combat your bookâ€™s smell, you must first remove it from the problematic environment. [1] X Research source If your book is wet, be sure to dry it before using any of the deodorizing methods."

    {
      "title": "Place your books in a sealed container with baking soda.",
      "content": "Place your books in a sealed container with baking soda. Set your books inside of a sealed container, such as a piece of large tupperware, alongside an open canister of baking soda. The sealed environment will provide a way for the baking soda to absorb both moisture and odors from your book. [2] X Research source Clay cat litter and cornstarch can also be used to absorb odor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow the soda to sit for a few days.",
      "content": "Allow the soda to sit for a few days. Set your books aside in an area they will not be disturbed for 3-7 days. This will give the baking soda plenty of time to absorb both the moisture in the books, and the offending odor. Hardcover books may need to sit closer to seven days, as the cover can hold in more moisture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the baking soda and books from the container.",
      "content": "Remove the baking soda and books from the container. Check for any remaining smells or damp pages. If your book is still damp or still contains unpleasant smells, place your materials back into your sealed container for 2-4 more days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store in an a dry area.",
      "content": "Store in an a dry area. To prevent further molding or mildewing, opt out of storing your books in more humid areas. Cookbooks, for instance, can be stored in a dining room instead of a kitchen, and bathroom interest books can be set on a shelf just outside of the bathroom. Avoid storing books in areas such as the basement and attic, as most basements and attics are prone to encouraging mold growth and developing excessive moisture contents."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use protective breathing tools.",
      "content": "Use protective breathing tools. Any time you work with mold or mildew, you want to make sure you are not breathing in any spores. Before you begin, place a mask over your nose and mouth. If you are prone to watery eyes, you may also want to wear a pair of protective glasses. [3] X Research source If you have asthma or any type of respiratory issues, do not attempt mold clean-up yourself. Mold can aggravate breathing conditions quickly, and could even prove fatal."

    {
      "title": "Wipe away any visible mold growth.",
      "content": "Wipe away any visible mold growth. Locate any visible sources of mold in your book and gently wipe them away using cloth dampened with alcohol or peroxide. Although alcohol may not remove all of the staining caused by mold or mildew, it will kill the spores and should eliminate the bulk of the smell. [4] X Research source If your books contain a lot of mold or mildew, you may need to take them to a professional for cleaning."

    {
      "title": "Dry your books immediately.",
      "content": "Dry your books immediately. Make sure you dry your books after you have finished cleaning them. You can use an air dry method, or you can dry them with a hair dryer. The method you choose will depend on the speed you require and the age of the books. Newer books will not be drastically degraded by being dried with a hair dryer, while old pages may be damaged by high heat."

    {
      "title": "Store in a dry area.",
      "content": "Store in a dry area. To prevent additional mold growth, make sure you store your books in a dry area. If your books are old or particularly prone to damage, you may want to store them permanently in airtight containers, such as large tupperware bins."

    {
      "title": "Choose a sunny, open area.",
      "content": "Choose a sunny, open area. The sun can work wonders in speeding up drying time while offering an antimicrobial effect for your books. Find a spot outdoors safe from animals and bugs, and place your books in the sun. [5] X Research source This method is best for newer books, as old books can actually be damaged by exposure to sunlight. If you do not have an open area with access to sunlight, find a large, sunny window."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the book open and upright.",
      "content": "Place the book open and upright. With the pages facing the sun, place your book upright, fanning the pages out as much as you can. This will allow the maximum amount of sunlight and warmth to reach your book. The more warmth and sunlight your book receives, the faster it will dry. [6] X Research source Make sure the pages do not clump or stick together, as sunlight could encourage already-tacky pages to stick together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry for 2-3 days.",
      "content": "Dry for 2-3 days. Dry your book in this fashion for 2-3 days to eliminate any lingering odors or moisture. The sun will both dry and deodorize your book, while drying the pages will prevent the growth of mold. To prevent dampness from recurring during the drying period, bring books inside during the night and place them back outside once the sun is shining. If you cannot keep your books safely outside for this period, you can also use a large indoor space with access to a window."
