      "content": "Try to tailor your look to fit with the style of the club. If you’re heading to a more laid back club, loosen up your collar or opt for jeans instead of slacks. But if you’re heading to a more upscale club, dress more formally. When in doubt, do an online search of the club to read up on their expected dress code. Outfit ideas include: A nice, well tailored button down collared shirt. Avoid golf shirts or generic corporate looking shirts (blue stripes, checks, ‘boardroom blue’). And don’t forget to tuck in your shirt! Jeans that fit. Baggy jeans are so 90s, and not in a good way. Opt for a nice pair of jeans that fit you well and hug, rather than hang, on you. A pair of loafers or oxfords. Look for shoes made of polished leather, but avoid pointy toes or square toed shoes, as these styles aren’t considered stylish. Avoid athletic wear or athletic shoes. Though not all clubs have very formal dress codes, most clubs will not allow anyone wearing athletic shoes or athletic wear to get past the doormen. So, leave the gym wear at home."

Though black is usually seen as the safe and sophisticated option, clubs are usually covered in black light bulbs that can show off dandruff, lint, etc on black.

      "title": "Do your hair.",
      "content": "Do your hair. While every woman may have their own hair routine, some women may want to spend time deciding on a hairstyle. Maybe you have a go to hairstyle like a high ponytail or loose curls, or want to change it up and try a new hairstyle like a messy braid or straightened hair. Whatever you decide to do, make sure you hair looks healthy, shiny and put together. Don’t forget to apply anti-frizz products to your hair to prepare your hair for the humidity of a packed club and ensure you look good throughout the night."

      "title": "Do your make up.",
      "content": "Do your make up. Focus on enhancing the aspects of your look that you love, and bringing out your best features. But avoid putting on too much makeup as this can hide your true beauty, rather than emphasize it. Before you begin, clean and moisturize your skin before applying makeup. Wash or wipe your face skin and apply a moisturizer to create a better canvas for your makeup. Begin with foundation and concealer. Depending on how much foundation you usually use, decide if you want to apply a bit more on for your night out, and dab concealer on anything on your face you want to cover up or mask. Make sure to check the mirror constantly and to keep blending uneven areas with a sponge or brush. Blush and bronzer are also a great way to add some depth and color once you’ve applied your foundation. Keep the blush color above the nose to avoid making your face look sagging. Next, focus on your eyes. Decide if you’re going for a certain look, like cat eye or smoky eye, or if you’re more into a natural, simple look with minimal eyeliner and mascara. Don’t forget to apply waterproof mascara so you don’t end up with makeup on your face while you’re dancing with your girls. There are several eye makeup tutorials online for almost any look you can think of. [3] X Research source Move on to your lips. Choose a bold shade if you kept your eye make up simple or go for a more subtle shade if your eye makeup is already bold or bright. Use lip liner or a lip pencil to keep your lipstick in place, or opt for a shiny lip gloss. [4] X Research source Though it may be tempting to match your makeup with the rest of your outfit, this can end up looking too matchy matchy and tacky. When in doubt, go a makeup look that compliments, rather than matches, your outfit."

      "content": "Choose an outfit based on the dress code of the club. If you are going to a venue that is known for its cool downtown crowd, skip the business suit and very formal get up. But if you’re going to a venue known for a more upscale crowd, maybe a more dressy outfit is a good idea. Tailor your look to the venue, as this will ensure the doorman lets you in and you feel confident walking into the venue."

Choose an outfit based on the parts of your body you aren’t afraid to flaunt and show some skin based on your comfort level. Remember ladies, you are dressing for yourself, before anyone else. Outfit ideas include: A crop top or blouse and a skirt A form fitting dress A pair of nice dress pants and a dressy top Jeans can be uncomfortable if you tend to sweat in the club, so avoid them. If you have a hard time walking in sky high heels, wear your favorite pair of heeled boots or low heels instead. As well, it’s best to avoid running shoes as they usually aren’t considered formal enough for entry into most clubs."

Depending on your climate, this can be a challenge, as you don't want to have to stand in the dreaded coat check line, but you also don't want to freeze your butt off. If you live in a warmer climate, this won't be an issue. But if you live in a colder climate, go for a leather jacket you won't sweat too much in or layer up your coat with a thin sweater. You can also get creative and choose an outfit that will keep you warm, but also ensure you look good, also known as \"sexy winter clubwear\"."
