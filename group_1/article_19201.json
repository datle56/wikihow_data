      "title": "Avoid UV exposure.",
      "content": "Avoid UV exposure. People who live closer to the equator are exposed to more ultra-violet (UV) radiation, so their cells produce more melanin. This excess melanin leads to a darker skin pigmentation that helps the skin protect itself from UV damage. Keeping out of the sun will keep skin from producing extra melanin, which may help the pigment return to a paler state. [1] X Expert Source Kimberly Tan Licensed Esthetician Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. If your skin is naturally dark, however, staying out of the sun won't do much. Keep out of the sun as much as possible, especially in the late morning and afternoon. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you must be outside while the sun is brightest, try to stick to the shade. Try carrying an umbrella to protect yourself from the sun. A regular black umbrella that’s designed to keep you dry in the rain will also block out at least 90 percent of UV rays. Remember that sunlight and UV rays bounce off concrete, water, sand, snow, and other surfaces. Be aware of your environment!"

      "content": "Wear protective clothing. Most summer-weight clothing (e.g. cotton garments) does not provide a measurable amount of sun protection.

The sun is necessary for vitamin D production, but most people don’t need more than 20 minutes of uncovered exposure. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use foundation and concealer sparingly. These cosmetics items can be used to help create an appearance of paler skin. However, the effect may look artificial if you try to use a shade that's much lighter than your skin. Instead, choose the shade that best matches your skin tone – perhaps even one that is slightly lighter, since you're trying to get paler skin. Use foundation or concealer to cover minor blemishes. This will create a blank canvas on which to apply the rest of your makeup. Try a BB cream to help even out your complexion and cover blemishes or splotchy patches."
