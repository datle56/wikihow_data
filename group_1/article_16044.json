      "content": "Identify where Salandit can be found. It's found at Route 8 during both the daytime and nighttime, and at the bottom of Wela Volcano Park during any time of the day. You have a 20% chance of finding it at Route 8, and a 30% chance of finding it at Wela Volcano Park. You'll find it at anywhere from level 16 to level 20. If you’re going to look for Salandit at Wela Volcano Park, make sure that you complete the trial there first, since in order for you to be able to catch Pokémon at a trial site, that trial will need to have been successfully completed first."

      "content": "Catch a female Salandit. Only female Salandit are able to evolve; male Salandit will not evolve at all. This can be difficult, since Salandit has only a 12.5% of being female. The easiest way to find one is to use a male Pokémon with the ability Cute Charm at the lead of your party. Cute Charm makes it easier to find a Pokémon of the opposite gender. Sylveon is a good Pokémon for this, since most Eevee are male, and Sylveon gets Cute Charm as its regular ability."
