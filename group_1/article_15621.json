      "title": "Elope at a courthouse for the simplest route.",
      "content": "Elope at a courthouse for the simplest route. Choosing to elope by registering with the government is not only the most straightforward way but also best if you want to avoid all the fuss of weddings. If you want, you can make it just between the two of you. Plus, you won't have to fuss around with all of the legal documents. [1] X Research source Make sure you bring all necessary documents with you: take government-issued IDs, birth certificates, social security cards, and (depending on your country) blood test results."

      "title": "Hire an officiant if you'd prefer to elope at a specific location.",
      "content": "Hire an officiant if you'd prefer to elope at a specific location. Most countries will require an officiant of some sort, but that doesn't have to consign your wedding to the courthouse. If you'd like, you can choose a scenic location or a spot that means a lot to both of you. As long as you have an officiant to verify the vows, the world is your oyster. If you're hiring an officiant, you don't have to stick to the classic vows. Make them unique to your relationship: don't be afraid to get sentimental, sweet, or even silly. Some officiants will complete all of the marriage paperwork for you, after charging a fee. Ask your prospective officiant whether they offer this service."

      "title": "Do the paperwork yourself to elope over time.",
      "content": "Do the paperwork yourself to elope over time. If life is busy right now and, in all ways except legally you consider yourself married, you can skip the ceremony altogether. Fill out the paperwork on your own and send it in when you're both ready. Ask a certified officiant to send the paperwork in for you to officially seal the deal. Some countries don't require an officiant but just need witnesses present while filling out the paperwork. In this case, you may be able to send in the paperwork by yourself."

      "content": "Invite your family to the elopement for a \"quasi-wedding.\" You don't have to elope alone; in fact, elopement is the perfect opportunity to organize a close-knit ceremony. Invite your closest friends and relatives as you commit to your vows and have a small but fun get-together afterward. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Go to Vegas for the novelty. Where's the only place in the world you can hire Elvis (impersonators) as wedding officiants? Vegas, baby! For U.S. citizens, eloping in Las Vegas, Nevada is a wedding and honeymoon all in one, and wedding licenses are easy to procure: no waiting periods or blood tests required. [3] X Research source Most wedding chapels in Vegas are open 24/7, every day of the year. Allow for at least four hours when marrying in Vegas. Unless you make wedding reservations, the lines can be long."

      "title": "Budget your money to cover legal costs.",
      "content": "Budget your money to cover legal costs. Between weddings and elopements, the latter is cheaper but that doesn't make it free. Court fees, license costs, and payment for your officiant can all add up. Decide on the amount you're willing to pay with your partner and avoid going over-budget. [4] X Research source Eloping can cost as little as $100 to several thousand dollars. Compared to the average wedding cost ($26,000), this is by far the budget-friendly way to get married.

      "content": "Make sure you're old enough to marry. While you can get engaged at any age, most countries only allow couples to marry after both are of legal age (between 17-22). The age that you can get married with parental consent varies between countries but can range from 12-17. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Obtain a marriage license. Your country will require different documentation depending on their policies. Some even require waiting periods up to three days before your marriage is considered legal. Contact your local legal department to acquire all necessary documents for a marriage license. [7] X Research source If you live in a location that requires a blood test, you can usually get the requirement waived via informed consent."

      "title": "Check if your government requires a marriage officiant or witness.",
      "content": "Check if your government requires a marriage officiant or witness. Most countries require a marriage officiant, and many have set requirements for who can officiate a wedding. Licensed ministers, clergymen, ship captains, or justices of the peace are all typical officiants. In locations that do not require officiants, a witness will be required to verify the marriage. [8] X Research source In the United States, the exception to this rule is Florida, which does not require a witness. [9] X Research source In a pinch, have a close friend register as an ordained minister online. This process can require as little as several hours' time and a nominal fee. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill out a prenuptial agreement. If your elopement is sudden, you might want to file a prenuptial agreement with your future spouse. Prenuptials are legal documents that determine what will happen to your incomes, possessions, and children (if applicable) if the marriage does not work out. [11] X Research source Have a lawyer draft or look over your prenuptial agreement to make the document official."

Ask a professional to document your vow ceremony or the ring exchange. [12] X Research source If you really want to keep the wedding intimate, ask a friend or family member to take photos."

You can wear the traditional wedding dress or tux, or you could wear something fun that expresses your personality (like a button-down with suspenders, a frilly knee-length dress, or an outfit with personal meaning). Eloping doesn't have to mean jeans and a t-shirt at the city clerk's office. [13] X Research source"

Instead, treat a few friends to a party after the ceremony. You can make a small registry, or you can ask guests to just bring themselves. Order a wedding cake, pop open a few bottles of champagne, and relax at your own mini-reception. Alternatively, go to dinner with your loved ones at a fancy restaurant after the ceremony."

Because elopement is so inexpensive, you can use some of the money you might have spent on a really nice honeymoon. If you're under time or cost restraints, spend a weekend in a nearby bed-and-breakfast or plan a staycation."
