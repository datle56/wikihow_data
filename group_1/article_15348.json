The most efficient way to open a claw: [9] X Research source Lay your knife, sharp side down, on the middle of the red side of the claw. Then use the crab mallet to gently hit the knife, until the knife is halfway through the claw. Finally, pivot the knife to the side. That will open the claw and make it easier to eat. Then snap the shell open and eat the meat, avoiding the cartilage."
