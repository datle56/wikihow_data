      "content": "Pre-set your freezer to its lowest temperature for at least 24 hours. Before putting any food into your freezer, you need to have it set to its lowest temperature for at least 24 hours. If you have a deep freezer, make sure the temperature is set to around -30°F (-34°C). If you’re using your regular home freezer, set it to the lowest temperature possible, which is typically -10°F (-23°C). Most freezers are already set to 0°F (-18°C). If your freezer doesn’t go lower than that, that’s okay; it will just take longer to dry the food. Use a freezer thermometer to test the temperature if your freezer doesn’t already have a dial."

      "content": "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut a sheet of parchment paper large enough to cover the entire baking sheet with some overhanging edges on the sides. This will save you the headache of battling to remove each piece that’s frozen to the baking sheet. [1] X Research source You can also use wax paper or plastic wrap, but these are flimsier and might tear when you pick them up."

Arranging your chopped, prepared food on the baking sheet with at least 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of room between each piece will ensure that they don’t get stuck together and that they dry evenly. Spread them into a single layer and make sure there’s no overlapping. [2] X Research source If you’re freezing different types of food at one time, like potatoes and berries, put them on 2 separate baking sheets because they’ll dry at different rates."

It’s best to have the freezer as empty as possible, but it’s okay if there are other items in there as well. [3] X Research source Do a little reorganizing so the baking sheet can sit on a level surface."

If you see any dark spots on the inside of the food, the food is not done freeze-drying (as the spots indicate moisture). Discard the tester piece and place the tray back in the freezer. [4] X Research source To test meat, take a piece out, let it warm up for about 5 to 10 minutes, and bend it in half. If you see any moisture coming out of the meat, it’s not done yet. Discard that piece and check on the rest of the batch in 1 or 2 days.

Then, transfer the pieces into a freezer bag and push as much air out the bag as possible before sealing it. [6] X Research source Use a rolling pin to gently roll as much air out the bag as possible.

Be sure to put only one type of food per bag rather than mixing different kinds of foods together. Then, push out all of the air from the bags with your hands or by rolling the air out (toward the opening) with a rolling pin. Pushing out the air ensures no ice crystals form on the food."

      "content": "Choose a storage box large enough that the bags only fill it halfway. A large styrofoam cooler or large plastic container with a lid will work nicely. Note that the box will have to fit inside your freezer, so if you have a small freezer, you may only be able to freeze dry small quantities of food at a time. Pick a plastic or styrofoam container you don’t plan to use for other purposes because you’ll need to put holes in the lid."

      "content": "Pour 1 pound (0.45 kg) of dry ice into the bottom of the box. Put on heavy-duty gloves like leather or work gloves to pour dry ice over into the bottom of the box until it forms an even layer. The amount of dry ice you need to use is equal to the weight of the food. So if you’re freezing 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of food, you’ll need about 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of dry ice. If it doesn’t cover the entire bottom of the box, add another 1 pound (0.45 kg) until it does. Depending on the width and length of the box, 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of dry ice should be enough for up to 4 layers of food. Don’t touch the dry ice with your bare hands—it will burn your skin. If you don’t have heavy-duty gloves, use oven mitts or thick kitchen towels. Purchase dry ice cubes online or at your local grocery store or supermarket."

      "title": "Poke a few holes into the lid.",
      "content": "Poke a few holes into the lid. Use a box cutter or sharp knife to cut 3 to 4 holes into the top of the box. These holes allow gas and moisture to escape, which is necessary for the dry ice to dissipate and for the food to fully dry. Avoid poking too many holes into the lid. The idea is to allow the gas to escape relatively slowly."

This process could take 24 hours or more, depending on how many layers of food you’re freeze-drying (and how much dry ice you’ve used to cover it). Wear gloves to remove the lid of the box and check the contents after 24 hours. If you don’t see any dry ice on top, shuffle the bags around with a gloved hand to check for dry ice on the bottom. If it’s all gone, the food is ready for storage. If you see any chunks of dry ice, reattach the lid, reinsert the box into the freezer, and wait for 3 to 6 hours before checking again."

Fruits and vegetables with a high water content are the easiest to freeze dry, so start with things like apples, berries, potatoes, carrots, and other veggies. You can also freeze dry cooked pasta noodles and meat (such as chicken, deli meats, steak, ground beef, fish, and shrimp). [13] X Research source Freeze-drying dairy like cheese and yogurt is possible, but it won’t have the same creamy taste and texture. Make sure to cook the meat before you freeze-dry it. It’s best to freeze dry it that same day (after letting it cool in the fridge for a few hours), but you can freeze dry meat that’s been stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Whole meals, desserts, soups, herbs, and instant coffee can be freeze-dried as well."

Cutting them into slices or chunks about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) across and less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick helps them dry out faster. Try to make each piece about the same size so they dry at the same rate. [15] X Research source If you’re freeze drying small berries like blueberries, blackberries, or raspberries, there’s no need to slice them. But when it comes to large strawberries, slice them into even chunks or slivers. If you want to freeze dry meat, cook the meat first and then slice it into strips about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. For pre-sliced deli meats, it may help to cut the slices into even strips. If you’re freeze-drying a loaf of bread, use a serrated knife to cut it into slices about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick."

      "title": "Freeze drying is the process of dehydrating and freezing food.",
      "content": "Freeze drying is the process of dehydrating and freezing food. Also known as lyophilization, freeze-drying pulls water out of a food and then freezes it to preserve it. [16] X Research source When a food is freeze-dried, its water content goes from a solid to a gaseous state, from ice to vapor. This helps preserve the food by freezing it in time. The process of freeze-drying is most commonly done with a freeze dryer or freezer. [17] X Research source Is freeze-drying more expensive? Freeze drying can get expensive if you invest in a dedicated freeze-dryer. However, it’s a relatively cheap preservation method. How do you rehydrate freeze-dried food? Some freeze-dried foods can be rehydrated by adding water or liquid. This is a great option for meats and vegetables. Simply soak or boil them."
