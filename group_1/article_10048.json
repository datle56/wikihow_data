      "title": "Fill a pan with some milk.",
      "content": "Fill a pan with some milk. The size of the pan and the amount of milk will depend upon the quantity of fish you wish to cook at one time. The pan should be large enough to accommodate all of the fillets with some room for your spatula, and there should be enough milk to just cover the filets. [1] X Research source Alternatively, half heavy cream and half water may be used. Do not use water alone, as it will pull the flavor out of the fish."

      "title": "Season with some pepper.",
      "content": "Season with some pepper. Grind fresh black pepper directly into the milk to give the haddock a little extra flavor boost. This is a good time to add other spices if desired. Other spices may include bay leaf, onion, garlic, parsley, or even dill ."

      "title": "Heat the milk.",
      "content": "Heat the milk. Do not boil the milk, but heat it to just before boiling. If the milk begins to boil over, remove it from the heat immediately until it settles. Once the milk has heated, reduce the heat to prevent boiling. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook the haddock. Allow the fish to simmer in the milk for about 10 minutes on medium heat. Alternatively, very small fillets of fish may be cooked in milk that has been removed from the heat. [3] X Research source To do this, remove the pan from the heat and cover it after the fish have been placed inside."

    {
      "title": "Check the haddock.",
      "content": "Check the haddock. When the fish are done, they will have become completely opaque, and the meat should flake apart easily. If the fish looks translucent or pieces do not come free with a gentle tug, cook the fish a bit longer. Be sure to check the widest part of the largest fillet to ensure the fish is cooked. The tapered ends of smaller fillets will be done more quickly than others."

      "content": "Serve the haddock while still hot. Poached smoked haddock, typically a British dish, is traditionally served with fresh baked bread and butter. The milk is strained off to use as a sauce, and the bread is used to mop up excess sauce off of your plate. The haddock can also be flaked and used in other recipes such as fish pie or Kedgeree.

      "content": "Place the haddock on some foil or parchment. You can use one large sheet for all of the fillets or you may decide to use separate pieces of foil or parchment for each of the fillets. Either way, the foil or parchment should be about twice the size of the filet(s) it will be covering."

      "content": "Fold the foil or parchment over the fish. After folding the covering over the fish, roll the edges together to encase the haddock. The fish should be sealed inside the packet. If desired, you could place vegetables inside the packet for additional flavor, but be aware that many hard vegetables take longer to bake than the fish will, so they may not be suitable for eating unless cooked fully prior to adding them into the fish packet.

Parchment is usually less sturdy and may need to be placed on top of a baking sheet prior to placing it in the oven. If you have made one large packet of all of the fish fillets, you may want to place the packet on a baking sheet to make it easier to handle without dropping."

If the fish looks translucent or pieces do not come free with a gentle tug, cook the fish a bit longer. Be sure to check the widest part of the largest fillet to ensure it has been cooked properly. The tapered ends of smaller fillets will be done more quickly than others."

Either approach includes adding herbs such as pepper, lemon juice, parsley, bay leaf, dill, or curry powder as well. Marinate the fish in oil by drizzling olive oil on both sides of the fish, then sprinkling herbs on top. Rub both sides of the fish slightly to cover completely in the oil an herb mixture, and allow to rest for several minutes to set the flavors. Dredge the fish in flour and herb mixture, then shake any excess flour off of the fish. [6] X Research source"

If the pan seems especially dry, you may want to add additional butter or oil when you flip the haddock over.

After pouring the sauce over the fish, the meal is complete, and should be served immediately. If you are concerned about the fish and the potatoes being cold, you could add them to the pan and toss them in the sauce over the heat, but be careful not to damage the fish fillets (they will taste great, but may not look as pretty if they are broken up while tossing in the sauce). You can top with a bit of parsley for a nice presentation."

You can place a bed of spinach between the potatoes and the haddock, or you can serve the haddock on a bed of peas in lieu of potatoes. It is also common to place a poached egg on top of each haddock filet before pouring the sauce over the meal. [13] X Research source"
