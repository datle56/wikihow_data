      "content": "Push your elbows back for a simple stretch that might crack your sternum. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your arms at the elbows and push your chest forward so it begins to stretch your rib cage area. As you move your chest forward, move your elbows and shoulders back at the same time. This movement will stretch out your chest even more, which may result in your sternum cracking. [1] X Research source Imagine trying to touch your elbows behind your back. That's the movement you should be aiming for!"

      "title": "Twist your torso side to side if your sternum hasn’t cracked.",
      "content": "Twist your torso side to side if your sternum hasn’t cracked. Bring your arms up so they're almost even with your shoulders, then bend your elbows. Twist your torso to the left as far as you can without straining, keeping your feet, knees, and hips in place. Then, twist all the way to the right. Repeat this process about 4 or 5 times, or until your sternum pops. [2] X Research source This movement will help open up your chest, which can help your sternum pop. However, even if you don’t hear a pop, you’ll likely get some pain relief just from stretching. You can do this exercise while you’re standing, or you can try it sitting down if you prefer."

      "content": "Try a doorway stretch for an easy variation on a twist. Hold one of your elbows at a 90° angle from your body, with your forearm pressed against a doorframe. Stagger your feet, then rotate your torso away from the doorframe, pressing in with your forearm to increase the resistance. Hold the stretch for 10-15 seconds, or until you hear a pop in your chest. [3] X Research source Stop doing this stretch if you feel any tingling in your chest, shoulders, or back."

      "content": "Practice the cat-cow pose to crack your sternum with yoga. Kneel on all fours, with your palms directly under your shoulders and your knees lined up with your hips. Arch your back upward and look at the floor near your feet so your back hunches, similar to the way a hissing cat looks. Stretch in this position for several seconds, then arch your back down as you look up to the ceiling, so your back has a cow-like sway to it. Hold this stretch for several seconds, then relax. Repeat the exercise about 3 times.

Push your hips up into the air, squeezing your ab muscles and your glutes as you lift. Hold the pose for a few seconds, then relax and lower yourself to the ground.

      "content": "Don’t try to crack your sternum more than once a day. While stretching daily is a good idea, limit cracking your sternum to one time a day at the most. Just like with any other joint, cracking it too often can lead to hypermobility , which means the joint will extend past where it should naturally. This can lead to ongoing pain issues, and it can also make you more vulnerable to injury in that area.

      "title": "Breathe in deeply",
      "content": "Breathe in deeply through your nose. Sometimes, a deep breath can expand your torso enough to crack your sternum. Start sitting or lying down, then inhale deeply through your nose. As you breathe in, slowly and steadily pull in as much air as you can. Try counting to 4 or even 8 in your head as you inhale. [7] X Research source If you can't breathe in through your nose, it’s fine to breathe through your mouth instead."
