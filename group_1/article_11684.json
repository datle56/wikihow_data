      "content": "Brush your teeth. One of the best and healthiest ways to avoid a kissing disaster is to brush your teeth. No one wants to kiss someone who still has food particles in between their teeth or has bad breath. Don’t forget to brush your tongue as well. Bacteria can build up on your tongue if it’s not brushed regularly, which causes bad breath. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Get in the habit of bringing a travel size toothbrush and toothpaste with you. You can either keep it in the car or, for girls, in your purse. Having the essentials on hand will help you to be prepared at all times. There are also disposable products you can purchase, which slip on your finger and serve as a toothbrush. These are a bit more discreet and don’t require you to have toothpaste on hand. You can find them at any major retail store or online at sites such as Amazon."

      "title": "Use mouthwash.",
      "content": "Use mouthwash. Once you’re done brushing, don’t forget to finish with some mouthwash. It not only helps to fight bacteria, but will freshen your breath and make you even more kissable. Mouthwash shouldn’t be used as a substitute for brushing. However, if you’ve brushed recently and are just in need of a freshening, feel free to swish with some mouthwash. To use mouthwash properly, swish it around in your mouth for a full 30 seconds. If 30 seconds is too long, try to keep it in your mouth for as long as you can before it begins to burn. [2] X Research source Travel size mouthwash is also something you can have on hand for emergencies. This is particularly useful if you think you may be staying overnight but don’t want to be presumptuous."

      "content": "Have mint gum on hand. In case you’re on the go and haven’t had time to adequately brush your teeth, mint gum is an easy way to mask your bad breath. It also comes in handy if your date has bad breath too! Gum is actually beneficial in more ways than one, as it helps with saliva production. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This may not seem like a good thing, but saliva production is actually a defense against bad breath. If you’re wondering what type of gum or mint is best, opt for cinnamon as it helps to reduce bacteria in your mouth."

      "title": "Use chapstick or lip gloss.",
      "content": "Use chapstick or lip gloss. Another way to make your mouth more kissable and fresh is to apply chapstick or lip gloss. If you’re nervous, instead of licking your lips, try applying chapstick or gloss so that you don’t dry out your lips. If you’re applying lip gloss, don’t wear anything that is too sticky. Instead, consider buying a flavored lip gloss that isn’t overly heavy. Lip balm is another great product, which will make your lips softer and smoother and even more kissable. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch for more eye contact.",
      "content": "Watch for more eye contact. It’s often a good sign that someone is into you or wants to kiss you if you notice an increase in eye contact. They may stare into your eyes or glance at you and nervously look away. Eye contact increases intimacy as well, so don’t be surprised if you feel your heart flutter or your palms get sweaty as a result of the increased eye contact. [5] X Research source Look into your partner's eyes and give butterflies a moment to develop in your chest. Hopefully, your partner will mirror this behavior back at you. The person doesn’t have to stare deep into your eyes to want to kiss you. They may feel equally nervous and may continue to look at you before quickly glancing away. Try to lock eyes with them and give them a reassuring smile if that’s the case. This will help them to feel more comfortable."

      "title": "Look for an increase in physical contact.",
      "content": "Look for an increase in physical contact. In addition to increased eye contact, you may also notice an increase in physical contact. Whether it’s holding your hand or brushing up against you, physical contact can be a good indication of someone’s desire to kiss you. They may be discrete in their intentions, by asking to show you something on their phone or by requesting a hug. Chances are they are just trying to get you to move closer, so take the hint and cozy up with them."

    {
      "title": "Watch for them to lean in.",
      "content": "Watch for them to lean in. One of the best indications that someone wants to kiss you is if they lean in. If you’re on the receiving end and share their feelings, lean in towards them to initiate the kiss. If you’re the one trying to lean in for a kiss, make sure to time it right so that you don’t catch them off guard. Leaning in during a meal is probably not the best time to initiate a kiss, particularly if it’s a first date. [6] X Research source Wait until the person is paying attention to lean in. Even better, wait until you notice that increase in eye contact and physical contact before going for it."

      "title": "Steer clear of braces.",
      "content": "Steer clear of braces. If you’re young, chances are you may be dealing with braces. You shouldn’t avoid kissing someone with braces, but if they’ve just gotten them, it’s best to steer clear until they’ve had time to heal. When you do go in for the kiss, go slowly. The last thing you want to do is to come in fast and get stuck if you’re both wearing braces. [7] X Research source Steer clear of braces with your tongue. While you can still enjoy the pleasure of using your tongue during kissing, you should avoid rubbing your teeth over braces. This could result in an injury, which would be awkward for both parties involved."

      "title": "Keep your neck from cramping.",
      "content": "Keep your neck from cramping. Regardless of your age, kissing can be physically demanding. This is particularly true if your partner isn’t the same height as you, which could result in a sore neck from straining to get to their level. If you are shorter than your partner, try wearing heels or sitting on a bar stool. If you are taller, try leaning against a wall and have your partner stand between your legs to get on even footing."

      "title": "Deal with a bad kisser.",
      "content": "Deal with a bad kisser. At some point in your life, you’ll inevitably encounter someone who is less experienced than you at kissing. Luckily, most bad kissers can become good kissers with a little bit of patience and encouragement. Show your partner what you consider to be good kissing. When the other person starts to follow your lead, respond positively and obviously so that he or she knows you like it. Never criticize someone’s kissing style. Instead, ask them to try something different with you and show them the way you like to be kissed. [8] X Research source The more a person practices kissing, the better they'll get at it."

      "title": "Be confident.",
      "content": "Be confident. One of the most important things to remember is that confidence goes a long way when it comes to kissing. If you feel self-conscious you may act unnatural, which could result in an awkward kiss or no kiss at all. Think positively about yourself and your abilities. Even if you’re a first timer, visualize yourself as an excellent kisser. Replace any negative thoughts with positive ones. The more confident you feel on the inside, the more confident you’ll appear to others. [9] X Research source If you’re still feeling nervous, take a deep breath and smile. This will help you to relax and will give off a confident vibe. It's OK to laugh. If something awkward does happen, try to laugh about it. This will help your partner to relax as well. Chances are you can both have a good laugh before trying it again."
