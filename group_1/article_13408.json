It’s very important to recognize that while it’s possible to get back with your ex, a large part of this happening has to do with them—not you. Even if you really want to get back together, you cannot control how they feel. As a result, the best thing you can do right now is work on yourself. Do things you enjoy, hang out with friends and family, and focus on what’s important to you outside of your ex. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Say “yes” to every invitation you get. Being social and building your other relationships is a great way to forget about your ex. Stay active . Exercise and get out of the house every day. Not only is it good for your body, but it’s good for your mental health as well! Throw yourself at your schoolwork or job. Tackling something on your plate will put you back into control and make you feel like the best version of you."

If the two of you are meant to be, don’t assume it’s over just because they’re seeing someone.

If you keep texting or calling them , you may give the impression that you’re a little clingy or obsessive. If you need to, block them on social media and delete their number. It seems counterintuitive, but giving them room will improve your chances in the future. [6] X Research source This isn’t to say that you should ignore them if they hit you up. However, you should wait for them to reach out to you, not the other way around. It’s also not particularly healthy to keep checking in on them once you’ve broken up. It can be extremely tempting to hop on social media and see what they’re up to every other day, but it won’t make you feel better."

The happier and healthier you are, the more attractive you’ll be as a potential partner.

The irony of this whole thing is that it’s probably only a good idea to get back with your ex if you’ve stopped worrying about getting back with your ex.

On top of that, the more time you give them to explore other possibilities, the more likely it will be that they realize the grass isn’t always greener on the other side.
