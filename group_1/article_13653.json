      "content": "You don't have to tip house cleaners unless you want to show appreciation. House cleaning is different from other heavy tipping industries like food service, where the waitstaff make most of their salary from tips. You're only expected to tip when the house cleaner performs above and beyond your expectations or tackles a particularly tough mess. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Tip 20% for infrequent or one-time services. When you hire these cleaners, they're performing a deeper clean than a regular housekeeper and doing a lot of work.

House cleaners who own their own business set their own rates, meaning they include things like a living wage and extra money for their high-quality services in the bill. There's no need to add a tip on top of that unless you just want to do so. [4] X Research source"

Make it easier on both of you and set up a specific time to tip, such as at the end of the month. You can also add up the tips you would have given them throughout the year and present it to them as a holiday bonus. [5] X Research source"
