      "title": "If you don't have a cell signal, head to a location that has Wi-Fi.",
      "content": "If you don't have a cell signal, head to a location that has Wi-Fi. You'll often find free Wi-Fi hotspots at libraries, cafes, airports, fast food restaurants, and even on college campuses. Chain businesses like McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, Dunkin' Donuts, Burger King, Peet's, Panera Bread, Tim Horton's, and Target all offer free Wi-Fi in stores. If you can get to one of these locations, you'll definitely be able to get online. If you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, your connection won't be encrypted. If possible, use a VPN any time you connect to a hotspot. You can install an app on your smartphone or tablet to locate public hotspots before you lose access to the internet. If you have an Android, try WeFi . On iPhone and iPad, try WiFi Map . You can also use the Facebook mobile app to find nearby Wi-Fi hotspots. Tap the three-line menu in the app, tap Settings & Privacy , and then tap Free Wi-Fi . [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Tethering can be a great option if it's part of your cell plan. If you have a phone that has cellular service but don't have internet access for your computer, you can use your phone as a Wi-Fi access point. Not all mobile plans support tethering, though—contact your mobile phone provider to add tethering to your plan. If you want to use your iPhone as a personal hotspot , go to Settings > Cellular > Personal Hotspot > On . [2] X Research source If you want to use your Android as a personal hotspot, go to Settings > Mobile Hotspot and Tethering and turn the switches on for the appropriate features. [3] X Research source If you aren't happy with your smartphone's tethering features, try a cell phone booster. Basically, an outside antenna receives a signal from cell towers and a coaxial cable feeds internet or cell data into a signal booster, which then sends that information to an indoor antenna feed that you can pick up internet from. This is perhaps the best solution if your cell phone gets poor signal strength, but you want to watch Netflix."

      "title": "Get a hotspot device from your cellular provider.",
      "content": "Get a hotspot device from your cellular provider. This only works if you have a cell signal, however, so if you don't have cell service, skip this step. The most popular and best mobile hotspots include Verizon's Jetpack MiFi 8800L, HTC 5G Hub, and GlocalMe DuoTurbo. Getting a mobile hotspot is the best suggestion as long as you have cell service, so even traveling in an RV doesn't mean that you'll be without internet! The GlocalMe is suggested if you're traveling overseas since it works in 140 countries."

      "content": "Ask someone who lives nearby to share their Wi-Fi with you. If you live in an apartment building or condo, you may be able to use a neighbor's Wi-Fi network to get online if you don't have your own internet service. Just make sure to ask permission first or you'll simply be stealing from your friend."

      "content": "These USB Wi-Fi dongles help you connect your computer to the internet on a mobile network. Think of a Wi-Fi USB Dongle like a more accessible mobile router. These are offered by cellular providers, like Verizon and AT&T, and are perfect for people who need internet as they travel. Don't expect great signal strength, speed, or range, though. A mobile hotspot is more reliable in those aspects. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Satellite service is a great option for rural areas. Internet isn't only available through FiOS, cable, or a cell provider. Chances are high that your house or where you're going has a satellite connection , though the environment and weather can affect the signal. Once you sign up for satellite internet, you should receive a dish as well as instructions on how to connect to the internet. Satellite internet is probably the least efficient form of internet service. It’ll work, but don’t expect the speeds to be all that impressive."

      "title": "Similar to satellite internet, fixed wireless broadband is a good alternative source for the internet.",
      "content": "Similar to satellite internet, fixed wireless broadband is a good alternative source for the internet. Instead of using cell towers or a satellite, private companies have antennas positioned throughout rural communities that use radio waves to transmit internet connection. When you buy a plan, you'll have an antenna fitted to your house in line-of-sight of the host's antenna so you can use that internet connection. Don't expect fast internet speeds though."

      "content": "Unlimitedville is a membership organization that offers unlimited and uncapped wireless data. This data is from carriers, like Verizon, T-Mobile, or AT&T, that you get to pick from for the right coverage for the area you're in.

You can pick your plan with Unlimitedville, and since it's contract-free, cancel at any time!"
