      "content": "Try the UUDD exercise to get hunter eyes. UUDD stands for “Up, Up, Down, Down.” To do it, start by lifting your eyebrows like you’re really surprised. Then, look up using only your eyes. Drop your eyebrows back down, then drop your eyes forward. [2] X Research source UUDD is thought to help you get hunter eyes because it strengthens the muscles around your eyes, which can help narrow your eyes."

      "content": "Squint while you pull outward on the skin beside your eyes. Place your index fingers on your orbital bones so they’re just outside of the outer corners of your eyes. Pull slightly outward—just enough to keep the skin tight, but not enough to be uncomfortable. Then, try to blink or squint. Repeat this about 15 times, working up to several sets a day. [4] X Research source The idea behind this exercise is that it will strengthen the muscles around your eye, which will then pull any loose skin tight, giving you narrowed hunter eyes."

If you don’t have an ice pack, try sliced cucumbers or chilled black tea bags. You can even put spoons in the refrigerator for a few minutes, then lay those over your eyes. [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Some people believe that applying cold compresses to your eyes will help you build fat around your orbital bone.

This will create a narrower gaze, giving you more of a hunter eye look. Try to hold this look for as long as you can, and repeat it frequently throughout the day. It may only be a few seconds the first time you do it, but over time, try to work up to longer periods. [7] X Research source It may help to imagine squinting just a little, but try not to furrow your brow—it will make it more obvious you’re trying to accomplish hunter eyes. If you practice this consistently, you may be able to train yourself to have naturally relaxed brows."

      "content": "Talk to an orthodontist before you try mewing. Mewing attempts to reshape your jawline and cheekbones by changing your tongue placement. However, it’s important to consult with a trained orthodontist before you try this. If you train yourself to hold your tongue in an improper position for your mouth, it could affect your teeth and even the way you speak. [15] X Research source If there’s an issue with the way you’re holding your tongue or how your jaw is aligned, an orthodontist will give you personalized tips on how to correct it. Mewing is named after Dr. John Mew, who developed the practice. But keep in mind that even though it was created by a doctor, mewing hasn’t been scientifically proven to work, so your results may vary."

Be sure to speak to a licensed medical professional, like an aesthetician or a cosmetic surgeon, before making any decisions about procedures to give yourself hunter eyes. If you can, embrace your own unique look! However, if you’re self-conscious about your eyes to the point that it impacts your self-image, a medical professional may be able to recommend specific procedures for you."

      "content": "Botox injections may help you keep your eyebrows relaxed. Botox temporarily paralyzes the muscles where it’s injected. While Botox injections are commonly used to treat and prevent fine lines, they can also change the position of your brows, depending on where they’re injected. So a properly-placed Botox injection could lower your brows, giving you more of a hunter eye look. [16] X Research source Although Botox injections are common, there can be side effects, so it’s important to consult with a licensed medical professional before having injections done."
