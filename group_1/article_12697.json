      "title": "Locate the engine.",
      "content": "Locate the engine. Most cars have the engine at the front; these cars may be either front- or rear-wheel drive. Cars with the engine at the rear, such as the Volkswagen Beetle, are always rear-wheel drive cars."

      "title": "See how the engine is mounted.",
      "content": "See how the engine is mounted. If the engine is transverse-mounted (that is, mounted sideways), with the belts facing one side of the car, your car is most likely a front-wheel drive car. If the engine is mounted longitudinally (front to back), with the belts facing the front grille, your car is most likely a rear-wheel drive car."

      "title": "Look for a differential.",
      "content": "Look for a differential. The differential is a large, pumpkin-shaped housing that transfers power from the driveshaft to the wheels. If there is such an assembly on the car's rear axle, the car has a rear-wheel drive. On front-wheel drive cars, the differential is integrated with the transmission in a unit at the rear of the engine called a transaxle, and the wheels are connected to the driveshaft by constant velocity (CV) joints."
