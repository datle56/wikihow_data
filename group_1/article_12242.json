      "title": "Do a finger pull.",
      "content": "Do a finger pull. Usually when someone grabs you from behind they're going to have at least one of their hands in front of you. With one hand grab their index and their middle finger and with your other grab the ring and the pinkie finger. Pull very hard in opposite directions. This is very painful to your attacker and should give you a chance to get away."

      "title": "Grab their ear.",
      "content": "Grab their ear. This defense you can use if you're grabbed from behind or if for some reason your attacker decides to grabs you where you're facing them. If from behind - put your hands on their head and drag your fingernails down until you find their ears. Grab on to the ears and pull down in a fast motion. Doing it too slow can give them a chance to realize what is happening. But if done fast enough and with enough strength, you should be able to damage their ear. And if you are very strong (As to where you're actually superman) you could even rip it off."

      "title": "Jab your attacker in the throat.",
      "content": "Jab your attacker in the throat. This one only works if your attacker is coming at you or grabs you to where you're facing them. Your hand shouldn't be in a fist, but uncurled and straight. Make sure every bone in your hand is straight. It won't work right if any of your bones are bent. With your hand 'jab' them straight in the middle of their throat. This should close their wind pipe for a few seconds; leaving them gasping for air and giving you a chance to get away."

      "content": "Walk backwards. As a last effort, try walking backwards. Both your attacker and you will fall backwards; giving you a chance to escape."
