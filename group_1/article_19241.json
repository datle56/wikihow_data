      "title": "Pump your breast milk for some feedings.",
      "content": "Pump your breast milk for some feedings. Typically, breastfeeding only prevents pregnancy if your baby is nursing. Your baby’s suckling triggers hormones that make more milk and suppress ovulation. If you pump your milk, it might reduce your hormone levels so that you can ovulate again. Try pumping for 1-2 of your daily feedings to help you ovulate. [1] X Research source Pumping shouldn’t affect your milk production, but it may help you ovulate. This is typically your best option because it allows you to continue feeding your baby on their regular schedule and you can still give them breast milk exclusively, if that’s what you prefer."

      "title": "Leave gaps longer than 6 hours between feedings.",
      "content": "Leave gaps longer than 6 hours between feedings. Breastfeeding may make you infertile if you do it every 4 hours during the day and every 6 hours at night. If you go longer than 6 hours without nursing, you might be able to start ovulating again. Space out your feedings so that you’re not nursing for at least 6 hours in a row once or twice a day. [2] X Research source For instance, you might nurse your baby at 6:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 4:30 p.m., 8:30 p.m, and 11:30 p.m. Keep in mind that this may not work if your baby is really hungry. Always put their needs first."

      "title": "Stop overnight nursing to break the breastfeeding cycle.",
      "content": "Stop overnight nursing to break the breastfeeding cycle. Most babies continue overnight feedings for several months. While this is a great time for bonding, it can also prevent you from ovulating. If you want to get pregnant, nurse your baby only during the day. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Ask your doctor if it’s okay to stop overnight feedings completely. If your baby needs to eat, you could give them expressed breast milk or formula. If your baby is sleeping through the night, don’t wake them up to eat."

      "title": "Replace breast milk with formula or cereal at some feedings.",
      "content": "Replace breast milk with formula or cereal at some feedings. You need to breastfeed exclusively to stay infertile. [5] X Research source If you introduce formula or cereal, it’s likely that you’ll disrupt the hormones that are preventing you from ovulating. Provide your baby with 1 or more formula feedings each day or, if once they’re at least 6 months old, give them rice cereal or other solid foods if the doctor says they’re ready. [6] X Research source Ask your doctor to recommend the best formula for your baby."

      "content": "Have sex every 5 days to increase your chances of pregnancy. It can seem really easy to get pregnant, but that’s often not the case. To conceive, live, healthy sperm need to be inside your body when a healthy egg is released. Frequent sex ensures you have sperm in your body if an egg is released. Sperm can live inside your body for up to 5 days, so have sex at least once every 5 days.

      "content": "Apply lubricant if you have vaginal dryness after breastfeeding. It’s normal to experience vaginal dryness while you’re breastfeeding, so you may not get very wet when you’re aroused. This can make sex uncomfortable. Apply a lubricant prior to having sex to relieve your dryness. [8] X Research source Use a water-based or silicone-based lubricant, depending on your preferences. Make sure your lubricant doesn’t contain spermicide, which will prevent pregnancy."

      "title": "Stop smoking",
      "content": "Stop smoking if you do. You’re likely not smoking right now because the nicotine can pass to your baby through your breast milk. If you are still smoking, it’s best to quit while you’re trying to conceive. Smoking lowers your levels of progesterone, which your body needs to prepare your uterus. Don’t smoke if you want to get pregnant. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Quitting is really hard, but you can do it. Try attending a support group to help you quit. Additionally, replace smoking with another behavior, like chewing gum. You likely won’t be able to use nicotine replacement products while you’re breastfeeding."

      "content": "Eat foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids to help you ovulate. Omega 3s naturally balance your hormones and improve blood circulation to your reproductive organs. They can also help increase your cervical mucus and may help you ovulate. Incorporate omega 3-rich foods into your diet to potentially help you get pregnant while you’re breastfeeding. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Foods rich in omega 3 are fatty fish, cod liver oil, canola oil, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, cashews, avocado, sunflower seeds, almonds, sesame seeds, olive oil, corn oil and safflower oil."

      "content": "Ask your doctor about royal jelly supplements. Royal jelly is made by bees and may help increase your fertility. It contains vitamin B6, which boosts your progesterone levels, as well as fatty acids that improve your egg quality. Additionally, it may help balance your hormones and maintain healthy gut bacteria to support your fertility. Take a daily supplement of royal jelly if your doctor says it’s safe.

      "content": "Use an ovulation kit to find out if you may be ovulating. Since your period happens when your body is shedding an unfertilized egg, your first ovulation will happen before you get your period back. That means you may already be fertile and not know it. If you’d like to monitor your fertility, get an ovulation kit from the store. Then, follow the directions on the box to find out if you might be ovulating. [13] X Research source Generally, you’ll urinate on an ovulation testing strip to find out if you’re ovulating. If the test is positive, you might be able to get pregnant if you have sex that day. Reader Poll: We asked 399 wikiHow readers who've tracked their menstrual cycles, and 52% of them agreed that the best way to do so is by using a period tracker app or calendar. [Take Poll] Not only do these apps help you keep track of your period, but many of them alert you of when you’re ovulating."

      "content": "Track your basal body temperature to look for a small spike. Your temperature spikes slightly when you ovulate, so tracking your temperature can help you detect when you’re ovulating. Use a basal body thermometer to take your temperature every morning before you get out of bed. Track your readings so that you can look for a small spike of a few tenths of a degree. When this happens, you’re likely ovulating. [14] X Research source An average basal body temperature ranges between 97 to 97.5 °F (36.1 to 36.4 °C). During ovulation, it might rise to around 97.6 to 98.6 °F (36.4 to 37.0 °C). The changes in temperature can range from 0.2° to 0.5° C (0.4° to 1.0° F)."

      "content": "Check your cervical mucus daily to tell when you’re ovulating. Your cervical mucus varies in consistency throughout your cycle. To check it, wipe the opening of your vagina before you pee, stick 2 clean fingers in your vagina to collect the mucus, or look at the discharge in your panties. Rub it to see if it’s sticky or slippery. Write down your observations to help you figure out if you might be ovulating. [15] X Research source If you feel dry, you probably aren’t ovulating. Yellow, white, or cloudy mucus that feels sticky may be a sign you’re about to ovulate. During ovulation, your mucus should look clear or slightly cloudy like egg whites. It’ll likely feel slippery and may stretch if you pull on it."
