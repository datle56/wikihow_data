      "title": "Wash the ink off with soap and water.",
      "content": "Wash the ink off with soap and water. Washing with soapy water is probably the easiest and most accessible solution to cleaning ink off your skin. Wash your hands (or wherever the ink is) as you normally would with hand soap and warm water, scrubbing the ink until it washes away. If you need something a bit stronger, try dish soap instead. This method works best for water-based inks, but it can also be used for oil-based inks. It may just take a bit of extra effort. [1] X Research source If the stain is particularly stubborn, try scrubbing the area with a pumice stone , as well. The pumice stone will help remove the dead skin cells that are stained with ink. Another option is to scrub the ink with shampoo. If you can, hop in the shower and wash your hair with shampoo. The ink should come right out. If you can’t take a shower right away, apply the shampoo to the affected area like any other soap. Water-based inks tend to seep through paper and take longer to dry, so they are more likely to smear and get on your skin. Rollerball pens and some gel pens are usually water-soluble. Many ballpoint pens are oil-based, so they may be more difficult to remove with this method."

      "title": "Squirt hand sanitizer onto the ink.",
      "content": "Squirt hand sanitizer onto the ink. Hand sanitizer is another quick and easy way to get pen off your skin. Hand sanitizer contains alcohol, which will break down and loosen the ink. Squirt some onto your skin and rub it into the ink with circular motions. Then, wipe the area with a clean cloth—the ink will wipe off with the sanitizer. [2] X Research source Hand sanitizer and other alcohol-based solvents can be harsh on skin, so remember to wash the area with soap and water and apply a moisturizer after using any of the methods in this section."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrub the ink with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "content": "Scrub the ink with isopropyl alcohol. Rubbing alcohol (or surgical spirit ) is often your best bet for removing the oil-based ink found in most pens. It dissolves oils, allowing you to wipe the ink off your skin. Wet a cotton ball or washcloth with alcohol and scrub the ink to remove it. [3] X Research source Many other cleaning agents use alcohol as the main solvent, so using it directly should give you the best results. Try not to use rubbing alcohol in a small, confined space, as the smell is very strong. Isopropyl alcohol and its fumes are extremely flammable, so don't use it around an open flame or heat source. Alcohol will also remove your body's natural oils along with the pen, so be sure to moisturize after rubbing it on your skin."

    {
      "title": "Spray the pen marks with hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray the pen marks with hairspray. If you don't have rubbing alcohol on hand, look for an alcohol-based hairspray instead. The alcohol will break down the ink in the same way. Simply spray the hairspray directly onto the pen ink, then wipe it away with a clean cloth. Depending on the concentration of alcohol used in the hairspray, it may take a few applications to remove the ink. [4] X Research source The hairspray will leave behind a sticky residue, so once the ink has been removed, rinse your skin with soap and water. Hairspray is highly flammable, so be careful when you are spraying it. Never use it anywhere near an open flame."

    {
      "title": "Soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover.",
      "content": "Soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover. Nail polish remover contains acetone, which will cause the pen ink to break down and dissolve, similar to rubbing alcohol. Dab some onto a cotton ball and rub it onto your skin until the ink comes off. Acetone can be very harsh on your skin, though, so use it sparingly, and be sure to rinse your skin with soap and water and moisturize afterward. [5] X Research source Acetone is also highly flammable and the vapors can be toxic in large amounts, so keep it away from open flames and use it in a well-ventilated area."

      "title": "Apply white vinegar to the ink.",
      "content": "Apply white vinegar to the ink. Spray or wet the affected area with white vinegar, then scrub the area with a paper towel to remove the ink. Vinegar contains an acetic acid which can effectively dissolve oils and many other compounds. [6] X Research source Using a rough paper towel will help exfoliate the skin and remove layers of dead skin cells that are stained with ink."

      "title": "Apply a baking soda paste to your skin.",
      "content": "Apply a baking soda paste to your skin. Baking soda is a natural and effective way to remove stains. Mix a small amount of baking soda with a little water or white vinegar until it forms a paste. Gently rub the paste onto the stained area in a circular motion. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse the area with warm water and pat it dry. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rub vegetable shortening or butter on the ink.",
      "content": "Rub vegetable shortening or butter on the ink. This method will likely get messy, but the oils in these products will help dissolve the oil contained in the ink. Rub the shortening or butter onto the ink as you would soap. Then, wipe it off with a dry paper towel. The ink should come right off. [8] X Research source Oils like coconut oil, baby oil, or olive oil will also help dissolve the ink the same way. Pour some oil onto a paper towel and use it to scrub off the ink."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply non-gel toothpaste to the ink.",
      "content": "Apply non-gel toothpaste to the ink. Choose a white, non-gel toothpaste that contains baking soda; the baking soda will pull the ink off the surface of your skin. Rub the toothpaste directly onto your skin, then clean it off with a damp cloth or rinse it with clean water. [9] X Research source The toothpaste may cause your skin to tingle, but this is nothing to worry about. Gel toothpaste doesn’t contain baking soda, so it won’t work to remove ink."

      "title": "Use tea tree oil for a natural option.",
      "content": "Use tea tree oil for a natural option. Tea tree oil has natural cleaning properties that can remove tough ink stains. Mix a few drops of tea tree oil with a carrier oil, like coconut or olive oil. Apply the oil directly to the ink and gently rub it in. When the oil starts to come off, wipe the area clean with a cloth or paper towel, then wash the area with soap and water. [10] X Research source Essential oils can be irritating to the skin, so do not apply them without a carrier oil. This option will also give your skin a pleasant scent. Tea tree oil also works well to remove more stubborn inks, like printer ink."

      "title": "Rub a cool, used teabag over the pen ink.",
      "content": "Rub a cool, used teabag over the pen ink. After making a cup of tea , set the tea bag aside and allow it to come to room temperature. Once cooled, scrub the ink with the tea bag. The oils in the tea and the rough fabric of the fab will work together to break down and lift the pen off your skin. It should rub off easily. [11] X Research source Don't be too harsh when you rub the tea against your skin, or you may break the bag and spill tea leaves everywhere."

      "title": "Opt for a commercial cleaner.",
      "content": "Opt for a commercial cleaner. Many hand cleansers or multi-surface cleaners are also effective at removing pen and printer ink stains. Products like GoJo and Goop are hand cleaners and stain removers that often remove ink. Follow the instructions provided on the package to apply them correctly. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a glass cleaner on stubborn stains.",
      "content": "Try a glass cleaner on stubborn stains. Glass cleaner works well on strong inks like printer ink. If the ink is still wet, spray it with a glass cleaner, like Windex. Let the cleaner sit for a moment, then wipe it and the ink away with a paper towel. Rinse the area thoroughly with soap and water, then apply a moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out. [13] X Research source Window cleaner can be harsh on skin, so this may not be the best option if you have sensitive skin. Make sure to wash the affected area thoroughly, especially if it’s your hands. Do not touch your face, and make sure you do not ingest the cleaner."

      "title": "Apply diluted bleach with caution.",
      "content": "Apply diluted bleach with caution. If all else fails, bleach is a strong ink remover. Wearing rubber gloves, mix 1 part bleach to 10 parts water, then dip a cotton ball or pad into the solution. Gently dab the stained area, being careful not to touch clean skin. Rinse your hands and the affected area thoroughly with water when you’re done. Never use undiluted bleach, and always work in a well-ventilated area when handling bleach. [14] X Research source Because bleach is so strong and can irritate skin, this method should only be used as a last resort. Do not use bleach if you have sensitive or fair skin. Bleach is often recommended specifically for removing printer ink. Do not mix any chemicals with bleach."

      "title": "Remove permanent marker with soapy water, hairspray, or rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Remove permanent marker with soapy water, hairspray, or rubbing alcohol. Removing permanent marker from skin is very similar to removing other types of ink, though sometimes it may take a bit more elbow grease. Try standard removal methods like hairspray, rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover, or hand sanitizer. [15] X Research source A gentler option is to rub the area with makeup wipes until the ink comes off. Dermatologist Mohiba Tareen recommends sea salt to remove permanent marker: “Sea salt is known to be a natural exfoliant. When mixed with warm water, it can gently help the marks to come off. Be careful not to rub it too harshly, as it could irritate or scrape the skin.” After cleansing the marker off your skin, moisturize the area. Tareen says olive oil, coconut oil, or baby oil are also great for this purpose because they “act as a moisturizer [and help] maintain your skin barrier. [They] also help ease any skin irritation or inflammation.”"

      "title": "Cover your hands and work surface when using ink.",
      "content": "Cover your hands and work surface when using ink. If you know you’ll be working with messy ink, like printer ink or fountain pen ink, wear disposable gloves to protect your hands. Keep towels handy and cover your work surface with newspaper, a trash bag, or another material you don’t mind getting dirty. [16] X Research source If you do spill ink, clean it up as quickly as possible while it’s still wet."

      "title": "How do I get fountain pen ink off my skin?",
      "content": "How do I get fountain pen ink off my skin? Fountain pen ink can be removed the same way as any other pen ink. Rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, and baby oil are particularly effective at breaking down the oils in fountain pen ink. It’s also possible to remove all kinds of ink by soaking the stained area in milk, as milk has properties that can separate oils. [17] X Research source Remember, alcohol- and acetone-based products can be harsh on skin, so remember to wash the area with soap and water and apply a moisturizer after the ink has been removed."

      "title": "How do I get stamping ink off my skin?",
      "content": "How do I get stamping ink off my skin? Stamp ink can often be more difficult to remove than standard pen ink because of its higher viscosity and fade-resistant pigments. In general, though, the removal methods are similar to those for pen ink. Applying rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover often works well, or scrub the area with a pumice stone to remove stubborn bits. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "How do I remove pen ink from children’s skin?",
      "content": "How do I remove pen ink from children’s skin? Children’s skin is more sensitive than adults, so it’s important not to use harsh chemicals to remove the ink. Wash the area with gentle cleansers like soap or baby oil, or try a natural remedy like butter or milk. Gently scrub the area with warm water and soap when you’re done. [19] X Research source"
