      "content": "Create super cute charcuterie boards for a swanky night in. No need to hit up Napa—just bring the glam vibes of a vineyard right to your living room. Stock up on your fave wines, from fruity Merlots to dry Chardonnays. To make a charcuterie board , grab a chic cheese board set and pile it up to your heart’s content. Go for yummy classics like high-end cold meats and cheeses. Or, be silly and tongue-in-cheek with a “lazy girl” charcuterie board. For a fun spread à la an adult’s Lunchable, serve cheap staples like Ritz crackers, American cheese, and M&Ms. Either way, you’ll give everyone a serious case of the munchies. [1] X Research source For your sober besties, offer non-alcoholic options like sparkling cider. Throw chocolate and cheese in a fondue pot for a special touch. To cater to your vegan lovelies, make a spread with fruits and veggies. If everyone’s got a sweet tooth, make a dessert charcuterie board."

Keep it chill by setting up a cereal bar with sugary guilty pleasures like Lucky Charms. If you want to get really extravagant, give your local diner a run for its money—we’re talking omelets, waffles, bacon, and mochas. When your girls chow down, they’ll have fuel to chat all night. [2] X Research source Be sophisticated and give a late night brunch a mature spin with mimosas. If you don’t want to be wired, swap evening coffee for some hot chocolate.

      "content": "Kick back and get lost in your favorite movies and TV shows. Have everyone pitch in and tell you their picks. Play fair and go with the crowd pleaser, whether it’s Bridgerton or Love Island . If your girls are ready to get a little random, write some options down on a piece of paper, throw them in a hat, and pull a title out. If you’re all feeling extra daring, play Netflix Roulette and hit “Play Something,” the shuffle feature. Whatever option you all choose, you’re in for a whirlwind night. [3] X Research source If you have all night, mix it up and sample everyone’s go-to movie or show. When it feels right, swoon over romantic leads or heckle really bad scenes.

Think about what feels realistic—maybe it’s best to cover a few chapters every week or review the whole book at the end of the month. Depending on what your book club wants, make some discussion questions or wing it and share your reactions. However you run it, your book club will be a blast and offer a lot to ponder over. [4] X Research source Give your book club a cute and fun name, like “The Page Turners.” You can even make a FB group to catch up and post literary memes. Decide if everyone should share “popcorn style” or speak one at a time. Create cute merch, like custom bookmarks, on a site like Redbubble ."

Feel free to mix and match workouts too—just make a YouTube playlist with a bunch of fitness tutorials that appeal to everyone. Make sure everyone knows the dress code is “athleisure chic” and brings a water bottle and hand towel. Get your blood pumping and you’ll all love how you whip each other into shape. [5] X Research source Is anyone a trained fitness instructor or just really bold? If so, elect someone to lead your impromptu workout classes. Try a sporty fashion show. For example, see who's the best at styling biker shorts. If you want to get really cheesy, turn on an oldie jam like “Let’s Get Physical,” stream vintage jazzercise vids , and channel 80s vibes with leg warmers and sweatbands."

Don’t sweat it. The major perk to having a girls’ night in is that you can do whatever you want in the privacy of your own place. So, power up your console or karaoke machine and sing your hearts out. As long as you don’t wake your neighbors, you’ll rock each other’s worlds with your at-home concert. [7] X Research source Dress up as your alter-egos—maybe you want to look like a rocker because you’re the ultra edgy “Alexis Rose.” Your other buddy might be in the mood to look like a pop star because she’s the super-sweet “Tee Swift.”"

[10] X Research source Check people’s sizes in advance and make little labels or tags to organize everything. For example, create separate piles for small, medium, and large blouses. If there’s anyone who can’t wear the same clothes as any of your other friends, be inclusive and throw an accessories and jewelry swap instead. That way, everyone wins.
