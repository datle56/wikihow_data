In a casual relationship, the obligation to sort through the heavy emotions isn’t there. You don’t necessarily need to omit sharing personal details and stories from conversations with your partner, but avoiding deep, personal conversations may help maintain the level of simplicity. Discuss with your partner about how you two should approach more serious conversations and situations. Conversations can be current and cheerful. Discuss books, movies, sports, current events—topics that are interesting but fun and don’t require a level of seriousness. “Did you see the football game last night?
