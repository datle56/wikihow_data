      "content": "Go through the Veilstone Building. You'll need to battle any Galactic Grunts on your way until you find your way to the lab where Cyrus is. Battle and defeat Cyrus. He will tell you to go to the warp panel that leads to the Lake Trio and to save them. He'll then give you a Master Ball, then head to Mt. Coronet to finish what he started. Locate Saturn and he'll challenge you to a battle. Press the button to free the Lake Trio after defeating him. They will float off from their prison and Saturn will flee to Mt. Coronet. Take the green warp panel to get out of the building quickly."

After defeating them, your rival will heal your Pokémon for you. You'll then see Dialga starting to form a new universe under Cyrus' control. The Legendary Trio arrives and destroys the Red Chain, which destroys Cyrus' control."

After defeating him, Team Galactic will disappear. Professor Rowan and Dawn (or Lucas if your character is a girl) will arrive and tell you to help Dialga who is now unable to control itself. You can do this by capturing it (recommended) or defeating it."
