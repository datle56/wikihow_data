      "content": "Originally, “dirty 30” meant a woman becoming more sexually active in her 30s. The thinking goes that when a woman reaches her 30s, she’s more confident, knows what she wants and needs sexually, and is still in the prime of her life. The “dirty thirties” are a time to feel liberated and create the sex life you want on your terms.

      "content": "Now, “dirty thirties” refers to anyone living life to the fullest in their 30s. “Dirty” isn’t strictly sexual anymore and is slang for “fun” (which could still definitely include sexual activities, but to each their own!). “Dirty 30” also doesn’t just apply to women anymore—anyone of any gender can celebrate their dirty thirtieth birthday or enjoy their dirty 30s. There’s a misconception that turning 30 means your life becomes less fun or adventurous, so anyone who’s proving that stereotype wrong is doing their dirty 30s right! “Your life seems so cool! You’re really doing your dirty 30s right.” “Gentlemen, here’s to the birthday boy and the dirty thirties!” Fun fact: The fact that “dirty” and “thirty” rhyme so well probably helped “dirty thirty” become a well-known slang phrase that’s separate from the purely sexual meaning."

      "content": "“Dirty thirty” can also refer to a wild 30th birthday party. “Dirty thirty” is a popular theme for 30th birthdays (you’ve probably seen the hashtag #dirty30 in Instagram captions before) since 30 is kind of a weird milestone. You’re not in your wild and less mature 20s anymore, but your 30s are far from “old”—there’s still a lot of fun to have! A dirty 30th birthday party is the perfect occasion to let loose, have some fun, and celebrate the fact that your life does not end after your 20s. “Happy dirty 30! We’re going out BIG tonight!” “30 never looked so dirty 🍾🤩 #dirtythirty”"

      "content": "“Dirty 30” is fun and lighthearted, but some may find it cringey or rude. In general, wishing someone a happy “dirty” 30th birthday is just a fun way to acknowledge a milestone or post a (somewhat cliché) caption with a birthday photo. However, some people think that “dirty thirty” is overused and that it feels cringey when someone says or posts about it (especially if the person or celebration is not super fun, adventurous, or “dirty” themselves). “Dirty thirty” may also be offensive or inappropriate to some people. Some women interpret the original meaning as suggesting women in their 30s become more sexually active out of “desperation” or to feel younger (making the expression seem less empowering and more discouraging)."

These light beers are often bought to play drinking games that require a lot of beer, like beer pong or flip cup . Since no one’s really savoring the taste, these beers are considered cheap and “dirty.” “Dirty thirty” could also refer to a drinking game where players take a shot of beer every minute for 30 minutes (it’s like doing a power hour , but cut in half)."

Pilots were on duty 24/7 and performed 40-50 missions per month, meaning many of them basically lived in their flight suits most of the time. Another officer commented on how “dirty” the pilots were as a result, and they adopted the nickname “The Dirty Thirty.” [4] X Research source"
