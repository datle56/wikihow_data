      "title": "Use olive oil.",
      "content": "Use olive oil. Olive oil, which your parents may use for cooking, can work by smothering lice. When applied to the scalp, olive oil may plug the lungs of lice and cause them to die. [1] X Research source Apply olive oil to your hair. Use enough that your hair is covered in olive oil, the way it might be when using leave-in conditioner. In order for this method to be most effective, you must keep the olive oil on overnight under a shower cap. This may be difficult if you're trying to hide your lice from your parents. [2] X Research source There are some ways you can use this method without your parents knowing you have lice. You could say you heard olive oil is good for the hair and that a friend at school is trying this method. Or, you could wait until your parents are asleep, apply the olive oil cap, and then set an alarm so you wake up before your parents to remove it."

      "title": "Apply petroleum jelly or hair styling gel.",
      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly or hair styling gel. Your parents may have petroleum jelly or hair styling gel somewhere in the bathroom cabinet. Both of these substances may kill lice by smothering them. Much like the olive oil method, you should coat your hair with gel or petroleum jelly and then put on a shower cap. As with the olive oil method, you can claim you've heard this is good for your hair or wait until they go to bed to put on the gel or jelly. Keep in mind petroleum jelly is very difficult to remove. Give yourself extra time to shower in the morning after using this method. You may have to shampoo and condition your hair more than once to get out petroleum jelly."

      "title": "Try using mayonnaise.",
      "content": "Try using mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is another home remedy that may be effective for removing lice. Much like the using hair gel, petroleum jelly, or olive oil you'll need to apply mayonnaise to your scalp, put a shower cap over it, and then leave it on overnight. Apply enough mayonnaise that your hair is thoroughly coated, working it into your scalp in order to smother the lice. Since mayonnaise works by suffocating the lice, this method will help in eliminating the lice but not in eliminating lice eggs. You'll also have to think of an excuse for wearing the cap to keep your parents from becoming suspicious. People who use this method often report that full fat mayonnaise works best.

      "content": "Wash your hair with dish soap after using these methods. Dish soap does not kill lice. However, it's more effective at removing things like olive oil and mayonnaise from your hair after treatment. If you don't want your parents to get suspicious, you can put dish soap in an old bottle of the shampoo you use. You can also hide a small bottle of dish soap in the bathroom and take it out when you shower. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try vinegar. If you don't want to tell your parents you have lice, the easiest treatment options involve using items from your own kitchen. Keep in mind home remedies don't work as well as medical treatments and may not be effective and Vinegar is considered to be the least effective out of all the home remedies in eliminating lice. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, you should start with at home treatments if you want to hide your lice from your parents. Vinegar, which your parents may have in the kitchen, is sometimes successful in removing head lice. Vinegar may dissolve some of the glue that lice use to attach their nits or eggs to your head. If you apply vinegar to your hair prior to brushing, you may end up removing some of the lice with your comb. Apply enough vinegar to your hair to get it thoroughly wet. Then, use a small, fine-toothed comb to comb out your hair. Look for lice or lice eggs as you go. Lice are small brown-colored bugs. Lice eggs are small and round and coffee-colored. Soak any comb you use remove lice in soapy water for an hour. If you don't have an hour, dispose of the comb. Place the comb in a plastic bag and throw it away in an outdoor garbage can."

You might need to try medicated shampoos if your lice infestation does not respond to home remedies. You may be able to find medicated shampoo at the local supermarket or drug store. It will usually be labeled as lice-killing shampoo. Some shampoo requires a doctor's prescription, but it might be difficult to see a doctor without your parents finding out about your lice. [6] X Research source You can try biking to a local drug store, telling your parents you're going for a bike ride. Use your allowance to purchase the shampoo. To hide the shampoo, consider putting it in an empty container of your regular shampoo."

      "content": "Be careful about when you apply at-home treatment. If you do not want your parents to learn about your infestation, you have to be careful about when and where you apply at home treatment. Hide any special shampoos you're using. If you use household items, prepare an excuse if your parents notice them missing. For example, you could say you were rummaging in the cupboards for something and knocked over the bottle of olive oil. Be aware that if your parents catch you lying to them, you may get into trouble for your dishonesty. It will likely be better to just admit that you have lice."

Any clothing you wore during the infestation will also need washing, especially hats! [10] X Research source Carpets, rugs and upholstered furniture will need vacuuming to remove any lice that fell off your head. [11] X Research source Any things you use in your hair, such as brushes and head bands, need to be soaked in rubbing alcohol or medicated shampoo for an hour. [12] X Research source"

Your parents will be able to help you better than most home remedies. Lice is a difficult problem to deal with alone."
