      "content": "Take a few minutes to think about all of the regular activities that you already participate in and write them down. This could include things like your hobbies, your work duties, or anything else that makes you happy. Pay special attention to activities that make you lose track of time since that usually means you’re enjoying them. [1] X Research source Ask your friends and family members about what things you’re always talking about. If you’re frequently bringing up specific activities, you have a spark of passion on that topic. Keep in mind aspects of your career that you find rewarding as well. For example, if you like training new employees, your passion may be in educating or working with other people. If you’re looking for your career passion, think about your daily duties that bring you the most joy, such as giving as presentation or training a new employee. [2] X Research source Think about the jobs you’ve loved and hated the most so you recognize what careers to go after and which paths to avoid. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Values are your core beliefs that make you feel satisfied in life and become a part of your personality. When you want to discover your passion, finding something that aligns with your values will make you feel happier and more fulfilled. Brainstorm all of the things that are important in your life so you can find activities, hobbies, or careers that align with them. Some examples of things you may value include loyalty, creativity, compassion, family, or dependability. [4] X Research source If you have trouble thinking of things you value, list a few people that you admire and think about what values they follow. For example, you may admire your partner for being a good listener or your friend for their honesty. [5] X Research source Consider what problems you want to solve and the people you’d like to help the most if you’re searching for a career you’re passionate about. It also helps to think about what outcomes from a job you’re looking forward to. For example, if you’re passionate about becoming an author, you may be looking forward to the recognition and sharing your specific views. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "If you’re naturally good at something or worked to develop a skill set, it may be a clue that you’re actually passionate about it. Brainstorm the things that you’re talented in, such as photography, public speaking, or playing an instrument. Even if you don’t think you have a talent, pay attention to when others compliment you on something even when you don’t think it’s good. You may not have noticed that you’re even more talented than you think. [7] X Research source Remember you don’t have to be good at something to be passionate about it. For example, you can still have a passion for playing basketball even if you don’t make every shot. As long as you enjoy doing the activity, you can still be passionate about it."

      "content": "While not all of your interests will align perfectly, they may be connected by a deeper passion you may not have noticed at first. Consider the books you enjoy reading, hobbies that excite you, and items you spend time and money on to see if they have any similarities. Are they all about a specific subject or do they share any recurring concepts? If they do, they could help point you toward what you’re truly passionate about.

For example, if you gravitate toward books about planets and enjoy stargazing, you may be passionate about astronomy and space."

While you can always come back to other interests later, the ones that you’re most excited about are usually going to be the things that you’re the most passionate for. [9] X Research source While it can be tempting to try all of your interests, pursuing too many can get stressful and tiring. You may also not see yourself improve in certain areas if you’re splitting up your time between too many things. You can also narrow down job searches by looking at the duties of each career path you’re considering. Read about what tasks they involve and what your day-to-day life would look like.

      "content": "As you grow up, you may feel like your childhood dreams weren’t rational and stopped pursuing those interests. Think about the activities you enjoyed doing as a child but didn’t continue when you got older. Maybe you loved writing stories, doodling in a sketchbook, or playing sports. Try incorporating those activities back into your life to see if you still get the same kind of enjoyment from them. [11] X Research source Ask yourself what your younger self would think of you now. Are you still doing things that were important to you and that you enjoyed back then?"

Even if you’re afraid or uncomfortable with the activity at first, you’ll never know if you’re really passionate about it until you try it out. Open yourself up to new opportunities so you can maybe find something you didn’t even know you liked. [12] X Research source Make a list of experiences or activities you have a slight interest in and find ways to expose yourself to them. Beware of staying closed-minded and not pursuing things just because they make you uncomfortable. If you don’t approach things with an open mind, you may be shutting yourself off from things you’re passionate about. Be open to explore new career paths. Check online for open positions and read the job descriptions thoroughly to see if they align with your passions. [13] X Research source"

Reach out to other people that have similar interests as you and have spent a little more time than you in the area you want to pursue. Ask them questions and hold discussions about the activity so you develop a good repertoire with them. [14] X Research source Mentors can be anyone, like professional connections, coaches, friends, or even family members."

Even when you’re doing something you don’t enjoy, approach it as a learning opportunity with an open mind. You’ll never know if you’ll discover something that you’re passionate about if you don’t have any enthusiasm for it.

Passion starts when you’re Curious about something because it captures your attention. If you want to keep pursuing it, you’ll start Learning so you can get a better understanding of what it entails. [16] X Research source As you get more Enthusiasm , you’ll want to really get involved with the experiences. Eventually, you’ll become Aware and make a deeper commitment to the activity, such as buying gear or setting aside more time to do it. As you continue down the path, people will start Recognizing your passion because it stands out."

Schedule time every week where you can focus on your hobbies and interests to develop them more. As you learn more about the activity and gain a deeper appreciation for it, you’ll feel more involved and your passion will continue to grow. [17] X Research source Finding your passion is a great step, but it will take time for it to develop even further. Try to find a class or coach related to your passion so you have someone to hold you accountable for it. Look for ways to eliminate time-wasters from your schedule. For example, you can spend less time looking at social media so you can dedicate it to your passion."

      "content": "There will be a few pitfalls as you get deeper into your passion, but don’t let those discourage you. Even if you aren’t naturally good at something you’re passionate about, keep pursuing them and working through the hardships so you can improve and get better. Passions take time and dedication, so make sure you spend time doing the work and use any failures as learning experiences going forward. [18] X Research source For example, filmmaker Steven Spielberg was rejected from film school 3 times and still ended up making hit movies like Jaws , Jurassic Park , and Saving Private Ryan . Walt Disney was told multiple times that he lacked imagination before he formed his animation company. While it’s important to persevere, it’s also important to recognize when to stop pursuing something. If you aren’t getting the same level of enjoyment that you were before, then it may be time to move onto something different."

      "content": "It can be really easy to get into a comfortable place, but that could prevent you from developing your passion even further. If there are new experiences you want to try, break out of your comfort zone and continue to learn. Try saying “yes” to things more often or doing something new that you haven’t tried before so you can push yourself. [19] X Research source Try switching up your daily routine each day so you can experience something slightly different each day. Move toward things you’re afraid of. For example, if you’re passionate about art but scared to work with paints, buy yourself a small paint set and try to make a small piece of art every day to practice. Even though it will seem difficult at first, it will be more rewarding and fulfilling knowing that you’re pursuing what you love."
