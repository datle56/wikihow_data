      "title": "Choose a username that reflects who you are.",
      "content": "Choose a username that reflects who you are. What are you passionate about? Think of any hobbies, sports, or other activities you're involved with or love doing, and use words relating to those interests in your unique email address. Also, consider pet names, favorite songs, musical artists, etc., and work those elements into your email address . An example for a volleyball fan could be 'volleygirl@yahoo.co.uk', and one for a Star Wars fan could be 'theforce96@aol.com'."

      "content": "Consider your favorite songs and lyrics. Song titles are memorable, and choosing the right song name for your email address is a great way to reflect your personality. If your favorite song name is taken, consider your favorite lyrics from the song."

    {
      "title": "Keep your unique email address on the shorter side.",
      "content": "Keep your unique email address on the shorter side. Don't pick an address that's long and cryptic. If you're making an email address on Gmail, for example, and it's flagged as taken, Gmail will suggest a variation of the address you chose with a string of numbers. This might seem like a great idea, but it's not! It'll be a lot harder for someone, including yourself, to remember all those numbers! For example, if volleygirl@gmail.com is taken, don't use volleygirl329823490234@gmail.com. Try something more creative like XvolleygirlX@gmail.com, volley.girl.uk@gmail.com, volleyqueen@gmail.com, or volleygirl.taylorsversion@gmail.com ."
    },
    {
      "title": "If your name is common, add your middle name.",
      "content": "If your name is common, add your middle name. For example, the email \"janedoe@gmail.com\" is probably taken, but \"janemarydoe@gmail.com\" may not be. You can also reverse the order, such as doejanemary@gmail.com."
    },
    {
      "title": "For a business email address, keep the name relevant and professional.",
      "content": "For a business email address, keep the name relevant and professional. If you're creating a unique email address for your business, include your business name in the email. For example, an email like \"pizzapalace@gmail.com\" for a company called \"Ceasar's Pizza\" is too vagueâ€”caesarspizzapalace@gmail.com would be more unique and memorable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid rare characters when possible.",
      "content": "Avoid rare characters when possible. If the email address you want is taken, you might consider adding a unique character like \"-\" or \"_\" so you can still use a variation of it. While this can be a good way to get a version of the address you want to use, rare characters are more difficult to remember than common characters. For example, pizza_palace@outlook.com is harder to remember than pizzapalace@outlook.com. If you want an email address that's easy to remember, try adding another word to the address instead of symbols."

      "title": "Register the account with an email service provider.",
      "content": "Register the account with an email service provider. Most email addresses end with @gmail.com, @outlook.com, and @yahoo.com, as services like Gmail , Yahoo , and Outlook are currently popular. If you want a more unique email address, you might consider a less popular email provider like ProtonMail or Mail.com."
