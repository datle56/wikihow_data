You can combine multiple herbs if you’d like, but you may end up diluting any positive effects if you do this. [2] X Research source While there are a variety of herbs you can choose, stay away from using anything you can’t eat just to be safe. Under no condition should you use a herb or plant that is toxic to humans, like sumac, hogweed, or foxglove. [3] X Research source Indian strawberry has been used for centuries as an antiseptic and anticoagulant. [5] X Research source Thyme, eucalyptus, and dandelion are used as cold remedies and may refresh your skin if used in a poultice. [6] X Research source Flaxseed is supposedly good for colds, but there is little evidence that it works. [7] X Research source Other popular options include garlic, mint, yarrow, sage, flannel-bush, gooseberry and pine. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Select a liquid to combine with your herbs and make a paste. If you merely put the herbs on your skin, they’ll simply sit on the surface and won’t do anything. You have a few options when it comes to the liquid you use, including honey, neem oil, milk, and water. You can also use coconut oil or olive oil if you’d like. [9] X Research source Never mix your herbal ingredients with an acidic liquid or medicated cream, since it may spark a negative reaction on your skin. Honey is one of the few natural ingredients with scientifically proven benefits. It’s great for scrapes, minor wounds, and inflammation. If you do use honey, opt for manuka honey if you can. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Use neem oil if you’re treating a sensitive skin condition or bug bite. [11] X Research source Use water or milk if you only want the herbal properties. These ingredients are safe bets and won’t interact with any of your herbal ingredients. Some people use milk and bread alone to prevent infections, but there’s mixed evidence on whether this works or not. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your herbal ingredients and pat them dry.",
      "content": "Wash your herbal ingredients and pat them dry. Run the plant that you’re using under cold water to rinse off any pests or bacteria off. Do this for 45-60 seconds to really give it a thorough wash. Use a paper towel or clean cloth to gently blot the plant dry. How much plant matter you use depends entirely on the size of the area that you’re covering. Generally speaking, you don’t need more than a small handful of herbs to make a decent poultice. If you’re using a plat you cultivated yourself, remove the stems and branches. Only use the leaves or petals (depending on what you’re using)."

Keep mixing the ingredients for 1-2 minutes until the herbs and liquid are thoroughly mixed together and the color of the paste is uniform. The consistency should be similar to thick syrup; add more herbs or liquid to change the texture and continue mixing as needed until you have a thick paste. [14] X Research source You can add flour to your mixture if you can’t get the ingredients to form a thick paste. It’s more of an art than science when it comes to mixing a poultice. The goal is to get the right consistency, so don’t worry about adding more herbs to make it thicker or more liquid to make it thinner."
