      "content": "Be patient with them, especially when they are being fussy about the details. Virgos are known for being perfectionists. They want everything to be just right, down to the very last, tiniest detail. This can be frustrating, especially to those who don't think the details are that important. The best thing to do would be to allow the Virgo express his or her creativity. [1] X Research source If the Virgo you are dating is getting stressed out over the details for something, ask if you can help. Virgos can also be self-conscious and self-critical. Try to reassure him or her that everything is great. Don't try to make it seem like whatever they are fretting over is unimportant, however."

[2] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. They also tend to be very critical of themselves. Try to avoid teasing Virgos, even if it is in a friendly manner—they will likely take it seriously, and end up feeling very hurt.

The best thing you could do is to compliment the Virgo and show your support. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Let them focus on their work, but also try to get them to relax every once in a while. Virgos can be workaholics, and once they get started on a project, it can be hard for them to stop. [4] X Research source There is nothing wrong with this—to a certain extent. Give the Virgo enough privacy to focus on their work, but also make sure that they aren't overworking themselves. A good way to do this is to express your concern for their health—or simply telling them that you miss them. This will help the Virgo realize how much you care, and he or she might take a break from whatever they are working on. Don't try to make it seem like you are more important than the Virgo's work. He or she most certainly thinks you are more important, but sometimes he/she will get lost in a certain project. [5] X Research source Sometimes, a Virgo will be trying to focus on too many things at once. All they need is a kind reminder to take things one step at a time, and to finish one project before starting another."

      "content": "Work with their practical nature, not against it. If you are thinking of giving any gift to them, choose something that they can use for a while. Flowers and chocolates might earn you a smile, but a more practical gift, such as a notebook, would be even better. At the same time, you might want to avoid lavish, expensive gifts at first. Not only may this make a modest Virgo feel uncomfortable, but he or she might see the gift as an unnecessary waste of money. [6] X Research source Consider the gift of learning. If your date has always wanted to learn pottery, see if your local community center offers such classes that the two of you can take together. This will allow your date to learn something new while spending time with you."

      "content": "Stay loyal, support their romantic side. Virgos take relationships and loyalty very seriously. They also tend to be romantics by nature. Don't hesitate to take a Virgo out on a nice, romantic date. Keep in mind that Virgos tend to be picky, and they don't always like surprises. To ensure that your surprise goes well, ask what sort of food he/she likes to eat. You may also want to keep the first surprise simple, inexpensive, and quiet. An expensive party with lots of people might not go well. If you're dating a Virgo woman, don't be surprised if she offers to help pay for the dinner.
