      "content": "Sprinkle baby powder onto the oil and let it absorb for 5 to 10 minutes. Baby powder works as a grease and oil absorber, so it will help to pull the oil out of the fabric of your shoes. Make sure the stain is covered entirely with powder and leave it to sit in an undisturbed area for at least 5 minutes.

      "content": "Use a toothbrush to dust off the baby powder. Do not rub the powder into the shoe, or you could put the oil back into the canvas. Dust the powder into the sink or onto a paper towel that can be thrown away. [3] X Research source You can also use a clean boot brush if you have one.

      "title": "Rub the stain with 1 drop of dish soap and hot water.",
      "content": "Rub the stain with 1 drop of dish soap and hot water. If the oil on your shoe was old and had a long time to set in, the baby powder may not have taken it away completely. Run a washcloth under hot water and wring out the excess. Pour 1 drop of dish soap onto the cloth and use that to gently rub at the oil stain. Keep rubbing until the stain is lighter or gone. [5] X Research source Dish soap is great for removing grease since it is made to break down oil on your dishes."

      "content": "Blot up the oil with a towel. If you just recently got the stain on your shoes, you may be able to get the majority out by blotting it up with a paper towel. Gently dab a clean paper towel over the stain. Do not rub the stain at all, or you could push it further into the leather. [7] X Research source If the stain is old, you probably won’t get any grease out this way."

      "title": "Spray oil remover onto the grease stain.",
      "content": "Spray oil remover onto the grease stain. Oil remover is a spray version of baby powder that works well on leather since it penetrates deeply without harming the material. Hold the spray can about 6 inches (15 cm) away from your shoes and coat the stain in the oil remover. Make sure the entire stain is covered. [8] X Research source You can find oil remover spray at most home goods or leather stores. It’s okay if a little bit of the remover gets on an area that does not have a stain."

      "content": "Let the remover sit for at least 2 hours. Allow the remover spray to pull all of the oil out of the leather by letting it sit for a few hours. Leave your shoes in a cool, dry area where they won’t be disturbed. [9] X Research source If the stain is really old or large, you may need to let it sit for up to 3 hours. [10] X Research source"

You can tell when the remover has absorbed all of the oil that it can when it starts to buckle and crack on your shoes. Use a toothbrush or a boot brush to gently swipe the remover away. You may need to wipe the remover away for a few minutes before it goes away completely. [11] X Research source"

Add more cornstarch to any areas of the stain that are darker than others.
