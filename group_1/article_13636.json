      "content": "Be clean. You are in a room full of students. Depending upon the weather and everyone's health, there might be germs around. So, it is best to maintain hygiene for your own sake. When you're in the sixth grade, some people judge you really fast. Even the teachers notice when a student looks unclean. Remember to keep your nails cut and clean. Brush your teeth, tongue, and even the inside of your cheeks as the tongue and cheeks hold on to bacteria. Wash your hair as needed. You could even put on a little bit of lip gloss if you want, but don't overdo the makeup. Bathe every day and use deodorant if you need to."

      "content": "Put on fresh, ironed clothes and clean shoes. Don't wear clothes that are too revealing or tight. Wear clothes that feel comfortable and fit your personality. If you're on your period, wear cotton underwear and wear tampons or pads. If your flow is a bit heavier and you're not comfortable with bigger tampons, try a tampon and a panty liner. Also, if you feel you are about to start your period, keep pads in your locker and wear a liner every day. [1] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 1515 wikiHow readers how theyâ€™re most likely to take care of their appearance, and only 10% of them said wearing deodorant that smells nice. [Take Poll] While this might not change your physical appearance, remember that wearing deodorant is a key part to practicing personal hygiene."

      "content": "Keep your locker organized and sort of personalized. Add a magnetic mirror and a couple of pictures if you want. Keep your books in order of classes. (If English is first, keep your English book on top) It's a good idea to keep organized because even though you may have free time between classes, you want to be prepared. [2] X Research source Put sticky note reminders inside of your lockers and on your books so you won't forget upcoming projects, homework, or assignments. Keep pads in the back of your locker for emergencies, make sure to keep them stocked up so you don't run out. Don't start pack ratting, because when you start throwing your garbage and food in your locker, it will all add up to a big mess. Before you throw your banana peel and apple core inside your locker, think of the consequences. Your locker will start stinking, attracting bugs, and molding. Every week, spray some air freshener inside your locker if it's allowed. Some people are allergic to the smells. Every month, wipe your locker with tissues or just a wet wipe. It will keep your locker clean and dust-free. Make sure you have a locker with a lock that has a combination you can remember, so no one can steal your stuff. If you have a locker with a hook, you can hang your backpack or jacket on it. If you don't, then just buy the ones you can stick on with adhesive."

      "content": "Take clear and organized notes. Note-taking is very important in the sixth grade. It keeps you ahead of class and refreshes your brain every time you look at it. Try to pay attention and take notes of only the important things, so you have all the information you need and not take up a lot of space. However, if you have a test, make sure you get everything the teacher says. Make a Venn Diagram showing differences and make a chart to separate things. Here's how: Take Better Notes [3] X Research source"

Keep your supplies in your pencil case and remember not to sharpen, put cut-up paper, or put eraser bits in your desk. Now, wipe your desk like how you wipe your locker. Don't write on your desk, it's thought of as vandalism and no one will trust you with their things after you do that."

Freshen your bag and maybe add some cute key chains or some stickers to make it match your personality. Remember to always bring your pencil case, lunch bag and binder home in your bag. Treat your backpack with care and respect. Wash your backpack to keep it clean and fresh every once in a while. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to make friends. Don't try to get involved in a group of popular girls unless you're keen to do so; there is no need to force yourself to be with people you don't feel comfortable with. Try to be friends with someone nice and you can trust. Don't lie because one day it will catch up with you and no one likes a lying phony. Don't show off because people will think you're trying to be the best and they'll not want to hang out with you. Don't let anyone intimidate you or get under your skin. Tell a teacher or someone you trust if you're being bullied. Don't try the dating thing because you have your whole life to live and you don't want someone to break your heart when you're 11 or 12. Try not to flirt or act like someone you're not. Everyone has crushes, so don't think having one is wrong. You don't need to have an intimate relationship. Being friends is good enough, isn't it?"

      "content": "Remember that teachers are a big part of the school. Say \"hey\" casually when you see him/her anywhere other then the classroom and \"Hey, Good Morning\" when you enter the classroom. Don't say things loudly and vibrant or too cheesy, it will creep him/her out and embarrass you. Teachers are human beings, defend your teacher and try to stay away from the class clown and goofballs of the class because they might influence you or get you in trouble. Don't talk when the teacher is talking and try to ask questions if you don't understand, people won't laugh at you if you have one."

Try to stay on the topic if you have a partner job and don't go off-topic. Stay friendly and nice and try your best to be the best."

      "title": "Stay on top of your projects and tests.",
      "content": "Stay on top of your projects and tests. Projects and tests are very important. When you have a project you need to have a partner with, choose someone you know you can work well with. Don't choose the same person over and over because you want to make friends and the teacher will see you can't work with anyone else. Review your notes when you have an upcoming test and, if necessary, ask your teacher after class for some extra help. Start studying one or two weeks before a test, don't cram 'till 1:30 in the morning. Instead, have a good night's rest and a healthy breakfast so you're ready to handle the test.

      "content": "Go to bed early so you can wake up early and prepare for school. Try getting up at an earlier hour so you can have a little time to prepare. Also, timing will help you in your adulthood too, so get practicing. It's also really nice outside when you get up. Get to school a few minutes early. When you go from class to class, don't stop in the hallway and chat unless you are sure you have the time. Get to class, people find this extremely irresponsible. Some people have a high amount of jealousy, so if the mean girls bump into you, don't worry about them, ignore any insults and get to class because usually, the mean girls main goal is to get you in trouble. Remember, anytime they act nice to you, think about it."

For most girls, it takes about 1 1/2-2 hours. So if school starts at 8am, get up at 6am or 6:30am, or if at 9am, 7am or 6:30am, as it's really helpful. Also, when you get home from school, if you have extra-curricular (dance, karate, skating etc.) you should plan when you'll do homework or when you'll finish your projects, just figure it out."

Remember, you still need to have energy to get through the rest of the day. If you want to buy lunch, make sure your money is safe. Make sure that the mean girls don't sit near you. They'll try to embarrass you, and the whole school will be there to watch. Once the bell rings, get to class."
