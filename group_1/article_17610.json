      "content": "Submerge the ball in just-boiled water until it reshapes. Boil a pot of water, then pour the water into a heat-proof cup. Place the ping pong ball in the water, and use a spoon to submerge it until it pops back into shape. [1] X Research source Remove the ball with your spoon and let it cool for 1-2 minutes. The heat expands the air inside the ping pong ball, making it push outwards and pop the dent back into place. [2] X Research source To help the cooling ping pong ball keep its shape, place it in the middle of a piece of toilet paper and hold the paper by the corners to create a sort of \"ping pong hammock.\""

      "content": "Hold a warm hair dryer 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) from the ball for 1-2 minutes. Hold the ball in your hand and point a hair dryer set to “hot” directly at it. Give it 1-2 minutes to heat the air inside, making that air expand. [3] X Research source In most cases, the dent will pop right out. For added science-y fun, point the hair dryer straight up and see if you can levitate the ping pong ball in the air stream. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the ball 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) over a lighter for 1-2 minutes. As long as you’ve got some heat, the air inside the ball will expand and pop the dent. [5] X Research source Wear heat-proof gloves or hold the ball with metal tongs. Position it over an open flame until the dent reverses (about 1-2 minutes). Avoid touching the flame to the ball itself. Ping pong balls are often flammable or may melt. [6] X Research source Only do this over a fireproof surface with a fire extinguisher nearby. If you can, rotate the ping pong ball as you heat it to prevent the surface from melting. Don’t handle the ball with your bare fingers."

      "content": "Squeeze around the dent with your thumb. Hold the ball in your hand and lightly press the area immediately surrounding the dent with your thumb. It won’t always work, and may take a little care and practice, but the ball will sometimes pop right back into place."
