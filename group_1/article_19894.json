      "content": "Rub olive oil or vegetable oil onto your skin. Hold your hands over a sink and pour a generous amount of olive or vegetable oil into your palms. Rub your hands together thoroughly and focus on working away at the paint. Turn on the water with your elbow and continue rubbing your hands underneath the running water. If the paint isn’t coming off, squirt some hand soap into your palm and continue rubbing. To avoid making a mess, it may be best to do this in the shower if the spray paint is anywhere other than your hands and/or arms."

Continue rubbing until the paint is gone. [1] X Research source Be careful not to touch your eyes when your hands have essential oils on them, as this may cause stinging and irritation."
