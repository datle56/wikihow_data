    {
      "title": "Absent-minded",
      "content": "Absent-minded An absent-minded character might be inattentive, oblivious, or just plain forgetful. They might also be prone to daydreaming or focusing more on the thoughts in their head than what’s happening in the world around them. As a result, absent-minded characters may need to be steered back on track by their more focused companions in a D&D party. [1] X Research source I’m easily distracted and always have a string of unfinished tasks on my to-do list. I’m pretty oblivious to my surroundings. I’m always wandering off to look at inconsequential things and get lost easily. I flake out on promises a lot. I don’t mean to…I just forget! If there’s a plan, I’ll forget it. If I don’t forget it…I usually end up ignoring it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aggressive",
      "content": "Aggressive Aggressive characters tend to rely on force to get what they want and react with anger or violence when challenged. They’re the kind of characters who start bar fights in taverns or choose to throw punches rather than negotiate with an enemy. They’re great allies to have in battle but may get into trouble because they’re so hotheaded! [2] X Research source I feel the most peaceful in the heat of battle as I vanquish my foes. I’m always the first to run into battle. I’ll start a fight over anything. I’ll even do it just because I’m bored! Violence is my first response to any challenge. I get unreasonably angry at the slightest insult. I use language so foul that I can make sailors blush—and not afraid to give someone a tongue lashing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Artistic",
      "content": "Artistic Artistic characters tend to be creative and expressive. They may have an artistic skill that they incorporate into their craft—or something they just do as a hobby. For example, you might play a bard with a tendency to dance out their feelings or a druid determined to illustrate and publish a guide to magical plants. Giving your PC an artistic trait is a great way to add some extra flavor to their personality! [3] X Research source I’m always doodling on the margins of my spellbook. I paint all the fascinating flora and fauna I see in my travel journal. I can see the true beauty in anything…even a beholder! I love to improvise new songs, but not everyone appreciates the fact that I’m always humming under my breath."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cautious",
      "content": "Cautious A cautious character’s motto is “Better safe than sorry!” Measured and vigilant, they always look twice before leaping into a potentially dangerous situation. They also tend to prefer peaceful solutions over violent ones. They’re great at keeping an unruly party in check—though you could also choose to make a character whose extreme caution makes them slow to trust or cowardly on a battlefield. [4] X Research source I’m slow to trust and often assume the worst of people, but once they win me over, I’m a friend for life. I never trust anyone other than myself and don’t intend to change that. I make sure to know my enemy before I act, lest I bite off more than I can chew. I’m the first one to panic (or advocate a speedy retreat) when a threat arises."
    },
    {
      "title": "Charming",
      "content": "Charming Charming characters have a sharp wit and a silver tongue. There are plenty of ways to make a charming character: you might make a PC who could woo a dragon away from its hoard or a PC with a clever, well-timed quip for even the most dire of circumstances. Regardless, a charming PC is more likely to solve their problems with words instead of force—and other characters are likely to listen to them! [5] X Research source I can (and do) sweet-talk just about anyone. Flattery gets me everywhere! I absolutely adore a well-crafted insult, even one that’s directed at me. I make witty jokes and quips at all the worst moments. I love gossip and know how to pry the juicy details out of anyone’s mouth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compassionate",
      "content": "Compassionate Compassionate characters are generally also good-aligned (or, at least, they’re not considered evil-aligned!) They care deeply about the world around them and may prefer to do quests for people who genuinely need help rather than for profit. You might even make a compassionate character who is altruistic to a fault and currently down on their luck because they never accept payment for their services! [6] X Research source I can empathize and find common ground between even the most hostile enemies. I fight for those who can’t fight for themselves. I go out of my way to help people, even if it puts me in danger. I can never say “no” when someone asks me for a favor. I watch over my friends like a protective mother, whether they want me to or not."
    },
    {
      "title": "Daredevil",
      "content": "Daredevil Daredevil characters aren’t necessarily violent or aggressive—they simply aim to live life to the fullest and may not consider the consequences that come with their high-risk, high-reward lifestyle. They also tend to be pretty spontaneous and may catch their fellow adventurous off-guard with sudden, unexpected feats of derring-do. [7] X Research source I like helping people…but I also like the rush I get from throwing myself into danger. I’ve always wanted to be an adventurer. Travel and constant danger sound fun! I’ll say “yes” to anything—it doesn’t matter what I’m asked to do. I'm a gambler. I can't resist the thrill of taking a risk for a possible payoff."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dishonest",
      "content": "Dishonest Dishonest characters are prone to lying, either because they feel they need to do so to survive or simply because it’s the easiest way to get what they want. They may also have underhanded habits, like stealing. However, dishonesty can also land them in hot water when their lies are exposed; dishonest characters may need to own up to the truth or quickly talk their way out of trouble. [8] X Research source I lie about almost everything, even when there's no reason to do it. I have a false identity and will tell any lie to protect it. I steal anything I see that might have some value. I love swindling people who are more powerful than me! I don’t consider it “stealing” when I need something more than the person who has it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dutiful",
      "content": "Dutiful Dutiful characters know their purpose in life and believe that they are obligated to fulfill that purpose. Some characters might eagerly take on their duties by choice, while others might feel that they have no choice but to fulfill the duties placed on their shoulders. To those characters, duty can be more of a burden than a calling. [9] X Research source I would lay down my life for my comrades in a heartbeat. I feel obligated to fulfill a mission given to me by my order, even though I don’t want to. I tend to judge people who forsake their duties harshly. My parent taught me a sense of duty, and I’ll always uphold it, even when the odds are against me."
    },
    {
      "title": "Easygoing",
      "content": "Easygoing Easygoing characters are incredibly friendly and have a knack for getting along with people. They’re effortlessly likable—but that relaxed vibe may also result in a character who has trouble standing up for themselves. They may even be a bit gullible! An easygoing character may learn to be more assertive over the course of a D&D campaign . [10] X Research source I’m always on the lookout for new friends—I love introducing myself to people wherever I go. I’m pretty likable, so I tend to assume everyone wants to be friends with me. I tend to let other people do all the planning. I prefer to go with the flow. I’m comfortable in any social situation, no matter how tense it gets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eccentric",
      "content": "Eccentric There’s a lot of freedom to explore different quirks and oddities when you play an eccentric character! “Eccentric” simply means that your character is unconventional and often considered strange by the widely-accepted rules of society. So, any behavior that defies the societal norms where your character comes from makes them eccentric. Consider what might make your character a bit of an outsider in their hometown! [11] X Research source I always leave a calling card, no matter where I go. Sometimes I mutter about myself in the third person…even when others can hear me. I change my mood or my mind as quickly as the wind changes directions. I always dress in formal clothes, even when I’m slogging through a cave or exploring a dungeon. I can’t control my reaction when surprised or afraid. One time I burned down a building that had a spider in it!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Honest",
      "content": "Honest Honest characters don’t like to tell lies. They prefer sincerity—which is why most of the other characters they interact will are likely to find them trustworthy and reliable. Still, an overly truthful character might end up offending someone with their blunt honesty. Or, in tense situations, an honest character might not be able to tell a lie in order to prevent a battle since lying doesn’t come naturally to them. [12] X Research source I’m very earnest and unusually direct. Sometimes people are taken aback by my bluntness. It’s hard to conceal my emotions. I always wear my heart on my sleeve! I made a vow never to tell a lie, and I intend to keep it. I’m bad at keeping secrets. I always end up blurting out the truth!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Knowledgable",
      "content": "Knowledgable A knowledgable character might be a sage or scholar, a jack-of-all-trades, or someone invested in honing a specific craft to the point of perfection. They’re likely eager to learn more about the subjects that interest them—but it’s up to you to decide how far they’ll go for that knowledge. You may also choose to roll a high Intelligence ability score for a knowledgeable character. [13] X Research source I read every book I can get my hands on and travel with a dozen in my pack. I love a good puzzle! Once I get wind of a mystery, I’ll stop at nothing to solve it. I would risk life and limb (my own or someone else’s) to obtain new knowledge. I don’t believe in “forbidden” knowledge. What matters is what you do with it, right? I tend to assume I know more about a particular subject than anyone else around me. I have a single obscure hobby and will eagerly discuss it in detail."
    },
    {
      "title": "Optimistic",
      "content": "Optimistic Optimistic characters have a positive outlook on life and do their best to share that attitude with the people around them. They’re hopeful about the future and confident that a favorable outcome is always possible, even in dangerous or grim situations. An optimistic character can be a breath of fresh air for a battle-worn adventuring party—though they can also be a bit unrealistic with their constant positivity. [14] X Research source Absolutely nothing can shake my sunny disposition! In a bad situation, I’m the one telling everyone to look on the bright side. I’m more likely to laugh or crack a joke than cry, which sometimes rubs people the wrong way. I encourage everyone to be the best version of themselves that they can be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Polite",
      "content": "Polite Polite characters are well-versed in manners and proper etiquette and use them to navigate social situations, even if they don’t like the person they’re talking to. Your character might be polite by nature, or they might use their politeness to win over other characters’ trust and get their way. [15] X Research source For example: I genuinely believe that manners are important, no matter my situation. My elegance and refinement are tools I use to avoid arousing suspicion from others. No one can fake a smile, a handshake, or an interested nod like me! I was raised to have the manners of a noble, and I can’t imagine a world where I don’t use them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Relentless",
      "content": "Relentless A relentless character is one that pursues their goals with uncommon focus and determination. They may have a compelling reason to chase those goals—like searching for a mythical treasure or a kidnapped family member, for example—or they may simply be a very stubborn person! Decide why your character is so relentless and how you’ll portray that attitude as you play them. [16] X Research source I’m convinced I’ll find riches beyond my imagination if I keep looking for it. I fail often, but I’ll never, ever give up. I will stop at nothing to achieve my goals, even if I make a few enemies along the way. If someone questions my courage, I’ll never back down, no matter how dangerous the situation is. I’m going to recover something that was taken from me if it’s the last thing I do, and I have no time for distractions…or friends."
    },
    {
      "title": "Resentful",
      "content": "Resentful Resentful characters tend to hang onto perceived injustices long after they happen and may even have vengeful motivations if their need for payback is great enough. Some resentful characters might outwardly come off as bitter and angry to the people they meet—although others might do a better job of masking their discontent and quietly getting revenge when the situation calls for it. [17] X Research source I always remember an insult, no matter how inconsequential. I never show my anger—but I do plot my revenge. I get upset when I’m not the center of attention. I’m slow to forgive when I feel like someone has slighted me. I’ll never forget the crushing defeat I suffered at my enemy’s hands, and I’ll pay them back dearly for it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reserved",
      "content": "Reserved Reserved characters may come off as the strong, silent type. They seem relatively detached, quiet, and thoughtful (though they may not actually be as detached as they appear). They tend to hang back and let other people do the talking—which means they can be very observant and great at keeping secrets but hard to get to know because they have such a stoic, protective outer shell. [18] X Research source I speak very slowly and carefully like I’m choosing each word before I say it. I’m more likely to communicate with a grunt or hand gesture than with actual words. I’d rather stand back and observe people than get involved. I endure any injury or insult with quiet, steely discipline. I always wait for the other person to talk first. There’s no such thing as an awkward silence!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Romantic",
      "content": "Romantic Romantic characters tend to be idealistic, dreamy, and easily preoccupied with things like love and beauty. They may be determined to find love themselves or may simply have a romantic outlook on life and the world around them. A bard who sings nothing but yearning love songs or a faithful paladin searching for their lost love could be romantic characters! [19] X Research source I'm a hopeless romantic. Wherever I go, I’m always looking for “the one.” I fall in love in the blink of an eye…and fall out of love just as quickly. I have a weakness for great beauty—from breathtaking landscapes to pretty faces. I got rejected by someone I’m convinced is the love of my life, and I hope to prove myself worthy of them through my daring adventures!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spiritual",
      "content": "Spiritual Spiritual characters believe in something larger than themselves, whether it’s an organized religion or the inherent powers of the world around them (like druids, who revere nature rather than gods). You could even create a character whose spiritual beliefs stem back to an insidious cult rather than a good-aligned institution! Spirituality can influence everything from a PC’s morals to conversational habits. [20] X Research source For example: I put too much trust in my religious institution and its hierarchy. I constantly quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs. I idolize a particular hero of my faith and constantly revisit their deeds. I believe everything that happens to me is part of a greater divine plan. I keep holy symbols from every pantheon with me. Who knows which one I’ll need next? I see omens—both good and bad—everywhere. The gods are speaking to us, and we must listen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Superior",
      "content": "Superior PCs with an air of superiority may genuinely feel more important than other characters or may simply crave the influence and confidence that comes with a superior social standing. Alternatively, they may have an intensely perfectionistic streak and judge themselves just as harshly as they judge other people—or feel like they always have to come out on top when talking to someone. [21] X Research source I never settle for anything less than perfection. I never admit to any mistakes because I’m scared they’ll be used against me. I'm used to the very best in life, so I don’t appreciate the rustic adventuring life. I’d kill to get a noble title (and the respect that comes with it)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tormented",
      "content": "Tormented Tormented characters tend to have a dark past—something weighing them down that makes them seem gloomier or more grim than the average person. If you want to make a darker D&D character, come up with a reason for them to be tormented, either by some outside force causing them pain or by their own actions. [22] X Research source For example: I have awful visions of the future, but I don’t know how to prevent them from happening. I’m plagued by bloodthirsty urges that won’t let up no matter what I do. I’m haunted by my past and wake at night frightened by horrors I can barely remember. I faced the worst a vampire could throw at me and survived. I’m fearless, and my resolve is unwavering."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tough",
      "content": "Tough Tough characters tend to be strong and have high levels of endurance. They’re hardy, and they’re very aware of their own strength. However, tough characters may also end up overestimating themselves because they’re so strong—and end up in a sticky situation that they need help to get out of as a result. [23] X Research source I feel the need to prove that I’m the toughest person in the room. I’m thick-skinned. It’s very hard to get a rise out of me! It’s hard for me to respect anyone unless they’re a proven warrior (like me). Anyone who wants to earn my trust has to spar with me first. I have an iron stomach. I’ve never entered a drinking contest that I haven’t won!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wild",
      "content": "Wild Wild characters were likely raised far away from civilization and all its rules. So, as a result, they probably don’t know much about civilized society! Decide just how “uncivilized” your wild character is going to be; they might have absolutely no knowledge (or regard) for social standards at all! A wild PC might need characters who are more familiar with the art of conversation (and persuasion) to offer them guidance at times. [24] X Research source I prefer animals to people by a long shot. I’m always learning how to be among others—when to stay quiet and when to crack a joke. My personal hygiene is nonexistent, and so are my manners. I’m a forest-dweller who grew up in a tent in the woods, so I’m totally ignorant of city life. I was actually raised by wolves (or some other wild animal)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Worldly",
      "content": "Worldly Worldly characters are cultured and experienced in the ways of the world. They may have traveled far and wide, or they may simply be wealthy and able to experience the more sophisticated parts of cultures around the world. Either way, if your character is worldly, they’re probably someone with a lot of practical knowledge and exposure to different ideas; they’re an explorer, not a sage hidden away in a library! [25] X Research source I'm tolerant of people different from me, and I love exploring other cultures. I love to tell stories of my travels to faraway lands…even if I tend to embellish a little! I’m filled with glee at the idea of seeing things most people don’t—dragons, mimics, and monsters of all kinds. The more unsettling, the better. I’m desperately trying to escape my past and never stay in one place—so I’ve been everywhere."
    },
    {
      "title": "Traits are the small details that set your character apart from others.",
      "content": "Traits are the small details that set your character apart from others. For your player character (PC) to feel fully developed, it’s important to come up with details about how they act, think, and feel—toward themselves and the world around them. These details are what give your character flavor and make them feel distinct from other PCs at the table. The basic 5e rules recommend choosing 2 traits for your PC, but you’re welcome to come up with as many as you want! [26] X Research source For example, you might create a bard character only to discover that another player is also making one. So, rely on personality traits to differentiate the two. Say you create a scholarly, well-read bard who takes joy in telling stories and delving into long-lost ruins to recover old knowledge. Meanwhile, the other player might make a vivacious diva bard who loves nothing more than singing emotional ballads under a spotlight. They share a class but are very different characters!"

    {
      "title": "D&D characters are characterized by traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds.",
      "content": "D&D characters are characterized by traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds. Personality traits aren’t the only aspects of developing a character in 5e. Creating a PC also involves choosing ideals (your PC’s beliefs and moral principles), bonds (their connection to other people and the drive behind their motivations), and flaws (negative traits, vices, or weaknesses that may bring misfortune if exploited). The 5e rulebook recommends choosing 1 each for your PC—but in reality, you can choose as many as you like. [27] X Research source There's no real strategy to choosing traits in D&D—it's your character, and you get to play them however you like. That freedom is part of the fun of D&D! Negative traits can be just as fun to play as positive ones. Assigning your PC a negative trait (like \"dishonest\" or \"bitter\") makes them feel more real and gives them an opportunity for growth over the course of the campaign. Not sure which traits to choose? Try looking at your PC's highest and lowest ability scores, and assign them traits based on each one. For example, if your PC's highest ability score is Intelligence, you might give them the \"knowledgable\" trait. If their lowest score is Charisma, you might give them the \"eccentric\" or \"reserved\" trait."

      "title": "Emphasize your PC’s traits rather than trying to introduce them subtly.",
      "content": "Emphasize your PC’s traits rather than trying to introduce them subtly. Remember: you know your character’s personality very well, but your fellow players probably don’t. So, give them a clear sense of what your PC is like by really playing up their personality traits in conversations. If you’re subtle about it, the other players might not pick up on those smaller details you’re trying to convey. [28] X Research source For example, say your PC is very cautious to the point of paranoia and tends to mistrust everyone. So, emphasize that trait every time your PC meets someone new. You might state your PC’s trait through dialog with other characters and say things like, “I don’t trust you yet,” or “I trust myself and nobody else, and that’s how I like it!” In short, don’t be afraid to exaggerate. You might feel like it’s too much, but in reality, it’s probably just enough to clue the other players into what kind of person your PC is."

      "content": "Write down your PC’s traits so it’s easy to remember and roleplay them. When you start playing brand-new D&D characters , it can be hard to remember everything about them all the time. So, to make sure you don’t forget anything important, write their most important traits, ideals, and flaws on your character sheet and keep it close so you can refer to it as needed while roleplaying. [29] X Research source Traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws are what shape a PC from the beginning of the campaign onward—so try to be as descriptive as possible with them. It may also be helpful to note the NPCs (non-player characers) your character meets, locations you visit, and a quick summary of how your character feels about each of them. This record of their adventures (and personality traits) can be really helpful as you develop your character over the course of an entire campaign!"

      "title": "Let your character’s traits (and personality) evolve over time.",
      "content": "Let your character’s traits (and personality) evolve over time. In short, have your character grow and change along with the overarching narrative of your campaign! As they gain more experience and go on wild, oh-so-memorable adventures, you may decide that their perspective on the world naturally shifts, too—so find ways to portray those changes in your character as time goes on. [30] X Research source For example, a paranoid, mistrustful character might finally learn to rely on their fellow adventurers. To illustrate this, you might your character strike up a conversation with the other party members and tell them a secret they’ve been keeping, or finally ask for help after always insisting they don’t need any. Say you’re playing a wizard from a noble house who absolutely hates traversing the wilds and refuses to get their designer boots dirty—but learns to appreciate the wilderness and accept that a little mud isn’t the end of the world. So, for example, you might have them ruin those designer boots while jumping into a muddy lake to save a party member in order to highlight their growth."
