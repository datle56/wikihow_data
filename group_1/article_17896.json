      "content": "Kingdom of Rose In the first area of the Kingdom of Rose (which is where you’ll first spawn in the Second Sea, and the largest island in the game), look to the side of a red building. A red flower may spawn beside a set of stairs next to the building. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that red flowers will only spawn during the day—and won’t despawn until picked up."

      "content": "Green Zone There are actually two spawning locations for red flowers in the Green Zone. The first location is behind the Marine Lieutenant, close to the Quest Giver. The second location is near Fajita behind the large brown rocks. A red flower may spawn behind the rock closest to Fajita. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "The Factory",
      "content": "The Factory Red flowers also spawn on a circular plateau near the Factory. Find the plateau closest to the bridge, and you’ll find the flower’s spawning point. Remember: you may have to check a few different locations before you actually find a red flower! [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cave Island",
      "content": "Cave Island While this island doesn’t have an official name, players often call it “Cave Island.” You’ll find it in a remote area of the Second Sea; once you reach the island, go into the large main cave and enter its uppermost hidden chamber by going through a hole in the ceiling (near the wall). That hidden room is one of the places a blue flower may spawn. [5] X Research source Blue flowers only spawn at night—and even if one spawns during the night, it’ll despawn again during the day if it isn’t collected in time."

      "title": "Graveyard",
      "content": "Graveyard There are two spawning points on Graveyard Island, which is a small, spikey island in the Second Sea. For the first, look on one of the graves to the left. For the second, look beneath the tree that’s facing a cave; it’s the tree closest to the island with a vampire on it. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Usoap’s Island",
      "content": "Usoap’s Island This island also has two spawning points for blue flowers. The first place a flower may spawn is behind the left house, not far from the tree that’s next to the house. The other spawning point is simply on the ground; you’ll find it as you walk around the small island. [7] X Research source Usoap’s Island is in the Second Sea, near the Kingdom of Rose."

      "title": "Kill any NPC with a random drop rate.",
      "content": "Kill any NPC with a random drop rate. Yellow flowers don’t have specific spawning locations; rather, they spawn randomly. All you have to do is kill an NPC with a drop rate of 60%—but you may need to kill more than one NPC before a yellow flower spawns. Just keep at it until you get a flower! [8] X Research source Try killing Swan Pirates; they’re easy to take out and tend to clump together, so you’re more likely to find a yellow flower fast."

To do this, speak to the Alchemist NPC behind some vines and below a red mushroom in the Green Zone. When you talk to them, the Alchemist will tell you to find flowers so you can evolve a race to V2. There are also a few prerequisites for this quest: [9] X Research source Reach level 850 (or higher) Collect at least $500,000 Complete the Colosseum Quest (which you can get in the Second Sea by talking to Bartilo)"
