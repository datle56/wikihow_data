[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To establish a natural sleep rhythm, spend a week or two waking up without an alarm clock. Keep a log with all the times you wake up. Keep a parallel account of the times at night you feel sleepy enough to put yourself to bed. You may find that these numbers become more consistent after a few days without your alarm. Formalize your bedtime. Once you have established your natural waking and falling asleep times, set a routine around them. Wake up and fall asleep on that schedule consistently. If your natural sleep routine seems to be inconsistent, you may need to experiment with setting different bedtimes and seeing which ones feel best. \"Morning\" people tend to have an easier time setting their sleep schedules. If you tend to be more energetic in the evening, you may just need to set a sleep time. [3] X Research source Make sure your formalized sleep schedule gives you the right amount of sleep.

Remove as many distractions as possible (as detailed in part two) to make a sleep-friendly environment. Lights, sounds, and anything else that might wake you up should be eliminated. Older adults still need seven to eight hours of sleep, but may sleep more lightly and wake up frequently. If you are elderly, take naps and spend a little more time in bed than eight hours. If you have a baby under a year old, sleep deprivation is part of the deal. You can help by maintaining a few boundaries. Establish a wakeup schedule with your partner or other adult sharing parenting duties with you. Your baby should sleep in their own crib, though you may bring your baby into bed for nighttime nursing. Try waiting the baby out for the first few fusses or cries. Don't ignore the fussing, but give it a chance—a few minutes of noise might just mean your baby is settling down."
