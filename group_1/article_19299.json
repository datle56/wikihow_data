      "content": "Combine 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and 3 tbsp (15.9 g) of pepper flakes in a pot. Paragon Pest Control tells us that hot peppers have a compound in them called capsaicin, which is an irritant to most animals if they smell or taste it, and so makes an effective repellant. Cooking the pepper flakes in the water will help to release the capsaicin into the water and make the mixture more potent. To make the spray more potent, or if you don’t have hot pepper flakes available, use 10-15 blended cayenne or jalapeno peppers, instead, and include the seeds. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Simmer the mixture over medium heat for 15-20 minutes.",
      "content": "Simmer the mixture over medium heat for 15-20 minutes. Move the pot onto a burner and cover it with a lid. Wait for the water to reach a boil, and lower the temperature to medium heat. Then, stir the mixture regularly as it cooks to infuse the pepper into the water. [2] X Research source For added potency, add a diced white onion or 10-12 smashed cloves of garlic. Your eyes may start to water if there’s a lot of steam rising from the pot. Try to keep your face away from the steam, and leave the pot partially covered while you stir."

      "title": "Remove the mixture from the heat and let it stand for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Remove the mixture from the heat and let it stand for 24 hours. After the heating process is over, the spray needs to infuse for a longer period of time to become as potent as possible. [3] X Research source Leave the pot covered and place it in a safe area to diffuse the pepper flavor into the water. [4] X Research source Optionally, blend the mixture in a blender after it cools to let the capsaicin and other deterrents mingle and set. [5] X Research source Let the mixture set for up to 48 hours for a more potent infusion."

      "title": "Strain any flakes or chunks out of the mixture.",
      "content": "Strain any flakes or chunks out of the mixture. Pour the liquid through a sieve or cheesecloth , and gather the water in a large pot under the sieve. This will separate the flakes and other solids from the water, leaving only the hot pepper spray behind. [6] X Research source Since you’re going to be spraying the liquid, you don’t want the hot peppers suspended in the water. They can clog the spray bottle, making your spray less effective. Discard or compost the strained solids."

      "title": "Mix 2 tsp (10 mL) of biodegradable dish soap into the remaining liquid.",
      "content": "Mix 2 tsp (10 mL) of biodegradable dish soap into the remaining liquid. The dish soap helps the spray stick to the plants and other areas when you spray it outside. Make sure you only add the soap to the liquid after the pepper flakes have been strained out of the water. If they’re still in the water, the soap will stick to the flakes and get strained out. [7] X Research source Try using a castile soap , which is biodegradable and safe for outdoor use. It won’t harm your plants or soil, but is powerful enough to add some sticking power to the spray."

      "content": "Pour the liquid into a spray bottle. Use a funnel to make this easier. Label the spray bottle to prevent a mix-up, and write the date on the outside since the spray will be most effective if used within 2-3 months. When you’re ready to use the spray, make sure the cap and nozzle are secured, and shake the bottle vigorously. [8] X Research source If you get some liquid on your hands as you’re pouring it into the bottle, avoid touching your face, and immediately wash your hands to prevent irritation."

      "content": "Spray the liquid on and around plants to deter deer, rabbits, and insects. Paragon Pest Control says the spray works by giving animals a bit of a shock when they eat sprayed plants. In the morning or evening, head outside and mist the leaves, stems, and soil surrounding the plants that the deer and rabbits like best. Make sure you spray every part of the plant that you want to protect, since the animals can sometimes eat around the unsprayed parts. This spray is organic and safe for most plants, including ornamentals, crops, trees, and shrubs. If you're not sure how sensitive plants will react to the spray, test a small area of a leaf first. Wait 4 days to see if there’s a reaction before applying more. Keep a close eye on plants like ivy, ferns, succulents, palms, tomatoes, and azaleas, which are known to be sensitive to insecticides and pesticides. Never apply the spray in the middle of the day, as the heat from the sun can cause the spray to “bake” the leaves and kill the plant."

      "content": "Apply the spray to a bird feeder if you have squirrels. According to Paragon Pest Control, squirrels are very sensitive to the active ingredient in peppers. Meanwhile, birds are not. [9] X Research source Spray the mixture on your bird feeder and onto the seeds inside the feeder. When the squirrels eat the seeds, they’ll experience a burning sensation in their mouths and won’t revisit the bird feeder. [10] X Research source This also means that the spray won’t prevent birds from snacking on your plants, so use other deterrents for birds ."

      "content": "Use an ultra-potent pepper spray to deter bears. Most commercial bear sprays are essentially extremely potent pepper spray. [11] X Research source To make your own emergency spray, replace the flakes in the spray recipe with 24 large chopped cayenne peppers, and reduce the amount of water to 2 cups (470 mL). If you have bears visiting your yard, spray the areas that they frequent. [12] X Research source Important: Use this spray only as a passive deterrent. Always carry certified, commercial bear spray when traveling on foot through bear territory. Remember to keep pets away from the sprayed areas to avoid injury, especially if you're using a potent spray."

      "title": "Re-apply the spray every week and after rain for the best results.",
      "content": "Re-apply the spray every week and after rain for the best results. Unfortunately, the spray won’t last forever on plants, and is washed away by rain or regular watering. Apply it your garden once per week during the spring, summer, and fall to ensure that your plants are protected from pests. If it rains at any point, apply the spray again as soon as possible to deter deer, rabbits, and squirrels. If you notice the animal pests have been avoiding the areas that you’ve sprayed, but have chosen new targets in your garden, Paragon Pest Control advises spraying as many plants as you can. Eventually, the animals will learn that your garden is unsafe and will look for food elsewhere."

      "content": "Put a tall fence around your garden. The best defense against garden pests is a physical barrier. Construct a tall fence (8–9 ft (2.4–2.7 m)) that deer can’t leap over, and which extends 6–12 in (15–30 cm) underground, so rabbits can’t dig under it. Chicken wire makes an excellent fencing material that keeps both large and small animals away. [13] X Research source Many gardeners also add a “ceiling” of chicken wire to their fenced gardens so that climbing pests, like raccoons, can’t get in."

Marigolds are one of the best deterrent crops—rabbits, deer, and other pests don’t like the flavor or aroma, and may turn away if they see it. [14] X Research source Plant marigolds around the perimeter of your garden to act as a sort of shield. Other deterrent plants include lavender, catnip, garlic, and onions."

      "content": "Spray different pungent repellents all over your garden. Animals have to eat plants sprayed with pepper spray for it to work. To keep animals out of your garden altogether, use odor-based repellents . Look for ingredients like dried blood, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, or eggs, and spray them on the ground all around the garden. [15] X Research source Also, animals might build a tolerance for the pepper spray, so it’s best to rotate through different repellants, swapping for a new one each month."

Some gardeners hang old CDs or reflective tape from trees to “flash” animals. You might also install motion-activated noise machines or sprinklers. [16] X Research source"
