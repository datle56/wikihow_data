      "title": "Start with the words for numbers 1 through 5.",
      "content": "Start with the words for numbers 1 through 5. To count to 10 in Arabic, start with the first five numbers. Repeat the words until you have them memorized. You might use flashcards to help test your memory of the words. One is wahid (waah-heed) (واحد). Two is itnan (ihth-naan) (اثنان). Three is talata (theh-lah-theh) (ثلاثة). Four is arba'a (ahr-uh-bah-ah) (أربعة). Five is khamsa (khahm-sah) (خمسة). Note that the h has a guttural pronunciation. Imagine exhaling a strong, deep breath from the back of your throat as you say it."

      "content": "Move on to the words for numbers 6 through 10. Once you've got the first 5 numbers nailed down, you're ready to tackle the next 5. Practice them the same way you practiced the first 5, then put all 10 together to count to 10 in Arabic. Six is sitta (siht-tah) (ستة). Seven is sab'a (sab-uah) (سبعة). Eight is thamaniya (theh-mah-nee-yuh) (ثمانية). Nine is tis'a (tihs-aah) (تسعة). Speak the last syllable from further back in your throat. Ten is ashra (ahsh-ahr-rah) (عشرة). The r is ever so slightly clipped or rolled."

      "title": "Say sifr (see-fur) (صفر) for \"zero.\"",
      "content": "Say sifr (see-fur) (صفر) for \"zero.\" The English word \"zero\" derives from the French \"zéro\" or the Italian \"zero,\" which itself is a shortened form of \"zefiro.\" Ultimately, \"zefiro\" originates from the Arabic word \"ṣifr.\" [2] X Research source The concept of zero originated in India and the Arab world and was brought to Europe during the Crusades. [3] X Research source Just as in English, the word for \"zero\" is not typically used in reading numbers, unless you're reading a list of cardinal numbers, such as a phone number or a credit card number."

      "content": "Learn to recognize Arabic numerals. Western numerals are frequently referred to as \"Arabic\" numerals. However, the numerals traditionally used in Arabic are more properly called Hindu-Arabic numerals, as they were imported from India. [4] X Research source The Hindu-Arabic numbers are 10 symbols or digits, representing the numbers 0 and 1 through 9: ٩ ٨ ٧ ٦ ٥ ٤ ٣ ٢ ١ ٠ . As in English, these 10 digits are combined to form every other number. So 10 would be a 1 and a 0, just as in English: ١٠ (10). Arabic is written and read right to left. However, Arabic numerals are written and read from left to right, just as you read English and other European languages."

      "title": "Add the un suffix to the root digit name to make the words for the tens.",
      "content": "Add the un suffix to the root digit name to make the words for the tens. Except for the numbers 10 and 20, all the words for even tens from 3-9 are constructed by replacing the last syllable of the word for the first digit with the suffix un . This is very similar to the way most of these words are formed in English, by taking the beginning of the first digit and adding the suffix ty . [5] X Research source Twenty (20) is ishrun . In Arabic, words often have singular, plural, and dual forms. The dual form is specifically used for quantities of two. So, when we say \"twenty\" in Arabic, we're essentially saying \"two tens.\" and not \" tens of two.\" This is why the Arabic word for \"twenty,\" is \"ishrun\", the dual form of the word (10) \"Ashra\". Thirty (30) is thalathun . Forty (40) is arba'un . Fifty (50) is khamsun . Sixty (60) is sittun . Seventy (70) is sab'un . Eighty (80) is thamanun . Ninety (90) is tis'un . The ending “-un” can sometimes change to “-een” due to grammatical rules. This is because of the Arabic grammatical system of word endings, which changes endings to show their role in a sentence. For example, the word for “forty,” “arba’un,” might also appear as “arba’een.” It's also worthy to note that the “-een” ending is more common in informal speech."

      "content": "Combine the digit with a form of the word for ten for 13 through 19. To form the words for the numbers 13 through 19, start with the word for the second digit in the number, then add the word ashar . [6] X Research source Numbers 11 and 12 have specific forms: \"ahad 'ashar\" (أحد عشر) for 11 and \"ithna 'ashar\" (اثنا عشر) for 12. These numbers use the words \"ahad\" (one) and \"ithna\" (two) respectively, instead of the more common forms \"wahed\" and \"ethnan.\" For example, 13 would be thalatha 'ashar . A literal translation would be \"three and ten.\" All the other numbers from 13 through 19 follow this same formula."

To make compound words for larger numbers, use the word for the last digit, followed by the word for and : the connector wa- . Then add the proper word for the tens place. [7] X Research source For example, fifty-three (53) is thalatha wa-khamsun . The literal translation is the same as for the numbers 11 through 19. Thalatha wa-khamsun could be literally translated as \"three and fifty.\""

Go to the app store on your phone and search for Arabic counting apps or multi-language counting apps (if you want to expand your knowledge beyond Arabic). Many of these apps are available for free. For example, the app Polynumial translates numbers and helps you learn how to count. While the main app includes 50 different languages, there is also an Arabic-specific version. However, this app is only available for iPhones."

      "title": "Repeat in Arabic any numbers you encounter throughout the day.",
      "content": "Repeat in Arabic any numbers you encounter throughout the day. As you go about your day, you likely see and use numbers without really thinking about it. Each number you see, stop and try to translate it into Arabic. With practice, when you see the number your brain will automatically think of how to say it in Arabic. For example, if you check your bank balance, try saying the number in Arabic. You can also do this with your step count, items in your grocery cart, number of minutes until lunchtime, or number of points in a sports game."

Basic counting flashcards, typically made for small children learning numbers, have a number of objects on one side and the number on the other. There's no reason you can't use these kinds of flashcards to practice Arabic counting. [9] X Research source You can purchase sets of flashcards online or at an educational store. There are also websites where you can download printable flashcards for free. Simply do a search for \"free printable counting flashcards.\" Look up the word for the object online, then practice saying the word for the object along with the number of objects."
