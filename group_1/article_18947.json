      "content": "Start with high-quality recordings. As obvious as it may sound, ensuring that your recording is as high-quality as possible means you won't have to edit the recording in Audacity very much. If you're editing audio you didn't record, start with uncompressed audio files in WAV, AIFF, or other uncompressed file formats. If you're recording music , vocals, or anything else, follow these guidelines: Use high-quality recording equipment - A pop filter and a high-quality microphone will go a long way in ensuring high recording quality. Record in a good acoustic space - Try to record in a tight, insulated area. You can even turn a closet into a recording space by clearing it out and lining the walls with acoustic foam. Eliminate background noise - Record when air conditioners or other appliances aren't running. A high-quality microphone will pick up any sound, so minimize the number of sounds it can pick up."

If you compress the file first, you'll lose some quality. After you're finished enhancing the audio quality, you can export your audio files in a compressed format like FLAC , MP3, or OGG Vorbis.

[19] X Research source Keep in mind that these file types produce much larger files, as they aren't compressed. If you just want to send a song to someone for listening or sharing, opt for a compressed but lossless format like FLAC. The Apple equivalent of WAV files is AIFF . If you want to save as an AIFF, select Other uncompressed files , then select AIFF from the \"Header\" menu. If you need to send a file somewhere but still want optimal quality, the FLAC file type is a great compromise. With MP3s, part of the audio is removed from the finished file to make the file smaller, even at higher bitrates. FLAC files, though compressed, are lossless—meaning, they retain the audio's original details despite compression and are thus higher quality. [20] X Research source Alternatively, you can save it as a \"lossy\" file type like MP3, which compresses the audio to ensure maximum compatibility and the best possible sound with the smallest file size. MP3 is optimal if you want to share the file with someone for listening but not editing, as it'll usually create a file that is small enough to attach to an email or text message."

If you're licensing or uploading the music to a streaming service, select 48000 Hz instead. [21] X Research source If that produces too large of a file, you can usually reduce it to 44100 Hz (CD quality), which is the minimum recommended by licensing services. If the track is for video, select 96000 Hz . If that produces too large of a track, you can safely decrease the sample rate to 48000 Hz (which is used by Dolby Atmos) [22] X Research source , but avoid going lower. For encoding, use Signed 16-bit PCM for CD-quality, or 24-bit PCM for higher quality. However, 24-bit will result in a large file, so you might need to stay on the lower end. You can opt for 32-bit float with a WAV file, which is the maximum possible quality meant to preserve the audio in its rawest form.
