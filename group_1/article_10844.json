      "content": "Look for the symptoms of a scarcity mentality. If you have a scarcity mentality then you will probably take things too seriously . You may think to yourself: “If I fail, the sky will fall”. It won’t, though, and you know that and need to remind yourself. But you think it will, you become overly nervous and POOF! you have invited that failure because your negativity becomes an obstacle on your path to success. If it’s a game, then you may fumble with the ball. If it’s an exam, then you may not have been able to sleep and will perform poorly on the test. If it’s a date, you may come over as too needy and nervous and not as your usual, more relaxed self. Regain your empowerment by remembering all the opportunities you have been afforded and know that it is all a flow that will always continue."

      "title": "Focus on the abundance, not on the lack.",
      "content": "Focus on the abundance, not on the lack. What you focus on, you will see in your world. Since you can’t take in everything around you, your reticular activation system – your focus system in the mind – will bring into focus what you focus your thoughts on. This will allow you to see the abundance in your world that you may be missing right now. If you, for instance, have a lack of money, then don’t focus on your lack. Focus and think about the abundance of possibilities in the world to make money . Soon ideas and opportunities to make that happen will start to “pop up” in your world. It’s almost a bit freaky how things that hold solutions for you – perhaps books or acquaintances – that have been there in the background for quite a while just one day suddenly jump out at you."

      "title": "Appreciate.",
      "content": "Appreciate. One quick way to revert from the pretty normal habit of thinking about what you don’t have is simply to appreciate. Appreciate your food, life, your roof, your friends and family and so on. This can not only turn a sour mood into a more positive one within minutes, but it can also help you notice opportunities you have missed or forgotten about. And it'll create a more open vibe within you, a vibe that makes it easier to focus on the abundance. So, make a habit of appreciating something in your life for a few minutes each day."

    {
      "title": "Get organized",
      "content": "Get organized . When you don't feel abundant or good about yourself or life in general, that can mean you are simply not in order. Have your home clean, your clothes folded , your digital files in place , and your finances organized. Have some order and discipline, and you'll start seeing results."

    {
      "title": "Get an abundance vibe from other people.",
      "content": "Get an abundance vibe from other people. Since you get a scarcity mentality from, say, advertising and media, then you can change your input to change your mentality. Cut down on watching the news. Record your favourite shows and skip the commercials. Or just cut down on your TV and media consumption, period. Replace the scarcity vibe you get from that input. How do you do that? “Hang out” with people that have an abundance mentality. Read, listen to and watch personal development material. Besides reading your favourite personal development blogs, read success stories in books and magazines. Have a positive attitude to the abundance and success of your friends, family and co-workers. Hang out with people in real life who have more of an abundance mentality and less of a scarcity mentality. Be selective with what you put into your mind. Create your own environment of abundance."

      "title": "Share the wealth.",
      "content": "Share the wealth. One very good way to acknowledge how much you have is to share it. Do you feel like you're not making enough money? Give some away. Not enough love? Give some away. Not enough validation, appreciation, recognition? Give it all away. It's hard for something to feel scarce when you're giving it away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create win-win situations.",
      "content": "Create win-win situations. People with a scarcity mentality tend to see every relationship is win-lose, as in: \"It's either you or me, buddy, and I want it to be me.\" People with an abundance mentality, on the other hand, try to create mutually beneficial relationships in which both parties can win. Instead of winning an argument, for example, try to reach a consensus that you both can be happy with. Instead of competing, collaborate."

    {
      "title": "Remind yourself.",
      "content": "Remind yourself. It’s very easy to slip back into your old thought patterns. You just forget about what you should be thinking about. A useful tool to keep yourself from slipping is to use external reminders. You can, for example, use written notes posted at places you can’t avoid seeing several times each day – your workspace, fridge and mirrors – or put a bracelet on your wrist. Seeing words or quotes that remind you of your new abundance mentality can help your mind snap back into the right headspace once again. It might help to keep a thought log, where you write down unhelpful thoughts you have throughout the day—those could be limiting beliefs, they could be self-judgmental thoughts, etc. This way, you'll start to become aware of what you're actually thinking. Try writing some replacement thoughts as well, to help you process and get better at it."

      "title": "When you face your greatest loss, it may contain your greatest opportunity.",
      "content": "When you face your greatest loss, it may contain your greatest opportunity. If you lose your job and are close to losing your housing, you could sell off anything you don't like, want or immediately need to cut back on your physical possessions. That means less to move, so starting over might as well be where you always wanted to live. You have to find a way to make a living, so it might as well be entry level in whatever you always wanted to do instead of just looking for a job, any job. Shoot high. Those crises are the point in life where everything that held you back can be left behind and moving toward something better than you've ever had will make any sacrifices meaningful. It's very different being frugal and living small because you're just starting out or living a reduced lifestyle viewed as a failure. Use the chance to give yourself something that money can't buy, like time and freedom."
