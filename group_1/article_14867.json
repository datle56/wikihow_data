      "title": "Choose a creatine powder.",
      "content": "Choose a creatine powder. Creatine powder usually comes in a large plastic container with a scoop inside for measuring out the correct dosage. Go to a nutrition store or health food store and select a powder to use. Some creatine comes in pure form, and other powders are mixed with sugar so you can create a sweet energy drink. Avoid liquid creatine. Creatine begins degrading the moment it is mixed with water, so packaged liquid creatine is actually creatine waste. Manufacturers of such products are pulling a fast one on consumers. Creatine has been tested in multiple studies and is considered safe to use, but since it is a supplement, it has not been formally approved by the FDA. Check with your doctor if you're taking medication or have a condition that might be affected by taking a supplement."

      "title": "Decide whether to \"load\" or base your dosage on your body weight.",
      "content": "Decide whether to \"load\" or base your dosage on your body weight. Creatine manufacturers recommend starting out with a high dosage of creatine and gradually waning to a \"maintenance\" dose to maintain creatine levels in your body. It is also common to forego the loading period and base your dosage on body weight. [1] X Research source Loading is said to be safe for the body and help the consumer see results - bigger, stronger muscles - in just a few days. Creatine may affect insulin levels, so if you have a condition related to high or low blood sugar, use caution when taking high doses. You may want to consider the more moderate body weight-based method. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "title": "Take creatine at the same time every day.",
      "content": "Take creatine at the same time every day. It doesn't matter when you take your creatine; whether you consume it in the morning or at night, it will have the same effect on your body. However, for best results, consume it at the same time each day so that your body has time to process one dose before you consume the next one. Some people like to take creatine right before a workout, but its effects aren't instant, so it doesn't actually provide an immediate energy boost for weight-lifting and other exercises. If you want to take creatine on the go, bring a separate water bottle and store the creatine dry. If you premix it, the creatine will degrade."

      "title": "Measure out 5 grams (0.18 oz) of creatine powder.",
      "content": "Measure out 5 grams (0.18 oz) of creatine powder. When you're loading creatine, 5 grams (0.18 oz) is the recommended dosage to start with; unless a doctor has recommended otherwise, 5 grams (0.18 oz) is a safe bet. [3] X Research source Use the plastic measuring cup that came with the powder to measure it out. If your can of powder didn't come with a measuring tool, measure one heaping teaspoon, which is roughly equivalent to 5 grams."

      "title": "Mix the powder with one quart of water.",
      "content": "Mix the powder with one quart of water. Pour the powder directly into the water and use a spoon to quickly stir it. If you're using a bottle with a cap, you can close the cap and shake it. If you don't have a container that is exactly quart-sized, measure four cups of water into a large container and mix in the powder. You may find it convenient to buy a quart-sized water bottle with a lid, which you can carry with you for times when you want to take a dose of creatine outside the house. You can also mix creatine with juice or an electrolyte-containing energy drink."

      "title": "Drink the creatine immediately.",
      "content": "Drink the creatine immediately. As mentioned above, creatine beings to degrade when it is mixed with water, so you must consume it right away to get the maximum benefit from the supplement. Chase the creatine with more water. It's important to stay well hydrated while you take creatine, so follow it up with another cup or two. Eat and drink as normal. There are no dietary contraindications for creatine, so you may eat a normal meal before or after consuming it."
