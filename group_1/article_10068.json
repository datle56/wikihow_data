      "title": "Fill a large pot with water.",
      "content": "Fill a large pot with water. Add 0.5 gallons (1.9 L) of water to a large pot with handles. Select a pot that is large enough to hold all of the water with at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of head space at the top of the pot. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a pot that is large enough, use the biggest pot that you have and only cook half of the tortellini at one time."

    {
      "title": "Bring the water to a rapid boil over high heat.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a rapid boil over high heat. Place the pot in the center of a large burner on the stove. Turn the heat on the highest possible setting to boil the water, and wait until it is bubbling rapidly, which should take 10-12 minutes. [2] X Research source Be patient while the water boils. With a very large volume of water, it can take some time for the water to heat completely. Wait until the water is boiling before adding tortellini. If you don't, the pasta will soak up the water and taste different."

    {
      "title": "Add 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of salt to the water.",
      "content": "Add 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of salt to the water. Use a measuring spoon to pour the salt into the water. This will help the pasta cook quickly and evenly, and the cooked pasta will float to the top of the water when it’s ready to be served. [3] X Research source If you can’t eat salt, you can skip adding the salt and let the pasta cook for 1-2 extra minutes."

    {
      "title": "Use a slotted spoon to lower the tortellini into the water.",
      "content": "Use a slotted spoon to lower the tortellini into the water. To ensure that the tortellini don’t stick together or break open, lower them gently into the boiling water. They should sit in the water just below the surface. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a slotted spoon, you can use a large wooden spoon or a spatula. Just be careful not to spill any of the tortellini!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook the tortellini for 5 minutes or until they’re floating.",
      "content": "Cook the tortellini for 5 minutes or until they’re floating. Stir the tortellini as they cook to keep them from sticking together. After 5 minutes, they should be floating at the top of the water. Scoop one out of the water and wait for it to cool, and then taste it to ensure that it’s done. [5] X Research source If it isn’t done, cook the tortellini for an additional 1-2 minutes."

When the tortellini are cooked, turn off the burner and lower a slotted spoon into the water to scoop out the noodles. Transfer them to a separate bowl, and then pour the used water down the drain.

Don’t be afraid to get creative with your recipes and try something new!

While the oven heats, you can measure out your ingredients and begin to prepare the dish. [8] X Research source Be patient while the oven heats up. Depending on what kind of oven you have, it may take some time to reach the right temperature. Most ovens will make a noise when they’ve reached the correct temperature."

Then, spread 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of sauce over the bottom of the dish to create a base for the pasta so that it doesn’t stick to the bottom. [9] X Research source Be careful not to use too much sauce on the bottom of the dish. This can leave you with too little sauce throughout the rest of the dish, making the tortellini dry."

      "content": "Add half of the tortellini to the dish and cover it with an even layer of sauce. Arrange uncooked fresh or refrigerated tortellini in an even layer over the sauce on the bottom of the dish. Then, pour 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of sauce evenly over the tortellini. [10] X Research source Be sure to only use uncooked tortellini. Using cooked tortellini can cause the noodles to become overcooked and the filling will spill out. If you end up with some areas that have more sauce, use a spoon to spread the sauce out over the tortellini."
