Cut out about 500 calories a day to lose roughly 1–2 pounds each week. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source “Unfortunately, when it comes to spot reduction, targeting certain areas of your body for fat loss is a myth,” says Bergeron. [2] X Expert Source Steve Bergeron Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. However, losing weight in general can reduce your overall body fat levels. Over time, you'll notice your love handles will get smaller. Start counting calories for an entire day (try keeping a food diary or using an app like MyFitnessPal). Use this number as a starting point. Then, subtract 500 from this number to get an average calorie target that will result in weight loss."
