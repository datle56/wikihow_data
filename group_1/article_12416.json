Since most of these steps cannot be undone, you will lose information, forfeit any marketable presence you've developed online, and sometimes lose the opportunity to recreate your account with the same name. Are there other ways around the problem, such as changing your online name or using a different email account from your normal one? For example, if your current email address has some unsavory online associations, you can create a separate one for professional transactions, like sending resumes and applying for scholarships. If you're worried about old tweets, consider deleting all your tweets instead of deleting your entire Twitter/X account. If there is a problem with false or defamatory information about you online, contact a legal practitioner for advice in your jurisdiction."

      "content": "Weasel your way out of undeletable accounts. Some sites don’t allow full deletion, forcing you to merely “deactivate” (while your information stays in the system) or abandon your account. If there is a serious legal or safety reason you need to delete your account, contact the site's owner or engineers; at the very least, you should be able to get a name change to cover your real identity. If you can’t get anyone to intervene on your behalf, try using these steps: Log in and delete all of your personal information. If leaving certain fields blank isn’t an option, overwrite it with a clearly fake name, such as Dingus Oppenheimer IV or John Smith. Do this on all of your undeletable accounts, and remember to vary the info on each account so they can't be traced to one another. If you try to provide a different email address, the site will email it to confirm, meaning nonexistent addresses are out of the question. This brings us to the next step. If you don't have an unidentifiable email address to associate with the account, create one with a free email host, and make sure the address you select does not include any information that can identify you. Once you have a new anonymous email account, add it to your undeletable profile and confirm. Once it goes through, make sure your real email address no longer appears anywhere in this account."
