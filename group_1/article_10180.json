      "title": "Ask them to seek treatment.",
      "content": "Ask them to seek treatment. Do what you can to be supportive to your spouse. Often, this includes asking them to get help. Don't give them an ultimatum about seeking help, as this can lead to more guilt or resentment in your marriage. Instead, say that you think the self-harm is a serious issue and should be treated seriously. Ask them to see a professional. [1] X Research source Don't pressure or guilt your spouse into getting treatment and support. Instead, tell your partner that they deserve support. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Educate yourself.",
      "content": "Educate yourself. Most people don't deal with stress or problems by hurting themselves. Your spouse likely has some very deep or complex wounds that contribute to their self-harm. Often, these problems are best discussed and worked through with a counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist. Don't feel like you have to take on the role of a therapist when you are not qualified to help someone with these problems. However, learn what you can about self-harm so that you can be informed about it. For example, people who self-harm do so with the intent to inflict pain yet not kill themselves. It's a way to express difficult feelings, punish oneself, or show distress. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Take risks seriously.",
      "content": "Take risks seriously. If your spouse's behaviors escalate or are dangerous, don't hesitate to break your silence or get them immediate medical attention. If your spouse is threatening irreparable harm or that they want to kill themselves, do not hesitate in taking action. Call an ambulance, take them to the emergency department, call their therapist and their family. Get them immediate help. [4] X Research source Any threats that might be serious should be taken seriously."
    },
    {
      "title": "Support their treatment.",
      "content": "Support their treatment. Your spouse's treatment is a commitment that they want to be healthy and function in a healthy way. If your spouse agrees to treatment, support them in whatever steps they take, from seeing a therapist, starting medications, or joining a support group. If you start to feel upset or that your spouse is backsliding, remind yourself that they are taking steps and want things to change. Do everything you can to support that change, both for your relationship and for your spouse. [5] X Research source Offer any assistance you can give. For example, offer to drive them to appointments or help them get through especially difficult days by talking with them or giving them a hug. Let your spouse know that you are not there to judge them or look down on them. You want what is best for them, and you will support them in any way you can. If your spouse does not initially accept your offer to help, do not push them. Those who self-harm may feel guilt or shame regarding their actions, and may not be prepared to open themselves up and be vulnerable about their situation."

    {
      "title": "Create a space of acceptance.",
      "content": "Create a space of acceptance. Regardless of whether your partner decides to accept your assistance or not, try to create a space of openness and acceptance. Listen without judgment, and support them in the choices they make regarding their treatment and how they want to start the healing process. [6] X Research source Remind your partner that even if they don't want to talk now, you'll be there for them should the need ever arise."

    {
      "title": "Recognize that it's not your fault.",
      "content": "Recognize that it's not your fault. Don't blame yourself for your spouse's self-harming behaviors. Even if things within your marriage are not going well, the self-harm is not your fault. You are not responsible for your spouse's behavior. [7] X Research source Perhaps you take responsibility for increasing your spouse's stress or problems. This might be true, but you have not caused them to self-harm."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid anger or judgment.",
      "content": "Avoid anger or judgment. Remember that your spouse isn't trying to purposefully hurt you or your marriage. They aren't trying to make you feel guilty or trying to get attention in this way. [8] X Research source Instead, recognize that your spouse is experiencing intense emotions that are difficult to cope with. Even if you feel angered or frustrated by your spouse's behavior, respond kindly to them instead of with anger. If you're struggling with your own intense emotions, take a break from talking to your spouse. Go on a walk or say that you need a moment before interacting."

    {
      "title": "Remember who they are outside of self-harming.",
      "content": "Remember who they are outside of self-harming. While it's hard to see someone at their best when they are in crisis, remember who your spouse is outside of their self-harm. What are the things that attracted you to this person, and what made you want to marry them? Think about their good qualities and remind yourself that self-harm is not who they are, but just a part of their life at this moment. [9] X Research source Spend time with your spouse doing something that you enjoy together and remind yourself that you can still have fun and enjoy each other together. Go to a movie or take a hike that you both enjoy."

    {
      "title": "Spend quality time together.",
      "content": "Spend quality time together. Sometimes, self-harm can be one way that people deal with overwhelming stress or dissatisfaction. Think about what causes your spouse stress and see what you can do to help relieve it so you can spend time together. While this won't stop their self-harming, it can help you feel closer and build your relationship instead of taking it down. [10] X Research source For example, if your spouse feels overwhelmed with taking care of the children or works tireless hours away from home, set aside time once a week where it's just the two of you doing something enjoyable together. Get a babysitter, make dinner plans, or buy tickets to see a movie."

      "title": "Help reduce stress.",
      "content": "Help reduce stress. You may also want to help reduce any additional stress that may exacerbate their desire to self-harm. If you know certain chores or errands like paying the bills cause your partner additional stress, offer to take up those responsibilities. Even if there is no predictable stress trigger, it may help your spouse maintain overall calm and mental balance when you offer to take on some stressful activities."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take care of yourself.",
      "content": "Take care of yourself. Don't get sucked into focusing only on your spouse's needs and forget about your own. Take care of your body by eating nutritious meals, sleeping well, and exercising. Do activities you enjoy and stay socially connected with friends and family. Get the support you need to get through by having someone to talk to and resources to fall back for your own health and safety. [11] X Research source Don't ignore your own needs and wants. You might feel guilty for taking a night to be with friends or family, but remember that it's important for you to take care of yourself."

      "title": "Talk to someone.",
      "content": "Talk to someone. You might feel like your spouse's self-harm is too much for you to deal with and feel overwhelmed by how much it affects you and the marriage. Perhaps you feel trapped in the marriage or that you can't leave your partner. These are normal and common reactions. [12] X Research source However, you might need some support and someone to talk to, which is where a therapist can help. Especially if you're keeping your spouse's self-harm a secret from family and friends, having someone to talk to can be a relief and a way to work through your thoughts and feelings. Find a therapist by calling your insurance provider or by calling a local mental health clinic. You can also get a recommendation from a physician, friend, or family member."

      "title": "Cope with stress together.",
      "content": "Cope with stress together. Self-harm is a way to cope with stress. Encourage your spouse to cope with stress in more beneficial ways that don't hurt their body. Offer to engage in coping strategies together, like going for a walk together or exercising together. That way, both of you can work through stressors and support one another in dealing with stressors effectively.
