      "content": "Apply eyelid primer. Eyelid primer creates a smooth base for your eyeshadow. Just dab a thin layer onto your eyelids using your fingers before you start doing your eye makeup. Not only will the color go on more easily, but it will last longer and the colors you use will be more vibrant. [1] X Research source You can find eyelid primer wherever beauty products are sold. If you don’t have eyelid primer, you can use regular face primer instead. For a fun way to create a long-lasting smokey eye, try using colored eyeliner as your eyeshadow base. Smudge the eyeliner where you want it, then blend it out with your finger or an eyeshadow brush. Then, layer on a little eyeshadow to set the pencil. However, avoid using waterproof eyeliner for this, because it will dry quickly and won't smudge well. [2] X Expert Source Stephanie Navarro Professional Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 10 June 2020."

      "content": "Sweep your medium shade all over your eyelid. Take your middle eyeshadow shade and apply it over your entire eyelid. However, stop when you get to the natural crease on your lid, rather than brushing the color all the way up to your brows. [3] X Research source A dome-shaped eyeshadow brush is perfect for applying color all over your lids. You might also want to stop just before the inner corners of your eyes, since that’s where your highlighter will go. For example, if you’re using a brown palette that contains dark espresso, warm honey, and a shimmery gold shade, you’d use the honey all over your eyelid. To pick out the right color for you, consider which colors will complement your eye color and skin tone. For instance, green eyes look particularly good with a gray and plum smokey eye, while blue eyes pop with gold or copper. Brown eyes look great with shades of navy and gray."

      "content": "Apply the lightest color to the inner corner of your eyes and under your brow. The lightest color in your palette is known as the highlighter. Using your eyeshadow brush, dab the highlighter on the inside corner of your eyelid on both your upper and lower lids. Sweep it directly under your eyebrows as well, from the beginning to the end of your brows. Then, use a fluffy eyeshadow brush to blend the highlighter into your middle shade. [4] X Research source A small, flat brush is great for getting eyeshadow into the inner corners of your eyes, but you can use the same brush you used for the medium shade, if you want. Just be sure to use a cloth to wipe off any of the old color before you switch to a new shade. If you’re using the brown palette from above, this would be the warm honey shade. Figuring out exactly where to place your eyeshadow is the tricky part of a smokey eye, since everyone’s eye shape is different. Just practice and have fun!"

      "content": "Begin layering your darkest color onto the outer corner of your eyes. Starting at the outside of your eyes, sweep on the darkest color in a ‘C’ shape. The dark color should go about halfway down your lash line, out to the corner, and back in about halfway down the crease of your eyelid. Whenever you need to apply more of your dark shadow, start at the outer corner of your eye and blend it inwards or upwards. For the best results, work in thin layers, rather than applying a lot of product all at once. [5] X Research source A small, flat brush is good for applying color to the crease, although you might prefer a fluffier brush that’s tapered at the ends. Don’t apply the shadow to the too far in. Depending on the shape of your eyes, the inner third or half of your eyelid shouldn’t have any dark shadow at all. This will help your eyes look open and bright. In the brown palette, this would be the dark espresso color."

It can take a little while to get a fully blended eyeshadow look, so be patient. [7] X Research source Blend all the way up to your brow bone, and all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner of your eyelid. If you need to, you can apply more color while you’re doing this. If you don’t have a separate blending brush, use a cloth to wipe off all of color from your eyeshadow brush before you start blending, so you don’t transfer the colors."

To make your smokey eye more dramatic, apply pencil , cream, or liquid eyeliner from the inside corner lash line all the way to the outer corner of your eye. To create a cat eye, which is often paired with a smokey eye, add a small upward flick of eyeliner at the outside corner of your eye, pointing up to the outside edge of your eyebrow. For a smudgy look, draw a thick line across the top of your lash line, and then use your fingertip or a small eyeshadow brush to smudge and blur the line. To add more drama to your smoky eye, tightline your eyes . This is when you use your eyeliner to draw a line on the inner-rim of your eyes, located directly under your upper lashes and above your lower lashes. This can be difficult for some, as it involves using eyeliner very close to your eyeball. To line along your lower lash line, either apply your eyeliner or use an angled brush to sweep a little of your dark shadow along your lashes. You may want to only put the dark shadow on the outer half of your lower lashline, so it mirrors the dark color on your upper lids."

You can also use a little of this middle shade to blend the dark shadow on your lower lash line.

To do this, draw a line on the part of your eyelid that is nearest your eyeball, directly under your upper eyelashes. If you add eyeliner on your bottom lashes, only bring it as far in as the dark color goes on your lower lashes. Be sure to taper the end of the line though, and blend it into the shadow so that it doesn’t look too harsh against the color."
