      "content": "Find a saw palmetto plant growing wild. Identify the saw palmetto by its small size of 7 to 10 feet (2.1 to 3.0 m), horizontal snaking trunk, and round crown of large, fan shaped leaves. Find the saw palmetto bush located in lowlands and savanna scrubs of the subtropical Southeastern United States, most commonly along the south Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Saw palmetto is especially common in Florida. [2] X Research source Look for berries in the fall months of September and October when the fruits are ripe. You will know they are ripe by their dark brown to black color. Make sure you find a plant that is wild and growing on public land. Saw palmettos are a cash crop in Florida and you can be fined if you are caught picking berries that are being commercially farmed."

      "content": "Eat the berry slowly to get used to the strong flavor. Saw palmetto berries are similar in size and oiliness to a black olive. Like an olive, they have a pit. Take small nibbles of the sweet, peppery, and pungent fruit. If you do pop the whole fruit into your mouth, remember that there is a pit. The strong flavor of the berries was described in 1692 by shipwrecked Quakers as the flavor of rotten cheese steeped in tobacco juice. Others say the taste is like a sweet, especially strong bleu cheese."
