      "title": "See if your home has a rotten egg or sulfuric smell.",
      "content": "See if your home has a rotten egg or sulfuric smell. Natural gases from your appliances have the added chemical mercaptan, making the gas have an unpleasant odor so you can detect it easier. [1] X Research source If you notice a sulphuric smell in your home, you may have a gas leak near your stove, water heater, or another appliance. If you have a gas stove, check the burners to ensure they’re completely turned off. Immediately turn off the gas supply line and leave the building if you detect a strong sulphuric odor."

      "title": "Check your natural gas alarms, if you have one installed.",
      "content": "Check your natural gas alarms, if you have one installed. These will usually be provided by your gas company or by your fire department and are located near gas appliances. Natural gas alarms will report \"GAS\" or beep continuously if there is natural gas detected in your home. If you have a monitored alarm system, and it appears to be giving a trouble message, see if a gas leak is detected by the panel."

      "title": "Listen for a hissing or whistling noise near your appliances or pipes.",
      "content": "Listen for a hissing or whistling noise near your appliances or pipes. You may be able to hear the gas leaking from loose connections. [2] X Research source If you hear a faint hiss or whistle you haven’t heard before, walk around your home and listen for a change in volume. The louder it gets, the closer you may be to a possible leak. The gas makes a hiss or whistle when it escapes through a tight space, so not all gas leaks will make a noise."

      "title": "Notice if the flames on your stove are orange/yellow instead of blue.",
      "content": "Notice if the flames on your stove are orange/yellow instead of blue. Gas stoves should have blue flames, meaning they have enough oxygen for the gas to combust completely. When the flames on your stove are yellow or orange, the natural gas isn’t burning properly and could be contributing to a gas leak. [3] X Research source If you see orange or yellow flames, turn off your stove immediately. Gas stoves may have orange or yellow flames when first lit and should only be cause for concern if the color stays consistent. If you suspect a gas leak, do not turn on your stove to check the flame color."

      "title": "Watch for a white cloud of dust moving near your gas lines.",
      "content": "Watch for a white cloud of dust moving near your gas lines. While natural gas is usually colorless, a leak may stir up dust and make a small cloud near your pipes. Keep your eyes open for any mist or clouds that you can’t account for otherwise. [4] X Trustworthy Source State of New York Official website for the State of New York Go to source"

      "content": "Look to see if your houseplants are dying. Plants need carbon dioxide to survive, and gas leaks can limit the amount your plants get. If you notice your plants wilting or yellowing even though you still care for them regularly, you may have gas leaking into your home. [5] X Research source Keep plants in areas where gas leaks are common, like in your kitchen or a fireplace, to use as a form of carbon monoxide detection."

      "title": "Check your gas bill to see if it’s higher than normal.",
      "content": "Check your gas bill to see if it’s higher than normal. Compare your gas bills over a 2-3 month period to see if there’s been a significant change in cost. If you notice a spike in your bill, contact your utility company first to make sure your bill is correct. If everything is right on their end, let them know you may have a gas leak in your home. [6] X Research source Keep in mind any changes in your lifestyle. For example, if it’s winter and you’ve been using your furnace more, your gas prices may be higher as a result. Compare old bills from the same time of year to see a more accurate change."

      "content": "Notice physical signs of gas inhalation, like headaches and body pain. Breathing natural gas or carbon monoxide limits the amount of oxygen your body receives. If you start to experience body pains, headaches, lightheadedness, or nausea for no apparent reason, check your gas lines and appliances to see if you have a leak.

Once it’s marked, contact your utility company and let them know that you have a gas leak in your home so they can fix it.

      "content": "Place carbon monoxide detectors throughout your home. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas toxic to the body. To detect carbon monoxide, place at least 1 detector on each level of your home, according to your detector’s directions. If it detects carbon monoxide in the air, it will chirp loudly, alerting you to the problem. [12] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you're using plug-in detectors rather than battery-powered detectors, put your carbon monoxide detectors in an outlet at knee level or lower, as CO is heavier than air. Never block a carbon monoxide detector with furniture or curtains, as they can restrict airflow. If you have pets or children that would interfere with the detectors at knee level, plug the devices in chest-level outlets."

Then, place a short-term test kit in the lowest level of your home and leave it there for 48-72 hours. Use the envelope provided in the kit to send the test results back to the company's lab, where they will calculate the radon levels. [14] X Research source If the results come back with 4 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) or higher, call a professional to install a radon mitigation system in your home. Radon is a natural gas that’s odorless, colorless, tasteless, and naturally found in the ground. Avoid keeping or placing radon tests in damp and humid areas, such as the kitchen, bathroom, or laundry room."
