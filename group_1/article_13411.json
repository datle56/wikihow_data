You can also free-form draw on your fabric before you paint if you are confident enough in your artistic ability."

      "content": "To create a watercolor look, mix your paint color with water until it is the thickness of writing ink. Dip a relatively thin brush in the mixture and paint brush strokes in a horizontal motion. Spray water lightly on the fabric surface using a mister bottle after painting to allow the brush strokes to bleed lightly while switching between colors. If the paint begins to bleed too much or too quickly, grab a hair dryer and dry the spot to stop the process. A hair dryer can also be used to dry fabric paint faster after finishing the work."
