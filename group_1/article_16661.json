      "content": "Find out which contaminants are in your water. If you live in or near a large U.S. city, look it up on the Environmental Working Group database. Otherwise, you may need to contact your water utility and ask for a water quality report, or ask a local environmental group focused on water issues."

      "title": "Choose a type of filter.",
      "content": "Choose a type of filter. Once you know the specific chemicals you are trying to filter out, you can read the packaging or online descriptions of water filter products to see whether they are removed. Alternatively, narrow down your options using these tips: Charcoal (or \"carbon\") filters are cheap and widely available. They will filter out most organic contaminants, including lead, mercury, and asbestos. Reverse osmosis filters remove inorganic contaminants such as arsenic and nitrates. They are extremely water-inefficient, so use only if you know the water is contaminated with a chemical carbon does not filter out. De-ionizing filters (or ion exchange filters) remove minerals, turning hard water into soft water. They do not remove contaminants."

      "title": "Select an installation type.",
      "content": "Select an installation type. There are many types of water filters on the market, designed to accommodate a variety of needs. Here are the most common options for home use: A pitcher water filter. These are convenient for households with low water use, as you can fill the pitcher once or twice a day and keep it cool in the refrigerator. A faucet-mounted filter is convenient if you want to filter all your tap water, but can slow down flow rate. On-counter or under-sink water filters required plumbing modifications, but generally use longer-lasting filters, and thus require less maintenance. Install a whole-house water filter if your water is severely contaminated and unsafe even for bathing."

      "content": "Set up the filter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each filter should come with a set of instructions showing you how to set it up so that it works correctly. In most cases assembly is quite simple, but if you have trouble putting it together, call the manufacturer for help."

    {
      "title": "Run water through the filter.",
      "content": "Run water through the filter. Take cold water and pass it through the filter. In most cases the water is poured into the top of the filter; it then makes its way down through the filter mechanism, where impurities are removed. The clean water streams into the bottom of the bottle or pitcher, or out of the bottom of the faucet, depending on what type of filter you have. Do not submerge the filter while running water through it. Water that backs up into the filter may not be purified. Some filters are damaged by hot water; check the manufacturer's instructions."

      "title": "Change the filter cartridge as recommended.",
      "content": "Change the filter cartridge as recommended. After a few months of use, a carbon water filter becomes clogged and stops working as well to purify water. Buy a new filter cartridge from the same manufacturer that made the water filter. Remove the old cartridge and discard it, then replace it with the new one. Some water filters last longer than others. Check the instructions that came with your product for a more detailed time frame, or contact the manufacturer."

      "content": "Gather supplies. Homemade ceramic filters work by filtering water through a layer of porous ceramic. The holes are small enough to filter out contaminants, but large enough to let water pass through into a container. To make a ceramic water filter, you'll need the following equipment: A ceramic filter element. You can buy a candle filter or a pot filter for this purpose. The filters are available online or at hardware stores. Be sure to choose one that meets or exceeds National Safety Foundation standards, which specify what percentage of impurities must be filtered out of the water in order for it to be drinkable. Two food-grade buckets. One bucket is used as a receptacle for the impure water, and the second bucket is for the purified water. Food-grade buckets are available from restaurant supply stores, or you may be able to obtain used buckets from a restaurant in your area. A spigot. This is attached to the bottom bucket to access the purified water."

In total, you'll need to drill 3 holes: one in the bottom of the top bucket, one in the lid of the bottom bucket, and a third hole in the side of the bottom bucket (for the spigot). Start by drilling a 1/2-inch hole in center of the bottom of the top bucket. Drill a second 1/2-inch hole in the center of the lid of the bottom bucket. This hole should align exactly with the hole in the first bucket. The water will pass from the first bucket through the filter and drip into the second bucket. Drill a 3/4-inch hole in the side of the bottom bucket. This is where the spigot will be attached, so it should be just an inch or two from the bottom of the bucket."

For long trips, look into \"gravity filters,\" which are typically a pair of bags connected by a hose. The bag with the filter is filled with water, then hung up to let the water drain through the filter into the clean bag. This is a fast, convenient option that doesn't require you to carry around a supply of disposable filters.

Not all wilderness areas require protection against viruses, however, especially in the US.

It may not be convenient to boil water several times a day, but be aware that you won't need additional filtration if you're already boiling water for your evening meal or morning coffee. At high elevations, boil the water for at least three minutes, since the water will boil at a lower temperature in the thin air.

You can make your own charcoal in the wild if you are able to build a fire. Built a hot wood fire and let it burn out completely. Cover it with dirt and ashes, and wait at least a few hours before digging it up again. Once it has completely cooled, break up the charred wood into tiny pieces, or even into dust. You've now created your own charcoal. While not as effective as store-bought \"activated charcoal,\" which is not feasible to produce in the wilderness, homemade charcoal should be plenty effective in a filter."

Alternatively, use two buckets will also work, one with a hole cut into the bottom. In a survival situation with little equipment, search for a hollow plant such as bamboo or a fallen log."
