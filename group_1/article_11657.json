      "content": "Remember that rejection is not a personal attack. In most cases, romantic rejection is not a criticism of your character. If a girl decides she doesn't want to date you, it doesn't automatically mean she dislikes you or even finds you unattractive. Though every instance of rejection is different, the common thread is that \"you\" are not rejected. Rather, your request to date is. [1] X Research source There are countless reasons she might’ve said no, and most of them have nothing to do with you. She might not be ready for a relationship, or already have her heart set on someone else, for example."

      "content": "Thank her for her time, and keep it brief (especially over text). Dating coach Suzanna Matthews says it’s best to get out of there quickly and “alleviate discomfort.” This is especially true if you were rejected by text. Though it might sting, staying polite is the right thing to do. Besides, if you’re rude now, word might spread, and that doesn’t help your chances in the future. Give her a quick and polite goodbye. For example: “No worries, worth a shot!” “I can respect that. Thanks anyway.” “Thanks for your honesty. See you around!” “I get it, and I hope you find what you’re looking for.” “Well, wish me luck next time!” “All good, and take care.”"

[2] X Research source Say \"hi\" when you see her, and smile and ask how she is if you're nearby. Just treat her like a friend and eventually you'll feel better around one another."

Just be sure to respect her boundaries and her choice, if the rejection was firm. [3] X Research source Give your crush as much personal space as she needs and try to be a good friend. If you and her grow closer, or if she starts flirting with you, consider asking her out again. Give her at least a few months before trying again, and keep in mind that if you keep asking her, she may not want to be around you at all. That said, keep in mind that though it may work in the movies, relentlessly pursuing a girl even after she says “no” comes off as creepy and incredibly disrespectful."

Sadness, anger, fear, and similar emotions are all natural parts of rejection, and working through them now will make it far easier to move on in the future.

Gibson recommends that you “find a safe person to talk to,” whether that means venting to a friend or a family member, or going to counseling or a therapist. Sharing your emotions with a supportive, understanding person can make a huge difference in your mental well-being. If you don’t have anyone to talk to, write your feelings down in a journal.

When asking a girl out, remember that she has the right to say “no” for any reason at all, just like you have the right to say “no” when somebody asks you out. Remind yourself to stay calm if she says no. It helps to put yourself in her shoes. Would you accept an advance from just anyone? Probably not, so why should she? Remember: It’s not personal!

When the time comes, dating coach Crista Beck says to “make sure that [you’re] inviting them to a very clear date.” Approach your crush with confidence and ask her to go on a date with you. Make sure she knows that you're asking her out for romantic reasons and not as a friend. Just be as honest and genuine as possible about how you feel. If possible, ask your crush out on a specific date . For example, ask “Do you want to go to a movie?” instead of “Do you want to hang out?” Even if you’re scared, try not to procrastinate. Doing so will make you more nervous about the possibility of rejection."

      "content": "It probably has more to do with her than with you. When you reject someone, it’s not really because of them, but because you have your own vision for a perfect partner. That means that rejection has less to do with the person who was rejected, and more with the person doing the rejecting. When you get rejected, remember that there are plenty of reasons she might have said no that aren’t related to you, such as: [10] X Research source She is too busy to date. She has a different sexual orientation than you. She is working through personal or emotional issues. She already has a significant other. She has a crush on someone else. She enjoys being single.

If you’re really dying to know, though, you might ask her politely, and emphasize that there’s no pressure to answer. If you’re kind and earnest, she might offer some tips or advice from her perspective. For example, say: “I totally respect the no, and won’t ask again. Out of curiosity, though, can I ask why?” “Can I ask why? No pressure, but I’m trying to be sure I’m not giving off bad vibes or anything.”"

      "content": "It can feel like someone is saying you’re not good enough. But the secret is that this feeling isn’t the truth. Dr. Schewitz reminds us that, in reality, “It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy or you’re not good enough if somebody rejects you, it just means there wasn’t a good match between the two of you.” And if you’re not a good fit for each other, the relationship wouldn’t have been very great, anyway, so you’re actually saving yourself some time and heartache."

      "content": "Rejection hurts, but it doesn’t hurt forever. The first few times you’re rejected, it’s easy to feel down and hard on yourself. But the truth is that rejection isn’t personal, and you shouldn’t take it to heart. People are like puzzle pieces, and all it means is that you didn’t fit, not that you’re unworthy. With time, practice, and patience, you’ll land the girl of your dreams, but you have to keep putting yourself out there! Let yourself feel your feelings for a while. Talk to people you trust and love to vent it out. Focus on things other than romance for a while to get your confidence back. Make another move when you’re ready, and when you find someone new."
