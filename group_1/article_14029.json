      "content": "Sweating can result in temporary loss of water weight, but the weight won’t stay off. After bones, water is the heaviest thing in the human body. In fact, about 60% of your body’s overall weight comes from water. Since water is so abundant in your body and it’s the primary ingredient in sweat, you’ll lose some water weight every time you sweat. The weight you lose won’t stay off, though. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Sitting in a sauna, wearing sweat-inducing clothing, and sweating it out on a hot day won’t help you lose weight permanently. Why won’t water weight stay off? Water isn’t stored in fat, which is what you need to shed for weight loss. If you lose water weight you may keep a few pounds off for a few hours, but it’ll just come back as you rehydrate. [2] X Research source This is why boxers and wrestlers will “cut water weight” only right before a fight—any weight they lose will come back soon after the match."

      "content": "You’ll (temporarily) lose 1–4 pounds (0.45–1.81 kg) of weight per hour of sweating. For every hour of continuous hour of sweat, expect to lose anywhere from 16-64 fluid ounces (0.5-1.9 L) of water weight. This translates to roughly 1–4 pounds (0.45–1.81 kg) of body weight. [3] X Research source Is losing water weight a good weight loss strategy? No. Aside from the fact that you’ll just gain the water weight back, you actually will struggle to lose weight if you don’t drink a lot of water. You must stay hydrated to lose weight safely. [4] X Research source The only way to lose weight permanently is by running a caloric deficit . Exercise can help you burn calories, which can contribute to a caloric deficit, but sweating alone won’t help you lose weight in the long run."

      "title": "Sweating on its own burns almost zero calories.",
      "content": "Sweating on its own burns almost zero calories. It does require some energy for your body to produce sweat, so sweating will burn calories; it’s just not going to burn enough calories to matter. If we’re just talking about sweating, we’re probably talking about the single digits. It’s normally whatever activity causing you to sweat that’s doing the heavy lifting when it comes to burning calories."

      "title": "No, although sweating is a good sign if you’re exercising.",
      "content": "No, although sweating is a good sign if you’re exercising. To lose weight, you must maintain a caloric deficit where your body burns more energy than it consumes. For example, if you burn 2,000 calories a day and you only consume 1,500 calories, you’re going to lose weight. None of that requires sweat. However , if you are exercising, sweating is a great sign that you’re putting in some good work! [5] X Research source You naturally sweat to control your temperature. If you’re sweating while working out, it means your body is overheating and needs to cool off. While sweating doesn’t necessarily burn a lot of calories, exercising absolutely does, so keep up the hard work.

      "title": "Body temperature regulation",
      "content": "Body temperature regulation Sweating’s primary purpose is to help regulate your body’s temperature. Sweat is almost entirely water, and heat has an easier time leaving through water than it does through air (this is why a 75 °F (24 °C) day is nice and warm but swimming in 75 °F (24 °C) water feels cold). As a result, your body will naturally sweat to help avoid overheating. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is also why fans feel good—moving air increases the rate of evaporation, so the moisture in your skin has an easier time absorbing heat when you have the fan on."

      "content": "Healthy skin Sweat is mostly water, so it helps your skin stay moisturized and healthy when it’s hot (which is when skin is at the highest risk of drying out). Sweat also contains dermcidin—a protein with antimicrobial properties—which helps keep your skin healthy and happy. [8] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source The dermcidin in sweat also neutralizes certain bacteria, which could be why people sweat a lot when they’re sick even if they don’t have a fever."

      "content": "Exercise aid The amount of sweat you produce plays an important role when it comes to identifying dangerous levels of exercise. If you are absolutely pouring sweat after an hour of working out, it’s probably a sign you’re at your limit. At the same time, if you’re exercising and you aren’t sweating at all, you could probably turn it up a notch.

      "content": "Dehydration If you sweat without replacing the water you lose, you will eventually become dehydrated. Dehydration is a serious health risk, so it is essential that you drink plenty of water when you sweat. If you’re thirsty, drink water until you no longer feel the need to drink. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Sports drinks are a fine substitute to water if you’re working out and want the electrolytes and sodium."

      "content": "Skin maceration Skin maceration refers to a condition where the skin becomes too soft due to overexposure to moisture. This can cause the skin to break or become infected. If you’re sweating to the point that your skin becomes puffy, discolored, or excessively wrinkly, stop whatever activity you’re doing, dry off, and take a break. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You know when you stay in a tub for too long and your fingers get wrinkly? That’s a mild form of skin maceration."

      "content": "Hormones, genetics, and behavior all influence how much you sweat. Everybody is different when it comes to how much they sweat. If you feel like you sweat too much, see a doctor—there are several medical conditions that can cause you to sweat more than normal. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Other factors that influence your propensity to sweat include: Genetics . If your parents were kind of sweaty, you probably will be, too. Weather . People sweat to cool down the body’s temperature, so if it’s hot where you live you’re going to be more prone to sweat. Hormones . Changes in testosterone or estrogen levels can trigger sweating, as can certain thyroid conditions. Illnesses . You’ll sweat more if you’re frequently sick, since fevers increase the body temperature and sweating cools it down. Diet. Caffeine, alcohol, and spicy food will all elevate the body’s temperature and cause sweating. Stress . Sweating is a common reaction to the fight-or-flight response , so if you’re stressed out or anxious a lot, you’re likely to sweat more often than others."
