      "content": "In slang, fleeced means to trick someone out of their money. Saying that you “got fleeced” is another way to say that you were scammed, ripped off, or cheated out of your money or other valuable items. This verb usually means that someone (or something, like a company) deceived and betrayed you to get your money, but it can also refer to someone robbing you. [1] X Research source For instance, you might say that you were fleeced by a clothing company that overcharged you for a designer sweatshirt that turned out to be fake. Fleeced is usually used in the past tense because you typically discover that you were stolen from after the theft happened. However, you can use it in the present tense (“They fleece people”), (“They are/were/have been fleecing people”). Pronunciation : Fleeced is pronounced like “flee-st.” It rhymes with words like “greased,” “released,” and “creased.”"

[2] X Research source For example, you might see fleeced jackets while shopping for outerwear in the winter, which means they’re lined with soft, insulating fabric. As a noun, “fleece” is what you call a sheep’s (or other wooly animal’s) coat. It can also refer to natural and synthetic fabrics that are soft, warm, and fuzzy."

      "title": "The slang term comes from the act of shearing a sheep’s wool.",
      "content": "The slang term comes from the act of shearing a sheep’s wool. When you fleece a sheep, you cut off all of its wool fur, which is a valuable item for making fabric. The sheep can’t do anything about losing its coat and looks more vulnerable without it. Similarly, when you “get fleeced,” you’re stripped of your valuables and feel taken advantage of. [3] X Research source It’s believed that people connected the feeling of getting your money stolen by a con artist or thief to the act of fleecing a sheep of its coat. The slang definition of fleeced was first used in the 1570s. The word itself comes from the Old English and German words for a sheep’s wool coat ( flies and vlies , respectively)."
