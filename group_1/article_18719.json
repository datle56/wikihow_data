      "title": "Find a keypad on Moai Island or Slapple Island.",
      "content": "Find a keypad on Moai Island or Slapple Island. The keypad will appear every 10 minutes behind the large tree on either island. You can find it quickly by server-hopping in the No One Shots and Killstreak Only game modes. Then, enter a code on the keypad using the following formula: # of players in the server * 25 + 1100 - 7 . For example, 5 people in the server mean the equation is 5 * 25 + 1100 - 7, and the code is 1218. [1] X Research source Tip #1: Use mobility gloves like Balloony, Charge, Grapple, Phase, Space, and Speedrun to quickly check each island for the keypad. Tip #2: Use the Default Arena portal to get to Moai Island fast. Tip #3: Stand behind the lobby portals and use shift-lock to look through the wall and see if there’s a keypad on Slapple Island."

      "content": "Enter the Elude Maze for the “Da Maze Runner” badge. Entering the code on the keypad will let you access the Elude Maze—which is vital because you can’t get the Counter Glove without the “Da Maze Runner” badge. Use the lever on a wall directly behind the map to get it. This will summon Pim, who will chase you, and your goal is to avoid Pim for 3 minutes. [2] X Research source Tip #1: Pim’s speed is faster than yours, but it can’t squeeze through tight gaps, so try to take lots of sharp turns and run through narrow passages. Avoid broad, straight hallways! Tip #2: If you can, try to get Pim stuck by running to the far wall opposite the level. As a bonus, you’ll also be close to one of the Counter Glove’s possible spawn locations. Tip #3: If you get caught, you’ll get sent back to the main game—but you can try again!"

      "title": "Find and collect the Counter Glove after it spawns in the maze.",
      "content": "Find and collect the Counter Glove after it spawns in the maze. Once you successfully evade Pim, the Counter Glove will spawn in one of 4 potential spots—and it’ll continually swap to a different spot every 30 seconds. Run around the maze until you find it, and click on the glove to collect it (and unlock the “Da Maze Runner” badge simultaneously). [3] X Research source Tip: The glove gives off blue light and makes a soft sparkling sound (just like the sound of the various maze relics). After you collect the glove, you’ll be sent back to the main game. It’s as simple as that!"

      "title": "Press the interaction button to trigger a taunt animation with the glove.",
      "content": "Press the interaction button to trigger a taunt animation with the glove. It lasts 2.75 seconds in total—and if another player slaps you during the taunt, it’ll automatically be countered while playing one of three possible counter cutscenes. You'll take no knockback (but still ragdoll in place) if you get hit with an attack that can’t be countered. The cutscenes are: [4] X Research source Fist of the North Star. You’ll teleport behind the target, then walk past them saying, “Omae wa mou shindeiru!” (Japanese for “You are already dead!”). A shockwave will knock the target back and deal around 100 knockback damage. Death Counter from One Punch Man. You’ll teleport behind the target and charge a slap. The screen will turn black and flash the Japanese symbol for “death” before showing a red fist. After a pause, you’ll throw a punch with massive knockback damage. Dragon Ball Z. Your character will say “No,” then release a giant shockwave (while screaming and projecting a yellow aura). The shockwave deals roughly 60 knockback damage to the target and anyone else within range."

      "title": "Bait and taunt players before activating the Counter Glove.",
      "content": "Bait and taunt players before activating the Counter Glove. When you’re up against an opponent and have the Counter Glove, you can get the most out of it by waiting until your enemy comes close for an attack. Use the glove once you lure them in and see them moving toward you! You’re more likely to get a successful counter that way. [5] X Research source You can also use the Counter Glove to cancel out the knockback from gloves like Ping Pong, which can hit several targets but also hurt the user."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pros",
      "content": "Pros One of the most obvious pros is the Counter Glove’s high damage output! It offers a great chance to one-shot opponents (and counter one-shot slaps they send your way). You can also use it to negate knockback from attacks and counter many abilities, like slicer, whirlwind, quake, and scythe. With the glove, you can bypass Golden’s invulnerability and MR’s knockback reduction. [6] X Research source Since the glove’s animation is a little shorter than the window for countering, you can fool other players into getting hit. You can also take advantage of players who try to fake slap you (and hit them when they do it). Finally, the glove can come in handy against Killstreak and players using OVERKILL, especially since the OVERKILL Hot Touch passive triggers the glove’s ability."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons Be careful when using the Counter Glove; you’re vulnerable after the cutscenes finish, and other players can immediately slap you—and if you miss the glove’s counter window, you’ll also be vulnerable (since the taunting animation is pretty obvious). Additionally, the glove isn’t invincible; recovery gloves (like Fish, Adios, Magnet, Recall, and Spoonful) can survive its attacks. [7] X Research source Reverse users can reflect the Counter Glove’s ability onto you if they’re quick enough, and the glove can’t counter Replica clones, Shukuchi’s ability, or Joust’s horse. Cutscenes are totally random, and you can’t move until the cutscene ends. After that, the glove’s ability has a relatively long cooldown time."
