[1] X Research source Your body burns calories fast, so you need to feed it more than it can use up right away. That means eating not just when you’re hungry, but throughout the day. Aim to eat five meals a day to gain weight. Don’t wait until your stomach starts to growl to eat. Plan out five meals so you never have time to get hungry. Eating this much can take a lot of effort, since you need to stock up on enough food to feed yourself more often. Pack calorie-rich snacks you can eat on the go, like bananas and peanut butter or dense granola bars."

Load up on a restaurant-sized meal each time, with big portions of meat, vegetables, and a carbohydrate. Eating this much might not exactly feel comfortable, but it’s the best way to gain weight fast.

For lunch, try a fully dressed turkey club on whole wheat bread, two bananas, and a salad. Dinner could be a grilled steak, loaded baked potato and a few cups of grilled veggies."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While you could easily gain weight by drinking sugary sodas and eating large pizzas every day, this can wreck your metabolism and cause you to gain fat instead of muscle. When you’re choosing food to eat, try the following: Look for foods that are relatively unprocessed. For example, choose old-fashioned oatmeal instead of instant, and go for fresh chicken as opposed to processed lunch meat. Cook as many meals from scratch as you can. Avoid getting frozen dinners, fast food and snack foods, which contain a lot of salt, sugar and other fillers that aren’t nutritious."

Focus on incorporating protein, fats, and carbohydrates into every meal you eat so your diet stays balanced. Here are some examples of good choices in each category: Proteins: eggs, salmon, tuna, and other fish; pork roast, pork chops, and ham; chicken breasts and thighs; lean beef burgers and steaks; and bison. Fats: olive oil, safflower oil, canola oil, coconut oil, and grapeseed oil; avocados, walnuts, almonds, flaxseeds. Carbohydrates: fruits and vegetables; beans, lentils, peas; brown rice, whole grain bread, whole grain pasta, and other whole-grain products; and honey."

      "content": "Make sure you drink plenty of water. Water will help your body process the extra protein and calories you’re taking in. Drink several glasses with every meal to avoid getting dehydrated. Since you’ll be exercising more to gain mass, aim to drink 10 glasses of water every day. You can also drink unsweetened tea, 4 to 8 ounces of fruit juice, flavored water, and other healthy beverages. Avoid drinking Gatorade and other sports drinks in excessive amounts, since they contain a lot of sugar."

Go to source You can practice weight training at a gym or get the equipment you need to do it at home. Since this is an integral part of gaining weight, make plans to do it several times a week. If you don’t want to pay to join a gym, see if you can obtain a barbell and a set of weights so you can work out at home. You can also try resistance exercises, which work your muscles without using weights. Push-ups are an easy way to get started right away. You can also install a pull-up bar in a doorway so you can work out your arms and chest."

Spend equal time working out your arms, back, chest, abdomen, and legs. [5] X Research source Rather than working out all of the muscle groups on the same day, rotate between them so each group gets a chance to rest in between sessions. Plan out your week so you’re able to target each muscle group evenly. For example, you might want to work out your arms and chest one day, focus on your legs and abs the next day, then do your back and chest the third day. Work with a personal trainer to come up with a schedule and exercise plan that meets your needs."

      "title": "Exercise to build muscle without causing injury.",
      "content": "Exercise to build muscle without causing injury. Muscle mass is built when you put stress on the fibers in your muscle tissue by pushing them past their everyday limit. This is done by lifting enough weight and doing enough repetitions to make your muscles feel tired and sore, but not so painful that you injure yourself. Find the right weight for any given exercise by figuring out how much you can lift for eight to 10 reps before you have to stop. If you can easily do more than 10 reps, add more weight. If you have to stop after 5, subtract some weight. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Compound exercises are your friend. Concentrate on complex, compound exercises that recruit as many muscles as possible: bench presses, dumbbell presses, squats, deadlifts, pull-ups, chin-ups, and dips. It doesn’t matter if you can only bench press 10 lb dumbbells right now. Wherever you’re starting out, concentrate on being stronger each and every time you exercise. Push yourself, get stronger, lift more, and before you know it you’ll be ripped. When exercising, keep your rest between sets to a minute or less, and don’t do more than 12 reps in a set."

      "content": "Have a protein shake immediately after each workout. According to a study carried out at the University of Birmingham, energy shakes will help you improve your endurance while exercising. Have a banana, a handful of dried fruit or a sports energy shake immediately after you work out. You can include shakes at other times during the day as well. For example, you could have a Boost or Ensure meal replacement shake along with your breakfast. Or, you can make yourself a protein smoothie with some whole milk, a banana, and a scoop of protein powder. Fortifying meals in other ways may also help you to gain weight. For example, you can include high fat, high calorie, or high protein add-ins in your diet, like cheese, whole milk, full-fat sour cream, and avocado."

Your muscles rebuild during your days off, so never exercise the same muscle before it’s ready, and never exercise the same muscle group two days in a row. Wait at least 48 hours before working the same muscle again. [7] X Research source T In addition, it’s important to get eight to nine hours of sleep every night for maximum gains. If you are only getting six hours or less, you’re not going to get all the benefits of your exercising and diet."

However, gaining weight this way isn’t likely to give you the appearance you want, and it will make your body weaker instead of stronger. Putting in the hard work to gain weight by building muscle will result in improved health and a built appearance."

You shouldn’t feel exhausted and sore all the time. In fact, your improved diet and workout routine should help you feel more virile than ever before. If your body seems to be telling you that something’s wrong, listen to it. Consider hiring a personal trainer. Within a few sessions, you'll have a great idea of scheduling, form, intensity, and duration of workouts and excellent insight into tweaking your diet. Ask your physician before taking any supplements, and see a doctor right away if you experience an injury during a workout."
