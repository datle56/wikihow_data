      "content": "Many Gen X slang terms are still popular, but others have fizzled out. Some slang terms, like “dude” and “DINK,” are still going strong decades later, perhaps because they’re so relatable and still relevant, or they fill a need that isn't otherwise filled by another word. [2] X Research source But a number of slang terms have become less popular for various reasons—maybe they just didn’t catch on in the same way, they were overused, or, in some cases, words considered insensitive or inaccurate may have fallen into disuse. For instance, “gay” and “lame” are Gen X slang terms that were often used to refer to something uncool, but both have become less common in recent decades. On the other hand, the word DINK waned in popularity after the 1980s, but when the late 2000s Great Recession caused many young people to consider being DINKS to save money, the word took off again."

      "content": "Gen X is the generation born between the mid-1960s and 1980. Generation X followed the Baby Boomer generation and preceded the Millennial generation. Gen X is also sometimes called the “forgotten generation” or “middle child” generation because they’re smaller than the Baby Boomers and Millennials and often get lost in the mix. [3] X Research source Generation Y—more popularly known as Millennials —describes people born between 1981 and 1996. Generation Z (aka Zoomers) describes people born between 1997 and 2012. Generation Alpha describes people born between 2010 and 2025."
