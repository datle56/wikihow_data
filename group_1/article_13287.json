      "content": "Make sure that each expression has the same base. If you're working with different bases, then you cannot divide the exponents. Here's what you need to know: If you're working with a problem with variables, such as m 6 ÷ x 4 , then there's nothing more you can do to simplify it. However, if the bases are numbers and not variables, you may be able to manipulate them so you end up with the same base. For example, in the problem, 2 3 ÷ 4 1 , you first have to make both bases be \"2.\" All you do is rewrite 4 as 2 2 and do the math: 2 3 ÷ 2 2 = 2 1 , or 2. You can only do this, however, if you can turn the larger base into an expression of squared numbers to make it have the same base as the first."

So, if you have 3 -4 in the numerator of a fraction, you'll have to move it to the denominator. Here are two examples: [5] X Research source Example 1 : x -3 /x -7 = x 7 /x 3 = x 7-3 = x 4 Example 2 : 3x -2 y/xy = 3y/(x 2 * xy) = 3y/x 3 y = 3/x 3"
