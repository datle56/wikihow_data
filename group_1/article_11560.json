      "content": "Show off your intellect. Capricorn guys are attracted to intellect above anything else. Regardless of the gorgeous outfit you’re wearing or your ridiculously gorgeous face, if you come across as ditzy or rather air-headed, your Capricorn may lose interest. Instead, show off your beautiful brain by engaging him in some stellar conversation. However, keep your cool and remain composed--don’t guffaw if he makes a joke. Don’t be afraid to show off that witty humor either--Capricorns can often have a humorous streak that runs on the sarcastic side."

Be honest and open with him but expect that it will take him a bit longer to share his inner workings with you. Astrologer Stina Garbis explains that you might want to engage their supportive side before you ask them to trust you with yours: \"if you were to ask for help from a Capricorn, that may generate attention from them. I would start small with asking for help, like helping with a car, or some small household 'emergency'. They will automatically hope that you are okay and you will end up on their worry list.\" [5] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021.

As you learned when trying to capture his attention, Capricorns only up to a select group of close friends and family. They take their time before letting others into their circle of trust. Because of this, a night out at his favorite bar with a group of his close friends, or a night at home spent with you, is more his speed than dancing at a crowded club or going to a party where he doesn’t know many people.

While holding hands is probably fine (he might even prefer holding hands because of his protective nature) making out in the middle of a busy street will probably make him feel a bit uneasy.

If word gets back to him that you have been exposing the secrets of your relationship to everyone who will listen, he might feel betrayed or lose trust in you.
