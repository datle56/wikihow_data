Getting your friend to think that they’re being watched or that someone might be following them is a great way to make them feel more than a little unsettled. Send them something like: “I see you.” “I’d keep your curtains closed tonight.” “OMG. Don’t look behind you!”"

      "content": "Creepy messages are even creepier at night. Get your friend scared to go to sleep and you’ll have them up at night feeling freaked out. If you don’t feel safe before bed, it’ll be tough to close your eyes. Send them a message like: “Something’s coming. Whatever you do, please don’t go to sleep.” “Did you know that when you wake up in the middle of the night it’s because your body knows it's being watched?” “A crazy man broke into my house today—I didn’t want to tell him where you lived but he made me. Please don’t go to sleep tonight.” [1] X Research source"

      "content": "A stalker-y message can keep your friend on edge. Let them know you like them, but a little too much, and they’re sure to get a little freaked out. If you want to get your friend to be creeped out by you, send them a message like: “I know where you live. Are you sure that’s a good thing?” “I want to hold your body. Preferably ice-cold.” “I’ve carved your name with a razor into everything I own.”"

      "content": "Get your friends thinking that they’re starring in their own slasher movie. Acting like you’re a crazy killer over text is pretty spooky—plus, it’s kinda fun! Send them a message saying something like: “I hope you aren’t a big screamer. The last one was a little too loud for my liking…” “Everyone’s blood tastes a little different. I can’t wait to taste yours.” “Would you rather be murdered with a knife or a hammer? Just want to know for future reference.”"

      "content": "Ghosts, vampires, and aliens are all more than a little creepy. Sharing a story about the supernatural with your friend over text can lead to some scary fun. Send them a message that reminds them that there might be things out there that we can’t understand like: “You ever think about how 1 in 5 Americans have seen a ghost?” [2] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source “Have you heard about Betty and Barney Hill? They were abducted by aliens and had all these insane tests performed on them. The weirdest part is that they didn’t remember any of this until they started having medical problems, then figured it out after hypnosis.” [3] X Research source “Elizabeth Bathory tortured and murdered hundreds of girls in the 17th century. People say she was a real vampire—she used to bathe in their blood.” [4] X Research source"

They start laughing uncontrollably, then lose control of their body before they die.” “No one ever survives rabies if you don’t get treated within 48 hours. The worst part?

Sending your friend the same message every hour and ignoring them when they ask you what is going on can be a great way to creep them out a little. The content of the message isn’t that important: what’s creepy is the buildup from weird, to annoying, to unsettling. Pick one of these messages and send it to your friend every hour, all day: “Hello.” “...” “Where are you?”"

Tell your friend about a scary urban legend, and dare them to try it out—most of these dares don’t need anything but a bathroom mirror and possibly some candles. Even better, ask them to videotape themselves doing it—it’s a creepy challenge that’ll definitely freak them out. Dare them something like: “Go to your bathroom, turn off the lights and bring a candle. Then, say ‘Bloody Mary’ 13 times, and see if she appears.” “Say ‘Candyman’ into the mirror 5 times and you die. If you don’t believe me, I dare you to try it out.” [7] X Research source “Have you ever played ‘Devil Face’? Set a timer for midnight, and go to your bathroom with all the lights off. Light 12 candles, and close your eyes. When your timer goes off, open your eyes, and you’ll see the face of the devil.” [8] X Research source"

Sending your friend a chain message that tells them that unless they send it to more people something bad will happen is a good way to freak them out. There are plenty of creepy chain messages around, but here are a couple that will really scare your friends: [9] X Research source “Hello, I’m Cordelia. I died in a fire 10 years ago. Send this message to 5 people or I will come to your room tonight.” “A serial killer escaped from jail. Now that you have read this message, he will visit you at 3 a.m. with a chainsaw. If you want to be saved send this message to 5 other people.” “Don’t stop reading or you will die. My name is Ofelia Heras. I am 16 years old. I am a murderer. I have no face.
