      "content": "Create a balanced diet with a nutritionist. Before you make any changes to your diet, you should speak to a licensed dietician. [2] X Expert Source Amy Chow Registered Dietitian Expert Interview. 16 September 2020. Your doctor can refer you to a dietician, who can help you create a healthy, balanced diet that is customized to your dietary needs. Men need around 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and women need to consume around 2,000 calories a day. However, your daily calorie intake depends on your age, your metabolism, and your level of physical activity. Your ADHD medication will also be a factor, and your nutritionist may suggest a higher daily calorie intake to help you gain weight while on your medication, possibly starting with an additional 500 calories a day. [3] X Research source To gain weight, you will need to eat more calories than your body burns every day through daily activity and daily exercise. It’s important that you gain weight safely by committing to a balanced diet with higher calorie meals every day. Your nutritionist can help you develop a meal plan so you are eating healthy, nutrient rich meals that will allow you to gain weight and maintain a healthy weight."

      "content": "Remember that trying to gain weight doesn't mean you can eat unhealthy. It may be tempting to reach for those donuts and ice cream — after all, you're trying to gain weight! But it's just as important to pay attention to where your calories come from when you are trying to gain weight as it is when you are trying to lose weight. Foods with empty calories (like sweets) will not give you the nutrition your brain and body need to function well. Instead, try adding calories in healthy ways, like with high-calorie, nutrient-rich smoothies with protein powders.

      "content": "Try eating before you take your medication. If you know you lose your appetite soon after taking your ADHD medication, make a habit of eating a healthy, hearty meal beforehand. So, if you usually wake up and immediately take your meds, hold off until you can have a healthy, filling breakfast (include whole grains, lots of protein, and try full-fat dairy). If you can, be flexible with your meal schedule and eat snacks, like protein bars, throughout the day. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Eat foods high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.",
      "content": "Eat foods high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Your body needs fatty acids to fuel basic cell functioning, improve your body's overall immunity and enhance your heart functions. Studies have shown that a deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 fats may contribute to the symptoms of ADHD, as these fatty acids also perform several functions in the brain, from transmitting dopamine and serotonin to helping your brain cells to communicate. Individuals with ADHD may then suffer from low levels of essential fatty acids. Your body cannot produce essential fatty acids on its own, so you need to add foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. This includes having foods like salmon, tuna, and other cold-water fish. Omega-6 fatty acids can be consumed via vegetable oils. Children with ADHD should have 12 ounces (per two meals) a week of fish and shellfish that are low in mercury, for example, shrimp, canned light tuna, pollack, salmon, cooked in unsaturated vegetable based fats."

Your nutritionist may also recommend that you maintain a daily workout routine along with your new meal plan so your body is able to burn off just enough calories to sustain a healthy weight.
