Most plastic straws are made out of polypropylene, which is considered a #5 recyclable plastic.

If they are able to do #5 plastics, then you can collect and recycle your straws in the recycling bin. [4] X Research source Search online for other recycling services in your area if your primary waste maintenance doesn’t accept #5 plastics. Other independent centers may be able to recycle the plastic for you."

      "content": "Save a larger plastic container made from the same material as the straw. Many takeout food containers or margarine tubs are made with #5 plastics and are able to use for collecting straws. Double-check the bottom of a plastic container to confirm that they’re made of #5 plastics so your recycling is sorted correctly. Rinse out the container if there’s any leftover food before setting it near your trash bin.

Collect multiple containers so you always have another to use after you throw away the first one."

      "content": "Label cords with pieces from plastic straws. If you have a lot of cords or plugs near your desk, cut a plastic straw into 1 in (2.5 cm) long pieces. Use a pair of scissors to make a cut through one side of the straw piece so you can easily wrap it around a cord. Use a pen or marker to label what the cord is for so you know what you’re plugging in at a glance. [8] X Research source If the straw doesn’t stay in place around the cord, then use a piece of tape to secure it."

      "content": "Make a mock bouquet with straws and zip ties. Put a handful of colored straws in a glass so they gather in a cylindrical shape. Secure a zip tie around the centers of the straws and pull it tight to squeeze them together. As you tighten the zip tie more, the centers of the straws will bend and make the ends stick out in multiple directions so it looks like a “flower.” Make multiple “flowers” and put them in a vase or glass to display your bouquet. [9] X Research source You can choose to use multiple colors of straws, or use matching colors to make your “flower” look uniform."

      "content": "Decorate the outside of a vase or candle holder for a colorful centerpiece. Apply a strip of double-sided tape around an empty vase or candle holder. Press the straws onto the tape one by one so the bottoms of the straws are flush with the bottom of the vase. Continue adding straws all the way around the glass and then cut them with scissors so they’re level with the top of the vase. [10] X Research source Make sure the straws aren’t over the flame of the candle or else they will melt and produce fumes that may be harmful."
