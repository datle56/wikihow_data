      "content": "Run until the killer bees stop chasing you. The best way to get away from killer bees is to run as fast as you possibly can away from the swarm. Run in a straight line as quickly as you can, away from the swarming killer bees. Continue to run for at least 100 yards (300 ft) or until the bees stop chasing you."

      "title": "Cover your head and face.",
      "content": "Cover your head and face. Use a blanket, sheet, or your shirt to cover your head and face. Position the sheet or blanket so that you can still see under it. If you don't have anything to cover your head and face with, use your hands to cover your face, making sure not to cover your eyes so that you can still see. African honey bees will target your face and head area and the most severe injuries are usually sustained in those areas."

      "title": "Seek shelter as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Seek shelter as soon as possible. Try to find a place that has a door that you can close. Good shelter includes your house, your car, or a public restroom. Only a small amount of bees will be able to follow you into a closed space. Even if a few killer bees do get through, it should stop the assault of the entire swarm."

      "title": "Turn off the lights once you're inside.",
      "content": "Turn off the lights once you're inside. Once you get inside, bees will become attracted to the light from the windows. Turn off the lights so that your windows are the only light source in the area. From there, you can open the windows and let the bees out. Make sure that the swarm is no longer near your house when you open the window."

      "content": "Use a credit card to remove the stingers. If you do end up getting stung, remove the bee stingers as soon as possible to prevent the spread of venom through your system. To remove the stingers quickly, simply scrape the surface of your skin with a credit card or another hard edge. This should remove the stingers without embedding them deeper into your skin."

      "content": "Don’t kill or swat killer bees. The more that you agitate and swat at killer bees, the more fiercely they will swarm and attack you. When trying to escape killer bees, just try to outrun them, don’t try to kill them."

      "title": "Don’t jump into a body of water.",
      "content": "Don’t jump into a body of water. While bees won’t be able to sting you in the water, they will just swarm around the area where you went under and wait for you to resurface. Hiding in the water is not a viable strategy for killer bees."

      "title": "Seek medical attention if you have an adverse reaction to the stings.",
      "content": "Seek medical attention if you have an adverse reaction to the stings. Some people may have an allergy to the stinger venom.

      "title": "Wear light colored clothing.",
      "content": "Wear light colored clothing. Killer bees have evolved to recognize the dark coloring in their most common enemies like bears and badgers. For this reason, light colored clothing won’t be as threatening to them. [3] X Research source The color red appears black to killer bees, so avoid wearing that color as well."
