      "title": "Keep your dog away from other things.",
      "content": "Keep your dog away from other things. Skunk spray is actually an oil. The longer it stays in contact with your dog, the more difficult it will be to remove. This oily nature allows it to adhere, and easily transfer, to anything it comes in contact with. This makes it very hard to get out of a dog's coat or any other surface. While you're getting ready to bathe your dog, try to not let them come into contact with anything. The odor will remain on anything that your dog touches, such as their bed, toys, clothes, or any furniture, and your skin and hair. Also prevent them from playing with any other animals you have. They may transfer the smell to them as well. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the dog outside. It is best to wash your dog outside. The skunk smell can permeate your house, but it can also cause respiratory problems for you, your family, and your dog. If it is cold, try to keep the dog into a large, open area of your home and keep your windows open or have fans blowing the smell out of the room. As long as you have plenty of clean smelling air that does not have the skunk particles in it, you shouldn't have any adverse effects."

      "content": "Gather old towels. When you bathe your dog, you need to gather some towels that you don't mind throwing away or getting ruined. Any towels that you use when bathing your dog will need to be thrown away afterward. If you are low on towels or lack access to water such as while camping, some clean dirt, mud, paper, or odorless dried leaves (not pine, eucalyptus, or poison oak, and no sand) and some lukewarm salt water is a fair first aid step to removing the oil. You will want to make sure that you are able to keep them warm both during and after their bath, so have some extra towels or blankets around in case they get cold. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear old clothes. Since you have to get up close to your dog to bathe her, you might get some of the wash or skunk spray on your clothes. Because of this, you should wear old clothes or a paper painter’s jumpsuit that can be thrown away. You should also wear rubber gloves as well during the bath to prevent the oils from getting onto your skin. The oil can cause skin irritation as well as smell transfer. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak up the oil. It's possible that your dog only gets sprayed on a small area of their body. Once you've located where your dog has been sprayed, try to soak up as much of the oil as you can from their coat. You can use paper towels or an old towel. After soaking up the oil, at least initially, you will want to focus your bathing in this area. Make sure you clean everywhere they were sprayed.

These will typically give you the best results because they contain enzymes to help neutralize the odor while they clean. Apply it like normal shampoos, but leave it on for 10 minutes to soak on your dog's fur to help break up the oil. Try brands such as Nature's Miracle Skunk Odor Remover. You more than likely will need to bathe your dog multiple times to eliminate the odor. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a home remedy. Sometimes, you may not have commercial products on hand. Since it is important to start the cleaning process as soon as possible, you may not have time to get one. For the most effective home remedy, combine 1 US-quart (950 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide, 1/4 cup baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap, liquid hand soap, or baby shampoo. This amount is enough for a small dog. Double or triple these amounts depending on the size of your dog. This mixture can explode if left in a closed container, so discard any solution that is leftover. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the home remedy. Once you have mixed up the solution, you need to bathe your dog. Apply this mixture to your dog like you would any other shampoo. Rub the mixture into the coat, making sure to get all the way down to the skin and cover all the affected areas. It depends on your dog’s type of coat, of course. A husky has an undercoat that probably will stay clean, while a chihuahua will need a lighter touch so you don’t scrub oil into the skin. Let the mixture stay on your dog for 10 minutes. If necessary, cover your dog with an old towel or blanket to keep them warm while you wait. After 10 minutes, thoroughly rinse your dog. Avoid getting the mixture in their eyes, mouth, and ears. Use a cloth or sponge to bathe around these areas. Let natural tears and saliva do their work too. Peroxide can cause some discoloration of your dog's fur, depending on your dog's hair color and how long it is left on the hair. Be careful if you are worried about the color change.

Make sure you use a different towel and change or remove your gloves and clothing. You don't want to transfer the oils back to their skin.

Apply the mouthwash to your dog's coat and massage it in all the way down to the skin. Be sure to avoid getting it in their eyes. Be aware that mouthwash can cause a burning sensation if applied to cuts and scrapes. Let the solution sit on the coat for 10 minutes and then bathe them in their regular shampoo. Let the shampoo sit on the coat for another 10 minutes and then rinse thoroughly. Repeat as needed. This can also be used as a spot treatment to help eliminate any lingering odors. This may help with the odor, but will usually not get rid of the oils that cause it. [13] X Research source"
