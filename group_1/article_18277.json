      "title": "Take a large puff of smoke and hold it in your mouth.",
      "content": "Take a large puff of smoke and hold it in your mouth. Don’t inhale the smoke or vapor into your lungs, and bring your tongue to the back of your mouth and use it to trap the smoke. [1] X Research source Let the smoke sit in your mouth for a second or two to let the vapor settle. The larger the puff, the more smoke you’ll have to work with. Be careful not to overdo it, though, since coughing will interrupt the trick."

      "title": "Open your mouth slowly while pushing your bottom lip out.",
      "content": "Open your mouth slowly while pushing your bottom lip out. Part your lips and push your lower jaw forward without exhaling, so that the smoke has a direct route from your mouth to your nose. [2] X Research source Keep your tongue at the back of your mouth to avoid disturbing the smoke or pushing it out of your mouth too soon."

      "title": "Inhale through your nose to complete the trick.",
      "content": "Inhale through your nose to complete the trick. Now simply inhale through your nose as the smoke seeps out from your mouth to create that signature upwards waterfall. [3] X Research source Don’t inhale too quickly, or the effect may not be quite as impressive as the smoke disappears. Take a slow, measured inhale, instead. As you inhale, it may help to push the smoke forward out of your mouth with your tongue, slowly moving the tip of your tongue forward across the roof of your mouth. Practice in the mirror to see the effect for yourself, and tweak how wide you open your mouth or how quickly you inhale—find the right balance to make the trick more impressive."

      "title": "French inhales don't get you any higher than a usual toke.",
      "content": "French inhales don't get you any higher than a usual toke. When you perform a French inhale, the smoke has more chances to disperse before it actually reaches your lungs or bloodstream. This means that the pull is actually a bit weaker than if you just took a normal drag. And since you're pulling the smoke, letting it go, then inhaling it again, it’s a bit closer to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is less likely to get you high. Note that while secondhand smoke results in a much weaker high, you’re still interacting with the smoke directly during a French pull, meaning that if you’re smoking cannabis, you’ll still feel the effects of THC fairly strongly."

      "title": "They aren’t much more dangerous than other forms of smoking.",
      "content": "They aren’t much more dangerous than other forms of smoking. The fact is that smoking is smoking, and may have adverse effects on your lungs in any form, whether you pull smoke through your mouth or your nose. That said, recent studies suggest that smokers who frequently inhale or exhale smoke through their nostrils may be at greater risk of upper respiratory disease. [4] X Research source So maybe don’t do a French inhale for every pull—just once or twice to impress your friends. Always understand the risks of smoking before participating, and avoid smoking if you’re pregnant, have respiratory diseases or asthma, or are under the legal age."

      "content": "The Bane This trick is named after the infamous Batman villain, and gets its name from the mask he wears over his mouth. To do it, perform the French inhale as usual, but instead of jutting your lower jaw out, only jut your lower lip out. Keep your teeth clenched so the smoke exits between them in “bars” and inhale through your nose (which creates an effect that looks like Bane’s mask). [5] X Research source"

      "title": "The Ghost Inhale",
      "content": "The Ghost Inhale This trick involves blowing a puff of smoke, then inhaling it back through your mouth, which looks like a retreating ghost. Start by taking a hefty pull from your vape or smoking rig. Then, part your lips slightly without exhaling so the smoke escapes, and slowly scrape the tip of your tongue forward across the roof of your mouth to push the smoke out. Let the smoke hover in front of you for a moment, then purse your lips and suck it back in. [6] X Research source Pushing smoke out with your tongue takes a bit of practice, so repeat this trick a few times to get a feel for it. This trick forms the foundation for learning other smoking tricks , so mastering it early is a good idea."

      "content": "Smoke rings Smoke rings are a classic trick and a great addition to anyone’s arsenal. To do them, take a large pull and inhale the vapor into your throat. Then, open your mouth in an “O” shape while keeping your tongue at the back of your throat. Take a short exhalation and gently cough to push the vapor out of your throat and past your lips. [7] X Research source Everyone’s mouth is different, so it may take some practice and adjustment to achieve those perfect Os. Try opening your mouth wider or smaller, or tapping on the side of your cheek with your tongue to expel smoke, rather than coughing."

      "content": "Smoke bubbles This is a fun prop-based trick that creates soap bubbles full of smoke that disperse when they pop. [8] X Research source Just get a bubble blower and some bubble mix, or 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of dish soap mixed into 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water. Take a pull of smoke and hold it in your lungs. Then, dip the bubble blower into the soap mixture and blow a bubble, just like you did as a kid. The bubble will float away and pop, bursting in a cloud of smoke."
