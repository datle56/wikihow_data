Lavender oil can lighten skin and reduce the appearance of scars and blotches. Carrot seed oil also rejuvenates the appearance of skin by encouraging cell regeneration. Myrrh has certain anti-aging properties that can keep skin looking younger and blemish-free.

      "content": "Lean your head over the water. Once the water is steaming and oil is added, wrap your head in a towel and lean over the pot of steaming water. Allow the steam to touch your face. However, do not lean too far in as you don't want the water to actually touch your face as it will likely be very hot. If the steam feels too hot and you feel like your face is burning, wait a few minutes and let the water cool some before beginning the steaming process. You can also try steaming your face with a small steam machine. This is a safer method that may also be able to provide steam for a longer period of time."
