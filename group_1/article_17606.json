      "content": "Make sure all the connections are secure. If your computer won't start, the first step is to check your connections. This may sound basic, but it is often overlooked. Make sure your computer is properly plugged in and has power. Try a different electrical outlet. If you are using a laptop, make sure the battery is securely in place and fully charged. If you have a keyboard and mouse connected to your computer, make sure they are properly connected. If you have a little more technical skill, you can open your computer and check to ensure the power supply and hard drive are securely connected to the motherboard. Also check to make sure the RAM, GPU, and any devices connected to a PCI slot are properly seated."

If the CPU or GPU gets too hot, it can cause permanent damage to your computer. Your computer will shut down to prevent this. If your computer or laptop is hot to the touch or your fans are running loud, this may be a sign of overheating. You can also download programs like Core Temp , or HWMonitor to check your computer's temperature. The CPU may overheat if it exceeds temperatures of 75°C. The GPU may overheat if it exceeds temperatures of 85°C."
