      "title": "Identify your criteria.",
      "content": "Identify your criteria. Think about the things that you definitely want in a girlfriend. Perhaps you want to find someone who shares your religious views, or someone who definitely wants children. Identify your “must-haves” in a potential girlfriend, and then consider where that type of woman might spend time. Think about both major and minor criteria. Dating coach John Keegan says that it's important to find someone with the same values and life views as you. But you might also think about whether you want someone who will run marathons with you, or someone who will binge-watch TV with you, or someone who works in the same industry as you. While you may want a girlfriend who you think is extremely physically attractive, avoid putting this at the top of your list. Your relationship should be based on something less superficial than good looks."
