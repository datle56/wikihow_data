      "content": "Apply your darkest eyeshadow to the outside corner. Take the darkest color eyeshadow you want to use (black or dark gray) and swipe it on in an arch shape just above the crease of your eyelid, from the outside corner to the middle of the eyelid. Then apply it right along the lash line."

      "title": "Line your top and bottom lashes.",
      "content": "Line your top and bottom lashes. Use a black eyeliner pencil to carefully line your top lashes, drawing from the inner corner to a point at the outer corner, staying as close to the lash line as possible. Then do the same to the bottom lash line and your waterline (the side of your bottom lashes closest to your eyeball) by pulling your undereye skin down slightly. [1] X Research source Use a gel or liquid liner for your upper lash line if you like, but only use pencil on your waterline, because liquid liner will easily transfer to your eyeball from your waterline and irritate your eye."

      "title": "Smudge the bottom liner.",
      "content": "Smudge the bottom liner. Use a smudge brush, cotton swab, or your fingertip to gently smudge the liner on your bottom lashes, creating that signature hazy, smokey look. You can smudge the top liner too if you wish. If you want more color below your eye, you can also dab on a gray eyeshadow with a firm-bristled brush just below the liner."

      "content": "Apply a light color to the inner corner. Use a light silver, cream, or shimmery white eyeshadow or a highlighter pencil in the inner corner of your eye. Blend if needed to create an even and gradual change from light to dark across your eyelids. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a black eyeliner for your top lash line. Make small strokes of eyeliner across your top lash line until you have a straight, even line. Start at the inner corner or just outside it, and increase the thickness of the line as you draw further out toward the outside corner. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Achieve the signature wing tip.",
      "content": "Achieve the signature wing tip. Draw a thin line of eyeliner from the outside of your bottom lash line into a fine point past your eyelid, up and out as far as you like in the direction of the end of your eyebrow. Then draw a line that smoothly connects the liner on your eyelid to this point, creating an unfilled triangle. Fill in this triangle with liner to finish. [4] X Research source You can use a piece of clear tape or the curve of a spoon to help guide the shape of the wing. [5] X Research source Liquid or gel eyeliner works best for creating a sharp, clean line, but you can use a pencil eyeliner if it has a sharp point."
