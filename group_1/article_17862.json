Giving them the floor to talk about themselves is a way to learn more about them and allows you to be more interesting by being interested in them. [1] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. Ask open ended questions that delve into the person’s past and present. Find out their career ambitions, their hobbies, and what they enjoy about life. Also ask about their love lives. Sometimes inquiring about a person’s dating life is one of the things that hint towards you being interested in them as more than a friend. Friends don’t tend to ask you about your last relationship and what went wrong."

      "content": "Touch on past shared experiences. Recalling the moments you have shared together in a way that feels intimate creates a flirting dynamic between you two. Talk about how you met online, in line at the coffee shop, or in study group for class. Take the time to recap an attribute that made you notice him or her by saying something like, “Your smile took my breath away.” If you have been out with him or her before, mention a detail of an outfit you’ve seen them wear before and mention how it made you feel watching them in it: “You had that amazing sundress on that day and it had me looking at you like, wow.”"

      "content": "Keep things clean, but don’t be afraid to get a little naughty. Flirting can come with a lot of sexual undertones. Use them to your advantage in subtle ways like casually mentioning that you just got out of the shower, or if you’re asked what you’re wearing, state some boxers or a t-shirt. Say their names purposefully. When you know someone, you very rarely refer to them directly by their names. In a husky voice, say their first name. It will personalize the conversation and make them think about you saying their names in other places. It will make their heart race slightly. Diffuse the tension a little by laughing and joking saying, “Don’t go getting any ideas!” It’s a way to play with the sexual tension without fueling it to a point you aren’t ready for just yet."

Unless it’s a text to say “good morning”, skip the formality texts that offer no flirtation value or act as energy zappers, such as “Hey what’s up?” They are typically followed by a routine back and forth that eventually dies out really early on.

      "content": "Avoid letting your excitement for flirting lead to over-texting. Over-texting is the pitfall to many budding romances. Hitting it off and establishing a connection can lead to needy behaviors, over-texting being one of them. Text him or her once, wait for a reply, and if you get one, reply with one text in response. Think of texting as a dance, you take a step, and then they take a step, you take a step, and then they take a step. If you don’t get a reply, wait a full 24 hours to attempt to reach out again. As the relationship progresses, you will be able to slowly increase the frequency of your text messages. Too much at once though feels over-eager and can read as desperation. Appearing scarce by allowing time in between texts creates intrigue."

Contact the person when you feel like contacting them. [9] X Research source You do not have to wait for the other person to make the first move in establishing contact. [10] X Research source Maintaining balance between exchanges is important but who acts as the initiator is not.

[13] X Research source Find a quiet location to speak to him or her, avoiding heavily populated locations like a bus, shopping center, or a movie. You want the person to be able to hear you clearly and allow your tone to feel calm and collected as you flirt with your love interest. Choose a time of day where you know the both of you will not be busy and be less prone to distraction. A good way to do this is to ask him or her ahead of time when an ideal time to call would be."
