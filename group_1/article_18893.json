      "content": "Learn the basic skin types. There are five different types of skin: dry, oily, combination, normal, and sensitive, and it's important to know which one is yours before you begin treating your skin. Every skin type is treated differently, so learning how to treat yours will give you the most radiant glow. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cleanse your skin. In order to test your skin to determine what type of skin you have, it's important to cleanse it with a mild cleanser to remove any excess dirt, makeup, and oils. Then, pat dry with a towel, but do not rub as you don't want to irritate your skin. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Press tissue paper or a napkin to the T zone. After you have cleansed and dried your skin, wait about 30 minutes, and then test the skin on your T zone. Taking tissue paper or a napkin, gently press down on your T zone, making sure the entire area makes contact with the paper. The T zone includes your forehead and your nose. Picture making a T, with the top of the T above your eyebrows and the length of the T along your nose."

      "title": "Examine the tissue.",
      "content": "Examine the tissue. Remove the paper from your face and look at the dirt and oil left on it from your skin to determine your skin type. Here are some different things you might see: Dry: Skin feels stretchy and taut, there are signs of flaky and dead skin after you've cleansed your face, and pores are small. With this skin type you'll need to take extra care in moisturizing it. Oily: Shiny face and oil on the tissue, with large open pores. In order to achieve a glow with this face you'll need to keep the oil production down by using lighter products. You don't want your face to have a glow just from the oil! Combination: The tissue will be oily because of the T zone, but your cheeks and other parts of your face may be normal or dry. This is a very common skin type and can be treated easily. Normal: The tissue will have little oil and there will be no flakes of skin. This really just means that your face is healthy and produces an adequate amount of oil -- not too much, not too little. You'll still want to treat your face daily, though, to maintain its normalcy. Sensitive: This won't necessarily show on your tissue, but it may show on your face after you've removed the tissue. Does your face look red or irritated? Do you often feel a burning sensation on your face after using facial care products? If this is the case, you likely have sensitive skin and will just need to take extra care when cleansing your face to make sure you don't use products that are too harsh on your skin."

It's important that you follow this routine every day, because it provides your skin with the moisture and cleanliness it needs. Doing this in the morning will help kick start your day by giving you a fresh, clean face and then repeat the routine at night. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source People who have more sensitive skin or dry skin should only do this once per day, as cleansing your skin too much can dry it out even more and cause it to be more irritated. If you have dry skin, try following CTM in the morning and then removing your makeup and moisturizing your face at night before you go to bed. Remember that exfoliating is also important. Exfoliate using a face scrub or an enzyme exfoliant two to three times a week for normal or oily skin, and one to two times a week for dry or sensitive skin."

Start by rinsing your face with warm water to help lift dirt out of your skin, and then using a cleanser to remove oil and cleanse your face. Put the cleanser on your fingertips and gently rub onto your face and neck using circular motions and working out from the center of your face. Then, rinse with warm water and pat dry with a towel. [4] X Research source Make sure you get a cleanser suited for your skin type. When buying a cleanser there will often be information on the bottle explaining what type of skin type the cleanser is good for. You can also use natural facial cleansers that will probably be less irritating on your face. A cream cleanser is more hydrating so it may feel more refreshing on your face and can be better if you have dry skin. However, you can also use a gel cleanser if you have more oily skin or want to remove makeup. Always remove makeup before going to bed, even if you usually cleanse your face in the morning. Leaving any makeup on your face while you sleep will leave your face feeling more oily in the morning and can clog pores. You can use makeup remover or cleansing wipes to quickly remove any eye or face makeup."

Stress can cause an increase in acne, so monitor those things that are making you feel overwhelmed and try to find a way to cut them out of your life or reduce their impact to better your health. When you are stressed your body releases stress hormones including cortisol, which triggers an increase in skin's oil production, leading to increased acne.

While this can be treated with Botox or other medical procedures, it is best to keep your stress levels to a minimum. Getting adequate sleep can also lower stress levels. When you lose an hour of sleep your risk of psychological stress increases by 14%. Imagine losing four hours of sleep in one night--- that increases your chances by over 50%!

Although there are a lot of foods that worsen your skin, there are also a lot of foods that can benefit your skin, giving it the proper nutrients that it needs to maintain hydration and stay healthy. Some great things to focus on when choosing foods for your diet are: [11] X Research source Selenium -- It's a mineral that helps protect your skin from gaining free radicals that can cause wrinkling, dryness, and some diseases. You can find these minerals in foods like Brazilian nuts, shrimp, lamb, tuna, salmon, whole wheat pasta, light turkey, and cooked beef. Antioxidants--These also prevent free radicals from entering your body. Colorful fruits and vegetables like berries, tomatoes, spinach, beets, squash, and sweet potatoes all have antioxidants. CoQ10 -- This is a key antioxidant that decreases in your body as you get older. You can find this in salmon, tuna, poultry, liver, and whole grains. Some skincare products also contain this to prevent wrinkles. Vitamin A -- This prevents dry, flaky skin and can be found in carrots, cantaloupes, and oranges along with leafy greens, eggs, and low-fat dairy foods. You can also purchase prescription acne products that contain Vitamin A called retinoids that will help treat wrinkles and brown spots. Vitamin C -- This helps protect you from the sun and prevent sun damage. [12] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. Find this vitamin in citrus fruits, red bell peppers, papayas, kiwis, broccoli, and brussels sprouts. Vitamin E -- This is another antioxidant that can help save your skin from sun damage and prevent inflammation. Eat foods like nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, olives, spinach, asparagus, and leafy greens to obtain this vitamin. Healthy fats -- Yes, some fats are good for you! Look for Omega-3s and Omega-6s to help create your skin's natural oil barrier, which keeps away dryness and blemishes while also making your skin look younger and smoother. You can find these fatty acids in olive and canola oils, flaxseeds, walnuts, and cold-water fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel. Green tea -- This is considered a \"magic potion\" for your skin because it can help stop inflammation, slow DNA damage, and prevent sun damage."

Sunscreens are made for different skin types as well, so if you have oily skin, find a lighter sunscreen with ingredients like avobenzone, oxybenzone, methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, and zinc oxide.

      "content": "Avoid touching your face. This may seem silly, but acne can be triggered by the oils on your hands. Throughout the day, pay attention to where you place your hands. Are you resting your chin or cheek in your palm? Are you constantly picking at blemishes on your skin or swiping your hair out of your face? All of these things contribute to the oil on your face, which in excess can lead to more acne. Your cell phone also carries a lot of germs and oils that can easily attach to your face. The heat produced by your cell phone can multiply bacteria and when you put it to your face to talk on the phone you are being exposed to much of that bacteria. Get into the practice of cleaning your phone with a wipe or hand sanitizer once a day.

Apply a tinted moisturizer, blending it in evenly over your skin. Make sure you use one that is similar to your skin tone (you don't want to use one that is bronze if you have ivory skin) and don't cake it on.

Applying this under your eyes to lighten them up and cover any puffiness or dark circles or anywhere you have redness or uneven skin tone is also a good use of the concealer. Make sure to use just the right amount. If you use too much concealer and don't rub it in well, you will only draw attention to your blemishes. On the other hand, if you use too little, you won't be able to cover up your blemishes or problem areas adequately."
