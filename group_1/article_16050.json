      "content": "Raise your Snom's happiness. Unlike other Pokemon, Snom doesn't evolve by level or by using a special item. Instead, you must raise its happiness , sometimes also called \"friendship.\" Happiness evolutions have been in the Pokémon series for years, but they're not always very straightforward. You can raise your Pokémon's happiness by doing the following: Using potions or other items on the Pokémon Feeding it Grepa, Hondew, Kelpsy, Pomeg, Qualot, or Tamato Berry Playing with it at camp Taking the Pokémon for a walk with the Let's Go feature Doing any of the above with a Soothe Bell equipped and/or in the same area you caught the Pokémon will further increase friendship.

When you show a Pokemon to the friendship rater, she will say a phrase that correlates to a friendship level. [3] X Research source Show the friendship rater your Snom. If she says \"Wow, you're pretty great friends! You sure mean a lot to each other.\" your Snom is ready to evolve. [4] X Research source If the friendship rater says \"You're good friends, all right! You definitely enjoy each other's company!\" then your Snom may be ready to evolve. This statement correlates to a happiness level of 200–229, and Snom needs a minimum happiness of 220 to evolve. You can try to evolve your Snom, or keep raising happiness until you get the next phrase."
