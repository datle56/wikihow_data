      "content": "If he thinks you’re the one, he’ll walk around feeling like the bee’s knees. Nothing makes a man feel more confident and powerful than the love of the woman he thinks is the one . That sense of security and support can’t come from a good relationship with a friend or a big promotion at work. [1] X Research source A man who has found the one is also likely to express fewer negative emotions, too. They may be less judgmental, prone to anger, or nervous."

      "content": "Does he show up to dates well-dressed and on time? Is he trimming his beard to keep it clean? Is his home or room well-kempt and clean? If so, he thinks you’re special! Psychologist and relationship coach Lisa Shield agrees: “Women tend to dress better than men. It angers my female clients since they will put all that energy and attention into looking nice for a day, and it seems like very often the guy will just go through the laundry pile and find the least unwashed clothing.” If he’s trying hard, you may be the one."

      "content": "A man who thinks he has found the one will let up a bit on a lot of the socializing and clubbing because he knows he’s got you. That means he’ll have more time in his day to pursue the stuff he finds personally interesting—not just stuff a potential partner would want to do. If he suddenly gets super into woodworking, video games, or working on cars, it’s a great sign.

      "content": "A guy won’t make plans for the future if he doesn’t picture a life with you. If he thinks you’re the one, he may talk about future trips the two of you should take or ask about where the two of you should retire. If he keeps bringing up the future with you, he’s in it for the long haul and you’re the one.

If he is excited about introducing you to his parents, extended family, and close friends, it’s a major signal that he’s not interested in anybody else. This is a guy who wants to build something with you. [5] X Research source The reverse is also true. If a guy is in love, he’ll want to meet your friends and family, too!"

For a lot of guys, hobbies are everything. So, the fact that he wants to bring you into his “world” means a lot.

Vulnerability is essential to the health of any relationship, but it can be hard for men to open up—even if they’re super into someone. So, if your partner has learned how to be open and vulnerable to you, it’s a big cue that he thinks you may be the one."

However, if he thinks he has found the one, he’ll be much more diplomatic in his approach. If your conflict has the texture of “us vs. the problem” and not “you vs. me,” he thinks you’re it.A man in love will also look for a middle ground in the “little” things. If you want sushi for dinner and he wants burgers, does he scrap over it or offer to look for a fusion spot?"

While you won’t be able to listen in to his private conversations, you can see what he’s up to on Facebook and Instagram. If he’s posting about you and sharing photos of you, he’s into you in a way that’s special. [9] X Research source Try not to read too much into this if he isn’t posting about you and he was never a big social media guy to begin with. Some men just don’t share a lot online like that."

If your partner uses a ton of “we” language (as opposed to “I” language), it means that you’ve fully embedded yourself into the fabric of his thoughts. It’s no longer just about what he wants—it’s about the two of you and what you’re building together. [10] X Research source For example, instead of saying something like, “I’d love to go to Sweden one day,” he might say, “We should go to Sweden some day.”"
