It's also great to have some positive entries to read on days when you feel everything but happy or settled. [4] X Research source"

Place it inside a shoebox of many papers. Hide it in plain site. Make it as boring as your school or college books and keep it among them. Just take care not to carry it to school or college with you though! Keep inside a secret hollow book . And boldest of all, don't worry about others reading it. Be bold and don't care what others snoop around and learn. That's their karma and you'll stand by the person you are."
