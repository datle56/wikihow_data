[2] X Research source If your friend has a relaxed posture, with their torso facing towards you, it’s a sign that they feel at ease. It may mean they like you or it may just mean they are comfortable being around you. Watch for signs that your friend's posture has changed around you. For instance, if they normally act relaxed, but now they seem stiff, it may be a sign that they are nervous because they have a crush on you. If your friend usually has their arms crossed or they stand with their body turned away from you any time you're around, they may not be crushing on you. However, if they only act closed off every once in awhile, it might mean they are talking to someone else or are busy."
