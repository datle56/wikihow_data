      "content": "Ask him why he’s angry and validate his feelings. When someone feels like they’re being listened to and validated, they’re more likely to hear your point of view. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source When you’ve both calmed down, gently ask why he’s angry. As he talks, practice active listening by maintaining eye contact, repeating what he says for accuracy, and allowing him to talk without interruption. [2] X Research source Letting your partner talk about why he’s upset isn’t giving into his emotions—it’s just a way to put out the fire so you can talk about the issue calmly together. [3] X Research source Repeat what he’s saying as he explains his perspective. For example, you may say, “I understand that you’re frustrated because I didn’t call you back when I was out with my friends.” If this conversation makes him angrier or makes the situation worse, tell him that you need some space to calm down and think. Leave the room for a few hours, or even spend a few days apart."

      "content": "Directly express how his mean actions made you feel. Say something like, “I care about our relationship” or “I know you don’t mean to upset me” to validate his frustrations. Then, describe the mean behavior that your partner displayed during your argument, use an “I” statement to explain how it made you feel, and ask him if he would change that behavior. [4] X Research source For example, you might say, “I know you didn’t mean to upset me, but I felt really hurt and sad when you said I’m terrible at cooking. I would like it if you didn’t insult my abilities like that.” Or you could say, \"I feel hurt when you come home from work and immediately get frustrated with me. I want our home to feel like a safe and calm environment, and lately I don't feel relaxed.\" Try to say what you want your relationship to look like— \"My goal is for us to both communicate how to keep our stress levels down and enjoy each other's company. I want us to thrive and be happy.\""

      "title": "Ask what he needs from you and work on a solution together.",
      "content": "Ask what he needs from you and work on a solution together. Your boyfriend’s mean words and actions may stem from feeling treated unfairly. If that’s the case, reassure him that you want to be proactive and find a way to address his frustrations. Find a middle ground that allows both of you to feel satisfied and doesn’t compromise your values. [5] X Research source Discuss strategies that can help him diffuse his emotions. If he’s frequently stressed about work, you could talk about setting aside an hour each day to relax alone before spending time together. [6] X Research source Stick to one issue at a time. Couples who stick to one argument have enough time to process their emotions, creating a better chance of finding a solution. [7] X Research source Advocate for yourself and express when a request isn't reasonable. If he wants you to skip work or school to spend time with him, say, “I really need to focus on my responsibilities. My future is important to me.”"

I’m allowed to leave at any moment.” “Put down that book. It’s not okay to throw things in our house.” “Please lower your voice. We need to have a civil discussion.” “I’m not going to give you my passwords. That’s an invasion of privacy.” To take a break, set a timer and go to a place where he can’t engage with you during that time. Take a walk, lock yourself in your room, or drive to a safe location.

      "title": "Ban the use of insults, name-calling, cursing, or yelling.",
      "content": "Ban the use of insults, name-calling, cursing, or yelling. When your partner yells or uses put-downs, it can cause you to feel defensive or return the favor, which can make your argument unproductive. [11] X Research source If your boyfriend slips up, gently remind him that his language isn’t acceptable, take a break, and come back when you both cool down. [12] X Research source For example, say something like, “I understand that you’re upset about me not calling you back, but that kind of language isn’t helping either of us. Remember, we agreed to talk about this without using those words.” Or say, “I feel anxious when you yell, and when that happens, I can’t concentrate on this topic. Either you stop shouting, or I'll talk to you later when we’ve both had a chance to calm down.\" Before coming back to the discussion, remind yourself of your boundaries. Tell yourself that if he starts to call you names again, you will tell him you won’t tolerate that behavior and walk away if he doesn’t stop. Your boyfriend doesn’t have the right to hurt you, and you never deserve verbal abuse . If he continues to disrespect your boundaries, walk away from the conversation."

[13] X Research source If he constantly tries to blame you for his anger when it isn’t your fault, use an “I” statement to tell him how it makes you feel and encourage him to do the same. [14] X Research source “I feel very upset and hurt when you blame me for all of our problems.” It may be helpful to address how you may have enabled this behavior by not setting boundaries earlier. That way, you can show your partner that conversation is a dialogue, not an attack. If he tries to play the blame game in the future, say something like, “We promised not to blame each other. Remember, our main goal here is to find a way to get through this.”"

      "content": "Use positive reframing to prevent getting defensive. “Positive reframing” helps you get rid of negative thoughts by looking at a situation with a different view. [15] X Research source Practice positive reframing when your boyfriend is angry so you can avoid feeling shame or negativity. For example, instead of telling yourself, “All I do is irritate him,” say, “He must be having a bad day.” It’s not always easy to feel empathy for a person who’s being mean. However, by choosing to reframe his anger, you keep yourself from becoming defensive. Just because you reframe his anger doesn't mean that you have to accept it. Positive reframing is a tool to remind yourself that you’re not the one at fault."
