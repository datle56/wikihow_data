Tight clothes can reduce blood flow to the area. Put on comfortable, loose fitting clothes, such as sweatpants, a skirt or athletic shorts.

      "content": "Lie down on a couch or in bed. Lie on your back on a wide couch or in bed with plenty of room. You can place a pillow behind your head or shoulders to make yourself more comfortable, if you like. Make sure to have some propping pillows for your knee within arm’s reach. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of California San Francisco Health Center Research hospital associated with UCSF, a leading medical university, providing innovative patient care and public health resources Go to source Avoid lying flat on your back if you are more than 3 months pregnant. Lying flat late in pregnancy can cause your uterus to compress a major artery in your body, which can decrease circulation. Place a few pillows behind your back and shoulders so you’re propped up at a 45-degree angle instead. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Prop your knee so it is at least 12 inches above your heart. Place a few pillows underneath your heel and calf to raise your knee until it is about 12 inches (30 cm) above your heart. Avoid putting pillows directly underneath the knee, which can apply pressure to any swelling and limit your range of motion. Use as many pillows as necessary to achieve the right elevation. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of California San Francisco Health Center Research hospital associated with UCSF, a leading medical university, providing innovative patient care and public health resources Go to source It may be helpful to have a partner or friend place the pillows for you. This way you don’t have to exert yourself if you’re in any pain. If you don’t feel confident about arranging your own pillows or don’t have enough to achieve the right elevation, many online retailers sell special knee-elevation pillows to hold your leg at just the right angle. Especially if you are injured or having trouble arranging multiple pillows yourself, this might be a good alternative."

      "content": "Keep a 45-degree angle between your thigh and the couch or bed. After arranging the pillows, check the angle between your thigh and the surface you are lying on. A 45-degree angle—halfway between lying flat and having your legs vertical—is best for good blood flow.

      "content": "Repeat the process several times daily. Rest and elevate your knees 3 to 4 times a day for 15 minutes at a time. Use your elevations as a moment to relax, check your email, or watch a show. Elevating your knee for this amount of time will help increase blood flow and reduce any pain. It is not helpful to do elevations for a longer period of time, unless your doctor tells you to do so. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply ice to relieve any discomfort.",
      "content": "Apply ice to relieve any discomfort. Use an ice pack wrapped in a tea towel to ice your elevated knee for up to ten minutes at a time. Don’t ice more frequently than once an hour, though. [7] X Research source Icing can reduce puffiness and ease any pain you’re experiencing. To protect yourself, always use a barrier, such as a towel or T-shirt, between the ice and your bare skin. If your pain makes you want to ice the knee more frequently, schedule a checkup with your doctor to rule out a more serious knee injury."

      "content": "Lose any extra weight if necessary. Maintaining a healthy body weight through diet and exercise will take excess pressure off your knees as you go about your life. Strive to workout for 30 minutes a day 4-5 days a week for good health. This will help you kick start weight loss and increase circulation to the knee. [8] X Research source Your doctor can advise you on a healthy weight range for your height. Start any new exercise routine gradually so your body can get used to that level of activity. For example, if you’re sedentary, try walking once or twice a week for 15 minutes to start."

      "content": "Walk on flat rather than uneven surfaces. Uneven surfaces, such as grass or gravel, can place unequal pressure on the different parts of your knee. Over time, this can cause joint pain and swelling. If you like to jog or walk outside, look for level pavement or a finished track, where the surface will be gentler on your joints."

      "title": "Modify how you do squats and lunges.",
      "content": "Modify how you do squats and lunges. Squats and lunges can put lots of pressure on your knee joints, particularly if you do them frequently. If you want to perform squats and lunges in a knee-sensitive way, don’t bend your knees beyond a 90-degree angle. When squatting, focus on your hips sitting back first to engage the abdominal muscles and to help maintain a center of gravity. [9] X Research source It can also help to hold the squat or lunge as a static exercise rather than a moving one. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose low-impact exercises when possible.",
      "content": "Choose low-impact exercises when possible. Swap high-impact exercises, such as running and plyometrics, for ones that are easier on your knees, such as swimming and cycling. This will reduce knee pressure and pain related to your feet striking the ground. If you like to cycle, make sure your bike seat is high enough. Your knee should extend completely straight when the pedal is at its lowest point."

You can also buy gel inserts for added comfort. [11] X Research source If your feet roll inward when you walk, look for a shoe with arch support to keep knee pain in check. [12] X Research source Many sneaker stores can measure your feet and fit you appropriately for athletic shoes. Tell the fitting assistant what kinds of activities you like to do when you exercise, and they can direct you to shoes that would be the best fit for your lifestyle."

      "title": "Stretch before exercising.",
      "content": "Stretch before exercising. Focus on stretching your calves, quads, and hamstrings well before being active. These muscles take pressure off your knees and kneecaps as you move. Building additional flexibility in your hips can relieve pressure from your knees, too. While no one loves stretching, you’ll increase your pain tolerance by limbering up before exercise. In order to best protect your knees, slowly ramp up to full speed when exercising rather than jumping right into the most challenging part of your workout. [13] X Research source Some stretches to explore to protect your knees include hamstring curls, step-ups, the butterfly stretch, and straight-leg lifts. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Work on your posture . Center your head over your shoulders and your shoulders over your pelvis when you walk around during the day. Slouching forward while walking forces your knees to compensate, which can cause pain and swelling. Try to be conscious of your posture both as you exercise and as you go about your daily routine. [15] X Research source Building your core muscle strength through plank exercises, yoga and Pilates are great ways to improve your posture. This will lessen extra pressure on your knees.

Also look for any bulging areas of excessive swelling. These changes are not typical of swelling you should address at home. Call your doctor to get the knee checked out.
