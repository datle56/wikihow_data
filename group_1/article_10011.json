      "content": "Marinate the rabbit for at least 1 hour. Place the rabbit pieces into the marinade and toss well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour, if not longer. When roasting an entire rabbit, only use farmed rabbit. If using wild rabbit, only use the saddle or torso of the rabbit. Farmed rabbit has much more fat, so it fares better in dry heat methods like roasting than wild rabbit does. Since the saddle of wild rabbit is fatty enough, though, it can still be roasted. Use 2 large saddles or 4 smaller saddles from wild rabbits in place of 2 full farmed rabbits. Marinating the rabbit for 2 hours is actually ideal since the marinade will have more time to permeate and flavor the meat."

Either method will work. Pour the flour into a large resealable plastic bag or into a shallow dish before dredging the rabbit pieces. If you use a bag, you can toss the pieces into the bag, seal it, and shake thoroughly. If using a shallow dish, turn and coat all sides by hand."

Ideally, the oil should be heated to a temperature around 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius). [5] X Research source Check the temperature of the oil using a candy thermometer. Note that you may need to continually check the temperature of the oil during the cooking process to make sure that it does not get too cool or too hot. Do not let the oil smoke at any point during the cooking process. If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the oil by quickly sprinkling flour into it. The flour should sizzle upon contact. A large cast iron frying pan is the ideal type of pan to use. Keep in mind that once you add the rabbit pieces, the oil should reach roughly the halfway point up along the side of the pieces."

Remove all the pieces separately as they turn crispy and golden brown. The belly flap pieces and forelegs will finish up first. The loin will be next, and the hind legs will be last.
