      "content": "Select a style or two that you want to go for with your wardrobe. [2] X Research source One example of a style is “the rocker”, he wears band tees, jeans, leather jackets and converse tennis shoes. Look at the clothes you already own, and decide what kind of style you may already have. If you don’t have a style yet it is helpful to decide what style is right for you. First, it might be helpful to think about someone who dresses in a way that you like. Identify that particular style- for example, if you like plaid shirts, tweed jackets, bow ties and oxford shoes- you like the professor look. Before you decide on a style, ask yourself: does that look make sense for me and for my interests? Choose from the following list of some common styles for men: the professional, the collegiate, the sportsman, the playboy, the minimalist, the professor, the rocker, the woodsman, the man of leisure. [3] X Research source There are, of course, more styles than are listed there. Remember, styles are flexible. The objective behind choosing a style is to give you a template to build your style. You will be the most confident and attractive when your style becomes an extension of you. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Start shopping for the style you like. Ask the people you know who have that style where they get their clothes, and go to those stores to shop. Do research online to find examples of men wearing that style, and then search for the companies or brands associated with that style. For example, if you like the woodsman style you might want to start shopping at Lands End. Online shopping is another great option, and if you don't like crowds, it will keep you from rushing while you shop. In addition, there are online companies and consultants who will help you find the style that is right for you, however, this option is a bit more pricey."

      "content": "Get your clothes tailored or altered so that they fit you correctly. Take your suit to a tailor to have it fitted, or have a customer service representative at a reputable clothing retail store to help you buy clothing that fits. When you go to retailer or tailor, ask them how the clothes are meant to fit. At Club Monaco, J. Crew and Banana Republic, they will take your measurements and have the clothing altered for you to make sure it fits correctly. [5] X Research source In a study where men's faces were blotted out, men who wore a tailored suit, as opposed to a very similar looking store bought suit, were rated as being more confident, successful, flexible and a higher earners by the participants of the study. [6] X Research source Studies have shown that people make snap judgments about you, based on how you are dressed. The study showed that small differences in the clothing, for example, if the inseam of your pants was too short, reflects badly on people’s impression of your personality and abilities. [7] X Research source Take note if you are under 5’10 tall, most companies design clothing for men who are 5’10, and so the clothes made for men by most retailers probably won't fit you correctly. Luckily, Jaden Lam, Jimmy Au’s For Men 5’8 and Under, and Peter Manning NYC, have made clothing with you in mind. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the colors you wear carefully. If you wear the correct colors for your skin tone, you will accentuate your good looks, whereas, wearing the wrong colors will be unflattering. As a rule, bright red, pale pink, teal, and eggplant, look good on all skin types. Decide whether you have a warm skin tone or a cool skin tone. If gold looks best on you, then you probably have a warm skin tone. However, if silver looks best on you, your skin tone is probably cool. If your skin’s undertones are yellow, then you have a warm skin tone. Cool skin tones tend to have a rosy or pink undertone. If you have a warm skin tone, wearing earth tones of ivory, orange, yellow, brown, and green, will be flattering for your skin type. If you have a cool skin tone, wearing jewel tones of pure white, black, blue, and true pink, will be the most attractive on you. If you are going to a club and you want sex appeal, wear red; a multicultural study showed that men wearing red were found to be more attractive and sexually desirable to women. [9] X Research source Warning, do not wear more than three colors together at once. It will distract from your desired effect."
