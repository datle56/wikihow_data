      "content": "Prep your hair with styling cream or pomade. Start by applying styling cream to get your hair prepped and frizz-free, and to help hold the hairstyle in place. [1] X Research source If you have a go-to styling cream that you typically use before braiding your hair or creating an up-do , that should work perfectly! If you have fine, straight hair, opt for a lightweight cream to avoid weighing down your hair. If you have thicker, wavy, or curly hair, try out a medium to heavy weight styling cream to lock in moisture. [2] X Research source If you need to make sure your hairstyle stays in place throughout a long day, add a bit of pomade for a bit of extra hold."

      "content": "Add hair ties in equal increments down your ponytail. Start by adding an elastic hair tie a few inches down from the original one, and continue adding more hair ties down the length of your hair in equal intervals. [4] X Research source If you want to create several small bubbles, add in more hair ties at shorter intervals. If you want to create just a few large bubbles, add fewer elastics and space them further apart from each other. This step is entirely customizable and up to you, so don't be afraid to get creative with it! If you have thicker hair, try using thicker elastic hair ties to make sure the style stays in place."
