      "content": "Put on your gloves, ear plugs, and protective eyewear. Crushing rocks can be very dangerous, so put on protective gear. Wear thick work gloves to protect your hands from blisters and cuts, and use ear plugs to protect your hearing. Cover your eyes with safety glasses in case a piece of rock flies up into your face. [2] X Research source Striking the rock can be very loud, so it might damage your hearing. If you’re using a machine, it’ll be especially loud."

      "title": "Put the rocks in a metal container.",
      "content": "Put the rocks in a metal container. Metal works best for crushing rock because you'll be striking them hard with a blunt instrument. Pick an old metal container that you don’t mind damaging. Place 1 or more rocks inside the container in a single layer. [3] X Research source Don’t try to crush too many rocks at one time. If you layer the rocks, it'll be too difficult to crush them."

      "content": "Use a sledgehammer to break the rock into smaller pieces. Lift the sledgehammer into the air, then swing it down onto the rock as hard as you can. Strike the rocks with your hammer until they’re crushed into small pebbles. [4] X Research source If you have access to a power hammer, use it to break up your rock faster and easier. You can also drop a heavy object, like a weight, onto the rocks. However, this might be less efficient. Historically, gold prospectors used sledgehammers to break up rock."

      "content": "Grind the rock into a powder using a metal rod. Leave your rock pebbles in the metal container for the grinding process. Use a metal rod with the metal container to create a makeshift mortar and pestle that are strong enough to use with rocks. Press the end of the metal rod into the rock pebbles, then drag the rod along the bottom and sides of the metal container. Grind the rocks until the pieces are slightly larger than the holes in the bottom of your mining pan.

With persistence, you can turn the rocks into powder."

      "title": "Put the rock powder in a mining pan.",
      "content": "Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

Wear long pants, long sleeves, closed-toed shoes, and thick work gloves. Additionally, put on protective eye wear so that rock bits and mercury don’t get into your eyes. While you’re crushing the rock, wear ear plugs to protect your hearing.

[13] X Research source You may be able to harvest your own cinnabar if you live in Spain, Egypt, the United States, New Zealand, the Philippines, Slovenia, Italy, Serbia, Peru, and China. Do an online search to find a mining site in your area. Typically, it's present in rock formations around hot springs. If it's legal for you to harvest your own cinnabar, use a pickax to chisel off a piece of it. [14] X Research source Don’t try to extract mercury from an old thermometer. This is very dangerous!"
