The leader will place their hands on each side of the injured persons head, making sure their head is facing straight ahead. It is very important to keep their neck and head stable. The other 3-4 helpers should be kneeling on one side of the injured person. Each helper will be in control of moving a different portion of the injured person's body, and the helpers should be spread out evenly. One helper should be designated to slide a stretcher under the injured person as the rest of the helpers roll them on their side. This helper should be kneeling on the opposite side of the injured person's body."

The helpers will then roll the injured person toward them, so that the injured person ends up on their side. As the helpers move the injured person, the leader must keep the head and neck aligned with the body. As the body turns, so should the head."

Keep your knees bent as you roll onto your side. It is sometimes helpful to visualize your body as an actual log. This technique is called a log roll because your torso is supposed to move as one solid unit - just like a log would move."
