      "content": "Perfect your bridges . The bridge, also known as the press, is an advanced back stretch, but also a key component of the valdez. Start by laying on your back with your legs bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep your feet planted on the ground. Place your hands by your ears, palm down. Make sure your fingers are pointing towards your feet, and your elbows are pointing towards the ceiling. Lift your back off the ground by pushing up with your hands and feet. Keep your hands and feet on the ground as you lift. Your goal is to lift your back completely off the ground while keeping your arms and legs straight."

      "title": "Practice standing backbends.",
      "content": "Practice standing backbends. Standing straight up, lift your arms over your head. Keep your arms straight, with your palms facing the ceiling, and your fingers pointing behind you. Arch your back backward and slowly move your arms closer to the floor. Look for the ground behind you. Use your arms to feel for the ground so that you don't hit your head when you land. When you feel the ground, firmly plant your hands to complete the backbend. If you are having trouble performing a standing backbend, use a wall to help you. Stand facing away from the wall. As you start your backbend place your hands on the wall and walk yourself down to the ground."

      "title": "Learn to do backbend kick-overs.",
      "content": "Learn to do backbend kick-overs. To do a backbend kick-over, start by doing a standing backbend. Once you've completed your standing backbend, kick your legs over your head until you land back on your feet. Make sure you have enough momentum to get your legs over your body, and onto the ground behind you. If you are having trouble kicking your legs over, try performing a bridge in front of a wall. Keep your feet next to the wall, and walk your feet up the wall before you push off. You may find that you can't quite kick your legs over your body the first few times that you attempt a kick-over. If you try to kick, but keep landing in the bridge position, that's okay. Kick-overs are difficult, and it will take a lot of practice to complete one."

Common gymnastics back stretches are the cobra pose from yoga, and the see-saw. To do the cobra, lay on your stomach and place your hands on the ground in front of your head. Keep your hands about shoulder width apart. Use your hands to press your upper body off the floor. Don't let your hips or legs lift off the ground, and remember to keep your arms straight. Hold the stretch for several seconds, and then release. To do the see-saw, lay on your stomach and stretch your arms back towards your feet. Bend your legs up and try to grab your ankles. When you can grab your ankles with your hands, lift both your upper and lower body off the ground. Your core should be the only thing touching the ground. Gently rock back and forth for several seconds, and then release the stretch."

As you're standing, try to engage your core by pulling your body up as much as you can. Keeping your body still, extend your forward pointed leg and raise it. Try to raise your leg at an even pace. When you have your leg extended fully in front of you, lower it back down to the ground. Repeat this movement 10 times. Do this exercise twice on each leg. Try a variation on leg raises by doing them from the bridge position. Get into a bridge position and then shift your body weight to your shoulders. Extend one leg forward and point your toes. Lift this leg into the air until it is over your shoulders. Lower the leg back down, keeping your toes pointed forward. Repeat this raise 3-5 times on each leg."
