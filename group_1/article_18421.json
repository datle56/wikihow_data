It also depends on your goals and what results you are looking for. If you belong to a gym, ask one of the staff members to make some recommendations for your particular body type."

Try stirring some into whatever you're eating--oatmeal, soup, salad dressing--to boost your calorie intake for that meal. Read labels. Avoid items that are \"low fat\", \"light\", or \"diet\". For example, eat regular cottage cheese rather than the light version."
