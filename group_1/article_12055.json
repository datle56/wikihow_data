      "title": "Get an orthopedic bed for your cat.",
      "content": "Get an orthopedic bed for your cat. It is very important for your paralyzed cat to have a comfortable, well-padded bed. Orthopedic cat beds are designed to be easy on your cat’s joints and prevent the development of bedsores and other problems that frequently develop in cats with limited mobility. They are also designed to make it easier for cats to climb in and out without bending or crouching. [1] X Research source Ask your vet to recommend a good type of orthopedic bed for your cat."

      "content": "Install ramps to help your cat get around. If you have steps or elevated surfaces in your home that your cat needs to be able to reach, purchase a pet ramp or a set of shallow pet stairs. Ramps can help your cat access areas like beds and other furniture, stairs in your home, and even the litter box. Ramps can be especially helpful if your cat is outfitted with a wheelchair or cart.

      "title": "Get your cat an appropriate litter box.",
      "content": "Get your cat an appropriate litter box. Using the litter box can be a major challenge for a paralyzed cat. If your cat still has some mobility and is able to go to the bathroom without help, it may be enough to get a very shallow litter box, or a box with a low entrance. Cats with more severe paralysis may need to use training pads or pet diapers. Consider keeping the litter box close to your cat’s bed and other necessities, so that your cat will not have to travel a long distance in order to use the litter."

    {
      "title": "Provide your cat with accessible food and water dishes.",
      "content": "Provide your cat with accessible food and water dishes. Talk to your vet about what types of food and water dishes will work best for your cat’s needs. In many cases, elevated feeders can be useful for cats with limited mobility, since they do not force your cat to bend down or crouch to access their food and water. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add rugs to areas with hard floors.",
      "content": "Add rugs to areas with hard floors. Carpeting or rugs may be easier for your cat to navigate than linoleum, tile, or hardwood. If your cat is partially paralyzed, lay down area rugs in locations where your cat spends a lot of time, like near their bed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Block off areas that might pose a danger to your cat.",
      "content": "Block off areas that might pose a danger to your cat. If you are worried about your cat’s lack of coordination or mobility leading to injuries, consider blocking off areas of your home with elevated or uneven surfaces. You can use a baby gate to block off problem areas, or simply close the door to rooms that you don’t want your cat to access without supervision. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bathe your cat",
      "content": "Bathe your cat regularly. A paralyzed cat will probably have a difficult time with grooming. Many paralyzed cats have problems with incontinence, so your cat may need extra help keeping clean. Bathe your cat each time it soils itself to prevent urine scald and bedsores. For cats without incontinence, clean them every few days (or more often, as needed) to keep their skin and fur healthy and clean. [5] X Research source Ask your vet to suggest a healthy cleanser for your cat. A moisturizing cleanser or dry shampoo may be a good option."

    {
      "title": "Groom your cat",
      "content": "Groom your cat if they can’t do so themselves. Many paralyzed cats will have a hard time grooming themselves. If this is the case for your cat, help them keep their fur, teeth, and nails in good shape. Brush your cat’s fur and trim any snarls or tangles. Trim the cat’s nails, brush its teeth, and clean its ears. If you feel uncomfortable or unsure of how to complete these tasks, talk to your veterinarian or take the cat to a professional groomer."

      "title": "Help your cat use the litter box, if necessary.",
      "content": "Help your cat use the litter box, if necessary. Some paralyzed cats need extra help going to the bathroom. Talk to your vet about the best way to help your cat. You may need to simply place your cat in the litter box from time to time to encourage them to go, or you may have to actually help your cat eliminate after being trained by a veterinary professional on how to do so.

      "title": "Talk to your vet about getting a wheelchair or other mobility device for your cat.",
      "content": "Talk to your vet about getting a wheelchair or other mobility device for your cat. You may be able to outfit your cat with a wheelchair, or cart, to help them get around. Cat wheelchairs typically consist of a pair of wheels positioned on either side of the cat’s hind legs, along with a pair of harnesses that support the cat’s hips and shoulders. If you have a cat with paralyzed hind limbs, a wheelchair or cart can help restore much of your feline companion’s mobility. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check your cat for sores and other injuries.",
      "content": "Check your cat for sores and other injuries. Paralyzed animals are prone to a variety of injuries and abrasions, which can result from spending too much time in the same position (bedsores), dragging their paralyzed limbs, or simply as a result of lack of coordination when trying to get around. Keep a close eye on your cat and look for any signs of sores, scrapes, and other injuries. [8] X Research source Injuries often occur around joints, especially the elbows, ankles, and hips. Your vet may be able to provide bandages or pads to protect vulnerable areas. If your cat is unable to turn over or change positions easily, help your cat turn over every few hours to prevent bed sores. If you notice any injuries, take your cat to the vet right away."

      "title": "Watch out for new or worsening symptoms.",
      "content": "Watch out for new or worsening symptoms. Ask your vet what sorts of trouble signs to watch out for. If your cat’s paralysis seems to be getting worse, or if you notice new symptoms developing, call your vet immediately, or take your cat to an emergency vet."

      "title": "Take your cat to the vet for evaluation.",
      "content": "Take your cat to the vet for evaluation. If your cat is showing new or worsening symptoms of paralysis, take them to the vet immediately. Your vet may be able to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the paralysis. Common symptoms of feline paralysis may include: [9] X Research source The inability to move some or all of the legs. Limb weakness. Dragging the rear legs while walking. Pain in the neck, back, or legs. Insensitivity to pain in the extremities. Difficulty using the litter box. This could take the form of incontinence (urinating or defecating outside the litter box, or dribbling urine) or the inability to urinate or defecate."

      "title": "Work with your vet to understand the reason for your cat’s paralysis.",
      "content": "Work with your vet to understand the reason for your cat’s paralysis. Feline paralysis can have many causes, including stroke, injury or infection in the spine, certain infectious diseases (like toxoplasmosis or an infection caused by a tick bite), blood clots, or cancer. [10] X Research source Depending on the cause of your cat’s paralysis, treatment could involve surgery, or it could be as simple as a course of antibiotics. Your vet may need to run laboratory tests on your cat’s blood or urine, or do diagnostic imaging (e.g., and X-ray, MRI, or CT-scan)."

      "title": "Give your vet as much information as possible.",
      "content": "Give your vet as much information as possible. You can help your vet diagnose your cat’s condition by providing any information you have about the cat’s symptoms and recent health history. For example: Did your cat recently fall or experience some other injury? Was your cat bitten by a tick? When and how quickly did the paralysis symptoms appear? Does your cat have any other symptoms aside from the paralysis (e.g., coughing, difficulty breathing, cold paws, dilated or unresponsive pupils, any unusual behavior)?"

      "content": "Follow your vet’s treatment plan. Once your vet determines a likely cause for your cat’s paralysis, you will need to carefully follow your vet’s recommendations for treatment and aftercare. [11] X Research source Depending on the severity of the paralysis and the type of treatment, your cat may need to spend some time in the veterinary hospital before coming home. This is especially likely if your cat is unable to urinate, defecate, or eat without help. Pay careful attention to your vet’s instructions on caring for your cat at home, including information on how to give your cat any medications they might need, how to care for your cat after a surgery, and any trouble signs to look out for (like new or returning symptoms)."

      "content": "Talk to your vet about getting physical therapy for your cat. In some cases, physical therapy can help relieve symptoms of feline paralysis. Consult with your vet before attempting to start any sort of physical therapy, as beginning exercise too early may aggravate your cat’s condition and make recovery more difficult or even impossible. Talk to your vet about how long to wait before starting physical therapy, and ask about what kinds of exercises might be appropriate for your cat. [12] X Research source"
