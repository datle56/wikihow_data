This amount is your starting balance. If your register doesn't include such a box, write the words \"Starting Balance\" in the first line under the Description of Transaction and enter the starting balance in the box on the far right. If you've previously filled out a check register and are starting a new one, this amount is your carryover balance from the previous check register."

If you are recording a debit card payment to a restaurant, don't forget to include the amount of the tip. Record the amount of your payment. This could be from writing a check, using a debit card purchase or a fee charged by your bank. Enter this in the Payment/Withdrawal column. This column is immediately to the right of the Description of Transaction field and may be followed by a narrow, unlabeled column in which you can check off the checks reported as cleared on your monthly bank statement. Record the amount of your deposit or interest payment in the Deposit column. This column is to the right of the Payment/Withdrawal and check-off columns."
