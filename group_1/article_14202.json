Under \"Google Drive\" you'll see an option selected from the \"Remove items synced between Google Drive and this computer.\" This option determines whether deleting a file on your computer will also remove it from Google Drive. Always remove both copies: If this option is selected, synced files and folders you delete from your computer are immediately deleted from Google Drive. This means if you're looking for a file you deleted, you might not find it on Google Drive. See How to Recover Deleted Files from Your Computer if you're unable to download backed up files with this method. Never remove both copies: This option means that deleting a file or folder on your computer will not affect the synced copy of that file on Google Drive. You can restore from your backup. Ask before removing both copies: This option is your best bet—when you remove a file from your computer, Google Drive will ask if you also want to delete the backed-up copy. If you say no, the file will remain on your Google Drive in case you need to download it again."
