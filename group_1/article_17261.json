      "content": "This is the slope formula, which states Slope = Rise over Run. When plotting a line on a graph, the “Rise” refers to the change in y that corresponds to a specific change in x . This change in x is called the “Run.” For instance, if y increases by 4 when x increases by 2 , then Rise = 4 and Run = 2 . To find the slope, divide 4/2 to get 2 . [1] X Research source The slope of a line is represented by the variable m . In this example, m = 2 . The slope m is part of the formula y = mx + b . This is called the “slope-intercept formula.” You can use y = mx + b to calculate a value of y that corresponds to a particular value of x . Each pair of corresponding x and y values is called a “point”, written as ( x , y ). [2] X Research source If you find multiple ( x , y ) points for the same equation, you can plot those points on a graph and draw a straight line through them."

You can pick any two points you like, as long as the line passes directly through them. [3] X Research source In the example above, we picked the points ( 2 , 1 ) and ( 5 , 3 ). The first point has an x value of 2 and a y value of 1 , so it’s written as ( 2 , 1 ). The second point has an x value of 5 and a y value of 3 . It’s written as ( 5 , 3 )."

In the example above, ( x 1 , y 1 ) is ( 2 , 1 ), while ( x 2 , y 2 ) is ( 5 , 3 ). [4] X Research source For simplicity, you can always make the point farthest on the left ( x 1 , y 1 ). This point will have the lower value for x . In reality, you can make either point ( x 1 , y 1 ) or ( x 2 , y 2 ), as long as you remember which is which."

To illustrate this, let’s calculate m for our previous example using the coordinates ( 2 , 1 ) and ( 5 , 3 ): [5] X Research source ( x 1 , y 1 ) = ( 2 , 1 ), and ( x 2 , y 2 ) is ( 5 , 3 ). Rise = y 2 - y 1 , or 3 - 1 . Run = x 2 - x 1 , or 5 - 2 . Rise/Run = (3 - 1)/(5 - 2) , or (2/3) . Therefore, m = ⅔ , or 0.67 ."

Note that each line goes uphill from left to right, and that the y value for each point gets larger as the x value gets larger. [6] X Research source A positive slope can be a positive integer like 3, 5, or 16. It can also be a fraction or decimal, like ½, 0.75, or 1.86. Look closely at the y = mx + b formulas listed with each line. Notice that m is always a positive number."

Note that each line goes downhill from left to right, and that the y value for each point gets smaller as the x value gets larger. [7] X Research source A negative slope can be a negative integer like -2, -6, or -19. It can also be a negative fraction or decimal, like -⅓, -0.9, or -2.21.

In the graph above, you’ll see that all the lines are completely flat. [8] X Research source A horizontal line always has a slope of m = 0 . This means the equation y = mx + b can be written as y = 0x + b . Since 0x = 0 , the equation gets simplified to y = b , with b being the y corresponding value for all values of x . The formulas for the line above all follow the same format: y = some number."

Vertical lines can’t be written with the formula y = mx + b . Instead, they are written as x = some number, and the vertical line passes through the x -axis at that exact number. [9] X Research source The image above shows lines with undefined slopes."
