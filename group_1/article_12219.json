      "content": "Level up your Pokémon. Red's Pokémon are extremely high leveled, with his pikachu topping the numbers at a whopping Lv.88. It is best advised that your Pokémon are at least Lv75. The higher the better. If your Pokémon are lower than this level, it is highly uncertain that you will succeed against Red."

      "title": "Navigate your way through Mt Silver beforehand.",
      "content": "Navigate your way through Mt Silver beforehand. Navigating through Mt. Silver is a good choice before actually meeting with Red for the battle. If you can easily traverse through the mountain without any hiccups or without any Pokémon fainting, you're almost ready to battle Red. If your Pokémon are not quite up to the mark, then consider training at Mt. Silver itself, as the wild Pokémon are pretty high leveled there as well."

      "title": "Build your team of Pokémon.",
      "content": "Build your team of Pokémon. Your average team to battle trainers and elite four might not cut it in front of Red. As such a specialized Pokémon is needed to beat all his six Pokémon. Consider choosing six Pokémon from the recommended list below. Recommended list: Steelix, Best against Red's Pikachu Electric Pokémon, Ampharos/Electabuzz recommended, against his Lapras/Blastoise Rock Pokémon, Tyranitar recommended. Your Starter Pokémon Fighting Pokémon/Mewtwo. Given Mewtwo's incredible power and versatile moveset, it's recommended to use him instead. A HM slave Pokémon/Filler Pokémon. This Pokémon may not have much use in the battle. Use it to revive a much more powerful Pokémon, or to heal other Pokémon. Alternatively, Use a powerful legendary Pokémon in this slot, such as Ho-Oh."

      "title": "Get to know Red's Pokémon.",
      "content": "Get to know Red's Pokémon. Red's Pokémon have some unique moves to help them counter their weaknesses.His Pokémon are: Pikachu . His highest level Pokémon and the one he leads with. It is Level 88 and holds a Light Ball, an item that doubles Pikachu's Attack and Special Attack, making it all the more dangerous. Fortunately, it succumbs easily to Ground type Pokémon, especially Steelix, since none of it's attacks can put a scratch on it. Red's Pikachu knows Volt Tackle, Iron Tail, Quick Attack, Thunderbolt, all of which simply fail against Steelix. The Pokémon he calls out next depends on which Pokémon you lead with. Snorlax . This might as well be his hardest Pokémon to defeat, given is colossal HP stat. It knows crunch, so it might be well advised to keep your Mewtwo away from him. Snorlax knows Giga Impact, Crunch, Shadow Ball and Blizzard. Blizzard is especially deadly since it has perfect accuracy and an increased chance of sustaining a freeze condition. A Strong fighting Pokémon should bring him down to its knees fairly quickly. Have a Pokémon with High HP and resistance to Ice moves, such as lapras can also work. Lapras . Being the only member in Red's team to be immune from hail damage, it may take a hit or two to bring Lapras down, given its massive HP stat. It knows Brine, Blizzard, Psychic and Body Slam. The best counter to Red's lapras is to have a Lapras of your own which knows Thunderbolt and preferably has the water absorb ability.Beware of body slam however, since it may easily render your Pokémon paralyzed. Venusaur . First of Red's three Kanto starters, Red's Venusaur is not a particular pain to battle and bring down. However it can be extremely annoying since it knows Sludge bomb, a move that can easily poison your Pokémon, and Sleep Powder, rendering your Pokémon useless for at least a few turns. It also knows Giga Drain and Frenzy Plant, which may very well take your Pokémon out, or two. Charizard . Second of Red's three Kanto starters, and one of his strongest Pokémon. Charizard has an especially high Attack and Special Attack stat, it also knows moves to abuse its ridiculous attack stats such as Flare Blitz, Blast Burn, Dragon Pulse and Air Slash. It is by no means a slouch either, being fairly quick. Rock Pokémon shut Charizard down instantly, especially Tyranitar with its sand stream ability. Blastoise .The last of his Kanto starter Pokémon. Not a particularly difficult Pokémon to defeat. Beware, however, of his Blizzard attack since it has perfect accuracy in hail. It knows Blizzard, Flash Cannon, Focus Blast and Hydro Cannon, but can be easily shut down with a strong electric Pokémon."
