This will create a chain circle and you will be working your stitches into the center of this circle. [1] X Research source To make the first chain , yarn over the hook twice and then pull the first loop through the second. Then, loop the yarn over again. Pull through the other loop. Continue until you have six stitches. [2] X Research source To slipstitch, insert the hook into the end of the chain. Then, yarn over and pull it through both loops. [3] X Research source"

This will complete one cluster of double crochet stitches and you will need to make a total of eight clusters or 16 double crochet stitches. [4] X Research source To double crochet , yarn over the hook, then insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over the hook again. Next, pull the yarn through the first stitch, and then yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches on the hook, then yarn over the hook again.

To do this, lay them along the stitches that you will be working with next and then crochet around them."
