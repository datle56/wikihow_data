If your phone isn’t picking up your voice, check all of them to see if they might be clogged with dust or dirt. Use a soft brush or a wooden or plastic toothpick to carefully clean out any clogs. There are two mics at the bottom of your iPhone, which look like a pair of holes on either side of the charger port. These are the mics you use the most (for things like phone calls and voice memos). There’s another mic at the top of your phone in the front, next to the speaker. This is used for things like speakerphone calls and front-facing video recordings. You’ll find another small microphone on the back of your phone, near the camera lenses. This is used for things like rear-facing video recordings."

Here’s how to test them: If people are having trouble hearing you during regular voice or FaceTime calls, test your bottom microphones by recording yourself in Voice Memo while speaking into the bottom of your phone. If the mic is working, you should be able to hear yourself clearly when you play back the recording. For issues with the speakerphone, try recording yourself in the Camera app. Make a video with the camera in selfie (front-facing) mode while speaking into the top of your phone. Then, reverse the camera and make a second video, still speaking at the top. If the top mics are working, you should get clear audio when you play these videos back. If your mics work fine during these tests, double-check your settings for the problematic apps. The problem might also be on the other person’s end. You should also make sure you didn’t accidentally mute yourself , which is easy to do in the Phone app as well as a lot of other voice or video chat apps."
