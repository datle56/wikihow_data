      "content": "Create structure. Teenage boys need structure in their lives, overseen and directed by their parents. This structure is not due to a lack of trust, but rather the biological fact that teenage boys haven’t yet developed the brain function to make safe choices based on the possible consequences. [1] X Research source As the parent, work with your teenage son to develop a daily routine for them. Make sure he’s involved in the process, but ensure the end result is what he needs."

      "title": "Ensure he gets lots of sleep.",
      "content": "Ensure he gets lots of sleep. Sleep is vital at any age, but teenagers need between 8 and 10 hours of sleep every night in order to be functional. Ideally, they should develop a regular sleep pattern. A sleep pattern can help increase the quality of the sleep they get. [2] X Research source Not getting enough sleep can slow down many of his abilities - such as the ability to learn, listen, concentrate and solve problems. It can also cause him to forget very simple items like someone’s phone number, or when homework is due. A lack of sleep can cause health problems, including acne. And can cause him to consume more unhealthy items like coffee or soda. Not getting enough sleep can also affect his behaviour, causing him to become irritable or angry faster than he would normally. He may end up being mean or rude to someone that he'll regret later."

      "title": "Make him feel like part of the family.",
      "content": "Make him feel like part of the family. The anger felt by a teenage boy may make him feel as if you (their parents) don’t trust him. You need to make him feel that he's trusted, and loved, while teaching him the importance of family and community. [3] X Research source Encourage him to participate in family events and volunteer in the community. Teach him about responsible financial management. Show him how to be respectful of other people, their rights and their property. Rather than telling him what you want him to do, ask him. When making rules, allow him to be a part of the process."

    {
      "title": "Communicate with him effectively.",
      "content": "Communicate with him effectively. Teen boys need more than simple verbal reminders or instructions in order to comprehend what is needed or required of them. In addition to verbally providing him with instructions, also do the following: [4] X Research source Make eye contact when providing instructions. Ask him to repeat what you’ve told them. Use short and simple sentences. Allow him to respond and ask questions. Don’t turn instructions into a lecture."

      "title": "Help him understand responsibility.",
      "content": "Help him understand responsibility. Responsibility can be learned in multiple ways. Many teenagers can learn responsibility from example - by watching and mimicking responsible people. But it can also be learned by making mistakes and incurring the consequences of irresponsible behaviour. As corny as it sounds, the statement “with power comes great responsibility” is very true. Teenagers need to learn that power, privilege and responsibility are all connected. The best place for them to learn this is from their parents. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick your battles. Teens, in general, change often. For example, their fashion changes with the trends. As a parent, you might not be able to keep up, and you might be shocked by some of the clothes your teen decides to wear. While you may be tempted to make rules regarding clothes, keep in mind that you may also want to save your battle for something much more important (like drinking, drugs, curfew, etc.).

      "content": "Understand why he's angry. Teenage boys experience surges in their hormones (testosterone), which can have an effect on their ability to feel fear and causes them to loose their inhibitions. In turn, this can cause them to engage in dangerous activities simply because they aren’t able to process how dangerous it is. And, they tend to allow their emotions, especially anger, to rule their reactions. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Realize friends have more influence than you. In the teenage years, your son’s friends will most likely have more influence over his actions and behaviours than you do. It’s not because he doesn't love or respect you, he's just trying to find his way in the world. [9] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "title": "Enforce the rules.",
      "content": "Enforce the rules. Teens are known for trying to push the limits, with you and with others. One way he may do this is by trying to get away with breaking the rules (e.g. how much later can he come home after curfew before you say something). It’s important that your enforce the rules you’ve made, or those limits will continue to be tested. It may also influence how your teen reacts to rules outside the home. You want to set a good example of how important rules are, and that they need to be followed."

Watch for signs of more serious problems, and seek professional help as soon as possible. [10] X Research source Extreme amounts of weight loss or weight gain. Ongoing sleep problems. Rapid, drastic and long-lasting changes in personality. Sudden change in close friends. Skipping school and falling grades. Any form of talk about suicide.

      "content": "Know that going through puberty can change their point of view. Boys normally go through puberty between the ages of 11 and 16. It is during these years that they experience most of their physical changes (including growing taller and developing muscle). During and after these years they’ll normally start to develop their sexuality. They’ll start to look at themselves, and others, differently. [11] X Research source If you’re a girl who is a friend of a teenage boy, he might start to treat you differently. On one hand because he’s experiencing changes in his emotions (and hormones). And on the other hand because your physical appearance is changing. This change doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong, it is an unfortunate part of growing up. Teen boys can also become confused or unsure about their sexual orientation. He may need your help and support to figure out who he is."

[12] X Research source Being able to read your friend's body language can help you determine the best method by which to deal with him. The ability to read body language starts with the ability to observe. Practice reading body language by observing people in everyday settings like the mall, the bus or the coffee shop. [13] X Research source Some examples of body language to watch out for in your friend: If you see your friend walking the hallways at school with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders hunched over, he’s probably feeling dejected. If your friend often plays with his hair or adjusts his clothes in some way, he’s probably nervous about something. If your friend is tapping or drumming his fingers against the table, or fidgeting a lot, he’s probably impatient about something. If your friend is talking to someone either with his arms crossed in front of him, or holding something in front of him, he’s being defensive."

[14] X Research source In other words, it’s understanding what it is like to be in their shoes. Empathy allows you to understand what someone else is going through, and sympathize with them. Being empathetic also helps build better relationships. [15] X Research source Being empathetic includes being able to listen. It is difficult to understand how someone is feeling, if you don’t allow them to talk. When listening to your friend talk, think about how you would feel in the situation he's describing. Chances are, if you would feel a certain way, so would he. Some examples of how to be empathetic to your friend: If your friend is telling you a story where he’s expressing a lot of different feelings, listen carefully and repeat back some of the things he’s telling you. It shows you’re listening and actually care about what he’s saying. If your friend is giving his opinion about something, listen without judgement. Then ask yourself why he might feel that way. Put yourself in his shoes before jumping in with your own opinion. If your friend had a particularly embarrassing experience that he doesn’t want to talk about, open up to him by telling him a story where you embarrassed yourself. Your friend will be more likely to share his own experiences if you’ve shared yours."

[16] X Research source Once you have gained an understanding for how your friend is feeling, you can determine what you need to do for him. Being compassionate is another way in which to build healthy relationships. [17] X Research source Reach out to your friend and ask him if he needs anything. If he doesn't know what he needs, think about what you’d like in his situation and offer that. Show an interest in your friend and use your curiosity to ask questions and get to know him better. Be kind to your friend when you know he's being teased or treated badly by others. Don’t become part of the gossip or teasing yourself."

Not allowing rumours and gossip from other people to sway how you feel about your friends. It also means making sacrifices for your friends when they need something. Loyalty and friendship might be more than keeping their secrets, it may mean breaking their confidence in order to help them. Loyalty may also mean telling your friend something he doesn't want to hear, by being honest. The truth may hurt, but it may be what he needs."

[18] X Research source However, when your peers (friends and otherwise) start to pressure you to do something you either do not want to do, or you know you should not do, it is considered a negative influence. [19] X Research source The teenage boy you’re friends with may start to feel and act awkward. Other may attempt to pressure him into doing things he doesn’t want to do.

Add a large amount of testosterone to the mix, and you have the possibility of aggression and other negative behaviour. [21] X Research source If your friend is arguing with you and appears to be becoming aggressive, stay calm. [22] X Research source If an argument becomes too heated, and it doesn’t appear that your friend is going to calm down, walk away. Tell him you’ll continue the conversation in 30 minutes. Give him the opportunity to calm down before resuming the conversation. If your friend ever becomes violent, your safety comes first. Remove yourself from the situation if possible. If that’s not possible, and you fear for your safety, call 911."

      "content": "Understand his weird behaviour around you. Between the changes that happen to girls and boys during puberty, girls actually have it a little easier. There’s a big time period when puberty can start for girls, but once it starts, it finishes up pretty quickly. Boys, on the other hand, can continue to grow and change into their 20s. This means that teenage boys are constantly feel awkward and disoriented. This is made especially worse if a boy finds himself growing at a rate slower than his friends. Boys experience a chance to their voice box in their teenage years, which will eventually make their voices deeper. But their voices, while this process is happening, may sound weird to them. They may be uncomfortable having a conversation with you simply because they’re embarrassed about their voice. This may not be something you want to think about, but one of the major changes a boy goes through in puberty is to his penis. The increase in size to his penis and scrotum, and the increase in hormone levels, can result in a lot of unwanted erections. Simply having a dirty thought about a girl might cause one. Unfortunately the boys can’t always control this, which may make them very uncomfortable about you. Boys begin to demonstrate more mature social skills around the age of 17. Before this, they may still be somewhat immature and childish. Because girls mature faster, they may find boys somewhat annoying until their mental maturation catches up."

Dates can be anything you want them to be - going to a coffee shop, theatre, restaurant, sports event, etc. Whatever you decide to do for the date, it should be something you both enjoy. If the first date goes well, go on a second date, and so on. If the date doesn’t go well, that’s okay, maybe you weren’t meant for each other."

Others feel the need to date in order to feel like they have control or power over someone else, or because they need the boy in order to gain some sort of status among their peers. None of these are good reasons to start dating. If these are the only reasons you can come up with as to why you want to date a boy, then it might not be a good idea to date him.

Eventually your true self will surface - you won’t be able to pretend to be someone else forever. You don’t have to date someone of equal intelligence. If you’re smarter than them, that’s okay.

If it doesn’t last, it could be because real life interferes with your ideal view of each other. Annoying habits become apparent, and character flaws become obvious. Real love takes time and effort.
