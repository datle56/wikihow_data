      "content": "You see apps you didn't install. According to Electronics Repair Specialist Bryzz Tortello, if you see an app you don't remember installing, it may be malware that got onto your phone through a malicious link or file download. These apps often look legitimate, so they can be hard to spot. If you see a suspicious app on your Home Screen or in your App Library, tap and hold the app icon until a pop-up menu appears, and then tap Remove App . Select Delete App in the dialog box. Alternatively, you can check for apps in the Settings menu. To do so, open the Settings menu. Scroll down and tap Apps to see if you see any apps in the Settings menu you didn't install. You can view a list of apps you have purchased in the App Store by opening the App Store and tapping your profile icon.

Battery life is expected to decline on older devices, and sometimes legitimate apps and features can use more battery power than others. However, if you notice your battery life drops all of a sudden, it could be a sign that your phone is infected with malware or viruses. You can check the health of your battery in the Settings menu. When your battery is fully charged open the Settings app and tap Battery . You will see a graph showing your battery level and how it corresponds to your activity throughout the day. [1] X Research source Tap Battery Health & Charging to see your battery’s current maximum capacity compared to what it was when your iPhone was new.

If you see any unknown or suspicious apps in this list that seem to be eating up a lot of battery, that may be the culprit."
