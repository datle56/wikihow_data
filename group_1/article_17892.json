      "content": "Wrap 18–24 in (46–61 cm) of [2] around your middle fingers. Tear off a long strand of floss so it’s easier to grip. Wind the ends of the floss around your middle fingers, but not so tightly that it digs into your skin or cuts off circulation. Leave a few inches of the floss unwrapped between your fingers. [1] X Research source Look for the American Dental Association (ADA) logo on the packaging when you’re choosing dental floss to ensure it’s safe to use. It’s okay if you accidentally use a shorter piece of floss, but it may be a little tougher to hold onto when you floss your back teeth. Wash your hands before you start flossing so germs and bacteria don’t get in your mouth."

      "content": "Hold a 1 in (2.5 cm) section taut with your index fingers and thumbs. Pinch the floss with your fingers and pull it tight so there isn’t any slack. That way, you’ll have a lot easier time getting it between your teeth. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Use a length of floss that’s easy for you to maneuver in your mouth. If you have a hard time flossing with a 1 in (2.5 cm) section, then try pulling 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of floss taut instead."

      "content": "Slide the floss between your teeth with back-and-forth motions. Start with your top front teeth since they’re the easiest to reach. Use a gentle rocking motion to guide the floss into the gap between your teeth, and slowly move the floss up towards your gums. [3] X Research source Be careful not to forcefully push the floss up since you could hurt your gums or make them bleed."

      "content": "Curve the floss into a C-shape around the base of your tooth. Pull the floss so it presses tightly against the side of your tooth. This helps you scrape the most plaque and buildup stuck to your tooth so you can get them clean. [4] X Research source Gently move the floss up further toward your gum line as far as you comfortably can go. [5] X Research source Avoid pushing the floss into your gums so far that it hurts."

[6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Work the floss gently between your gums and your tooth to break apart the buildup. Use 8–10 back-and-forth strokes to completely scrape off the plaque. Rub the floss against the side of your tooth as well. When you’re finished cleaning the sides of both teeth, slowly pull the floss out from between them. [7] X Research source If you haven’t flossed in a while, it’s completely normal for your gums to bleed a little bit. After a few days of consistent flossing, the bleeding will go away. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Dental Association World's largest dental professional organization and advocate for proper oral health Go to source If you’re still bleeding after 3–5 days of flossing, talk to a dentist to see if you’re dealing with any other gum issues.

Wrap the section of floss you just used around your middle finger and pinch a clean 1 in (2.5 cm) section between your fingers. Floss between all of your top teeth before moving onto your bottom teeth. Make sure you loop the floss around the backs of your rear molars to clean them too. [10] X Research source If you have trouble reaching the teeth in the back of your mouth, secure your floss into a floss holder . Hold onto the handle so you can reach your molars. Follow the same pattern each time you floss your teeth to make sure you don’t miss any spots. When you finish flossing, ball it up and toss it in the trash."

      "content": "Use waxed floss to prevent it from breaking or tangling. Waxed floss has a coating that makes it easier to slide between the tight spaces between your braces and teeth. It also doesn’t shred as easily against the metal brackets or bands, so it won’t fray when you’re flossing between your braces . [11] X Research source"

Guide the end of your floss under your brace’s wire between your 2 front teeth. Once you pull the floss through, gently guide it between your teeth and rub it back and forth to remove plaque or leftover food debris. [12] X Research source If you have trouble slipping the floss between the wire and your teeth, loop it through a floss threader first. Then, feed the floss threader under the wire and pull it through with the floss. If you can’t get standard floss between your teeth, try using an orthodontic flosser that has a narrow tip on the end. Guide the tip under your braces wire to remove plaque and food debris. After you finish flossing, brush your teeth to clean off any plaque you loosened up."

To use a water flosser , fill the tank with water, position the sprayer's tip between your teeth, and turn it on. Spray the water along your gum line to get rid of the plaque and buildup. Many experts say that you can’t use water flossers in place of brushing and flossing since they remove all the plaque and buildup.
