      "content": "Threads does not show you who has viewed your profile. Likewise, other users cannot see if you have viewed their profile. This is to protect the privacy of other users. While it may be useful for you to know who has viewed your profile, other users may not want you to know. It may even discourage them from viewing your profile. If you are worried about what other people might see on your Threads profile, don't share any information you don't want others to know about. While Threads doesn't show who viewed your profile, it does show who is following you, and who has liked, commented, shared, or quoted your Threads posts. You can use this information to make an educated guess as to who has viewed your profile."

      "content": "It is unlikely that third-party apps can show who has viewed your profile. You may have seen some apps that claim to be able to show you who has viewed your profile on Threads. It is unlikely these apps work, and it is strongly recommended that you do not use them, as they may endanger your account. Providing your Threads or Instagram log-in information to a third-party app can compromise your account and result in your Threads or Instagram account getting hacked. Using a third-party app to see who has viewed your profile is also against Threads' privacy policy and may result in your account getting banned."
