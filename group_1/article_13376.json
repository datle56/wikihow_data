Also make sure that you choose your foundation according to: The climate of the place where you stay (in colder regions, you'll need more hydrating foundations while in hotter regions you'll need long stay foundations with more SPF). The time of day. Avoid wearing heavy coverage foundations during the day as they can look a bit too overwhelming during this time (they are better for night-outs). Your age.

      "content": "Do contouring and highlighting as necessary. Even if you are not an expert in this area, the one thing you can easily do is make your nose look slimmer and smaller. Take a dark brownish lip color or eye shadow and with your finger tip apply a very small amount of the product on the sides of the nose bridge. Smudge it well so that no obvious lines are visible anymore. [3] X Expert Source Stephanie Navarro Professional Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 22 June 2020. Try choosing something in a matte finish, if not you can choose something creamy.

Line the inner half of the eyes with green eyeliner and the outer half with blue. Then take black eyeliner and draw a very fine line close to the eyelashes to add definition to the eyes. You can use any two color combinations of eyeliners, not just blue and green. It will depend on your personal style and what you are comfortable with."

      "content": "Groom the eyebrows to shape your face and eyes. Your eyebrow grooming routine may include waxing/ tweezing/ trimming or threading. Although some people like to leave their brows alone and keep them natural. If you'd rather not trim, you can still use some clear eyebrow gel to brush through the brows for a neater, more maintained look. Use a good brow pencil that matches your natural brow hair in color and make small strokes with it to fill in any gaps in your brows. Then finish by brushing through with a clear brow gel. Never use pure black, even with dark hair. It almost always looks out of place. Don't use long, harsh strokes to fill the brows. Use small, light-handed (as light as you can manage without dropping the pencil) strokes to achieve the most natural looking strokes that resemble real brow hair."

To give the illusion of heavier lower lashes, you can use an eyeliner to draw tiny dots and dashes along the lower lash line, then smudge these dots and dashes a little bit for a gradual look. Avoid using a waterproof mascara unless you'll be going in the water or humid regions. They are more taxing to take off than regular mascaras, you end up rubbing your eyelashes a bit too hard and breaking them."

Before application, make sure your lips are well exfoliated and moisturized. Otherwise, you'll see flaky lips that aren't attractive no matter how pretty the lip color. If your eyeliners consist of cooler shades such as blue and green, then make sure that your lip color also has a cooler undertone to it, like a darker red. If you've avoided eye shadows or coloring, find a lip coloring that matches well with your blush for a truly put together look. [4] X Research source"

Your secret weapon is going to be healthy, hydrated skin, which makes your naturally beautiful skin glow and shine.

Using a finely-pointed eye-liner, draw a nice, clean line right on the eyelash line on top of your eye. Then make a similar line on the bottom eyelid, but only do the outer 1/3 of the lower lash. If you have time, use a pencil smudging brush to smooth out and blend the line, especially towards the outer edge. If you want to use eyeshadow, keep it light. Apply it first, then use a dark eyeliner to add the essential contrast to your eyes and make them pop. Use liquid eyeliner if you find it easier."
