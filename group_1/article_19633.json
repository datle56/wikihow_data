      "title": "Soak a rag in ammonia and place it near the squirrels' nesting spot.",
      "content": "Soak a rag in ammonia and place it near the squirrels' nesting spot. The strong smell of the ammonia will irritate the squirrels and make them view the attic as a bad place to nest. This may get them to leave on their own. [1] X Research source Be sure to don a mask and protective gloves when using ammonia, as it can irritate your skin, mouth, throat, lungs, and eyes. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you don’t have ammonia, use another strong household cleaner instead. Pepper-based and mint-scented repellents may also be effective. [3] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019."

      "content": "Turn on bright lights in your attic. Use the overhead light or install temporary lighting if there’s no light in the attic. The squirrels will feel uncomfortable and exposed under the lights, so they’ll likely leave your attic in favor of a new home. [4] X Research source Just like with ammonia, it’s best to use this repellent alongside other techniques to increase your chances of success. If you know exactly where the squirrel nest is, direct the light toward the nest. In this case, you only need a flashlight to get the job done."

      "title": "Disturb the squirrels with a loud radio placed in your attic.",
      "content": "Disturb the squirrels with a loud radio placed in your attic. Turn the radio to a talk station so the sound of human voices fills the attic. The squirrels will likely decide your home is unsuitable, causing them to go elsewhere. [5] X Research source If you find the nest, put the radio as close as you can to the nest. You don’t need to turn up the radio loud enough for the entire house to hear. As long as the sound fills the attic, the radio is loud enough. Avoid ultrasonic pest repellers. These devices plug into electrical outlets and emit a high-pitched sound intended to drive away squirrels (and other unwanted pests). Unfortunately, they have little science backing them, and are often ineffective. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a commercial squirrel repellent for an easy option.",
      "content": "Use a commercial squirrel repellent for an easy option. Choose either a natural or chemical repellent. Natural repellents often use the scent of predator urine to scare away the squirrels. Read the label on your repellent and apply it directly to the area where the squirrels seem to frequent, such as near entry holes, around urine and feces, and where you see tracks. Make sure you’re using the product as directed. Find a squirrel repellent at a hardware store or online. Look for products that list capsaicin as one of the active ingredients. This chemical compound comes from chili peppers. It's what makes them so hot, and squirrels, like many people, hate it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid using mothballs, as they can be toxic to humans and pets. Additionally, they may not work against squirrels and have a very strong smell that many people find offensive. It’s safer and more effective to use one of the proven squirrel repellents. [8] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. In some areas, mothballs are illegal to use against squirrels, so check your local laws if you’d like to use them anyway."

      "title": "Place a squirrel trap near the entry point or where the squirrel is active.",
      "content": "Place a squirrel trap near the entry point or where the squirrel is active. You’ll have more success catching a squirrel if you place the trap in a location the squirrel frequents. However, they aren’t as likely to enter a trap that’s placed in the middle of the floor, so position it in a corner or near the wall. To find the best spot for your trap, look for the hole where it enters your home or a place where you’ve noticed tracks, urine, or feces. Choose a trap that catches the squirrels for release or a trap designed to kill the squirrels. Before you attempt to trap a squirrel, contract a wildlife specialist in your area to ensure it's safe and legal to do so. [9] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. Find a squirrel trap at a local hunting and fishing supply store, hardware store, or online. Make sure your trap is specifically intended for squirrels, as the wrong type of trap may cause unintended harm to the squirrel or allow it to escape. If you’re handy, build your own trap. However, some areas have laws concerning squirrel trapping, so it’s best to use commercial cages that comply with regulations."

      "title": "Bait the trap with peanuts or peanut butter.",
      "content": "Bait the trap with peanuts or peanut butter. Put the bait inside the trap, far enough away from the opening that the squirrel can’t reach in and pull out the bait. Then, set the trap. The squirrel will likely enter the trap to get the bait, triggering the door. [10] X Research source If you don’t have peanuts or peanut butter, use walnuts, soda crackers, bread crusts, or apple slices as squirrel bait. If you’re using a catch and release trap, you’ll need to take the squirrel outside as soon as you can after catching it. A deathtrap will kill the squirrel humanely after the trap is triggered."

      "content": "Remove a live squirrel from your home and release it. Put on thick, heavy work gloves before handling the cage. When you're ready to release the squirrel, put the cage on the ground at your release site. Then, slowly lift the cage door using your gloved hand or a string tied to the door. As the squirrel exits, keep a distance between you and the squirrel so it doesn’t bite or scratch you. [11] X Research source Check your local laws and ordinances to find out if you are able to remove the squirrel from your property, or if you have to release it near your home. Although it’s best to release the trapped squirrel at least 10 miles (16 km) from your home so it’s less likely to find a way back into your attic, this is not always permitted."

Take the cage to your outdoor trash can, then transfer the dead squirrel to the trash. [12] X Research source You may want to seal the dead squirrel in a trash bag to minimize the smell. As another alternative, bury the dead squirrel on your property. However, this will become very laborious if there are multiple squirrels in your attic."

Then, use a chainsaw to remove the branches, effectively cutting off access to your attic. [13] X Research source Squirrels will use tree branches as a bridge to your attic. They may even live in the tree most of the time but venture into your attic for nesting supplies or comfort during bad weather. If you aren’t experienced in cutting tree branches, hire a professional to do it. Not only could you get injured, you could also accidentally cause damage to your roof."

[14] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. Check both the exterior and interior of your home for visible holes. Then, use animal-resistant patches to cover the holes, which will prevent the squirrels from coming through them. [15] X Research source Avoid patching large holes with wood or foam sealant, as the squirrels will still break through. Patch any large holes with metal flashing or a steel screen, and attach them with a power screw driver to ensure they're tightly affixed. If you’re not sure how to repair the holes, hire a general contractor to do it for you. Ask around for a referral to a good general contractor, or conduct an online search to find one in your area."

Use a power driver and screws to affix mesh screens or metal flashing over any gaps around your wiring or plumbing. Fill in the space around the plumbing or electrical wiring with caulk or canned spray foam . This will help reduce the risk of the squirrels squeezing though the holes or gnawing around the gaps to make them bigger. [17] X Research source Since squirrels are rodents, they can squeeze through very small holes. Additionally, they can gnaw around an existing hole to make it larger."

      "content": "Put a chimney cap or wire mesh over your chimney. Measure the perimeter of the top of your chimney, called the crown, as well as the size of your flue. Purchase a chimney cap or mesh screen that is larger than the flue but smaller than the crown. Clean the top of your chimney to remove any debris, then fit the chimney cap or mesh over the hole, making sure there are no gaps around it. Use a drill to screw the chimney cap or mesh screen in place. [18] X Research source This allows the smoke to escape your chimney but prevents squirrels from using your chimney as an entrance to your home. Make sure you don't leave debris around the chimney, as this could become a fire hazard. Clean your chimney cap or mesh screen every few months during use, as well as before winter arrives. Soot buildup can cause damage or may become a hazard. [19] X Research source If you live in the UK, there are rules and regulations for how chimney caps are installed. Once it's in place, a building inspector will need to check your chimney cap to make sure it's installed correctly. For this reason, it's best to hire a professional to do it. [20] X Research source"

Put a handful of peanuts, some peanut butter, crackers, or apple slices at the end of the tunnel or just outside of it. This will entice the squirrel to make its exit quickly. You don’t need to use bait, as the squirrel will eventually leave to collect more food. However, using bait can encourage the squirrel to leave your home sooner."
