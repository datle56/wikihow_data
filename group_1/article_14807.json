LaReau Wardrobe Consultant & Stylist Expert Interview. 31 January 2022. Shorts aren’t the best option unless they come past your fingertips when you put your hands down at your side.

      "content": "Consider covering up tattoos or body piercings. Unless you know that your boyfriend’s family won’t mind that you have tattoos or piercings, it’s best to keep them covered. Wear long sleeves to cover any tattoos on your arms, or take the jewelry out of visible piercings just for the gathering if possible. [3] X Research source It’s helpful to let your boyfriend’s parents get to know you better before revealing tattoos and body piercings to avoid any immediate judgments. If your tattoos or piercings can’t be covered up, still opt for modest clothing, such as high necklines and long sleeves or pants, to show that you’re respectful."

      "content": "Wear form-fitting clothing that isn’t too tight or too baggy. While it’s perfectly fine to wear clothing that’s tailored to your body, avoid garments that cling to your skin tightly. This includes super tight tank tops, bodycon dresses, or tight skinny jeans. Baggy clothing like pants that hang down below your waist or sweaters and shirts that are too big for your figure should be avoided as well. Choose clothing that is comfortable and that you can move around in easily. [4] X Expert Source Taissha G. LaReau Wardrobe Consultant & Stylist Expert Interview. 31 January 2022."

      "content": "Opt for dressier outfits instead of leisurely wear. Things that you might wear around the house or to workout in aren’t great options for making a first impression with your boyfriend’s parents. Instead of wearing T-shirts or athletic wear, pick out blouses or shirts with buttons, as well as nicer slacks or dresses. [7] X Research source Avoid shirts with graphics on them, and instead opt for a shirt in a solid color or light pattern. Wear leggings only if they’re under a dress or skirt—not as pants."

Ask your boyfriend about the details of the gathering, such as the time of day and location, so you’re sure to dress appropriately. For example, if you’re meeting them at a soccer game, you might wear jeans and a sweater, while a dress and flats would be perfect for a nice dinner."

If you’ll be outdoors or just want to put together a casual, warm outfit, a sweater and jeans are a great option. In warmer weather, a short-sleeve blouse looks great too. Pick out a pair of fitted jeans without holes or rips, and wear them with a modest sweater or blouse in colors like blue, green, or orange. Finish off the look by wearing a pair of comfortable flats or low heels, depending on the occasion. [9] X Research source For example, you might wear blue fitted jeans, a pastel green sweater, and black flats. Opt for jean capris and a short-sleeve white, yellow, or blue blouse in summer weather.

Wear a T-shirt dress with a jean jacket over it for a casual meet-up with your boyfriend’s parents, or get dressier by pairing a sundress with a simple sweater.
