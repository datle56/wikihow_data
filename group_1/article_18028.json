Do this slowly and in a reverent manner, showing your respect toward the flag. [1] X Research source Gather the flag as it gets close to the ground. Slide the flag off the line, then secure the line in place on the pole. It's best to fold the flag near the pole to reduce the risk of dropping all or part of it."

[10] X Research source For example, veterans' families often receive a flag following the veteran's funeral. This flag will be placed over the coffin, then folded to be presented to the family.
