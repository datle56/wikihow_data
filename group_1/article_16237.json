      "content": "Identify the coefficient, variable, and degree of each term. A coefficient is the number in front of a variable, which is multiplied by the variable. [1] X Research source The variable is the unknown value, usually denoted by x {\\displaystyle x} or y {\\displaystyle y} . [2] X Research source . The degree refers to the exponent of the variable. For example, a second-degree term has a value to the second power ( x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} ) and a fourth-degree term has a value to the fourth power ( x 4 {\\displaystyle x^{4}} ). [3] X Research source For example, in the polynomial 36 x 4 − 100 x 2 {\\displaystyle 36x^{4}-100x^{2}} , the coefficients are 36 {\\displaystyle 36} and 100 {\\displaystyle 100} , the variable is x {\\displaystyle x} , and the first term ( 36 x 4 {\\displaystyle 36x^{4}} ) is a fourth-degree term, and the second term ( 100 x 2 {\\displaystyle 100x^{2}} ) is a second-degree term."

[4] X Research source If there is a factor common to both terms of the polynomial, factor this out. [5] X Research source For example, the two terms in the polynomial 36 x 4 − 100 x 2 {\\displaystyle 36x^{4}-100x^{2}} have a greatest common factor of 4 x 2 {\\displaystyle 4x^{2}} . Factoring this out, the problem becomes 4 x 2 ( 9 x 2 − 25 ) {\\displaystyle 4x^{2}(9x^{2}-25)} ."

      "content": "Determine whether the terms are perfect squares. If you factored out a greatest common factor, you are only looking at the terms that remain inside the parentheses. A perfect square is the result of multiplying an integer by itself. [6] X Research source A variable is a perfect square if its exponent is an even number. You can only factor using the difference of squares if each term in the polynomial is a perfect square. For example, 9 x 2 {\\displaystyle 9x^{2}} is a perfect square, because ( 3 x ) ( 3 x ) = 9 x 2 {\\displaystyle (3x)(3x)=9x^{2}} . The number 25 {\\displaystyle 25} is also a perfect square, because ( 5 ) ( 5 ) = 25 {\\displaystyle (5)(5)=25} . Thus, you can factor 9 x 2 − 25 {\\displaystyle 9x^{2}-25} using the difference of squares formula."

The difference of squares only applies to these polynomials, and not those in which addition is used. For example, you cannot factor 9 x 2 + 25 {\\displaystyle 9x^{2}+25} using the difference of squares formula, because in this polynomial you are finding a sum, not a difference."
