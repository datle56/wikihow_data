      "content": "Make a list of your traits. Traits are the parts of you that don’t usually change much over time. [1] X Research source They are characteristics about you that may be positive, while others might be a bit more negative. Your personality is the sum of all these traits and characteristics and is what makes you a unique person. Listing your traits can help you define your personality. For example, you might write that you are sensitive, caring, stubborn, determined, ambitious, hard-working, and dependable. Use words that describe how you think, behave, and feel in general. [2] X Research source For instance, you could include: calm, a night owl, sociable, a good planner, or helpful on your list. Look at lists of personality traits online that others have used to define themselves. See which ones are applicable to you, then add words of your own. Include words that family and friends frequently use to describe you. For example, if they are always telling you that you’re comical, put it on the list. You may even ask family and friends to help you find descriptive words for yourself."

      "content": "Examine your attitude and actions. Some studies suggest that your personality influences how you approach situations and your outlook on life. [3] X Research source Other research suggests that personality traits influence behavior. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source So, look at your attitude and actions to understand how to define your personality. Consider your attitude towards change. Write about a major change in your life. For example, you may write that you felt nervous and worried when you moved. Think about how you handle challenges and obstacles. Then consider how likely you are to take risks, and how you respond to failure or set-backs. Write down the personality traits that come to mind. For example, think about how you react when someone is rude to you. You might write, “I calmly tell them to stop and try to figure out what’s wrong.” Think about the things you do. Would you describe them as individual activities or social? For example, gardening, reading, and painting are individual activities. Social activities are things like team sports and participating in clubs and organizations. Reader Poll: We asked 144 wikiHow readers what strategy they find most effective for maintaining self-awareness in social situations, and 53% of them said regularly reflecting on the interaction afterward. [Take Poll] Reflecting on your interactions is a great way to determine how you react to different things."

      "content": "Pick three characteristics that summarize you. Think about three words that could be used to describe most of the things on your list. These three words will help you define your personality. [5] X Research source Look over your list and find the words that could be used as synonyms, or to describe some of the other words. For instance, ‘ambitious’ could be a word to summarize being determined, hardworking, and goal-oriented. As another example, energetic, fun-loving, independent, and thrill-seeking could be described by the word ‘adventurous’. Identify those three (no more than five) words that would tell someone about you in general if that was all they had to go on. You might determine that you are outgoing, active, and easy-going, for example."

      "content": "Try the Big Five to describe your personality.This popular and well-researched method, also called CANOE or OCEAN, categorizes your personality in terms of a combination of five areas or dimensions: conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism , openness, and extroversion. Using this system can help you define your personality using terms that have been researched and that many people understand. For each trait, consider whether you would describe yourself as ‘high’ or ‘low’ on that dimension or more or less like that trait. Compare your list of traits, attitudes, and behaviors to the descriptions of the Big Five personality types to help define your personality."

      "title": "Determine how conscientious you are.",
      "content": "Determine how conscientious you are. If you’re highly focused on your goals, organized, detailed-oriented, considerate of your impact on others, and reliable you can consider yourself conscientious. [6] X Research source Conscientious people are less impulsive and more deliberate in their actions and plans. On the other hand, you may be low in conscientiousness if you are more impulsive and spontaneous. For example, if you’re more conscientious and are invited on a spur-of-the-moment vacation, you would think about how much it will cost or how it benefits you. A less conscientious person would just go on the vacation without worrying so much about these things."

      "title": "Examine how agreeable you are.",
      "content": "Examine how agreeable you are. You are likely to define yourself as agreeable if you are kind, helpful, trusting, or if you think about ways to bring people together and make things run smoothly. [7] X Research source You might describe yourself as less agreeable, or disagreeable, if you are more skeptical and suspicious of people, and look out more for your own interests, or if you find that you often come into conflict with others. If you tell yourself things like, “I can cut some of the tension in this situation and help us compromise” you are probably high in agreeableness. Thinking things like, “They probably have a secret motive. I’ll just do what’s best for me” is characteristic of people that are more disagreeable."

      "title": "Look for signs that you might be neurotic.",
      "content": "Look for signs that you might be neurotic. Be honest and ask yourself if you are very emotional or sensitive, moody, or unpredictable and emotionally intense. If you cry frequently, apologize unnecessarily for things you do or say, or find friendly physical contact stressful, these may be signs that you are high in neuroticism. People that are lower in this dimension are calmer, less excitable, and more emotionally stable. For instance, if everyday things like traffic jams or missing the bus completely ruin your mood and your day, you may be neurotic. If you aren’t bothered by small nuisances and daily challenges, you are probably low on neuroticism."

      "title": "Ask yourself if you are open to experiences.",
      "content": "Ask yourself if you are open to experiences. If you have an open personality, you are okay with change, like new experiences, and learning new things. You are flexible, view life as a chance to explore, and define your personality by your curiosity. [8] X Research source You might be more closed if you are more conservative and prefer routine and tradition to new experiences. If you say to yourself, “This is a chance to have a new experience that could turn into an epic adventure with amazing people” you are likely open. If you would rather stick with the safe, conservative plan rather than try the risky one, you are probably more closed."

      "title": "Decide if you are extroverted.",
      "content": "Decide if you are extroverted. You could define yourself as extroverted if you are outgoing, enjoy spending time with others, and like doing things in public. On the other hand, if you are more quiet, enjoy time alone, and less energetic you would define yourself as an introvert. For example, you are extroverted if you think to yourself, “How can this be fun? What new people can I meet?” when your friend tells you about a party. You may be introverted if you would prefer to stay home and read or work on a craft project than go to the party. Keep in mind that shyness and introversion are not the same. You may be good with others but prefer to be alone, or you may want to be social but struggle finding common ground. Look at your desire to be with others as an indicator."

For example, if you tend to get very stressed and extremely upset when something makes you even a little late, you may be Type A. Or, for instance, you might be Type A if you would skip a night out with your friends without a thought in order to finish a report. Check your list of traits to see if you mentioned words like: hard-working, driven, busy, focused, or impatient to see if you are Type A."

      "content": "Explore the Myers-Briggs system. This personality system is based on research by the psychologist Carl Jung and is widely used. [13] X Research source The Myers-Briggs categorizes personality along four dimensions. Each dimension has two opposite preferences associated with it. Combining your preference from each of the four dimensions will define your personality according to one of 16 possible types. The four dimensions are: introversion/extraversion (I/E); sensing/intuition (S/N); thinking/feeling (T/F); and judging/perceiving (J/P). Compare your personal list of traits to your preferences on each of the four dimensions on the Myers-Briggs . For example, does your list indicate you are more of an ‘I’ or an ‘E’? Do you have more words related to thinking or feeling? You might, for instance, be a ISFP (introverted, sensing, feeling, perceiving) personality based on the traits on your list."

Evaluate your list of traits to see if they can be described by one of the nine types of personality according to the Enneagram system. Look for clues that you are mostly a: reformer, helper, achiever, individualist, investigator, loyalist, enthusiast, challenger, or peacemaker. For example, if you see traits on your list like: mediator, problem-solver, and diplomatic you may be a peacemaker.
