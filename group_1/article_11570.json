      "content": "Accept that she's taller than you. There is nothing either of you can do to change the fact that she's taller. Think about what is really important in a relationship—Do you get along? Do you have chemistry? Do you have similar interests? Don't let something superficial and beyond your control ruin what could potentially be a wonderful, fulfilling partnership. [1] X Research source “Stop making it a big deal. Stop fixating, and stop bringing it up. There’s no point in directing your energy and focus toward a physical quality you cannot change,” notes dating coach Laura Bilotta. [2] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. Think about who actually cares about your height difference. Are you afraid people are going to laugh or make comments? Don't let other people's pettiness stop you from finding happiness. Simply put, don’t worry about what others think. If you truly can't get over the fact that she's taller than you, you may have some soul-searching to do. Ask yourself why it matters to you and if it truly makes a difference in the quality of your connection with someone. If she turns you down because you're not tall enough, then forget about her. If she's not willing to see beyond a superficial difference, you're better off finding someone else."

You may think it's cute or cheeky to tease her about her height—opening with a line like \"What's the weather like up there?\" or \"Wow, do you play basketball? Can you dunk?\"—is going to make you look insecure and make her feel awkward or even angry. [3] X Research source She knows she's tall, and she's probably heard those lame jokes a million times. Make it clear you're interested in getting to know her and her personality and that you're not hung up on something superficial like her height. It’s just as important for her to feel confident about herself as it is for you. Unless she brings it up first, don't mention her height until you've gotten to know each other. Then you can tell her how her long legs are super sexy. [4] X Research source If she addresses your height difference, tell her you don't think it's an issue. Let her know you think it's an asset, but it's not something you spend a lot of time worrying about. [5] X Research source You can treat a tall woman's height as you would a woman with an ample chest; even if it's part of her appeal, you would never walk up to a woman with large breasts and ask about her bra size.

      "content": "Don’t let negative comments about height get you down. Whether you’re dating a taller girl or are attracted to tall girls in general, friends and acquaintances may have a problem with it, even if you don’t. They may poke fun or make jokes about you being shorter than her or make judgments. Comments like, “Does she spoon you?” or “Does she always win at basketball” get old fast. Don’t let them dissuade you from dating someone you really like just because people you associate with don’t have the same preferences. [7] X Research source Random strangers sometimes feel the need to make comments about a couple where the man is shorter than the woman. They’re probably just jealous, so be proud of who you are and who your partner is (and how good you look together). Confidence is everything when you’re dating, so it’s important to focus on yourself, the other person, and your relationship. Spending time obsessing over what other people think doesn’t leave time and energy for your relationship, so enjoy your partner instead."

You can also make a woman feel safe, respected, and desired.” [8] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. The most attractive characteristic of a man or woman is self-confidence and feeling good about who you are. If you are insecure about your height and constantly remind her of how much taller she is, or if you ask her not to wear heels because it makes you feel uncomfortable, you're going to look like you're not secure with who you are. It may also make her feel like you think something is wrong with her. Never underestimate yourself and who you are when you’re trying to get with a girl ) you like. [9] X Research source Dating a tall woman will actually make you appear more confident. If you're a short guy and you're comfortable with your tall lady wearing heels, it will be clear that you feel good about yourself and your relationship and that you have a great connection that is greater than outdated taboos. Don't try to always stand in a position that makes you seem taller than her (on a curb or one step above her on an escalator). She’ll notice what you are doing, and it’ll suggest to her that you’re not comfortable with yourself or the fact that she's taller. [10] X Research source"

Even if you’re comfortable being shorter than your girl, she may still feel awkward or worry that you are self-conscious about it. Once she knows you like her for her personality, let her know that you think her height is just as cool as her wicked sense of humor, her ability to quote your favorite movies, her incredible math skills, and all the other things that make her special. Don't try to get her to slouch so she appears shorter or ask her to wear only flats. Compliment her height and her long legs. Remind her that her stature only adds to her appeal."

Most women will say they prefer a taller man because it makes them feel more feminine since she's probably heard most of her life that to be bigger than a man in any way is a turn-off. [11] X Research source If a tall woman has any insecurities about her height, it usually boils down to feeling like she's intimidating or \"mannish.\" [12] X Research source Make her feel feminine by putting your hand on the small of her back or around her waist. Put your arm around her when you're sitting next to each other. Don't discourage her from wearing heels if she wants to. She may appreciate it if you behave with a certain classic masculinity. Be assertive (but not rude or controlling). Make the first move and kiss her first. [13] X Research source You can still be the big spoon while cuddling, you may just need to adjust how you would normally lie next to her. Or why not take a turn as the little spoon?"

If you’re having issues with feeling short, you can try and dress taller—it’s important to remember that you should only do this if you and your girlfriend have discussed the height difference and you both still feel uncomfortable with it. If you start trying to be sneaky and wear shoes that make you look taller just so you feel better, she's going to notice and think you're insecure. Wear boots or sneakers with a thicker sole. You can also wear lifts inside your shoe, which make you appear taller without having to wear a heeled shoe. Wear tailored clothes with vertical stripes. Loose, baggy clothes can make you appear smaller or shorter in stature, and vertical stripes will make your body appear longer. [16] X Research source Style your hair in a pompadour or spike it up with gel. The key is to keep it short on the sides but leave lots of volume up top. Stand up straight! Not only does good posture just look better, but you may find you're not that much shorter than your girlfriend after all. Keep your shoulders back and your head high. You'll even look more confident. [17] X Research source"
