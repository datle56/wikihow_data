Before you can request a feedback revision, you must have resolved the issue the buyer had that caused him to leave the negative feedback. The option to have feedback revised is only available after the problem that was the subject of the original feedback has been resolved to the buyer's satisfaction. You also may ask a buyer to revise feedback if you believe the comment was left by accident. For example, if a buyer leaves negative feedback because they purchased a tea pot from you and it arrived broken, but you do not sell tea pots, you might ask the buyer to alter that feedback since it wasn't intended for you.

These problems are tracked in your transaction defect rate, which is the percentage of your sales that had defects. [19] X Research source Every Wednesday, eBay reviews defects and automatically removes those that meet the requirements outlined in the company's feedback policy. [20] X Research source Feedback that qualifies for automatic removal includes problems that happened as a direct result of an eBay site issue or error, or transactions for which the buyer initiated a PayPal Purchase Protection case or an eBay Money Back Guarantee request and the case was decided in the seller's favor.
