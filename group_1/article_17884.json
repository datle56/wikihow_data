      "content": "Make sure she’s interested in you to avoid coming off as creepy. In general, a girl will appreciate a flirty joke if she’s into you, but feel uncomfortable if she doesn't like you. Before shooting your shot, think of how she acts when she’s around you. Some signs that she might like you include: having open body language, making eye contact, trying to touch you, mirroring your movements, fidgeting around you, or giving you compliments. [2] X Research source If your joke falls flat, don’t try to explain it to her. Instead, make a joke about the joke! Tell her it was terrible but that she was making you nervous. Dating coach and matchmaker Laura Bilotta says, “one of the best ways to put someone at ease and build a connection is to be willing to laugh at yourself.” If she reacts positively, ask her open-ended questions to keep the conversation going. Then, move it into a more flirtatious zone to show her you’re romantically interested. When you’re both relaxed and having fun, you could ask for her number and invite her on a date."

If you’re flirting with a girl on a dating app, Bilotta says you should “use a positive and respectful tone” and “be authentic and genuine.”"
