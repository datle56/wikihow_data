However, there’s conflicting evidence whether this cat breed actually exists! Previous breeders have claimed their cats are Ashura, but DNA evidence has shown that these cats are actually Savannah cats. So, Ashura cats might just be a scam to sell Savannah cats at an even higher price. [2] X Research source"

Popular, rare, or purebred cats are often more expensive than other types because they're highly sought-after and may be more difficult to breed. Breeding itself can also be costly, as the breeder has to pay for breeding rights, and pedigreed cats must be registered, which the breeder has to pay for.

[21] X Research source For instance, a Ragdoll or Persian might be a great option if you have children at home and want a less active cat.

Look up breeders or rescues in your area, or go to TICA’s or CFA’s website . Check that the breeder or rescue is registered with a reputable association, like TICA. Then, read through reviews from previous adopters to see if people recommend using the organization. [22] X Research source If possible, visit the breeder or rescue in person. This way, you can check out the certification and conditions yourself. Be wary of breeders or rescues that have little online presence, aren’t officially registered with a cat association, or seem to offer very low prices. This can be a sign that the organization is a scam (i.e., selling you a “purebred” cat when it’s not) or they don’t treat their cats well. Note : If the price of a purebred cat is out of your price range, there are plenty of sweet kitties available to adopt at animal shelters. Purebred cats occasionally show up at shelters, too."

Ask the organization how the cat was raised, what they’re like, and what kind of home they’d like. Then, make sure to get the cat’s general health history, vaccination history, spayed/neutered status, and dietary and care needs. [23] X Research source While cat breeds share certain characteristics, every cat is different. It’s important to learn about the cat you want to adopt to ensure they still fit with your lifestyle and care needs. Avoid breeders or rescues who don’t socialize their cats or aren’t directly involved with the cat’s life, as this can be a sign that they’re a mill. Be wary of organizations that don’t seem to know much about the cat or their breed, are unable to provide their health history, or generally seem cagey about answering your questions.

This can also tell you about any health issues you might need to be aware of. [24] X Research source Avoid breeders and rescues that don’t give you the pedigree papers or who aren’t open or familiar with their cat’s ancestry, as this can be a sign that they’re a scam. Ask the breeder if you can see the cat’s parents. While you can’t visually confirm a cat’s breed, a willingness to show you the parents is usually a good sign of a reputable breeder.

Ask the breeder or rescue what other fees you need to pay besides the general adoption fee. For instance, the organization might charge you for a medical exam, vaccinations, spaying/neutering, flea treatments, and an ID tag. [27] X Research source Most breeders and rescues will provide you with an adoption contract. Make sure to read it over thoroughly before you sign it so you understand all agreements, guarantees, and fees you’re responsible for. Think about what ongoing expenses your cat will require to ensure they’re in your price range. For instance, you’ll have to buy them food, a litter box, a bed, and toys. Take into account what regular checkups cost and prepare for unexpected vet visits, too."
