      "content": "Stand with your shoulders back and down. Before you even start your Irish dance, make sure you are standing up straight. Your shoulders should be back so that your chest is out and you appear confident. No Irish dancer is ever caught slouching. However, don’t stand stiff with your shoulders up, make sure they are down so that you are comfortable. [1] X Research source Make sure your head is held high and proud during the entire dance."

      "title": "Keep your arms straight and at your sides.",
      "content": "Keep your arms straight and at your sides. The positioning of the arms is a major element of the Irish dance. Some dancers keep their arms directly at their sides. Others put their arms slightly behind their backs so their hands are hidden. Put your hands into fists, but be careful not to clench them -- you don't want to tense up. [3] X Research source While you’re dancing, your entire upper body, including your arms, will stay very still while your feet move quickly."

      "content": "Cross your legs and point your right toe out in front of you. This will always be your starting position and the position you return to throughout the dance. Your right leg should be slightly out in front of your left leg with your toes turned outward. It is similar to ballet's closed 4th position. [3] X Research source Keep your knees crossed at all times. Throughout the dance, the leg in front switches constantly, but you need to remember to keep your knees close together and crossed the entire time. If your feet are turned out properly, you should be able to see a diamond-shaped space between your legs and your ankles."
