      "content": "Find the right diapers. Because incontinence is an issue for people of all ages [1] X Research source , a variety of diapers are on the market to meet your needs, and it can be helpful to research the various products that are available that will help you feel physically comfortable. There are diapers especially for older children, preteens, teenagers, and adults [2] X Research source . You should try different brands of diapers until you find the right one. Having the right diapers can make you feel more confident. Youth pull ups are a great option for older children. Popular brands of youth pull ups are Goodnites and Select. Some of these pullups look exactly like regular underwear. Shopping for diapers can be expensive. The CareGiver Partnership allows you to try out samples before you spend a lot of money on diapers. If you are a preteen, you may be too small for adult diapers and too big for youth diapers. Race Car Diapers are made for preteens and come in many different sizes. These diapers were designed for boys. Molicare is another brand that has sizes for preteens. Popular brands for teenagers are Tena , Prevail, and Tranquility. You can also insert booster pads into your diapers to increase how much your diaper can hold. The booster pads will also allow your diapers to absorb more. The most important factor when finding the right diaper is how you feel in them. If they fit well and you are comfortable, you will be more confident wearing them to school. There may be other students with the same issues and you may want to be upfront about it. Sports are possible with the right product. Part of being more comfortable with your body is the acceptance that all bodies are diverse in shapes and functioning, and that means taking care of your body in a way that makes sense for you and your personal needs. There is a growing market of products used to manage incontinence ranging from briefs, pads, to specialty incontinence underwear that are designed to be discreet and comfortable to wear."

They may also give you permission to come late to class or leave class early to change your diaper. Two more things are necessary if you want to have complete bowel and urinary protection - namely a pair of plastic pull up pants - clear is best so as to monitor adult diapers underneath; and a onesie or singlet for support of the diaper once it becomes heavier. Lastly, Seni Quatro or Tena slip maxi are the kind of quiet briefs with cotton surface and hook-and-loop fastener which attract no attention in a stall."
