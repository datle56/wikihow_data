      "content": "Eat nutrient-dense food. If you are experiencing Effexor withdrawal, chances are you will not want to eat; however, allowing yourself to get too hungry is a drain on your immune system, and will not help you to bounce back. Instead, try to nibble on nutrient-dense food, like fruits, vegetables, or nuts. Ask a friend to bring you a fruit smoothie made with strawberry, banana, almond milk, and coconut oil. Alternatively, eat a handful or trail mix or a couple pieces of beef jerky when you feel up to it."

      "title": "Get some rest.",
      "content": "Get some rest. The best way to deal with an Effexor withdrawal is to sleep right through it. Do your best to clear your schedule and get as much sleep as you can. Even if you cannot fall asleep, simply taking it easy and getting some rest will enable your body to heal. This should only be done if you are well-hydrated. Drink water before and after doing any intense sweating."

      "content": "Wait it out. Although the symptoms of an Effexor withdrawal may be uncomfortable or even painful, they won't last forever. In fact, most people report relief in as little as 24 hours (or 72 hours at the most). If detoxing from Effexor is your goal, you are on the right track. Your withdrawal symptoms will be gone in a few days or less.

      "content": "Talk with your doctor or psychiatrist. Before you decide to wean yourself off of Effexor, you really should speak to your doctor or psychiatrist. Effexor is a difficult medication to stop taking, and doing so can bring on intense emotional reactions, including suicidal thoughts. It is best to undergo this transition under advisement from a professional you trust. [5] X Expert Source Padam Bhatia, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020."

      "content": "Switch from XR to IR. Most people are prescribed Effexor XR (extended release), however these pills are difficult to split for tapering. Effexor IR (immediate release) tablets come in 25mg, 37.5mg, 50mg, and 100mg doses, which makes the dose easier to control. Talk to your doctor about switching to IR tablets for a smoother tapering experience.

For a more gradual program, cut your dosage by just 10%, stay at this dosage for a week, and cut by 10% again. This method can take several months, but it is less likely to induce withdrawal.

      "title": "Introduce a different medication.",
      "content": "Introduce a different medication. If your goal is to stop using mood-altering medication, then this step will seem counterintuitive; however, many doctors recommend substituting a different antidepressant medication (usually 10 – 20 mg Prozac) to help you transition off of Effexor. Prozac is less likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, so introducing it (at your doctor’s request) may help stabilize your mood and prevent withdrawal as you wean yourself from Effexor.
