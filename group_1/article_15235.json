      "content": "Start with healthy hair. Damaged hair will not take the dye very well. Also, the bleaching process will damage your hair to some extent, so you want it to be as healthy as possible. If you try to bleach hair that is already damaged, you'll only damage it further. [1] X Research source If you have damaged hair but still want to dye your hair pink, consider going with an ombre instead. This way, you won't bleach all of your hair. It would be best if your hair hasn't been washed for a few days before you start bleaching it. This may sound gross, but the accumulated oils will help protect your hair."

      "content": "Decide between bleaching your hair all the way or partially. If you have red hair or blond hair, you can bleach all of your hair. If you have dark brown or black hair, however, consider getting an ombre instead. This way, you won't have to retouch your color as often, because the roots will be their natural color. It will be less damaging in the end. [2] X Research source If you have light hair between levels 8 and 10, you may not need to bleach it at all. Speak to a stylist to find out what level your hair color is."

      "content": "Prepare your bleach using the right developer. High levels of developer lighten the hair more quickly, but are also more damaging. In general, if you have light-colored hair, a 10 or 20 volume developer should be enough. If you have dark-colored hair, a 30 volume developer would be the better choice. [3] X Research source Each increment of 10 with the volume developers can lighten your hair one more level. Avoid using a 40 volume developer. They act very fast and are very damaging."

      "content": "Perform a strand test. While not absolutely necessary, this is highly recommended. The times on the packaging are guidelines. This means that your hair may bleach faster than the time recommended for your starting hair color and desired lightness. Never go over the recommended bleaching time, however. Select a strand from an inconspicuous area, such as your nape or from behind your ear. [4] X Expert Source April Ferri Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 8 December 2020. If your hair is not light enough, you will need to do a second bleaching session. If it is healthy, you could do it the same day. If your hair is damaged, though, you should wait a couple of weeks before bleaching it again. You could also grab a small piece of hair from the back of your head—your hair is usually darker here.

      "title": "Bleach your hair",
      "content": "Bleach your hair while it is dry, starting from the ends. Divide your hair into 4 sections. Working 1 section at a time, apply the bleach to 1 ⁄ 2 –1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) thin strands of hair, starting from the ends and finishing at the mid-lengths. Once you have applied the bleach to all your hair, go back through your hair and apply the bleach to the roots. The heat from your scalp will cause the bleach to process faster than the bleach on the ends of your hair. You must apply the bleach to your roots last. Be thorough when applying the bleach to each section. It can be especially easy to miss spots along the back of your hair , so pay close attention when bleaching the hair there. If you are going for pastel pink hair, aim to bleach your hair to a level 10, or platinum. Be careful when bleaching hair that has already been dyed. Your hair may not bleach evenly, and the dye may react with the bleach."

Your hair may reach your desired lightness level sooner than the time written on the package. As soon as your hair hits that desired lightness, wash the bleach out with shampoo. If the time is up and your hair still hasn't turned the right color, wash the bleach out anyways and plan to do a second treatment. Check for signs of damage from the bleach, like excessive shedding or breakage. If you see these signs, wait a few weeks before bleaching your hair again."

If you have brown hair and wish to go pastel pink, you may need to bleach it a second time. Keep in mind however, that it may not be possible to bleach very dark hair to a pale blond; you may have to settle for a darker shade of pink. If your hair is healthy, you can bleach it again the same day. If it’s damaged, wait a week or 2 before bleaching it again."
