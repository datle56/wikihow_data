The empirical formula provides the simplest, most reduced ratio of elements within a molecule, for example, two oxygens for every carbon. The molecular formula tells you how many of each of those atoms is present in the molecule. For example, one carbon and two oxygens (carbon dioxide). The two formulae are related by a whole number ratio such that if the empirical formula is multiplied by the ratio, it will yield the molecular formula. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Calculate the number of moles of gas. This means utilizing the ideal gas law. You can determine the number of moles based on the pressure, volume, and temperature provided by the experimental data. The number of moles can be calculated using the following formula: n = PV/RT . [2] X Research source In this formula, n is the number of moles, P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and R is the gas constant. Example: n = PV/RT = (0.984 atm * 1 L) / (0.08206 L atm mol-1 K-1 * 318.15 K) = 0.0377 mol"

You will also need to know how many grams of gas were present. Then divide the grams of gas by the moles of gas present to yield molecular weight. Example: 14.42 g / 0.0377 mol = 382.49 g/mol"

      "content": "Add together the atomic weight of all atoms in the empirical formula. Each atom in the empirical formula has its own atomic weight. This value can be found at the bottom of the atom’s square on the periodic table. Add these weights together to get the weight of the empirical formula. For example, carbon has an atomic weight of 12.0107, hydrogen has an atomic weight of 1.00794, and oxygen has an atomic weight of 15.9994. It's okay to look up the atomic weight if you don't know it. Example: (12.0107 g * 12) + (15.9994 g * 1) + (1.00794 g * 30) = 144.1284 + 15.9994 + 30.2382 = 190.366 g"

Knowing how many times the empirical weight is repeated will let you find the number of times that the empirical formula repeats itself in the molecular formula. This should be a whole number. If the ratio is not a whole number, you will have to round it. Example: 382.49 / 190.366 = 2.009"

[4] X Research source Example: 75.46 g C * (1 mol / 12.0107 g) = 6.28 mol C 8.43 g O * (1 mol / 15.9994 g) = 0.53 mol O 16.11 g H * (1 mol / 1.00794) = 15.98 mol H"

You need to divide the number of moles for each separate element by the smallest molar amount from all the elements present in the compound. In doing so, you can find the simplest mole ratios. This works, because it gives sets the least abundant element to “1” and provides the respective ratios of other elements in the compound. [5] X Research source Example: Smallest molar amount is oxygen with 0.53 mol. 6.28 mol/0.53 mol = 11.83 0.53 mol/0.53 mol = 1 15.98 mol/0.53 mol= 30.15"
