      "content": "Section your hair. Using your fingers, divide your hair into convenient sections. If you have long hair, twist it into four or more sections. If you have shorter hair, use hair clips instead. Either way, treat your hair as gently as possible.

      "content": "Wash your hair. Wash one section at a time, and clip or twist it again once done. Smooth your hair back over your scalp until it feels fully wet. Gently apply the shampoo or other washing treatment in a smoothing motion from scalp to tip. Massage the scalp with your fingertips, then wash thoroughly with water. Tilt your head back and wash in the direction your hair falls to reduce tangling. [2] X Expert Source Ndeye Anta Niang Professional Hair Stylist & Master Braider Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Try a gentle washing method, such as co-washing, homemade cleansing mixtures, or shampoo that doesn't contain sulfates, paraben, or silicone. Sulfates, paraben, and silicone are damaging to hair and cause frizz and hair damage such as split ends and dry hair. Do not pile hair on top of your head while washing. This will only cause more tangles and breakage. If your hair is very tangled when wet, consider taking a wide tooth comb in the shower to help loosen knots carefully. Being too rough or using a brush may split ends shorter or cause damage."

      "title": "Apply conditioner.",
      "content": "Apply conditioner. Section by section, saturate your hair with a conditioner that has plenty of \"slip.\" A conditioner with good slip makes it easy for your hair strands to slide past each other, practically undoing tangles by themselves. Detangler conditioners, hair mayonnaise, or other creamy conditioners generally work best. You may need to try several to find one that works on your hair type. [3] X Research source Whenever applying conditioner, focus on the ends of the hair, the oldest and most easily damaged area. You can make your own detangler conditioner from Aloe vera . Cut the Aloe vera leaf in the middle, scoop out the gel and blend it until it is foamy and slightly gel-like. Olive oil or another medium or heavy natural oil can work as well. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Finish with a wide comb or brush. If your fingers can't do the job, move on to a seamless wide-toothed comb or a widely spaced, rubber bristled brush (such as a Denman brush). Start from the ends, gradually combing from higher points as the hair detangles. After detangling each section, the hair should be braided, twisted, or hair clipped in such a way that it won't tangle back up."
