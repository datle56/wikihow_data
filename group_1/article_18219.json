      "content": "Rinse the Brussels sprouts with fresh water and then pat them dry. Use a dishcloth to carefully dry each of the sprouts. It's important that they're completely dry before you store them in the freezer or ice crystals could form on them. [3] X Research source"

Once the bags are full, press out any excess air with your hands and seal the bags. [4] X Research source You can also make it so each freezer bag has one serving of Brussels sprouts in it. Then, when you're ready to cook, you can grab a bag and not have to worry about doing any measuring."

Writing the date on the bags will save you the trouble of having to remember how long the Brussels sprouts have been in the freezer. You can also write the future expiration date on the bag so you don't have to count out the months every time you want some Brussels sprouts. [5] X Research source"

If the Brussels sprouts are dry or discolored when you take them out of the freezer, it could be a sign that they’ve developed freezer burn . They’re still safe to eat, but they may not taste as good. [6] X Research source If you want the Brussels sprouts to maintain their color, flavor, and nutritional value for longer in the freezer, it’s a good idea to blanch them before you freeze them."
