      "content": "Try a top with a low neckline that distracts from your neck. You probably don't want to wear a turtleneck every day and there are lots of necklines that can bring attention away from your neck. Wear a deep V-neck or a shallow scoop neck that's low near your breastbone. [1] X Research source Play around with other interesting necklines like a square neckline or deep scoop neck. Avoid wearing shirts with crew necklines that sit right at the base of your neck since it draws attention to your neck."

      "content": "Wrap a flowy scarf around your neck to hide your wrinkles. Take a long, soft scarf and drape it around your neck. Tie a simple knot in the front and fluff the fabric around your neck so it covers your skin. Play around with different ways to wrap the scarf until you find a method that you really like. [2] X Research source Choose comfortable fabrics that drape well such as chiffon, cashmere, or silk."

      "content": "Wear bold necklaces that draw attention away from your neck. Invest in a few pieces of statement jewelry that are brightly colored, fun, or bold. Adjust the length so they hang down on your chest near your breastbone. [3] X Research source Avoid wearing chokers or short necklaces that bring attention to sagging skin."

      "content": "Wear a turtleneck or a blouse with an upturned collar for the most coverage. In cooler seasons, reach for a shirt that offers a lot of coverage around your neck. You could wear a turtleneck or a polo shirt with an upturned collar, for instance. [4] X Research source In cooler weather, pair a light top with a lightweight blazer or jacket to get some coverage."

      "title": "Apply a moisturizer and primer to minimize the look of wrinkles.",
      "content": "Apply a moisturizer and primer to minimize the look of wrinkles. Choose a moisturizer that's designed for your skin type and gently rub it onto your neck. The moisturizer plumps your skin, which can hide fine wrinkles. Then, spread a silicone-based primer over your neck to keep your makeup in place. The primer is especially important since you'll be applying powders which can easily wear off unless you apply a primer base."

      "title": "Brush highlighter powder vertically along your neck.",
      "content": "Brush highlighter powder vertically along your neck. Dip a large powder brush into a shimmery highlighter and brush up and down along the center of your neck. The shimmery powder makes your neck look slimmer and disguises lines along the side of your neck. Pick a highlighter that works with your skin's tone. For example, choose a warm highlighter if you have an olive skin tone."

      "content": "Create high-impact eye makeup like eyeliner and full lashes. Bring the focus onto your eyes and face instead of your neck by using eye makeup that really pops! Play around with new eyeshadows to find a color you love, add a bold eyeliner, or add an extra coat of mascara to make your lashes look fuller. [5] X Research source If you have fine eyelashes, use false eyelashes. These are great for giving instant volume, which also makes your eyes look bigger."

      "title": "Keep your lip color natural so it doesn't draw attention to your chin and neck.",
      "content": "Keep your lip color natural so it doesn't draw attention to your chin and neck. Since you're trying to emphasize your eyes, don't wear a bold or bright lipstick, which brings attention to the lower half of your face and your neckline. Instead, choose a neutral or natural lipstick or gloss. Test out a few sheer lip colors, which have less pigment than cream lipsticks."

      "title": "Try an asymmetrical cut that ends near your collarbone.",
      "content": "Try an asymmetrical cut that ends near your collarbone. Bring the focus away from your neck by getting a cut that's just below your shoulders. Asymmetrical haircuts are also great ways to create a stylish look that distracts from wrinkles. You could get an asymmetrical bob, for instance. If you have fine or thin hair, add volumizing products to your hair care routine. Texture and volume can hide your neck so the sagging isn't as noticeable."

      "title": "Get bangs to distract from your neck and bring attention to your face.",
      "content": "Get bangs to distract from your neck and bring attention to your face. For a bold look that's great with a blunt cut, ask your stylist for blunt bangs that cover your entire forehead. If you prefer a looser, natural style, try side bangs that frame the sides of your face. [6] X Research source Remember that bangs don't have to be straight and smooth. You can curl them or add a texturizing product to make wavy locks."

      "title": "Avoid hairstyles that end near your chin.",
      "content": "Avoid hairstyles that end near your chin. Although very short haircuts like a tight bob or pixie cut can bring attention to your face, haircuts that end around your chin draw attention down below your face. Go for shorter cuts or styles that are at least down to your shoulders. Work with your hairstylist to choose the best cut for your face."
