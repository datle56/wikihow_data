      "content": "Insert the hook into the top loops of the next stitch of the previous row. Identify the loops by looking at the bumps along the top edge of your project. Each stitch looks like a “V” that tucks into the top of the next “V.” The two “legs” of the “V” are the two loops you work in. Insert your hook into the stitch from the front of the work and out through the back. [1] X Research source A single crochet decrease stitch is abbreviated to sc2tog when you’re reading a crochet pattern . You may also see “dec” for decrease, meaning you should decrease using the same stitch you’ve been using in the pattern. In this case, it’s a single crochet stitch (or double crochet in the UK). A third way a decrease is noted is “crochet 2 stitches together.” Use single crochet decreases in rows with single crochet stitches unless the pattern says something different. Decreases are worked the same way when crocheting in the round as on flat rows. In most cases, use the same hook you use for the rest of the project. Most patterns specify a hook size and yarn weight. However, if you’re practicing without a pattern, try an H-8 (5mm) hook with worsted-weight yarn . As you become more familiar with crocheting, you’ll be able to judge when to use a different-sized hook based on how tightly or loosely you crochet. As a beginner, it’s best to stick with the size the pattern calls for."

Then, pull the yarn back through the same stitch to make a loop on the crochet hook. [2] X Research source There is now a total of 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over means to wrap the yarn around the hook so the hook can catch it. It’s one of the most common instructions in crochet patterns. This is the same way you start a regular single crochet stitch, but you don’t finish the stitch."

Another option is to use a hook that’s 1 size smaller than what you’re using for the rest of the piece. This makes the stitches smaller and tighter. Or, use an invisible decrease, which increases the tension of the stitch and pulls any gaps close.

However, some patterns aren’t specific. They may say something like, “Space 8 decreases evenly along the row.” In that case, all you have to do is take the full number of stitches in the row and divide it by the number of decreases the pattern calls for. This will tell you how many stitches to make between your decreases to keep them evenly spaced. [28] X Research source For example, if your row has 40 stitches and you need to space out 8 decreases, divide 40 by 8 to get 5. Then, make a decrease every 5 stitches as you work your way down the row."

You've no doubt already started noticing how much shorthand and new vocabulary you have to learn as a crochet beginner. It can be a bit overwhelming! Here are some of the most common terms and abbreviations you'll see: Chain (ch): The most basic crochet stitch made by yarning over and pulling through the loop on the hook. Loop (lp): The loop of yarn on your hook at any given time. Repeat (rep): This tells you to repeat a portion of the pattern. It’s usually accompanied by brackets [] or parentheses () to tell you what part of the pattern to repeat. Right side (RS): The front of your work, or the part of the stitch that is facing you when you are crocheting. Round (rnd): This is a row when a project is worked in the round or in a circle. Row: A row is a line of crochet stitches in a project. Skip (sk): You see this when a pattern tells you to skip the next stitch in the previous row. Work in progress (WIP): A project you’re still working on. Working yarn: The working yarn is the long end of yarn you use to make new stitches. Yarn over (yo): Yarn over is when you wrap the working yarn over the hook."
