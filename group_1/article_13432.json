      "content": "Print out reference images. You should have one of Goku's hair from the front, side, and back. One taken at an angle would also help. Make sure that the images are nice and clear. Keep these images handy; you will need to refer to them throughout the wig styling process. If you don't have a printer, have the images readily available on your computer, tablet, phone, etc."

      "content": "Get a short, black wig. Look for a short, black wig with finger-length hair that is easily spike-able. Something with \"J-rock\" in the name and lots of layers would be ideal. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pin the wig to a Styrofoam wig head.",
      "content": "Pin the wig to a Styrofoam wig head. You can do this with regular sewing pins or T-pins. Next, place the wig head onto a stand. You can easily make your own by sticking a thick dowel into a bucket filled with sand or pebbles, then placing the wig head on top. If you are using a dowel, make sure that it is thin enough to fit into the hole at the bottom of the wig head."

      "title": "Sculpt the bangs into large, triangular spikes.",
      "content": "Sculpt the bangs into large, triangular spikes. You will need two large spikes to either side of the forehead, and two smaller ones on each temple. The bangs need to lay flat across the forehead. Refer to your reference pictures for a clearer image. To make the spikes, do the following: [2] X Research source Gather a section of hair from the bangs. Pinch the bottom of the section so that it tapers into a triangle. Mist the section with hairspray. Set the triangle with a hair drier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Touch up the spikes.",
      "content": "Touch up the spikes. Use a small pair of scissors to trim off any unruly or stray hairs. If the spikes are separating at the tips, you can apply a little bit of hair gel or a clear-drying glue to the points. This will help them hold together."

      "title": "Make five cones out of craft form for the spikes.",
      "content": "Make five cones out of craft form for the spikes. Cut five, large triangles out of craft foam. Roll each one into a cone, then secure it with hot glue. The cones need to be about the same height as your face. [3] X Research source Don't worry if they look too big; you will trim them down later. Trace the triangles onto black felt before gluing them together. Save the triangles for the next step."

      "title": "Cover the craft foam with black felt.",
      "content": "Cover the craft foam with black felt. This will help the hair blend in better. Wrap the felt triangles around the craft foam cones, and secure the edges with hot glue. [4] X Research source If you did not cut the triangles out of black felt earlier, simply cover the cones with the felt, then trim off the excess felt off the sides."
    },
    {
      "title": "Form the cone bases into oval shapes.",
      "content": "Form the cone bases into oval shapes. The spikes will look more realistic if they have an oval base rather than a round one. Draw a ring of hot glue around the base of your first cone, then squash it into an oval while it dries. Do this for all of the cones; work one cone at a time, otherwise the glue will set up too fast."

Next, place two spikes on the right side of the head, and a third spike directly above. Make sure that their edges are touching as well. [5] X Research source Orient the spikes vertically, with the narrow ends of the ovals facing up/down, and the long edges facing front/back. Place the spikes behind the ears."

      "title": "Check the spikes against your reference image.",
      "content": "Check the spikes against your reference image. Make sure that they are in the right position. If one of the spikes appears too big, take it off and cut down the bottom edge. Keep doing this until you are satisfied with the size. Once you are happy, remove the spikes, and label them on the inside with a black marker. If you used black foam, use a white, silver, or gold marker instead."

      "title": "Get some black wig hair.",
      "content": "Get some black wig hair. You can buy a hank of loose hair or wefted wig hair extensions. Make sure that you get the same shade of black as your wig. There will be a difference between black-black and soft-black. Do not get braiding hair or \"Jumbo Braid\" kanekalon; it is too crinkly. Plan on getting three packs. Alternatively, you can cut the wefts off of a long wig instead."

      "content": "Cut the hair until it is a little longer than the cones. If you bought the hair in hanks, separate it into pencil-thin bundles first, then tie it around the middle with twist ties. If you bought wefted hair, cut the wefts down to 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide. Measure the hair against the cones, then cut it down until it is about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) longer than the cones."

Use your fingers to spread the hairs as thinly as you can across the glue.

      "content": "Secure the bottom edge of the hair to the inside of the cone. Draw a line of hot glue inside the cone, close to the edge. Fold the bottom of the hair over the edge of the cone and press it into the glue. You can do this with a pen or paintbrush handle if the glue is too hot. [7] X Research source If you tied your hair at the bottom, cut the hair apart and remove the twist tie before you glue it down. Use a low-temp hot glue gun so that you don't burn yourself."

Position them vertically up the sides of your head, behind your ears. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that things are reversed in the mirror. If this is too scary for you, drape a thin towel over the wig head, cover it with the wig cap, then put the wig on top."
