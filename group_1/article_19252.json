      "title": "Develop a Sniper Rifle.",
      "content": "Develop a Sniper Rifle. To counter the range of Quiet’s sniper rifle, you’ll need to develop a sniper rifle of your own. As soon as it’s available for development on your iDroid, make sure to spend some GMP on at least the RENOV - ICKX SR (Sniper Rifle). It only costs 40000 GMP to make and should be more than enough to take out Quiet when you meet her later."

      "content": "Take on the mission “Side Op 82: Make Contact with Emmerich. ” Miller, your Mother Base XO, will inform you of a Side Op to meet with Dr. Emmerich. Take on this mission and drop in at the LZ closest to the mission area. Don’t forget to equip your Sniper Rifle during the mission sortie screen. Either D-Horse or D-Dog will do fine as buddies for this part of the mission since they’ll have minimal impact on its completion (at least before and during the fight with Quiet)."

      "content": "Enter the ruins to start Episode 11. Follow the road that leads to Dr. Emmerich’s whereabouts. You’ll eventually come across some ruins and upon entering it a cutscene will automatically play. If you rightfully avoided the Skulls in Episodes 1 and 6 then this should be your first proper boss fight."

      "title": "Figure out Quiet’s initial sniping position.",
      "content": "Figure out Quiet’s initial sniping position. After the cutscene plays out, you will almost always be spotted by Quiet, who is aiming for your head atop some ruins in the area in front of you. Duck behind cover and use your Int Scope to figure out Quiet’s location. The glint from her sniper rifle’s scope or its laser sights are usually dead giveaways of her location."

      "title": "Look for a good sniping point or call a supply drop.",
      "content": "Look for a good sniping point or call a supply drop. Once you’ve established where she is, make sure that you mark her on your iDroid. You can then choose between using your sniper rifle to chip away at her health or call a supply drop to her location and take out half of her stamina."

    {
      "title": "Use Your NVG (night vision gear) when Quiet disappears.",
      "content": "Use Your NVG (night vision gear) when Quiet disappears. Hitting Quiet once with either the supply drop or with your sniper rifle will force her to transfer to a different location and disappear. So you won’t lose sight of her (or at the very least so you’d know the direction she ran off to), make sure you turn on your NVG. Don’t worry if you don’t see where she set up her next sniping spot. You can always go out in the open and wait for the white cloud that indicates the location of where she’s sniping."

      "title": "Play the cut scene but don’t pull the trigger.",
      "content": "Play the cut scene but don’t pull the trigger. Once you’ve depleted either Quiet’s health or stamina, she will move to the northern end of the ruins. Going to her location will trigger an interactive cutscene where you are urged by Miller to shoot her. Since we want to have her as a buddy, you can ignore his instructions and just wait for the cutscene to finish."

      "content": "Extract Quiet using the chopper. Since you can’t use the Fulton Recovery System on Quiet, you’ll need to wait for a chopper sent by Ocelot to pick you up. Boarding the chopper together with Quiet will then trigger another set of cutscenes which culminate in Quiet getting detained at Mother Base."

If you’re already at Mother Base, you can go directly to the Medical Unit Platform and you’ll find a set of stairs in front of the helipad that leads to her detention cell."

      "content": "Take her on a mission. After Side Op 111, Ocelot will inform you that you can now develop weapons for Quiet. Immediately start development on her Wicked Butterfly, and once that’s done, you can then take her out to missions. Bringing Quiet on missions will raise your bond with her and open up development for upgrades to her weapons. One mission that you can farm to raise her bond level with you is Episode 3: A Hero’s Way. Have her take out the commander from a sniping point directly facing his house. Once the commander is eliminated, exit out of the mission zone by helicopter and redo the mission until her bond level gets high enough for you to develop the silenced Guilty Butterfly (extremely useful for non-lethal takedowns of bases and outposts)."
