If your cat is not happy about getting into position, take some time to calm it down and get it comfortable. Give it lots of pets and make it very relaxed before expressing its bladder.

Its weight will be on your lap or on a counter while its rear end is held over the sink, toilet, or litter box.

In this position, you will hold the cat under its front legs with its rear end hanging down and its belly facing away from you. [5] X Research source This position works well for cats that are not fully paralyzed because they will have more muscle control in their core. When you get it into position, make sure you can hold the cat securely as you will hold the majority of the cat’s weight with one of your arms positioned right behind the cat’s front legs."

A cat’s urethra is located right below its tail, so that area of the cat’s body needs to be in place. When you first start expressing your cat's bladder there may be occasions where the urine doesn't go where you want it to. Just keep working on your technique, and before long you won't have any more accidents to clean up."

They will not have a lot of urine come out if they are expressed on a regular basis. If you are unsure, let go of the bladder and then feel it again. It should be markedly softer than it was when you started expressing it. Never force the bladder empty if you feel resistance. Contact a vet to discuss options and find any problems."

When you watch your cat walk around, keep an eye out for abnormal movement, especially if they're having difficulty moving their back legs. Many cats that need their bladders manually expressed have a paralyzed rear end. If your cat can’t use its rear legs, it’s likely that the muscles around the bladder are also not working. [11] X Research source Most cats that have mobility issues are either born with a problem, get an injury, or develop problems in old age. If your cat if in mid-life and isn’t injured, it likely won’t have paralysis in its hind legs."

[13] X Research source If your vet tells you that you need to express your cat’s bladder, they should follow that suggestion by showing you how to do it. If they don't offer to show you how to do it, ask them to. Watch how they do it, try to do it while in the vet’s office, and ask your vet as many questions as you like. Determine if you have the time and energy to commit to expressing your cat’s bladder regularly if it can’t urinate. If they get distressed easily or you can’t take care of it yourself, euthanization may be the best option so the cat doesn’t suffer."
