      "content": "Make sure the body is face up. [1] X Research source If the body is front-side down, gravity will pull the blood down to the lowest parts of the body, particularly the face. This can discolor and bloat the facial features, making it more difficult to create a life-like appearance for the viewing.

      "title": "Remove any clothing that the person is wearing.",
      "content": "Remove any clothing that the person is wearing. You will need to see the skin for signs that embalming is working, so the body will remain uncovered throughout the procedure. Also remove any IV needles or catheters that are in place. [3] X Research source Typically, you'll need to catalog any property found on the person, as well as any cuts, bruises, or other discolorations at this time on your embalming report. This will also be used to document the procedure and chemicals used in the process. The report acts as insurance if the family chooses to sue the funeral home for any reason. Respect the body at all times. Use a sheet or towel to cover the genitals, and don't leave tools laying around on it while you're working. Assume the family may pop in at any moment."

      "title": "Disinfect the mouth, eyes, nose, and other body openings.",
      "content": "Disinfect the mouth, eyes, nose, and other body openings. Wash the entire body with a germicidal soap or detergent. [4] X Research source Spray a powerful disinfectant to clean bodily openings, open wounds, and other necessary surfaces. [5] X Research source Inspect the deceased in regards to the type of fluid you will need. Some embalmers will use this opportunity to mix all the fluid they'll need for the procedure to get it ready. Usually, 16 ounces of fluid with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water is a good dilution."

      "title": "Shave the body.",
      "content": "Shave the body. Typically, the face and body are shaved at this point. [6] X Research source Men, women, and children are shaved to improve the look of the makeup. However, if the person had facial hair, the hair stays. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Relieve rigor mortis by massaging the body. Massage the major muscle groups to relieve the tension and move stiff joints to loosen them up. Even though rigor mortis goes away naturally, massaging the body helps to postpone it or move the process along. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Close the eyes.",
      "content": "Close the eyes. Use great care in setting the eyes. Place an eye cap on each eye to set the eyelids in place. [9] X Research source Eyelids are never sewn shut but may be glued shut in some cases. The features need to be set before the embalming fluid is introduced, because that fluid will \"set\" the body fairly rigidly, making it difficult to do it afterward."

      "title": "Close the mouth and set it naturally.",
      "content": "Close the mouth and set it naturally. One of two methods is typically used to set the mouth: [10] X Research source Sometimes, the mouth is sewn shut using mandible suture. Pass a curved needle through the jaw under the gums and back up through the septum. Place dentures, a mouth former, or cotton inside to help shape the mouth. Tie the string into a bow. [11] X Research source A needle injector is also commonly used in conjunction with a mouth form. Like a mouthguard or a dental prosthetic, the mouth form holds the jaw together to create a natural bite and alignment of the jaw. [12] X Research source This method often includes less room for human error."

      "content": "Find the carotid or femoral artery. The arteries are embalmed by simultaneously introducing embalming fluid (a mixture of formaldehyde, other chemicals, and water) into the carotid or femoral artery while draining the blood from a nearby vein or from the heart. It takes about two gallons of fluid to embalm a typical body. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Make your incision. Clean the vein point off, create an entrance point, and insert the drain tube towards the heart. Tie a ligature around the lower side of the tube. [14] X Research source Do the same for the artery except insert the cannula instead of a drain tube. Place the cannula forceps on the artery locking the cannula in place. Use the small locking forceps to clamp off the upper side of the artery and restrict the flow."

    {
      "title": "Turn on your embalming machine and distribute the fluid.",
      "content": "Turn on your embalming machine and distribute the fluid. While the embalming is taking place, wash the body with a good germicidal or antibacterial soap and be sure to check for drainage while massaging the limbs to push blood out and embalming solution in. [15] X Research source When the fluid enters the arteries, pressure will build throughout the veins, which means the fluid is moving throughout the body. You'll notice the veins bulging somewhat. Open the jugular drain tube periodically to allow blood to escape and relieve the pressure."

    {
      "title": "Slowly decrease the pressure.",
      "content": "Slowly decrease the pressure. Once the area is thoroughly embalmed, turn off the machine and reverse your arterial tube to the other side of the artery you chose to inject. [16] X Research source This will embalm the part that was blocked by the arterial tube previously. Be sure to turn down the pressure, as the fluid only has to go a short distance. In the case of the femoral, this will embalm the lower leg. In the case of the right common carotid, this will embalm the right side of the head."

      "content": "Finish. When you've embalmed to your satisfaction, or run out of fluid, turn off the machine, remove the cannula, and tie off the veins and arteries you used. Suture the incisions closed. Use sealing powder or putty to ensure there is no leakage. [17] X Research source"
