      "content": "Open the doors and wear rubber gloves. Opening the car doors or windows will help prevent the urine odor, as well as the smell of the cleaning materials, from overwhelming you or your car. Wearing rubber gloves is very useful if you don’t want your hands to smell like urine or the cleaning solution."

Combine in a small bowl 2 cups (470 mL) of cold water with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid dish soap. Gently stir ingredients together. [1] X Research source Vinegar is an important ingredient because it works to disinfect the area as well as break down the acid found in the urine. [2] X Research source Baking soda can also be applied directly onto the car seat to soak up the urine, thereafter you’ll want to clean the car seat with dishwashing soap and water and rinse thoroughly."

      "content": "Sponge the urine stain. Do this gently, blotting not wiping or smearing. Dip a cloth into the cleaning solution and dab the stained area. You don’t want the cloth to be soaked in solution or it will soak the seat more. [3] X Research source Start at the outside of the stain and work to the center as you sponge and clean the area, to help prevent the stain from spreading. [4] X Research source Make sure to use a clean cloth. If you already used the cloth to wipe some dirt, it will only add to the problem."

Alternate between dabbing the area with a damp, cleaning cloth and a dry cloth until the stain is no longer visible. [5] X Research source If urine stain is still visible after cleaning it with the solution, you can apply a few drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the stain with an eyedropper, optionally adding a few drops of ammonia as well. Using a clean cloth, dab the area with cold water until the chemicals are removed. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Combine hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and dish detergent to create a cleaning solution. If you prefer a different, less hands-on approach to cleaning the stain, you may want to try creating a cleaning solution that you can spray directly onto the stain. This mix includes 10 ounces (280 g) of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 3 tbsp (41.4 g) of baking soda and a drop or two of dish detergent. Mix them together in a small bowl. [7] X Research source The mixture will likely foam a little, so wait until the foam recedes before pouring the mixture into a spray bottle. [8] X Research source This way the liquid you spray from the bottle won't be too thick and foamy."

[14] X Research source Anytime you wash or clean leather, you must wash the entire cushion, even up to the edges, so you don’t end up with a “water stain.” You want the leather to dry evenly so there is no single spot that sticks out. ”Nature’s Miracle” is a popular, all-surface cleaner to remove pet-related urine stains because it effectively breaks down the damaging chemical properties of the urine. Avoid using products that are not designed for leather. For example, soap that is too alkaline can stain it. If you have suede, nubuck, or unfinished leather it is recommended that you use cleaners specifically designed for those materials. They will likely be damaged or discolored if the wrong cleaner is used. [15] X Research source Try your cleaner on a discreet area of your leather furniture to observe its effects before fully applying it - this will let you know if there will be any adverse effects.

Using an old toothbrush both stops you from having to buy a new scrubbing tool, and is soft enough so that the scrubbing won’t damage the upholstery. This method involves scrubbing, rather than just dabbing or spraying, because the stain may be absorbed further into the upholstery as it has had time to dry and sit. Scrubbing enables the cleaning mixture to go deeper into the upholstery."
