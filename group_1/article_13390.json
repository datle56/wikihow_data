      "content": "Start with brushed hair that hasn't been washed for 1 to 2 days. Unwashed hair has more grip than freshly-washed hair, so it will be easier to braid. If you just washed your hair, dry it first, then apply some dry shampoo to give it texture.

If you have curly or frizzy hair, consider misting it with water. This will help the strands lay smoother and make them easier to work with."
