      "title": "Cut out the core of the tomato with a paring knife.",
      "content": "Cut out the core of the tomato with a paring knife. Place a tomato on a cutting board with the stem facing up. Cut a circle about 1 ⁄ 2 –1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) deep around the stem. Remove the core by pulling it out or scooping it out with a spoon. [1] X Research source Tomato corers are spoons with sharp spikes. If you have one, use the corer to gently dig under the stem and pull it up."

    {
      "title": "Turn the tomato onto its side.",
      "content": "Turn the tomato onto its side. The empty core should face either left or right. This will help you get those beautiful spokes when you slice your tomato. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hold the tomato with your fingers curled inward.",
      "content": "Hold the tomato with your fingers curled inward. This will help prevent accidental cuts while slicing. Hold it towards the end of the empty core. As you cut, the flat, dull edge of the knife should be lightly touching the knuckle of your middle finger. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut down through the tomato with a serrated knife.",
      "content": "Cut down through the tomato with a serrated knife. Start at the end opposite to the core. Make a slice by cutting through the tomato about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) away from the edge. [4] X Research source While any sharp knife will cut a tomato, a serrated knife will prevent all of the juices from escaping."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the slices equal thickness.",
      "content": "Make the slices equal thickness. How wide you make the slice depends on your preferences. As you continue to slice through the tomato, try to keep each slice roughly the same size. As you make each slice, move your fingers back slightly. This will keep your fingers away from the knife. Cut with a sawing motion, letting the blade do all the work so you don't end up squishing the tomato!"

      "title": "Remove the stem and core with a paring knife.",
      "content": "Remove the stem and core with a paring knife. Cut around the stem in a circle, and dig out the stem with a spoon. You can also use a tomato corer."

    {
      "title": "Slice the tomato.",
      "content": "Slice the tomato. However thick you slice the tomato is how thick your dice will be. Wider slices will give you a chunkier dice while thinner slices will give you delicate cubes. Continue cutting until the entire tomato is sliced."

      "title": "Stack 2 or 3 slices at a time.",
      "content": "Stack 2 or 3 slices at a time. You will be cutting these all at the same time. If you have very thin slices, you may be able to stack a few more. You might have 2 or 3 stacks when you are done."
