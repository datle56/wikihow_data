You have to wait until night because, based on the game mechanics, Chingling can only evolve during nighttime. Starting from the fourth generation, the in-game time depends on your device’s clock or the real-world time. nighttime in the game starts at 8:00 PM and ends on 3:59 AM. If you want the night to come faster, you can adjust your device’s system clock."

      "content": "Level up Chingling. When night arrives, go out and make Chingling level up. Go out and do Pokémon battles using Chingling until it levels up (at least once). You can do any kind of Pokémon battle (either fighting trainers or wild Pokémon) as long as Chingling wins and gain XP. Once Chingling levels up, it will evolve into its adult form: Chimecho. If Chingling doesn’t evolve, make sure that its Happiness level is at least 220. You can max out the Happiness level (255) just to make sure."
