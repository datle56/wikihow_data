      "content": "Download and install Redact. Redact allows you to bulk delete tweets easily. While it used to be possible to delete more tweets at once for free with Redact, you can now only delete up to 500 tweets with a free account and will need to pay to be able to delete more than that. Go to https://redact.dev/download in a web browser and click Download . Once downloaded, run the setup to install the program. Redact is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Understand the limitations: If you have fewer than 500 tweets to delete, the free version of Redact should work as long as you haven't already used your X account to view more than 500 tweets today. Twitter/X limits free users to viewing only 500 tweets per day, and this affects Redact's ability to delete tweets for you. If you have more than 500 tweets, Redact recommends paying for a Premium account ($95.88 for a yearly subscription), and importing your tweets and other X data .
