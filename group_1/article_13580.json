Repeat this for the second pigtail too. This is a great idea if you have thin hair, as it will make your hair appear thicker and give you larger space buns in the end. [3] X Research source Alternatively, wrap 3-comb hair extensions around the base of your pigtails instead. This will help give you a little more volume. [4] X Research source"

For even more volume, gently tug on the hair going into the buns to loosen it up. Focus on the hair on the top and sides of your head. If you left strands out of your buns, consider straightening them with a flat iron . Give them a wispier look by curving the iron towards your face rather than straight down."

You are working with less hair than when creating a basic space bun, so it would be a good idea to tease your ponytail a little. Simply lift strands of your ponytail, then backcomb it towards the hair tie with a brush. Teasing can help if your hair is on the thinner, less voluminous side."

Focus on the sides and top of your head. It's okay if the part in the back center of your head goes away at this point. You don't need it anymore."
