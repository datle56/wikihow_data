      "content": "Pull any stuck fabric out with tweezers. Sometimes, your zipper gets stuck because there’s fabric or thread trapped in the zipper teeth. Open your bag as far as possible and try to look inside. If you see anything clogging the teeth, grab a pair of tweezers and gently pull the fabric out. Once you’ve gotten the teeth unstuck, you should be able to slide the zipper back and forth no problem. [1] X Research source Oftentimes, a luggage zipper is stuck because there’s clothing caught in the zipper. If you can gently remove the clothing from the zipper teeth, you can fix your zipper in no time! If you don’t have tweezers on-hand, try gently tugging on the fabric with your fingers."

      "title": "Color the zipper teeth with a graphite pencil.",
      "content": "Color the zipper teeth with a graphite pencil. If your zipper is still stuck, you might need a little extra help. Grab a pencil made of graphite (the old-style #2 pencils) and gently rub it on the zipper teeth near your stuck zipper. Slide your zipper back and forth to see if the graphite helps lubricate and release the zipper. [2] X Research source Try rubbing the graphite on the teeth both above and below the zipper slider itself. That way, your lubricating material will hopefully get inside the zipper slider and unstick it."

      "title": "Use baby powder or lip balm if the zipper is still stuck.",
      "content": "Use baby powder or lip balm if the zipper is still stuck. If graphite doesn’t fix your problem, you may need to move onto tougher lubricants. You can use baby powder, lip balm, petroleum jelly, bar soap, glass cleaner, or wax paper. Grab whatever you hand on hand and rub it on the zipper teeth near the zipper slider, then try gently tugging the zipper back and forth. [3] X Research source If your luggage is made of leather, use caution if you choose to use glass cleaner or bar soap. Both can stain leather, so be sure to wipe it off with a wet rag as soon as you can."

      "content": "Straighten the zipper teeth with pliers. If your zipper won’t catch because the teeth are crooked, you might be able to fix it right away. Grab a pair of pliers and gently squeeze the zipper teeth to straighten them back out. Slide the zipper up and down to see if that fixes your problem. [4] X Research source If the zipper teeth are the problem, you’ll probably be able to see that they’re crooked. If they aren’t the problem, move onto the next step."

      "title": "Pinch the zipper plates together with pliers.",
      "content": "Pinch the zipper plates together with pliers. Usually, a zipper separates because the plates, or the base of the zipper, are too loose. Grab a pair of pliers and gently place them on the base of the zipper slider, or the small, flat part of the zipper that touches the zipper teeth. Squeeze the pliers gently to tighten the plates of the zipper slider, then do the same thing on the other side. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Try the zipper again, then keep pinching.",
      "content": "Try the zipper again, then keep pinching. Once you’ve pinched the zipper a few times, try zipping it up and down to see if it catches. Make sure you line up the teeth with the sides of the zipper before you slide it. If the zipper is still separated, try pinching it again with pliers. [6] X Research source If the zipper catches but gets stuck, try lubricating the teeth with graphite or wax paper. If your zipper still doesn’t catch, it may be time to replace it."

      "title": "Pull off the zipper stop with a pair of pliers.",
      "content": "Pull off the zipper stop with a pair of pliers. The zipper stop is the flat piece of metal or plastic at the very beginning of the zipper teeth. Since it helps keep the zipper from sliding off your bag, you need to remove it before you can replace your zipper. Use pliers to pull the zipper stop off, then throw it away. [7] X Research source The zipper stop will probably be damaged from the pliers you used to take it off, so unfortunately, you can’t reuse it. You might have to replace your zipper if the slider is broken or the teeth keep separating. [8] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. Old zippers can warp or stretch, which can make it impossible to close your luggage all the way."

      "content": "Slide the zipper off the zipper teeth. Once the zipper stop is gone, you can go ahead and grab the existing zipper and pull it off your bag. If your zipper is locked into position, grab a paperclip and stick it underneath the sliding base of the zipper, then gently tug upwards. If your zipper slider has a lock on it, this will unlock it from the zipper teeth so you can slide it off your luggage. Then, throw the old zipper away. [9] X Research source"

Line the zipper stop up with the end of the zipper teeth, then pinch the 2 sides together. Keep pinching until the zipper stop stays on by itself so your zipper doesn’t fall off again. [11] X Research source Once your zipper stop is on, you’re done! Your new zipper should work flawlessly, and you shouldn’t have any more issues with your luggage."
