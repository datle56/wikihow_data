      "content": "Most rubbing alcohol is at least 60% alcohol and can’t go down the sink. Rubbing alcohol is typically around 60% isopropyl alcohol, meaning that it cannot be safely poured down the drain. However, it can be if there’s less than 5% alcohol in the solution. Check the ingredients list of your rubbing alcohol. If it has less than 5% alcohol, empty it into the sink. If it has more than 5% alcohol, consider alternative disposal methods. [1] X Research source Any substance or solution above 5% alcohol shouldn’t be dumped down the drain because it’s flammable and can be hazardous to aquatic life and the ecosystem. If you do dispose of your rubbing alcohol down the drain, make sure to run or pour water down the drain afterward to flush it through the pipes. [2] X Research source Pouring a hazardous chemical down the drain should be done with caution, even if it’s regulated, as it may result in liquid and vapors that cause fires and explosions.

Make a plan to stop by during their hours of operation, where you can give them the sealed, labeled containers of rubbing alcohol.

      "content": "Flush rubbing alcohol into a sanitary sewer system if it’s less than 5% alcohol. If your container contains less than 5% rubbing alcohol, pour it into a utility sink, toilet, or other sanitary drain. After dumping the alcohol, pour a lot of water down the drain to dilute the alcohol. [6] X Research source You may want to wear eyeglasses and gloves when you flush the rubbing alcohol. If you pour 1 cup (240 mL) of rubbing alcohol down the drain, be sure to flush it out with 10 to 20 cups (2,400 to 4,700 mL) of water afterward. Never pour rubbing alcohol into a storm sewer. Many standard rubbing alcohol containers are over 50% concentrated, so this option might not work for everyone.

      "title": "Yes, isopropyl alcohol does expire.",
      "content": "Yes, isopropyl alcohol does expire. Each bottle of isopropyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol has an expiration date, which is generally 2 to 3 years from the creation or manufacturing date. This is because the alcohol inside the solution becomes less potent over time. The longer the product is open, the faster the alcohol fades and loses its disinfecting benefits. [14] X Research source Can you use expired isopropyl alcohol? You could use expired isopropyl alcohol, but it won’t have the same disinfecting strength. It’s best to dispose of the old bottle and purchase a new one."
