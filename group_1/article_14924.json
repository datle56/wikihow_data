      "content": "Breathe out, lick the salt, down your tequila shot and bite the lime. Some people prefer biting the lime before they breathe in, so they don't taste the liquor as much. When you drink the shot, throw your head back and try to swallow all of the tequila in one gulp. You are taking a shot, after all. Try using pineapple juice as a chaser to the tequila instead of a lime. Enjoy the shot of tequila but before taking a breath, drink the pineapple juice. It will cut the taste of the liquor.
