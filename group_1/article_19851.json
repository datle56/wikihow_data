      "content": "Drink more water to flush out extra fluids. It may seem counter-intuitive, but the more water you drink, the less you’ll retain. Drink water or other hydrating fluids, such as light fruit juices or low-sodium broths, to keep excess fluids moving through your system. You can also boost your fluid intake by eating plenty of water-rich foods, like juicy fruits and vegetables. [1] X Research source Avoid sports drinks, which contain sodium and sweeteners that can cause you to retain fluids. Steer clear of dehydrating beverages, like alcohol, tea, and coffee. If quitting alcohol, even temporarily, is difficult for you, talk to your doctor. They can offer advice on how to quit or cut back. Drinking coffee can also be a hard habit to shake. Consider weaning yourself off slowly for a few days before you drop it altogether."
