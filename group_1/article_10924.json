      "content": "Choose a US size 000 (1.5 mm) crochet hook to use on your hair. This is the smallest size crochet hook available, so it is your best choice for crocheting hair. [1] X Research source If you are unable to find this, then go up to the next available size, such as a US size 00 (1.75 mm) or 0 (2.0 mm). [2] X Research source Don’t use a size any bigger than a US size 1 (2.25 mm) crochet hook, which is the largest size that you can use for delicate crochet work, such as lace-making and crocheting dreads."

      "title": "Divide your hair into 4 or more sections depending on its thickness.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into 4 or more sections depending on its thickness. Use a comb to divide your hair down the center of your head going from front to back. Press 1 end of the comb against your scalp at the center of your forehead where your hairline starts. Then, run 1 end of the comb across these sections going from ear to ear. Clip each section up 1 at a time to keep the hair out of your way. The number of sections you will need to divide your hair into will depend on the thickness and texture of your hair. If you have fine hair, then 4 sections will be plenty. If your hair is thick or coarse, then you may need to divide it into 8 sections."

      "content": "Take out a 1 in (2.5 cm) section from the back of your head. Unclip one of the sections near the back of your head, and brush or comb through it if it is tangled. Then, use your comb to take out a 1 in (2.5 cm) section of hair from this section, and clip the rest of the hair back up. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Back comb",
      "content": "Back comb the section of hair from ends to roots. Hold the section near the ends and comb backwards by about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the ends to the roots. Then, lift the comb out of the hair, move it about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) up the hair shaft and back comb again. Repeat this until you get to the scalp. [5] X Research source Back combing creates texture in a section of hair, so you will need to back comb each section before you crochet it into a dreadlock. The section of hair should look fluffy when you finish back combing it."

Insert the crochet hook through the section of hair about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from where the section meets the scalp. Get a few strands of hair on the hook on the other side of the section. [6] X Research source Make sure that there are only a few strands of hair on your crochet hook! This is all it will take to start locking the dread."

Make sure that the hairs don’t slip off as you do this. If they do, you will need to repeat the step to get a few hairs on the hook again. [7] X Research source If you have a latch-style hook, this part will be easier since the latch will prevent the hook from snagging on the hairs in the section. If not, you will just need to work more carefully to avoid catching additional hairs on the hook."

Insert the hook into the dread about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) down from where you started, hook a few strands of hair, and pull them through the section again. Keep going until you reach the bottom of the section. [8] X Research source As you work, you will notice the dreadlock taking shape. Ideally, your dreads will have smooth edges with no bits of hair poking out of the sides, but they should still feel spongy when you squeeze them. If you notice hairs poking out of a section of the dread once you reach the bottom, simply go back to that section and use the crochet hook to grasp them and pull them through."

Push the crochet hook into the dread about halfway and pull it back quickly a few times while keeping the hook inside of the dread. Then, move down the section about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) and repeat.

After you have secured the locks, you may still notice some of them are looser at the roots than you would like them to be. If they are, you can tighten them by pulling a whole dreadlock through itself at the root. Insert the crochet hook into the base of the dreadlock at the root to create an opening. Then, grasp the strand about halfway down, and pull it through the opening you made with the crochet hook at the scalp. This is optional, but it may help to make your dreadlocks lay flatter against your head and look tighter."

Position the crochet hook so that it is parallel to your dreadlock and the hook is beside the end of the dreadlock. [11] X Research source If desired, you may also fold over the 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of hair end of your dreadlock before you start blunting it. This may help to speed up the process."
