If you've seen a moth or two fluttering around but aren't sure if you have an all-out infestation, look for these signs: Tiny holes in your sweaters or other items of clothing. If you see holes in one sweater, you'll probably find more. Check all of your clothes made with wool, feathers, fur, and silk. Clothing that looks dusty or discolored, or has a musty smell. Webbing in corners of the closet or on clothing."

      "content": "Set out moth traps. To take care of the immediate problem of moths in your closet, trap them with pheromone moth traps, which attract and kill them with a sticky substance that they can't escape once they touch. You can make your own moth traps with flypaper and fish oil, which attracts moths. Dab a bit on some flypaper and hang it in your closet. [1] X Research source Traps designed to catch mice are also effective for catching moths. In particular, look for zapper style traps with infrared sensors, as these will sense the moth approaching and zap it when it nears the bait."

If possible, put them through a hot dryer. Items that cannot be dried on high heat can be placed in the freezer for a few days to kill any eggs. Wash linens, towels, and any other cloth items stored in your closet. Remove suitcases, bags and other containers, and wash these as well."

Use soapy water or a vinegar and water solution to clean the closet floor and walls. Dip a sponge scrubber into the solution and scrub the walls to scratch off all the eggs. Clean especially well in cracks and crevices.< [2] X Research source Vacuum well. Use a high-powered vacuum to clean the carpet in your closet. While you're at it, vacuum the bedroom area, too, since moths may have laid eggs there.

Placing mothballs in your closet is an effective way to kill moths, but the chemicals mothballs are made with are toxic to humans, and they leave a strong scent in your closet and on your clothes. Try these alternatives: Sachets made with dried rosemary, thyme, cloves, lavender, or bay leaves. Simply fill a small cloth bag with these ingredients, tie it with a string, and hang it up. Essential oils made from these herbs can be sprinkled in your closet or on your clothing as an effective moth deterrent."

Moths can eat through cardboard boxes. If you see tiny holes in your pantry items, throw them out. Moths can also get into tiny spaces.
