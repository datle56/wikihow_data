Get into the first position by standing with your legs together and your toes pointed out. Lift your arms out in front of you and form them into an oval. Bend your knees and slowly lower your body down toward the ground, keeping your heels flat on the floor. Squeeze your muscles in as you come back up. This is called a demi plié. [9] X Research source In French demi means half. So, with a demi-pliè, you will only go a quarter to a half of the way down depending on the style of ballet. Pliés are pronounced as Plea-AE. You can hold onto a ballet barre or the back of a chair for support if you need it. Always start with lightly placing a hand on something to help stabilize you. At home, your makeshift barre should be slightly above elbow height. Remember the barre is only there to help if and when needed. Try not to become dependent on the barre for balance. Work on finding your balance by going through the moves slowly pausing in each one until you feel you have a stable connection to the ground then slowly move to your next position or move. Doing this will help when you advance. And move to center work. After you can do a demi plié, move on to the grande pliés. It's the same move, except that you lift your heels off the floor. This is similar to a squat but you have your heels together and your toes pointed out."

(work on tendue from all 5 positions this is a good warm-up for your legs at the barre) You can use a tendue to transition from the first to the second position.
