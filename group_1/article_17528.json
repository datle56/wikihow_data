      "title": "Locate the problem.",
      "content": "Locate the problem. Walk back and forth with your shoes, then rock your feet forward and back, then left to right. When you find the motion that causes the squeak, look for the parts of the shoe that bend during that motion. Try having a friend crouch near the floor and listen carefully while you walk."

      "title": "Sprinkle with powder.",
      "content": "Sprinkle with powder. Once you know what part of the shoe is squeaking, sprinkle that area with baby powder, corn starch, or baking powder. This will absorb noisy moisture, and reduce noise from two shoe parts rubbing together. Here are a few common problem areas and how to fix them: If the inside of the shoe squeaks, lift the insoles and sprinkle powder along the inner seam. If your insoles are non-removable, rub the powder into the edge of your shoe base. Powder the tongue of the shoe under the laces if the tongue squeaks. If the base of the shoe squeaks, there are probably air cushions. Massage the powder into the base at the seam or air bubble. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Swab with WD40 or silicone spray.",
      "content": "Swab with WD40 or silicone spray. These are more effective at removing squeaks than leather conditioner, but require careful application to avoid damage. Spray one of these lubricants onto a cotton swab or cotton ball. Rub it into the outside seam of the shoe, working along the squeaky area or its entire outline. [2] X Research source Donâ€™t use oil-based materials on suede or the fuzzy nap could be destroyed."

      "title": "Rub with leather conditioner.",
      "content": "Rub with leather conditioner. If you are using leather shoes, keep them lubricated by rubbing in a leather conditioner and buffing with a dry cloth. Be sure to purchase suede conditioner for suede shoes, not general purpose leather conditioner."

      "title": "Know the return policy before trying these methods.",
      "content": "Know the return policy before trying these methods. If you are trying to fix a new shoe, the squeak may be a manufacturing defect that makes you eligible for a refund or replacement. Using glue or other heavy-duty materials may void your warranty."

    {
      "title": "Try saddle soap.",
      "content": "Try saddle soap. Saddle soap is controversial among owners of fine leather shoes. Some claim it causes the leather to dry out, while others find it harmless. If you're willing to take this risk, apply saddle soap in small quantities to the problem area, and buff with a dry cloth. This may be particularly effective on a squeaky tongue. Never use saddle soap on suede."

      "title": "Glue on loose heels.",
      "content": "Glue on loose heels. This should only be done if none of the \"easy fixes\" above work, since excess glue can easily damage or stain shoes. If the shoe heel is loose, use a small dab super glue or rubber cement to reattach it firmly, pressing together for several seconds until the adhesive begins to take hold. This will not work on urethane shoes. Take expensive high heels to a shoe repair shop instead to avoid the risk of damage."

    {
      "title": "Fill damaged soles with silicone caulk.",
      "content": "Fill damaged soles with silicone caulk. Purchase a tube of silicone caulking material with a squeeze top, or a specialized silicone product for shoe repair. Stick the nozzle of the tube into an open space between the shoe and the sole, and slowly squirt it in until the void is filled. Clamp the shoe together with rubber bands, weights, or hardware clamps and let dry overnight."

      "title": "Take the shoes to a repair shop.",
      "content": "Take the shoes to a repair shop. Take the shoes to a cobbler or repair shop and ask for advice, or hire someone to fix it for you. About half of squeaky shoes squeak due to a loose shank inside the shoe, or another problem that should be left to a professional."

      "title": "Check the cause of squeaking in your wet shoes.",
      "content": "Check the cause of squeaking in your wet shoes. Many shoes are only squeaky when wet. Sometimes, this is just the sound made by rubber soles on linoleum, hard wood, or other slick floor materials. Other shoes swell up or develop structural issues when wet that cause squeaking, and these can be treated using the other methods on this page. Either way, the drying methods in this section will teach you to dry your shoes quickly and effectively, without causing damage to the shoe."

      "title": "Use a cedar shoe tree if possible.",
      "content": "Use a cedar shoe tree if possible. A \"shoe tree\" is a branched object inserted into the shoe instead of newspaper, meant to maintain the shoe's shape while it dries. A shoe tree made of cedar is especially effective, since the wood will wick moisture out of the shoe."

      "content": "Leave on its side at room temperature. Rest the shoe on its side or prop it against a wall so the sole of the shoe is exposed to the air while drying. Dry in a warm room, but not next to any heat sources. [3] X Research source"
