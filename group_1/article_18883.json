Some areas include South Province, East Province, West Province, North Province, Glaseado Mountain, Casseroya Lake, and Asado Desert.

Go to the areas where you previously looked, and Gimmighoul will respawn after some time, so you can endlessly farm for those coins. [2] X Research source Tip: When you see a Gimmighoul chest, save your game immediately. This way, you can perform a soft reset (turn the game off, then back on) and battle the Gimmighoul chest for more coins. [3] X Research source"
