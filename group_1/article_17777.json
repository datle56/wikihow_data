This could include skin near your cuticle that you pushed back with the manicuring sticks, but be very careful to only cut away skin that is loose, soft and translucent, not your actual cuticles. Only cut the skin that has grown out over your nail and is now loose. Never cut the skin that surrounds and protects your nail, which is your upper cuticle. Your cuticles serve a function; they keep germs and bacteria from getting into your body through the area around your nails. Clipping that area is going to make you extra susceptible to infections.
