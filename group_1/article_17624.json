      "content": "Add some motor oil to your key and try unlocking the glove box. Sometimes if the internal mechanism of your lock is stuck or rusted, it can make it difficult for your key to properly unlock it. Take some standard motor oil, add a drop to your key, and rub it over the surface so the key is fully coated. Then, slide the key into your glove box and try unlocking it. Don’t force the key too hard or it could snap off and ruin your lock for good."

      "content": "Spray brake cleaner into the lock if the oil doesn’t work. If lubricating the lock with motor oil doesn’t do the trick, you can try blasting away any corrosion or dirt that may be caught in the internal mechanism. Use spray brake cleaner, place the nozzle against the opening of the lock, and spray the cleaner directly into the lock. Then, try unlocking the glove box with your key to see if that works. You can find brake cleaner at your local auto supply shop."

      "content": "Use a lock replacement kit that matches your car’s make and model. If the glove box lock isn’t working, you’ll need to replace it with a new one that does. Look for a replacement kit that matches your car at your local auto supply shop or try ordering one online. Following the directions on the packaging, you’ll need to remove the old cylinder from the body of your lock, pop in the new one, and then secure it back into place. [3] X Research source Every lock is a little bit different, but if you have the right tools, you may be able to handle it on your own. For example, some locks may require you to unscrew a mounting plate inside the compartment, and most locks will have pins that you’ll need to depress with a narrow tool like an awl or coat hanger so you can slide the old lock out."

Remove the old latch (usually by unscrewing some screws located at the bottom of the latch) and replace it with the new one. Replace any screws you removed to secure the latch and try opening and closing the glove box a few times to make sure it’s working properly. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try prying it open with a screwdriver as a last resort. If you don’t want to hire a locksmith, and you aren’t worried about potentially damaging your glove box, you can try to force it open with a flathead screwdriver. Slide the screwdriver into the space where your glove box connects to your dashboard and pry it open. Once you’ve wedged it open enough, you can try pulling the glove box open. Keep in mind it may be really tough to pry the glove box open and you’ll more than likely damage your lock."

      "title": "The price can vary widely depending on your make and model.",
      "content": "The price can vary widely depending on your make and model. Some replacement glove boxes can cost around $350 USD. If you only need a small part replaced, such as a latch or handle, it’ll likely be much cheaper than a full replacement. Additionally, auto repair shops can charge between $47 and $215 USD per hour of labor. A simple repair may take about an hour or so, but a full replacement could require several hours of work. For instance, if you needed a full replacement for a glove box costing $350 USD, your auto repair professional charges $50 USD per hour, and it takes them 3 hours to complete the job, it could cost up to $500 USD."
