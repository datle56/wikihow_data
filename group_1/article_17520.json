      "content": "Do a spot test. Before applying the wood stain to the scratch, test the marker on an inconspicuous area of the wood to see how well it matches. If it is a good match, then you can use it on your scratch. Stain markers come in many colors, and can be found in home department stores, hardware stores, and paint stores. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the marker to the stain. If you are confident that the marker is a good match, then run the tip of the marker over the scratch a few times to stain it. Don’t worry if the stained area looks a little light. You can go over the area again after your rub off the excess."

      "title": "Rub the stain into the scratch.",
      "content": "Rub the stain into the scratch. Lightly press a clean rag soaked in a bit of mineral spirits onto the wood, focusing on the scratched area. Rub the area where you applied the stain to remove any residual, following the grain of the wood. [2] X Research source This application method works best (rather than directly drawing the stain marker over the scratch), because it allows for a gradual addition of stain. If you use the marker to draw and fill in the stain directly, you can saturate the scratch with stain, and end up making the scratch darker than the surrounding wood. [3] X Research source Drawing straight onto the scratch like that can make the scratch mark even more obvious."

      "content": "Clean the scratched area. If the protective coating of the hardwood floor is scratched, use a soft rag (such as a microfiber cloth) and a small amount of hardwood floor cleaner to remove any contaminants from the scratched area. [4] X Research source Any and all small dust particles must be removed from the scratched area so they don’t get preserved in the floor when you add sealant."

    {
      "title": "Apply a top coating.",
      "content": "Apply a top coating. When the scratched area is completely dry, use a small tipped brush to apply a thin layer of protective finish to the scratched area of the floor. This protective finish could be a sealant, shellac, or some other kind of polyurethane varnish. Ideally, you would use the same kind of finish that is already on the hardwood floor. Consult an employee at your local hardware store for advice on what kind of finish you should use on the floor. If you are an inexperienced wood worker, or if your hardwood floor has a specialty finish (such as a high gloss polyurethane finish), consider hiring a professional to repair and finish the floor. [6] X Research source Since hiring a professional will cost more money, it might be most cost-effective to let scratches accumulate, rather than hiring a company to fix one small scratch."

Rub the wax stick back and forth over the scratched area to fill in the scratch. If needed, use a plastic tipped putty knife to force the wax down into the scratch.

If your floors don't have that coating, you don’t need to worry about removing the top finish of the floor. Dampen a scouring pad with mineral spirits, and gently rub the scratched area of the floor. [13] X Research source Wipe over the area with a clean cloth, and let the area dry completely. If you are inexperienced with woodworking and sealing, it’s advisable to hire a professional to repair the flooring."

Use your finger to work the wood filler into the scratch or gouge, spreading the filler in all directions to remove air bubbles. [14] X Research source You can be generous with the wood filler, because excess filler will be removed later. Be sure to apply wood filler rather than wood putty. The two substances are different, and using wood putty to fill the scratch can alter the effectiveness of matching the filling to the color of the floor, and affect the filling from properly taking the color of staining, if applied.

      "title": "Seal the patched area.",
      "content": "Seal the patched area. Apply a thin layer of the same sealer used on the rest of the hardwood floor to the patched area. Use either a small, natural bristle brush or a lamb’s wool roller to apply the layer of polyurethane, varnish, or sealer. Allow the sealer a complete 24 hours to dry before any traffic is allowed on the surface. If you use a foam roller, you run the risk of leaving air bubbles in the sealer. You will need to apply at least two coats of finish for best results."
