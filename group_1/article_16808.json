      "content": "Look for contacts with a green checkmark. When you log in to your Skype account, contacts that are currently online and available will have a green checkmark next to their username in the contacts list. Windows versions of Skype typically default to showing all your contacts upon login. Find the list along the left side of the Skype window, in a sidebar, with your online contacts automatically at the top of this list. On Skype for Mac, your view upon login depends on the screen you were showing when you last logged out. To view your contacts, click \"Contacts\" along the left sidebar. Online contacts who are available to chat will have both a green checkmark and a status which reads \"Online\" next to their name."

You can view all your contacts at once (\"All\") or only those who are currently online (\"Online\"). If you've linked other accounts or address books (e.g. Facebook) these will also appear as viewing options. On Skype for Windows access these options by looking for a small dropdown menu (by default set to \"All\") under your Contacts menu but above the actual list of names. On Mac versions, adjusting the list is accomplished by choosing one of the same options along the top of the main window. Contacts in Skype may also be logged in but inactive. This is indicated by a yellow clock icon. They will be included in online lists and are reachable, however the icon indicates that they have been inactive on Skype for an extended period of time."
