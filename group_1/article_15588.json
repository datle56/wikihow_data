The ancient Egyptians also worshipped a vulture goddess known as Nekhbet, who was said to protect the pharaoh with her vulture wings. Her vulture headdress was seen as a symbol of maternal protection and was often worn by female pharaohs and royal wives. [54] X Research source It was also believed in ancient Egypt that all vultures were born female and without male intervention. Because of this idea, as well as the vultures’ habit of eating carrion, they were thought to be transformative figures representing death and rebirth. Alongside these meanings, vultures were thought to protect children and were considered sacred to the point that killing one was punishable by death."

      "content": "These symbols were largely used as the main writing system. Hieroglyphic symbols were used as a written form of the ancient Egyptian language. These symbols were used on temples and tombs as well as throughout artistic pieces and architectural designs—like jewelry, pottery pieces, statues, and amulets. The symbols were used to show concepts and emotions, and they were especially important in a society where most citizens couldn’t read or write. Thanks to the use of Egyptian symbols, lower classes without a formal education were able to understand and pass down stories and cultural norms. [57] X Research source Symbols weren’t only used as a way for ancient Egyptians to communicate with each other , but also as a way to communicate with gods. As a result, subsequent generations and modern historians were and are able to understand the spiritual world and beliefs of ancient Egyptians."

      "content": "The symbols also played a key role in religion and afterlife beliefs. Ancient Egyptian symbols and hieroglyphics were often referred to as the “words of the gods,” and many Egyptians believed that these symbols carried a powerful force that connected them to the heavens and to the natural forces around them. As a result, these symbols were an important foundation of the ancient Egyptians’ religious beliefs and were often carved and incorporated into religious objects like amulets, statues, paintings, carvings, and temples. [58] X Research source Unsurprisingly, ancient Egyptian symbols played an important role in religious rituals and were often held by pharaohs and high priests during their religious work. In particular, certain symbols were used during funerary rituals and other practices related to the afterlife. The concept of death and rebirth is crucial to ancient Egyptian beliefs, and symbols were used to guide deceased souls on the start of their new journey into the afterlife. Protective symbols like the Eye of Horus may have been used to protect the deceased after death, while symbols associated with certain gods or goddesses may have been used to invoke that deity’s help. But how were these symbols bestowed in death? For the most part, they were carved into amulets and talismans and placed in the tomb or buried with the deceased. Symbolically, they were meant to ensure that the deceased person had a prosperous start to the next phase of their journey through life and death."

They were used to communicate with the gods, and ancient Egyptians also used them to convey how they thought about the gods and their actions. Certain symbols were specifically connected to specific gods—for example, the Eye of Ra represented the eye of the powerful sun god. His eye was often drawn on temples and tombs to safeguard against evil. [59] X Research source Other symbols were closely connected to divine powers. The Ankh, for instance, symbolizes life and life after death. Similarly, Scarab Beetle represents resurrection, while the Bennu Bird conveys the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth."

The most common material used to represent ancient Egyptian symbols was stone, as stone is highly durable and long lasting. Hieroglyphs and other symbols were carved into stone temples, tombs, and more. Different varieties of metal were also commonly used. Gold, lapis lazuli, electrum, silver, and bronze were frequently used to carve symbols into amulets that were thought to offer protection to their wearers. [60] X Research source Household items and day-to-day objects—like furniture, tools, beads, figurines, and some amulets—were usually made out of wood or faience (a ceramic material). Papyrus was also sometimes used in the same way that paper is used in modern times. Ancient Egyptians would record symbols and hieroglyphics onto papyrus scrolls. Typically, stones and metals were used for objects that were meant to stand the test of time, while wood or papyrus would be used for smaller, everyday objects that one would carry around or move often. And, of course, the material used sometimes simply depended on the resources available to the carver or creator."
