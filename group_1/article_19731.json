      "title": "He might take you more seriously if you two sit down together.",
      "content": "He might take you more seriously if you two sit down together. Meet up in a private place where you two can chat, like your home. If he’s hesitant, tell him that it’s important and you really want to see him. [1] X Research source If he doesn’t want to meet up with you, you can do it over text."

    {
      "title": "See what he thinks your relationship is.",
      "content": "See what he thinks your relationship is. A guy who is using you probably won’t be able to answer the question, and he might hem or haw while he makes excuses. Making him say it out loud will help you solidify your decision and make him understand why you’re doing what you’re doing. [2] X Research source Say something like, “We’ve been seeing each other for months now. What are we?” He might try to placate you with answers like, “We’re just seeing how it goes,” or, “Well, I don’t like labels.” If he can’t commit to dating you exclusively, that’s a red flag."

      "title": "Let him know that you want to be in a committed partnership.",
      "content": "Let him know that you want to be in a committed partnership. If he can’t do that for you, then he’s not the one for you.

      "title": "Tell him that you don’t want to see him anymore.",
      "content": "Tell him that you don’t want to see him anymore. Be firm, and don’t back down if he questions your decision or tries to get you to change your mind. If he tries sweet-talking you, tell him that you’ve heard it all before and you aren’t going to fall for it again. Try to use “I” statements so he doesn’t get defensive, like: [5] X Research source “Whatever we’re doing just isn’t working out for me. I feel like I need someone more committed, and I don’t think that’s what you’re looking for right now.” Reader Poll: We asked 179 wikiHow readers if they think it's acceptable to ghost someone, and 53% said No . [Take Poll] If you’ve been on a few dates with someone or are dating them more seriously, it’s best to be honest with them and tell them how you feel, instead."

      "title": "If he asks, you can elaborate.",
      "content": "If he asks, you can elaborate. Tell him that he’s just not the one for you, and that you’d probably both be happier in a different situation. You could also tell him that you’re feeling used and that you don’t want to continue feeling that way. [6] X Research source Try something like, “Honestly, it kind of feels like you’ve been using me for the past few months. We only meet up to have sex, and I don’t feel like we really know each other on a deeper level.”"

      "title": "He might hit you up for a booty call one last time.",
      "content": "He might hit you up for a booty call one last time. If you get the dreaded “You up?” text at 2 AM, just delete the message. If it keeps happening, it might be time to block his number. [7] X Research source There’s no need to respond to his text, even to tell him to go away. Your lack of a response will send a message."

    {
      "title": "Seeing him online will only make this harder.",
      "content": "Seeing him online will only make this harder. Remove him from your Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook so you don’t have to see any updates about his life. If he’s really hung up on you, he might post things to make you jealous, and you don’t need to see any of that. [8] X Research source If he tries to contact you on social media, it might be best to block him."

    {
      "title": "Focus on your friends and family to move on from him.",
      "content": "Focus on your friends and family to move on from him. Make plans to hang out with your BFFs for brunch, or go visit your parents for a little comfort. You can tell them what’s going on with you, or you can simply use them as a distraction from the guy who’s got you down. [9] X Research source If you feel ready, you could even try dating again. However, it might be best to take a little time to be single for now. It's okay if you feel hurt or sad after you end things. Be compassionate with yourself as you work through your feelings.
