[2] X Research source You could also use the formula P = S + S + S + S {\\displaystyle P=S+S+S+S} to find the perimeter, since the perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all its sides. [3] X Research source If you know that not all sides are the same length, then you are not working with a rhombus, and you cannot use this formula. If you don’t know the length of any side of the rhombus, you cannot use this method. A square is a special type of rhombus, with four 90-degree angles."
