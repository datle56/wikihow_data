      "title": "Check if an exception applies.",
      "content": "Check if an exception applies. California’s ban on cell phone use has several exceptions. The easiest way to fight the ticket is to show that an exception applies to you. Check the following: [2] X Research source Were you making an emergency call? The law doesn’t apply to you if you were calling the police, fire department, or emergency services. Were you operating an authorized emergency vehicle? If so, then you shouldn’t get a ticket. Were you operating your vehicle on private property? The law doesn’t apply in this situation. Were you checking your GPS or doing something other than texting or talking on the phone? If so, that isn’t illegal. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Identify other defenses.",
      "content": "Identify other defenses. You can always claim you weren’t using your phone and that the officer is mistaken. You can also raise these other defenses: You weren’t moving. You can argue you were actually parked when you were using your cell phone. Your passenger used the phone. The officer might have seen someone using the phone, but it wasn’t you. You were using speakerphone. If you are at least 18 or older, the law allows you to do this. You used a hands-free phone. Drivers 18 and older can use hands-free phones like Bluetooth or other earpieces, so long as both ears aren’t covered. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Find witnesses.",
      "content": "Find witnesses. You’ll strengthen your case if other people can testify on your behalf. Make sure the witness has relevant information, which will depend on your defense. For example, your defense might be that you were using the speakerphone on your cell phone. In that situation, someone sitting in the car with you would make a good witness. You can make a witness show up to court and testify by serving them with a subpoena. Get subpoenas from the court clerk’s office. If the witness is unable to appear in court, they can submit an affidavit, which is a notarized letter testifying to what they saw."

      "title": "Hire a traffic attorney if you need help.",
      "content": "Hire a traffic attorney if you need help. California doesn’t offer free attorneys for traffic citations, so you’ll need to hire someone yourself. Get a lawyer if you don’t know how to defend yourself or are feeling overwhelmed. Find a traffic attorney by contacting California’s state bar or a lawyer referral service in your county. Ask how much the attorney charges. You shouldn’t hire someone if you can’t afford them."

      "title": "Choose your type of trial.",
      "content": "Choose your type of trial. You can fight the ticket in 1 of 2 ways: by having a court trial or a trial by mail. A court trial is a 2-step process: you request an arraignment where the judge reads the charges against you and you enter a plea. Then you attend a trial. With a trial by written declaration, you never show up to court. You waive the arraignment and instead present written evidence. However, these cases are harder to win and not everyone has the option of a trial by written declaration. Check your ticket or courtesy notice, which might state you need to appear in court.

Go to court on that date and ask the court clerk for an arraignment. [6] X Research source You’ll need to schedule an arraignment and a trial date. In some counties, you may be able to schedule them both on the same day. At the arraignment, you will plead not guilty. You can also request a trial by written declaration when you go to court."

At this time, present your evidence and ask the officer if they’re willing to dismiss the case. This is also a good opportunity to show remorse and explain that you have learned your lesson.

If you don’t, then you should prepare a list of questions to ask. The questions will depend on your situation, but consider asking the following: “What color car was I driving?” or “What color jacket was I wearing?” You want to cast doubt on the officer’s ability to see clearly. [10] X Research source If the officer doesn’t know the answers to these questions, it shows they weren’t paying close attention. “How fast was I going?” This is a good defense if you claim you weren’t moving.

You want to be a credible witness, so do the following: Sit up straight. Slouching signals you’re afraid of the truth. Push your shoulders back and look everyone in the eye. Avoid guessing. If you don’t know an answer, say, “I don’t know.” That’s better than guessing and being wrong. [13] X Research source Speak in whole words and sentences.

Tell the judge why you didn’t break the law and remember to mention specific pieces of evidence. For example, your defense might be that a passenger was using the phone, not you. In that case, your argument might sound something like this: “Your Honor, the evidence shows I didn’t use the phone while driving. My 2 witnesses, Mrs. Kim and Ms. White, testified that Mrs. Kim was using the phone as she sat in the passenger’s seat. There’s no reason to credit Officer Kendrick’s testimony. He didn’t even know the color of my car or the color of the sweater I was wearing. He simply testified that he saw someone on the phone.”"
