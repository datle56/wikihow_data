      "content": "Reflect on your motives. Ask yourself if you're in love with a man who happens to be rich, or if you're dating a man only because he's rich. If the diamond earrings he gives you are more meaningful than his tender kisses, then chances are, you're in the relationship for the wrong reasons, and it won't last. [1] X Expert Source Alessandra Conti Celebrity Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 23 April 2021. Here are a few questions to ask yourself to help understand your true intentions: Would he still be a great catch without the fancy house and ride? If you're not sure if you would still love your current interest if he lived in a studio apartment and drove a car that was older than you, then you may be in love with what he owns, not who he is. Are you twenty years old while he's approaching retirement age? Though age may be just a number, \"Sugar Daddy\" is more than just a word. Is \"he's rich\" the first thing that comes to mind when someone asks what you love about him? If you're this obsessed with his wealth, then it's likely you don't respect his other good qualities--or that they don't exist. Do you have a history of only dating rich men? If he's the tenth rich man you've dated, then this quality could be the only thing you care about, and it may be time to reflect on what you're really looking for in a relationship."

      "content": "Enjoy his riches, but reciprocate however you can. Sure, the champagne and oysters are a treat, but if you start asking for them every night without offering anything in return, your man may suspect that you're falling in love with his bank account, not his intelligence or sense of humor. Find a balance between expensive activities and those that anyone can afford. [2] X Research source Pick up the tab once in a while. Even if you're short on funds, it's important to show that you care, even if it's only by paying for the movie after he pays for dinner, or picking up drinks at a bar. You can also look out for special deals at normally-expensive restaurants, or see which local bar is having a free live music night, so you can still afford the delicious food and fun ambiance. Treat him to an inexpensive meal. You can invite him over and cook a delicious, but inexpensive meal over a reasonably-priced bottle of wine, or prepare a tasty picnic, which will show that you put time and effort into planning your dates. Invite him to join you for an inexpensive activity. Ask him to do outdoor activities, such as taking walks, hiking, or just sunbathing at the beach. If it's too cold to spend much time outside, invite him to explore a new museum or bookstore in your neighborhood. This will show that his presence is more important than his presents."

      "content": "Don't be awkward about his wealth. If he's the right guy, he wouldn't want to repeatedly hear you mention how rich he is or how much you love dating a rich person. This may make him lose confidence in himself--and your relationship. When you introduce him to your new friends, make sure to tell them to be discreet. If one of them says, \"Oh, so you're the rich guy I've heard so much about,\" it may sound as if this is the only quality on your mind. If he wants to pay for something fancy, let him pay. If he's determined to take you to the opera or a fancy vacation, you don't want to ruin his kind gesture by repeatedly saying, \"This must cost a fortune...\" This will ruin the romantic mood, and will keep you from enjoying his gesture."

While you don't have to mirror his every move, especially if you don't have the funds, it's nice to have shared interests, and to have a better understanding of the world he comes from. And the more you have in common, the more likely your love is to grow. Look the part. If you want your outfit to look expensive, simpler is always better. Really focus on wearing accessories that are simple, clean, and well-madeâ€”it's not about wearing designer labels. A good, high-quality pair of shoes can also help a simple outfit look great. [3] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist & Speaker Expert Interview. 29 July 2020. Learn \"rich\" hobbies. Try your hand at sports that cater to the wealthy, such as yachting, polo, or tennis. You'll learn a new skill, make new friends, and have fun in the process! [4] X Research source"

You should make a good impression and show how much you love your new beau--not his new yacht. If you're nervous about meeting his friends, you can keep a low profile when you first meet them to get a sense of their group dynamics, and then jump into a friendly conversation that shows you're not intimidated by their wealth. If you're meeting his family for the first time, try not to talk about his money, or all of the extravagant things you've done together. Chances are, he has dated a gold-digger before, and his family may already be on the lookout for any hints that your intentions aren't pure. Be yourself. Even if you have to adjust your approach at first, remember to always be yourself. If your man loves the real you, then his friends and family are sure to follow. [5] X Research source"

In the end, remember that rich people aren't so different from the rest of us--they just have more money. Treat this relationship like any other. Have open and honest communication. It's important to tell him what's on your mind, and if his wealth has made you uncomfortable. [6] X Research source Tell him one new thing you love about him every day. This will ensure that he knows you love what's in his heart, not his wallet. If you love your relationship, don't feel guilty about enjoying the perks of dating a rich man. And if you end up taking a trip to Venice in the process, then all the better!"
