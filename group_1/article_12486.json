      "content": "Determine how far labor has progressed. The first stage of labor is called the “latent” stage, where the body is getting ready to deliver by dilating the cervix. It can take 12-24 hours, especially if this is the person's first child. The second, or “active,” stage occurs when the cervix has completely dilated to 10 cm or more. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source People may not experience as much pain or discomfort during the first stage as they do in later stages. If the cervix is fully dilated, and you can see the baby's head crowning, they're in stage two. Wash your hands, skip to the next section, and get ready to catch the baby. Unless you have been trained to do so, don't try to examine the cervix. Just watch to see if the head begins to appear."

The further along labor is, the more regular, stronger, and closer together contractions become. Here's what you need to know about contractions: [3] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Contractions that are 10 minutes apart or less are a sign that a person has entered labor. Physicians recommend that you contact the hospital when contractions are 5 minutes apart and last 60 seconds, and this activity has been going on for an hour. If this is the case, you probably have time to make it to the hospital if you live close to one. First-time parents are likely to give birth when contractions are three to five minutes apart and last 40 to 90 seconds, increasing in strength and frequency for at least an hour. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the contractions are two minutes or less apart, buckle down and get ready to deliver the baby, especially if the person has given birth quickly in the past. Also, if the parent feels like they're going to have a bowel movement, the baby is probably moving through the birth canal, creating pressure on the rectum, and is on their way out. If the baby is preterm, then you should contact the person's physician and emergency services at any signs of labor."

Don't wear things like dishwashing gloves, which are likely loaded with bacteria. To finish (or if you don't have access to soap and water), use an alcohol-based hand sanitizing product or rubbing alcohol to kill off any bacteria and viruses that may have been on your skin. This helps prevent giving the birthing parent or the baby an infection."

There will be a mess afterwards, so you may want to have absorbent pads near the birthing area or set up somewhere you don't mind getting messy. [7] X Research source Collect clean towels and clean sheets. If you have clean, waterproof tablecloths or a clean vinyl shower curtain, these are excellent at preventing blood and other fluids from staining furniture or carpeting. In a pinch, you can use newspapers, but they are not as sanitary. Get a blanket or something warm and soft to wrap the baby in. The infant must be kept warm once they are delivered. Find a few pillows. You might need them to prop up the birthing parent as they're pushing. Cover the pillows with clean sheets or towels. Fill a clean bowl with warm water and get a pair of scissors, a few lengths of string, rubbing alcohol, cotton balls, and a bulb syringe . You may find that sanitary napkins or paper towels are helpful to stop the bleeding later. Get a bucket in case the birthing parent feels nauseated or needs to vomit.

[8] X Research source Ask the birthing parent to undress from the waist down. Provide them with a clean sheet or towel to cover up, if they'd like. Encourage them to breathe. Avoid hyperventilation by speaking in a low, soothing voice and verbally directing their breathing. Encourage them to inhale through the nose and out through the mouth in an even, rhythmic manner. If you're still having trouble, hold their hand and take deep, slow breaths along with them. Butt recommends, “[Have them] take a deep breath in and to hold their breath for 10 seconds while pushing, and then to exhale… We do that three times total for each contraction.” Reassure them. This is probably not the birthing experience they had in mind, and they might be worried about potential complications. Tell them that help is on the way and that you'll do the best you can in the meantime. Remind them that people have given birth outside of hospitals for thousands of years, and that it's more than possible to come through it safely. Validate them. The expectant parent may feel scared, angry, giddy, or any combination of those feelings. Validate whatever they are feeling. Don't try to correct them or argue with them."

      "title": "Help the birthing parent find a comfortable position.",
      "content": "Help the birthing parent find a comfortable position. They might want to walk around or crouch down during this stage of labor, especially when a contraction hits. As they start to transition to the second phase, they might want to settle into a position to give birth or cycle through a few different ones. Switching between positions may help the labor progress more smoothly, but let them decide what's working for their body. Here are four standard positions, and the pros and cons of each: [9] X Research source Squatting: This takes advantage of gravity and can open the birth canal 20%-30% more than other positions. You can help the parent in this position by kneeling behind them and supporting their back. All-fours or kneeling: This position is gravity-neutral and can ease back pain, and the person might instinctively choose it. It can provide pain relief if they have hemorrhoids. Position yourself behind them if that's the case. Side-lying: This leads to a slower descent through the birth canal, but can lead to a more gentle stretching of the perineum and may reduce tearing. Have the parent lie on their side, with their knees bent, and lift the top leg. They might also need to prop themself up on an elbow. Lithotomy position (lying back). This is the most common position used in hospitals, with the patient lying flat on their back and their legs bent at the knee. It allows maximum access for the caregiver, but it puts a lot of pressure on the patient's back and is not considered ideal. It may also make contractions slower and more painful. If the person in labor seems to prefer this position, try putting a few pillows under their back to ease the pain."

      "title": "Guide the birthing parent in pushing.",
      "content": "Guide the birthing parent in pushing. Don't encourage them to push until they feel an unstoppable pressure to do so—you don't want to waste their energy and exhaust them too early. When they’re ready to push, they may feel increased pressure near their lower back, perineum, or rectum. It may even feel to them as though they are ready to have a bowel movement. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When they are ready, you can guide them through the pushing. Ask the parent to curl forward and tuck their chin. This curved position will help the baby through the pelvis. [11] X Research source The area around the vagina will bulge until you see the top of the baby's head (crowning). As soon as the baby crowns, it's time for the parent to push in earnest. Encourage them to focus their abdominal muscles to push down, as you might do when you're trying to urinate faster or have a bowel movement. This can help avoid straining or directing the pushing force upward toward the neck and face. Three to four pushes, lasting 6-8 seconds each, are considered appropriate per contraction. However, it is important to encourage the parent to do whatever comes naturally to them. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep encouraging deep, slow breathing. Pain can be controlled to different extents through mental relaxation and by concentrating on deep breathing instead of panicking or being distracted by everything that is going on. Different people have different levels of mental control, but deep, slow breathing is always a benefit during childbirth. Understand that the person may urinate or have a bowel movement during labor. This is normal and is not a cause for concern. [13] X Research source"

The baby will likely rotate spontaneously. If the baby's head doesn't rotate without help, gently turn it to one side. This should help a shoulder emerge with the next push. Don't push it if you feel any resistance. Deliver the other shoulder. Gently lift the body toward the birthing parent's stomach to help the other shoulder come through. The rest of the body should follow quickly. Keep supporting the head. The body will be slippery.

Instruct them to grab their knees and pull their thighs toward their stomach and chest. This is called the McRoberts position, and it's very effective at helping push the baby out. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Have her push hard with each contraction. Never push on a mother's abdomen to try to help deliver a stuck baby. If the feet come out first, see the section on breech birth below.

First, gently wipe the baby’s mouth and nose with a sterile cloth or gauze to clear any mucus. [20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Rub the body. Physical touch will help the baby breathe. If that's not helping, turn the baby so that they're facing the ceiling, tilt the head back to straighten the airway, and keep rubbing the body. They might not cry, but doing this ensures that the baby gets the air they need. Rubbing vigorously with a clean towel can also help stimulate the baby to breathe. If the baby needs more stimulation, rub their trunk and back or gently tap the soles of the baby's feet with your fingers. Don't slap the baby. Manually clear fluids. If the baby gags or turns blue, wipe fluids out of the mouth and nose with a clean blanket or cloth. If that doesn't do the trick, squeeze the air out of a bulb syringe, put the tip in the nose or mouth, and release the bulb to suck the fluid into the bulb. Repeat until all the fluid is cleared, emptying the bulb between uses. If none of this helps, perform infant CPR ."

They can't thermoregulate on their own before then,” explains Hines. It’s possible to deliver a breech baby vaginally, but there’s a higher risk of injury to the baby’s limbs. There’s also a higher risk of twisting or compressing the umbilical cord, which can cause oxygen deprivation. There may also be more difficulty delivering the baby’s shoulders and head.

Otherwise, leave it alone and just make sure it's not pulled tight. If you do need to cut the cord, first feel the cord gently for a pulse. After about ten minutes, the cord will stop pulsing. According to Hines, midwives prefer to wait until the cord is light and no longer pulsing. This allows the baby’s heart to draw all of its blood back into its body. Don't cut it before then. Don't worry about pain. There are no nerve endings in an umbilical cord; neither the birthing parent nor the baby will feel pain when it’s cut. The cord will, however, be slippery and difficult to handle. Tie a string or lace around the cord, about three inches from the baby's belly button. Tie it tightly with a double knot. Tie another lace about two inches away from the first one, again using a double knot. Using a sterile knife or scissors (that have been boiled in water for 20 minutes or wiped down with rubbing alcohol), cut between the two laces.
