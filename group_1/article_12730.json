      "content": "Hold the grasshopper in the middle of its body between your fingers. Pick up the grasshopper gently so you have a firm grip. The grasshopper may try to get away while you pick it up. Don’t squeeze too hard or else you may hurt the grasshopper. [1] X Research source Grasshoppers may bite, but it’s very uncommon. It also may regurgitate its stomach as a defense mechanism, but it isn’t harmful to humans.

      "content": "Squeeze softly on the grasshopper’s abdomen. Grab the rear of the grasshopper between your thumb and forefinger. Slightly pinch the abdomen so the grasshopper’s sexual organs are revealed. [3] X Research source Squeezing too hard will hurt the grasshopper."

      "title": "Identify a male grasshopper by a rounded abdomen.",
      "content": "Identify a male grasshopper by a rounded abdomen. Looking at the grasshopper's abdomen is the most definitive way to determine its sex. A rounded, upturned abdomen indicates the grasshopper is a male. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Note that a female grasshopper has a tapered abdomen. A female grasshopper's abdomen looks like a tube. This tube is known as the ovipositor, which the female uses to lay its eggs. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Recognize that female grasshoppers are larger than males.",
      "content": "Recognize that female grasshoppers are larger than males. If you are looking at a particular grasshopper in a large group, look at how large it is compared to others of its species. If your grasshopper is larger than the others, it’s most likely a female. If not, then it’s likely that you have a male. Don’t judge the sex of the grasshopper solely on its appearance since it will not be the most accurate."

      "title": "Identify male grasshoppers by their aggressive behavior.",
      "content": "Identify male grasshoppers by their aggressive behavior. Look to see if the grasshopper is kicking or biting others of its species. When grasshoppers prepare to mate, the males will become more aggressive with one another while they search for females. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Behavior and temperament depends on the grasshopper species. Some may be more aggressive while others will not."

      "title": "Look for males mounting females when they mate.",
      "content": "Look for males mounting females when they mate. When grasshoppers mate, they will climb on top of the females to deposit their sperm so the females can lay eggs. If you see a smaller grasshopper on top of a larger grasshopper, the smaller one is likely a male. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Sometimes, males will mount other males if they are fighting."

      "content": "Spot a female grasshopper if you notice it laying eggs. Check if the grasshopper is sticking its abdomen, or lower body, into the ground. Females lay their eggs underground, so look for grasshoppers digging in the ground or staying still when you approach them. [8] X Research source Female grasshoppers lay eggs throughout the summer and autumn."
