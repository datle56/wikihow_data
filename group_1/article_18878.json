Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald – Ralts can be captured on Route 102 connecting Oldale Town and Petalburg City. Ralts is rare, so you may have to spend some time finding one. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl – Ralts can be captured on Routes 203 and 204. You have to use your Poké Radar to encounter it. You also have a very small chance of finding a Kirlia, which will save you some time. Pokémon Platinum – Ralts can be found on Routes 208, 209, and 212. Kirlia can also be found on Route 212 and Route 209 with the Poké Radar. Pokémon Black and White – Ralts can be found in the White Forest in Pokémon White, but cannot be found by Pokémon Black players.

Ralts will be the third Pokémon you receive, but may be either female or male. Pokémon X and Y – Ralts can be found in Route 4 in both the Yellow and Red flowers. It is a rare Pokémon, so this may take a little while."
