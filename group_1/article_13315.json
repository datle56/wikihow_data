      "content": "A divine counterpart is someone you share a deep, romantic connection with. While there are many kinds of soul connections, a divine counterpart relationship is special in that it specifically focuses on romantic love and companionship, similar to (but not exactly like) a soulmate. It's believed that a person only has one divine counterpart and when these partners unite, both of them feel whole and complete. These relationships are usually lifelong. A divine counterpart is also known as a sacred partner, and their purpose is to help you realize who you truly are while also providing companionship. Many believe that a higher power guides these types of soul connections and that they’re divinely protected."

      "title": "A twin flame relationship is about spiritual growth, not romance.",
      "content": "A twin flame relationship is about spiritual growth, not romance. That doesn’t mean you can’t or won’t have romantic feelings for your twin flame, but romance isn’t the driving force. Also, unlike a divine counterpart relationship, a twin flame relationship isn’t meant to be lifelong–in fact, a twin flame relationship is usually volatile and even destructive. The point of this relationship is to spark a spiritual journey and destroy the ego so you can set yourself on your highest spiritual path. [2] X Research source Encountering your twin flame usually triggers challenges and difficulties. Both of your souls will have to face certain truths so that, ultimately, they can grow. You may not have a ton in common with your twin flame since the relationship is more dualistic–they may be a different gender, have different experiences, or choose beliefs that don’t line up with your own. Curious if you've met yours? Take our twin flame quiz to fine out."

      "content": "A soulmate relationship can be–but isn’t necessarily–romantic in nature. When you find your soulmate , you'll notice that this person matches your energy and you feel extremely bonded and connected to each other. This connection is on a soul level, but a soulmate can be a friend, family member, romantic partner, or even a pet. On the other hand, a divine counterpart is almost always a romantic relationship and many people consider their counterpart to be their “forever love” in this life (and beyond). [3] X Research source Similar to a divine counterpart, a soulmate is thought to be part of your \"soul family.\" A soulmate relationship doesn't necessarily last a lifetime, but it usually does. This is not a volatile relationship like with a twin flame; your soulmate is all about harmony. Wondering what kind of person your soulmate will be? Check out our soulmate quiz."
