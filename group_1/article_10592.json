      "content": "Learn what each html function is doing. The code you will use to create your calculator is made up of many pieces of syntax that work together to define different elements of a document. Click here for an explanation of how to familiarize yourself with this process, or read on to learn what each line of text is doing in the code you'll be using to make your calculator. html : This piece of syntax tells the rest of the document what language is being used in the code. In coding, a number of languages used to code, and <html> tells the rest of the document that it will be in - you guessed it! - html. [1] X Research source head : Tells the document that everything beneath it is data about data, also known as \"metadata\". The <head> command is usually used to define stylistic elements of a document, such as titles, headings, and so on. Think of it as an umbrella under which the rest of the code is defined. [2] X Research source title : This is where you will name the title of your document. This attribute is used to define what the title of the document will be when opened in an html browser. body bgcolor= \"#\" : This attribute sets the color of the code's background and body. The number in this set of quotes that appears after # corresponds to a predetermined color. text= \"\" : The word in this set of quotes sets the color of the text on the document. form name=\"\" : This attribute specifies the name of a form, which is used to build the structure of what comes after it based on what JavaScript knows that form name to mean. For example, the form name we will be using is calculator, which will create a specific structure to the document. [3] X Research source input type=\"\" : This is where the action happens. The \"input type\" attribute tells the document what sort of text the values in the rest of the brackets are. For example, they could be text, a password, a button (as it will be for a calculator), and so on. [4] X Research source value=\"\" : This command tells the document what will be contained in the input type specified above. For a calculator, these show up as our numbers (1-9) and operations (+,-,*,/,=). [5] X Research source onClick=\"\" : This syntax describes an event, which tells the document that something should occur when the button is clicked. For a calculator, we want the text that displays in each button to by understood as such. So, for the \"6\" button, we'll put document.calculator.ans.value+='6' between the quotes. [6] X Research source br : this tag initiates a line break in the document, so that whatever comes after it will appear a line below whatever came before it. [7] X Research source /form, /body, and /html : these commands tell the document that the corresponding commands that were initiated earlier in the document are now ending. [8] X Research source"
