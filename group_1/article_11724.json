      "title": "Balance top with bottom.",
      "content": "Balance top with bottom. Drawing attention to your upper body is key to dressing for a larger butt. You’ll also want to find tops that add weight or curves to your shoulders and chest. In doing both, you’ll distract from your behind while also using your clothes to add proportion for a more balanced figure. Go for bold colors and patterns. Don’t over-do it to the point of being garish, but look for eye-catching colors and provocative patterns to keep all eyes up top. Look for horizontal necklines. They draw the eye while also slimming the waist. Try bell sleeves. They widen your shoulder line to make a clean line with your larger backside, balancing your silhouette. Stock up on necklaces and scarves. These are two of the most valuable accessories you have for dealing with a bigger behind. Necklaces (especially larger ones) will keep eyes on your top and neckline while scarves add width to your shoulders."

      "title": "Disguise your butt.",
      "content": "Disguise your butt. If you’re chosen method of dealing with your behind is to reduce its presence, look for dark colors (especially in pants). Have tops (including jackets and sweaters) that reach low on your body, just after where your butt begins. The eye is drawn to where the garment ends, so they gloss over your butt entirely. The A-line dress is praised for its ability to hide any behind. Find more than a couple that you like; if you can make them a part of your style, the A-line dress will be your best fashion friend. Buy slimming shapewear/underwear. These will slim your waist, butt, and thighs for an overall slighter look. You can wear a tank top or full body shaper to smooth back fat. Wear a bra of the correct size. If your fit is wrong, it may cause the back fat to bulge when it may not otherwise. Get fitted by a professional and opt for a smoothing bra. Pay attention to the types of fabrics you wear. A fitted knit will always show more of our lumps and bumps. Pick thicker fabrics to skim over your body. Vertical features such as zippers and pleats make the waist and backside appear slimmer. Look for tops with these qualities."

      "title": "Be particular about pants.",
      "content": "Be particular about pants. Look for large back pockets, low waistbands and wide legs. The pockets serve as a diversion for the eyes, the waistband will have your butt appear smaller, and flared legs help to even out your silhouette. If your intention is to draw attention away from your hips, avoid skinny jeans which taper at the ankle. Find high-waisted shorts or pants for a classic look. The high-waist connects your butt to your waist to make it one seamless line, de-emphasizing your backside. When shopping for jeans you’ll want to look for anything “boot cut” or with flared legs. Don’t be anything bedazzled or with especially busy patterns, especially on the behind. You’ll looking for jeans to complement your behind, not draw attention to it."

      "title": "Buy the right skirts.",
      "content": "Buy the right skirts. More so than other articles of clothing, make sure your skirts are very well-fitted. You don't want to draw unwanted attention with an ill-fitted skirt that bunches up or slips at the waist. Pencil skirts are a solid option for wide hips as they even out your body shape. Fluted skirts are great for cloaking your butt and moving any attention down towards your legs. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Have form-fitting underwear.",
      "content": "Have form-fitting underwear. Boxer briefs and biking shorts will tighten the area around your butt and upper thighs for a tighter, smaller feel. In any case, make sure whatever underwear you have fits well enough not to bunch up. Bunching can be seen through pants and can make your backside look even awkward."

      "title": "Find the right pants.",
      "content": "Find the right pants. Possibly the most important consideration for anyone with a larger behind, well-bought pairs of pants will go the farthest towards shaping and disguising your butt. General advice to follow is to have pants that fit at the waist (too high will make your butt seem long) and too avoid anything labelled “skinny.” [2] X Research source For jeans, look for boot cut, carpenter, worker, and “relaxed-fit” jeans. This will sit more loosely on the waist and around the legs, which allow for straighter vertical line to your silhouette. For dressier pants, stay away from pleats. They draw the eye to your hips and can make your butt seem bigger than it is. Flat fronts are the way to go as they have a slimming effect around your waist."

      "title": "Buy t-shirts that fit.",
      "content": "Buy t-shirts that fit. Many might make the mistake of buyingover-large t-shirts in the hopes that they make your top half seem larger and more proportional to your behind. Unfortunately it ends up looking awkward and can make you appear overweight. Provided you have good pants that sit well at the waist, buy t-shirts which go down to where you back meets your butt for a clean vertical line. Don’t confuse a tight with a good fit. An overly tight shirt will make your butt appear as though it’s sticking out. You want a shirt that doesn’t bloom or billow, but lies flat on your front and back."

      "title": "Avoid tucking-in when possible.",
      "content": "Avoid tucking-in when possible. For collared shirts and button-downs, try not to tuck in when it’s appropriate. Unfortunately in business and formal situations this won’t be possible. Tucking in narrows your shirt and brings it closer to your torso, and can make your butt look like it’s sticking out. Instead, allow these shirts to sit loose around your waist for a clean line with your larger backside. [3] X Research source Again, avoid any “slim” or “skinny” fits in button-down shirts. These will end up hugging your torso, making your butt look larger."

      "content": "Splurge on shoes. Unlike girls, boys won’t have a lot of options for distracting away from a big butt. Flashy shoes, however, are the big-seated young man’s best weapon. Attractive, eye-catching shoes will draw the eye down quickly, away from your butt. Anything goes provided they match your outfit."

      "content": "Start working out. Whether aerobics or weight-training, walking or jogging, you can work out to better tone your butt and body overall. A fit and toned big butt is better than just a large one. You can do extra exercises for your glutes to shape them up even more. [4] X Research source Squats are the go-to exercise for toning and shaping your butt. Fortunately squats are like many butt exercises, and require no equipment. You’ll need to work out your waist and legs as well as your butt for a balanced look. Look for exercises that targets groups of muscles for added efficiency."

What one bully might be willing to pick on you for might convince another person to ask you on a date. Don’t let your body define your attitude; let it be the other way around. [5] X Research source"

You may think you have a big backside, but in actuality it’s just your anxiety and your environment making you self-conscious. If it’s something you’re trying to get to the heart of, try approaching a neutral third-party, such as your family doctor, about the concern."

Try to accept how you look now, but don’t expect future change as a reason not to be proactive now; now is the time to become proactive if you wish to make a long-lasting change."
