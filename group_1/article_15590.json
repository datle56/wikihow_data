Eid marks the end of fasting and gives believers the opportunity to thank Allah for the strength they had throughout Ramadan.

Religious authorities may set the beginning of Eid in their area on different days. [8] X Research source Mohsin says that Eid al-Fitr can happen at any time of the Gregorian year because it’s based on the Islamic lunar calendar. The date changes from year to year. Some Muslim countries have official government holidays that last 3 days or more for Eid. [9] X Research source"
