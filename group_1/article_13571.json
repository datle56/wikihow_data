This gives your skin’s barrier a boost and helps prevent any redness and irritation from popping up during your ice facial. [10] X Research source If you don’t have dry skin, ice your skin before applying any products (like moisturizer). The cold temperature of the ice damages your skin barrier a little bit, which helps your skincare products soak into your skin more deeply. [11] X Research source"

Freeze a batch of ice in an ice cube tray and wrap up a single cube in a thin washcloth or rag—this way, the ice won’t touch your skin directly. Move the ice in small circles around your face, applying it for only 10-15 seconds in each section. Keep rubbing and moving the ice around for 20-30 minutes before towel-drying your skin (or letting your skin air-dry). [12] X Research source Always clean out your ice cube tray before using it for facial icing. Swap out traditional ice cubes with frozen aloe vera gel, rose hydrosol, green tea, or cucumber water to make your ice treatment extra nourishing. Be sure to go over your cheeks, chin, jawline, forehead, lips, and nose."
