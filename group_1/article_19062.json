You don't have to have the world's greatest camera to take awesome photos , but you'll definitely want to edit photos that are dark, grainy, or improperly centered before posting them. Take a look at your profile and see how your posts look together on the grid—do they look good together? Consider sticking to a color scheme or photographic technique to keep your brand consistent and aesthetically pleasing. Use creative Instagram filters to make your photos stand out. Try to stick to the same one or two filters for all of your post to keep things consistent. In addition to (or instead of) using Instagram filters, use other photo editing apps like Photoshop Express and Canva to make your photos picture-perfect before posting."

If you make too many posts (or post too many similar things in a short period of time), your followers will be less likely to shower you in the likes you deserve. If you have a ton of photos you want to share, create carousel posts instead of posting them one-by-one. Carousel posts are extremely popular right now (sometimes called \"photo dumps\") and are a great way to share lots of cool photos without overwhelming your followers."
