      "content": "A cupioromantic is someone who doesn’t feel romantic attraction but who wants a romantic relationship. The term “cupioromantic” is a micro label that falls under the larger category of “aromantic,” which is a blanket term that describes someone who experiences little to no romantic attraction for others. [1] X Research source Cupioromanticism and aromanticism are romantic orientations which are identities based on a person’s romantic attractions. This is different from one’s sexual orientation, which relates to sexual attraction (the desire to be sexually intimate with someone). Another word for cupioromantic is “kalosromantic.” “Cupioromantic” is formed from the Latin word “cupio,” which means “I desire,” and “romantic.”"

It’s completely valid to want a relationship with someone for things like a feeling of closeness, passion, and exclusivity. You just might not want all the romantic feelings that come with it. If this sounds like you, then you might fall under the category of cupioromantic. [2] X Research source"

Since a lot of people who identify as cupioromantic are also aromantic, having little or no experience with having a crush can be a sign that you’re cupioromantic. Not really understanding what all the hype is about when your friends talk about their crushes or romantic interest can be another sign. [3] X Research source"

You could be totally on board with romance and romantic relationships when they’re portrayed in novels and movies, but actually picturing yourself being the recipient of all those romantic gestures might not sit with you right. You might still want a relationship, but just maybe can’t picture yourself getting super excited about the romance part. [4] X Research source"

Even if everything is going great, you still might find that you’re not falling head-over-heels in love with the other person. And believe it or not, the feeling of falling in love and being attracted to someone does come with physical symptoms, so if you don’t feel any of them, this might be a sign that you don’t feel romantic attraction. Some physical effects include: [5] X Research source A rush of euphoria or giddiness A sudden burst of energy Increased heart rate Tense muscles or trembling"

Getting flowers and chocolates, going on fancy dinner dates, and getting sappy love letters are all things you might find unappealing or just completely over-the-top.

Just because you may want a relationship or are in a relationship with someone doesn’t mean it’s because you’re romantically attracted to them. You may even feel guilty about not reciprocating their romantic feelings. Just remember that your wants and desires are just as valid as anyone else’s. Other types of attraction you might feel: [8] X Research source Sexual attraction: a desire to have sexual contact or showing sexual interest in someone. Aesthetic attraction: when you appreciate the appearance or beauty of a person, but not in a sexual or romantic way. Sensual attraction: wanting physical contact with another person but not in a sexual way, such as hugging or cuddling. Emotional attraction: the desire to get to know someone usually because of their personality rather than their physical appearance. Intellectual attraction: a want to engage with someone in more of an intellectual manner, such as through conversation or debate."

So when others come to talk to you about how they have all these romantic feelings for someone, you may come off as emotionally unavailable or dismissive.

You’re also usually never one to try and flirt and would rather just have a nice conversation.

They may want someone to have children with, may want someone to marry, or might want the passion, commitment, and a sense of closeness with their partner. However, oftentimes they feel little to no romantic attraction to their partner. To avoid any misunderstandings, it’s crucial that such expectations are discussed before really getting into a relationship. [12] X Research source Even though they may not feel romantic attraction, a cupioromantic can still favor the idea of a romantic relationship and the various benefits that come with it. A cupioromantic might choose to be in a queerplatonic relationship (QPR), which is defined as a relationship that goes beyond what’s considered the cultural norm for friendship but is non-romantic. It can include what a society might consider to be “romantic” elements, such as sex and exclusivity. [13] X Research source Someone who is cupioromantic may still want a sexual relationship. Someone who is cupioromantic can still experience sexual desire for other people, they just might not feel anything romantic for them. [14] X Research source"

The various romantic orientations on the aromantic spectrum all relate in that they often don’t feel romantic attraction, or may feel it in very specific situations. However, each identity has its own unique characteristics, and it’s important to know what makes cupioromanticism stand out on its own. [15] X Research source Cupioromantics differ from aromantics in their desires for a romantic relationship. Someone who is aromantic might feel very little or no desire for a romantic relationship and might view it more as an obligation. On the other hand, a cupioromantic might actively seek out and desire this kind of relationship. A demiromantic can feel romantic attraction after forming a close emotional bond with someone. Both a cupioromantic and a demiromantic might seek out these close bonds and intimacy, but in the case of someone who’s cupioromantic, this generally doesn’t lead to them feeling any romantic attraction. [16] X Research source Romantic attraction fluctuates for someone who is greyromantic . As opposed to many cupioromantics, someone who’s greyromantic might still feel romantic attraction. However, this feeling of attraction is often rare, not incredibly strong, and can pop up in strange or unexpected circumstances. [17] X Research source The opposite of cupioromantic is lithromantic , which is someone who feels romantic attraction but doesn’t want a romantic relationship."

Being open-minded and showing your eagerness to learn more is one of the biggest ways you can become an ally to someone who identifies as cupioromantic. Continue looking into cupioromanticism and other aspects of the aromantic spectrum to learn more and ask thoughtful questions that steer away from promoting stereotypes. Some good questions include: [18] X Research source How did you know you were cupioromantic? Have you found a community or other people you can talk to for support? What are some of the biggest misconceptions about you’re identity that you’ve had to deal with? What can I do to be a better ally to you?"

The concept of amatonormativity states that humans all share the common goal of finding an exclusive, romantic relationship and all want a romantic partner. However, this just isn’t the case for some people, particularly among folks who identify along the aromantic spectrum. Don’t go into a conversation assuming that someone is looking for a relationship, and keep an open mind about how others might prioritize the relationships in their life. [19] X Research source Remember that sexual and romantic attraction are two separate experiences. A common myth is that people who are aromantic or who identify along the aromantic spectrum are also asexual. While this can be true, it’s not a universal rule. A person’s experience with aromanticism and asexuality is individual to them, so try to avoid assuming. [20] X Research source Princeton’s Gender + Sexualtiy Resource Center offers a helpful explanation on the topic."
