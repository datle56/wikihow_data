      "content": "Dabbing up can also refer to the dab dance move. Dabbing –a dance move made popular by the rap group Migos–starts with one arm pointed upwards towards the sky. Then the dancer bends their other arm and bows their head into the inside of their elbow like they’re sneezing or dabbing sweat off their brow. They then bang their head into their elbow a few times. Finally, they straighten their arms and switch sides. [2] X Research source A dancer might take the dance to the next level by walking, hopping, or shaking their hips. They can also wave their hands in the air or swing their arms from side to side as they switch sides."

      "title": "Use a fist bump as a simple way to dab/dap someone up.",
      "content": "Use a fist bump as a simple way to dab/dap someone up. The simplest way to dab/dap someone up is to make a fist and hold it out with your knuckles facing forward. Your friend does the same, and you push your knuckles together. [3] X Research source Unless you and your friend have come up with a unique dab/dap, the fist bump is appropriate for most situations and familiar to most people. So, when in doubt, fist bump it out. There is an almost limitless number of variations for dabs/daps, so there’s no way to tell which dap is going down unless you have an established dab/dap with your friend."

      "content": "Try using a pound to customize your dab/dap. To perform this dab/dap, hold out your fist with your thumb facing up. Bump the top of your friend’s fist with the bottom of your fist, then vice versa. Both of you then open your hands and slap them together. Then, slide your hand away from theirs, catching your fingertips on theirs to make a snapping sound. This dab/dap is also commonly called a vertical fist bump. To make this dab/dap your own, add a fist bump or another fist pound or snap."

When your friend grasps your hand, pull them in for a quick half-hug while holding their hand at chest level. Tilt your head to the side and use your free hand to firmly pat their back. [4] X Research source This greeting is also known as the bro hug and is usually saved for close friends."

      "content": "Black G.I.s created the dap during the Vietnam War as a symbol of unity. The dap (an acronym for “dignity and pride”) was a combination of hand and body gestures that allowed Black soldiers to show each other solidarity during the Vietnam War. It was another way to reaffirm that they would look out for each other in camp and out in the “boonies” (what they called the jungle). [5] X Research source Since white soldiers and officers falsely believed the dap was a way to secretly plan insurrection, some Black soldiers were punished or forced out of the military for giving the dap. [6] X Research source After the war, soldiers continued to use the dap to greet friends after they got back home to the U.S."
