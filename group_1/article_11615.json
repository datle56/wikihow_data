      "content": "Check out their profile to see what they like to do. Once you learn a little more about them, you can craft a message that talks about something you two have in common. Maybe you graduated from the same college, or maybe you both participate in the same hobby. It doesn’t even have to be anything specific — if you both like being outdoors, that’s great, too! Try something like: [1] X Research source “Hey! I saw your hiking pics, they look so pretty. I love hiking, too!” “I’ve never met another person who does roller derby! How often do you hit the rink?” Reader Poll: We asked 329 wikiHow readers how they initiate conversations with people online, and 49% said they talk about something on their profile. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Online dating is all about getting to know the other person.",
      "content": "Online dating is all about getting to know the other person. Since the only things you know about them are from their profile, try expanding on those to get a little more insight into who they are. You don’t have to treat it like an interrogation (since that can feel a little intense), but some casual questions near the beginning of your convo can really get the ball rolling, especially if they have some pets or traveling pictures in their profile. Try things like: [2] X Research source “That pic of your pup is so cute! How old are they?” “Have you ever been to the rose garden?”"

      "title": "This is an easy way to start a fun conversation.",
      "content": "This is an easy way to start a fun conversation. If you two live nearby (and most dating sites will connect you with people around you), see how they like the place you’re in. You could also ask them how long they’ve been here or if they plan on staying a while, just for a few fun things to talk about. Try something like: [3] X Research source “How long have you been in San Francisco?” “Do you like living here in Minnesota?” “What’s your favorite thing about living here?”"

      "title": "There’s always a new TV show or movie to talk about.",
      "content": "There’s always a new TV show or movie to talk about. See if they caught the newest binge-worthy Netflix special, or ask them if they plan on seeing the next big box office in theaters. Plus, if they haven’t seen one of your favorite things yet, this is a great way to segue into a date! Try something like: [4] X Research source “You’ve got to watch that new Netflix documentary about mushrooms. It’s insane!” “Are you gonna go see the new Batman movie? I’m pretty curious about it, honestly.”"

      "title": "You can flatter your potential date by telling them something you like.",
      "content": "You can flatter your potential date by telling them something you like. Since you don’t know this person well yet, stay away from anything physical, and compliment them on something you noticed in their profile. Stick to 1 or 2 compliments per conversation, just so it doesn’t go overboard. You could say something like: [5] X Research source “You have such a nice smile! It really shines through in all your pics.” “You look like you have such a good fashion sense. I love your outfit in that first pic!” “You have such a good sense of humor. I can tell you’d be fun to hang out with.”"

      "content": "You can send a few cheeky messages if you get that kind of vibe. Some people appreciate a little harmless banter, especially if you’ve had a fun conversation so far. Try a little bit of teasing (in a flirty way!) to let your potential date know that you’re interested. You might say something like: [6] X Research source “Red Sox fan, huh? You must be pretty bummed out this season!” “You’ve never seen Twilight ?! Wow, idk if this will work out.😉”"

      "content": "These fun, fake scenarios can get a goofy conversation flowing. Come up with a “Would you rather” or “What would you do if…” question that your potential date can answer. If you disagree, don’t be afraid to hold a (non-serious) debate! Try something like: [7] X Research source “What would you do if a zombie apocalypse started right now?” “Would you rather fight 10 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?”"

      "content": "Conversations tend to fizzle out if you leave them for too long. Try to check your online dating account at least once a day, or even more if you’re actively having a conversation with someone. If you can’t keep up with their messages, consider giving out your phone number instead (if you feel comfortable with that). [8] X Research source If you do decide to give out your digits, say something like, “I’m not on this app a ton. Here’s my number if you want to keep chatting.”"

      "title": "The goal of talking to someone online is to meet up in-person.",
      "content": "The goal of talking to someone online is to meet up in-person. After you’ve chatted back and forth for five to six times, suggest meeting up somewhere casual, like a cafe or a bar. If they agree, you can set a time and a place to have a fun IRL date with someone you met online. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Say something like, “I’ve really enjoyed our convo so far. Are you free this weekend to grab coffee or a drink?” Sometimes, people are a little wary about meeting up in-person too soon. If the person you’re chatting with wants to talk online a little more before meeting up, don’t be offended! They’re probably just trying to be safe."

      "content": "If you don’t want to meet IRL yet, try this instead. A lot of dating apps have a video chat feature, but you can also use FaceTime or Zoom to talk to your date on a computer or your phone. This can be a nice way to take things slow and keep yourself safe if you’re wary about meeting a stranger in-person. [10] X Research source You could suggest it by saying something like, “I really like chatting with you! Do you have time for a video call this evening? I’d love to hear your voice.”"

      "content": "Keep your safety in mind as you chat with people online. Never give out your address or any personal information, like where you work. If you’re ever wary about someone you’re talking to online, try looking them up on social media to make sure they’re real. It’s okay to give people the benefit of the doubt, but online safety is just as important as real life safety! [11] X Research source If anyone ever sends you creepy messages, feel free to block and report their profile. Try to be reasonably sure that they are real and not a scammer. Make sure that the person is following a nice conversation and not asking you about your money."
