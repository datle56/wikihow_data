      "content": "Illness is considered the most valid reason to skip class. Whether it’s Covid, the flu, or a sinus infection, being sick is a foolproof excuse because it can affect the entire classroom. Most professors won’t ask for too many details, but if they do, mention a few symptoms that could spread quickly. Having a cough, fever, or Covid-related symptom is a solid reason to stay home. [1] X Research source “Dear Professor, I wanted to inform you that I will be unable to attend class tomorrow due to a sinus infection. I hope to maintain and complete all course requirements that I will miss during my time away.” “Professor, I have to miss class today because I have a serious case of the flu. I hope to return to class on Thursday, but please let me know if I need to fill out any documentation. Thank you in advance.” “Professor, I am writing to share with you that I will not be able to attend your class on Monday, September 13th. My roommate tested positive for Covid, and I am starting to exhibit symptoms. Would it be possible to set a time to meet up and discuss missed work? Thank you in advance for your time.”"

      "content": "Food poisoning is unexpected, making it the perfect last-minute excuse. A bad reaction to food can happen at any time, with symptoms ranging from bad to horrific. Your professor will definitely understand if you tell them you’re vomiting uncontrollably or running to the bathroom every 10 minutes. Plus, you won’t have to provide proof that you’re sick! Most people recover in 12 to 48 hours, so it’s a great excuse if you want to miss class 2 days in a row. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source “Dear Professor, I won’t be able to attend the socratic seminar this evening because I have contracted the stomach flu. The situation was unexpected, but I will attend your office hours on Friday to go over the next steps. Thank you for your time and understanding.” “Professor Smith, I wanted to inform you that I will be unable to attend the lecture tomorrow because I am recovering from food poisoning. I’m sorry for the short notice, but my symptoms have been serious. Would it be possible to set up a meeting to go over missed work next week? Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you.” “Professor, I wanted to let you know that I missed class on Monday due to food poisoning. I apologize for the late notice, but I have been trying to catch up on coursework as best as possible. Can we schedule a meeting to discuss missed work and possible next steps? Thank you in advance. I look forward to talking to you soon.”"

      "content": "An allergic reaction is a serious situation that most people won’t question. Some allergic reactions are life threatening, so your professor is more likely to be empathetic than suspicious. To be on the safe side, be as vague as possible—you could mention you ate something, then list a few allergy symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. [3] X Research source “Professor, I will be missing the lecture tonight because of an allergic reaction. My apologies for the short notice, but I am breaking out in hives. I plan to return to class on Friday and attend your office hours to catch up on any missed work.” “Dear Professor, I will not be able to attend class today, January 25th, because of an allergic reaction. I am aware of the attendance policy, but I wanted to inform you about my absence anyways. Would it be possible to schedule a meeting to go over possible next steps? Thank you.” “Professor, I could not attend the lecture yesterday due to an allergic reaction to a new medication. I apologize for the late notice, but it was an unexpected situation. I have already received notes from a classmate, but could we schedule a meeting to discuss missed work? Thank you in advance.”"

[4] X Research source A sprained ankle is your best bet since it impedes on your ability to walk to class, but if you need more time to create a story, simply state there’s been a “freak accident” and then develop the details during your time off. “Professor, I was not in class yesterday because I twisted my ankle. My apologies for not informing you earlier, but I was getting treated at Urgent Doc. Could we set up a meeting to go over missed work? Thank you in advance.” “Professor, I will be out on Friday because of an injury. I’m sorry for the short notice, but I’m in the process of recovering. I have received notes from a classmate, but please let me know how I can make up for the work I missed in class. Thank you.” “Professor, I wanted to inform you that I am missing class today because of an ankle injury.

      "content": "Family emergencies are effective because they don’t require much detail. Most professors won’t question this excuse because it’s considered personal, but you might want to think of a backstory in case you get questioned later on. [5] X Research source Common family emergency excuses include surgeries, car accidents, and mental health crises, so choose one that you can discuss on the spot. “Professor, I am writing to share with you that I will be missing class today due to a family emergency. I apologize for the short notice, but it is an extremely urgent situation. Could we set up a meeting next week to discuss missed work? Thank you in advance.” “Professor, I wanted to let you know that I won’t be in class today because my mom has gotten into a car accident. I need to take the day off to go to the hospital, but I will catch up on any missed assignments when I return. Thank you for your time and understanding.” “Dear Professor, I will not be able to attend tonight’s lecture due to a family emergency. My dad is at the hospital, and I need to make sure he is okay.

Serious issues, like gas leaks or burst pipes, need to be addressed immediately, so use either one when you need a reason to skip. [6] X Trustworthy Source State of New York Official website for the State of New York Go to source To really sell your story, you might mention that your roommate is in another class so it’s up to you to fix the problem. “Professor, there has been a gas leak in my apartment, so I will be missing today’s class. I’m sorry for the late notice, but I will drop by your office hours to pick up any missed assignments.” “Professor, my roommate just informed me that someone broke into our apartment, so I will not be in class today. I have to talk to the police, but I will get notes from one of my classmates.” “Dear Professor, I apologize for the late notice, but there’s a burst pipe in my apartment and my kitchen is completely flooded.

[7] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source Just tell your professor that there’s no one else who can take your pet to the vet. “I was walking my dog and he was just attacked, so I am taking him to the vet. I apologize for the short notice, but I will be missing today’s lecture.” “Professor Smith, I’m sorry for the late notice, but my dog ate something outside and is now very sick. I need to skip class to take care of him, but I am going to get notes from a classmate and watch the lecture online.

Some professors outline their policies about technical issues in the syllabus, but if yours doesn’t, feel free to shoot them an email . [8] X Research source It might be more believable if you show up to class and disconnect your WiFi a few times in the beginning so it looks like you’re trying to join. “Professor, I wanted to let you know that I was not in class earlier due to a poor WiFi signal. My sincerest apologies for the absence, but it was not possible for me to connect to the lecture.” “Professor, I am writing to let you know that I missed class today because my Internet went out.

Just let your professor know that you were driving to class and something unexpected happened.

I apologize for the short notice, but I will watch the recorded lecture and attend your office hours tomorrow. Please let me know if I need to provide any documentation.” “Professor, I am so sorry for the late notice, but I missed today’s lecture because my car broke down.

[10] X Research source Whether it’s a dentist appointment or a routine check-up, tell your professor that you need to skip class because there weren’t any available times in the next few weeks. If they do ask for proof, you can always fill out a free doctor appointment form online. “Professor, I have been experiencing issues with my vision and had to make a last-minute appointment to get it checked out. I apologize for the short notice, but I will not be in class tonight.” “Professor, I need to skip class on Wednesday because of a medical appointment.

If you need to miss class at the last minute, say your sibling just gave birth or your family flew in from another country without notice. “Professor, I apologize for the late notice, but my sister just gave birth, so I will not be attending class tomorrow.

After the second or third death in a month, your professor will start to question your integrity and you could get into more serious trouble. “Dear Professor, I will not be able to attend class on Friday because there has been an unexpected death in my family.
