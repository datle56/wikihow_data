      "title": "The Cartier logo is screen-printed and missing a connection.",
      "content": "The Cartier logo is screen-printed and missing a connection. The Cartier logo is iconic for its simple yet elegant cursive font. One way to tell if your Cartier is real or not is to look for spelling or typography errors in the logo, like a missing connection between the \"R\" and the \"T.\" The logo will also be screen-printed instead of stamped or engraved and feel smooth to the touch. [1] X Research source Real Cartiers feature a logo stamped or engraved into the right lens and etched onto the inside of one of the temple arms. You can feel their texture by rubbing your finger across them."

    {
      "title": "The Cartier logo is crooked or misaligned.",
      "content": "The Cartier logo is crooked or misaligned. Another clue that will help you determine if your Cartiers are real or fake is the placement of the logo and its alignment with the glasses frame. The Cartier logo on a fake pair may appear crooked or misaligned respective to the lens. It may also be missing completely. [2] X Research source Real Cartier glasses always feature the logo on the right lens and the inside of one of the temple arms. They are also perfectly aligned with the shape of the piece. For example, the logo on the lens arches slightly with the lens's curvature."
    },
    {
      "title": "The nose-pieces are plain and flimsy.",
      "content": "The nose-pieces are plain and flimsy. Fake Cartier glasses often don't have stamped nose-pieces – or if they do, the stamp may not be as detailed or the logo may not be accurate. Furthermore, the nose-pieces will likely feel flimsy and cheap, like they could easily break off if you handle them too much. [3] X Research source On each nose-piece on a real pair of Cartiers, you'll notice the brand's signature intertwined Double C motif stamped in gold or platinum. They're also comfortable and sturdy."
    },
    {
      "title": "The nose bridge is missing an etching or contains typographical errors.",
      "content": "The nose bridge is missing an etching or contains typographical errors. Many authentic pairs of Cartier glasses are engraved with the bridge measurement on the bridge of the nose. Fake Cartiers are often missing this detail. If you notice the measurement on the nose bridge, run your finger over them to check that they're etched and not just printed on. The etching should also be perfectly aligned and not missing any digits or containing any large gaps between the individual numbers. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "The temple arms are either not etched or missing crucial details.",
      "content": "The temple arms are either not etched or missing crucial details. The arms of Cartier glasses are typically engraved with the serial number, the model number, the color code, the Cartier logo, and the country where it was made (usually France). [5] X Research source In addition, you'll see CE and UKCA markings, which indicate that the glasses meet the European Economic Area's (EEA) standards for health, safety, and environmental protection. [6] X Research source Some fake Cartiers try to reproduce all or most of these elements. Look closely at the markings to ensure all the words are spelled correctly, that they're all engraved (and placed in a straight line), and that none of the letters or digits are abnormally close together or far apart. For example, the CE marking has a small space between the \"C\" and the \"E.\" If these letters butt up against one another, that may be a sign that your Cartiers aren't genuine."

      "title": "The hinges and exterior temples use a fake Cartier motif.",
      "content": "The hinges and exterior temples use a fake Cartier motif. Authentic Cartier hinges and exterior temples always feature a signature design resembling the motif for their specific collection. Cartier counterfeiters may try to replicate these motifs for their frames. Examine your pair and compare them to images of real Cartier glasses to find any discrepancies or errors in the design. These are the 5 real Cartier motifs to compare them to: [7] X Research source Santos De Cartier : A minimalistic screw hinge Signature C De Cartier : An elegant C-shaped hinge Double C De Cartier : 2 stylized and intertwined C shapes Première de Cartier : A Godron motif with three thin metal bars at the temples blending into a C-shape on either arm Panthère De Cartier : A plain exterior temple with a circle of precious metal terminating in a panther head affixed to it"

      "title": "The temple insert juts out and isn't flush with the arm.",
      "content": "The temple insert juts out and isn't flush with the arm. The inside of the temple insert where it joins with the temple arm should be smooth and flush. If you run your finger across it and feel a raised surface, that may be a sign that the Cartier glasses are fake. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "The materials are plastic, plated, or made of another cheap material.",
      "content": "The materials are plastic, plated, or made of another cheap material. Fake Cartier glasses are typically made of plastic. They may plate certain design elements in gold or platinum, but that's about as fancy as they get. For this reason, they may also feel lighter in your hand than the real ones. [9] X Research source Real Cartier glasses are made of luxury materials like 18K gold, platinum, titanium, Buffalo horn, and even wood."

    {
      "title": "The Warranty and Authenticity Guaranteed cards are missing.",
      "content": "The Warranty and Authenticity Guaranteed cards are missing. Fake Cartier glasses usually omit the Warranty and Authenticity Guaranteed cards that come with real pairs. If you purchased your glasses from a third party seller (i.e., not Cartier), you can request these documents from them. If they can't provide them, that may be a clue that the glasses aren't genuine. [10] X Research source If you plan on purchasing your Cartiers used, ask the seller to include the above cards in the order (unless they specify that they're included)."

      "title": "The case has the wrong color or logo or isn't made of real leather.",
      "content": "The case has the wrong color or logo or isn't made of real leather. Fake Cartiers will likely come in a case made of plastic that may feature a misaligned logo with typographical errors. Alternatively, they may not come in a case at all. The case may also be the wrong shade of red, as Cartier uses one specific shade only. [11] X Research source Real Cartier glasses cases are black or red, made of hard leather, and feature the brand's perfect logo sitting squarely in the center of the lid. The box that the case and glasses came in should be a deep garnet color and also bear the authentic Cartier logo in the center of the lid."

      "title": "The price is much less than $1000 and seems too good to be true.",
      "content": "The price is much less than $1000 and seems too good to be true. If the Cartiers you're interested in buying cost several hundred dollars less than $1000, be cautious about going through with the deal if you're looking for the original brand and not a knock-off. Even if the price of a pair of Cartier glasses is high, however, that doesn't mean they're not counterfeit. The only way to make certain you're acquiring the real product is to purchase it through a Cartier boutique or one of the brand's authorized dealers. Real Cartier glasses typically cost well upwards of $1000 – and for good reason! They're made with expensive materials, thoughtfully designed, and well-made. They also represent a brand that has existed since 1847."

      "content": "Purchase sunglasses from the Cartier website or a Cartier boutique. Cartier offers dozens of options for luxurious, comfortable sunglasses that will hold up to a lot of outdoor use. The best way to buy them (and ensure they're authentic) is directly through Cartier, which you can do on their website or by visiting a real Cartier boutique. Keep in mind that if you visit a Cartier boutique, you'll most likely have to call ahead and make an appointment. Shopping this brand in person at one of their storefronts is an exceptional experience you won't see in regular department stores."

      "content": "Buy prescription glasses frames from authorized Cartier dealers. Since Cartier's regular glasses frames require prescription lenses, they're typically only available at optometrists' offices and eyewear stores. To look up Cartier dealers in your area, use the Store Locator tool on Cartier's website, type in your city or zipcode, and filter by \"Authorized Dealers\" and distance."

Use the Cartier Store Locator and filter by \"Authorized Used Dealers.\" These dealers are less common and more difficult to find, however, so you may also want to hunt for them in antique stores that specialize in vintage jewelry or luxury goods."

Cartier's works were discovered by the French elite within a decade of starting his company and soon became popular worldwide.
