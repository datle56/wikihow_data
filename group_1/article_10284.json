Do not include the angle brackets in your command and make sure that they are separated by a space. Alternatively, you can also type /clone then tap the Tab key to get the results for the coordinates of the block you're currently looking at, then press Enter to send the chat. You'll get an error message that your command was incomplete, but you don't need to worry about that since you're still in the process of cloning. Move to the block in the opposite corner of your structure, then open the chatbox and press the UP arrow to refill the chat with your previous command (which includes the coordinates for the other block). Press the Tab key to get the coordinates for the block you're looking at, then press Enter or Return again. You'll still need to fetch the last set of coordinates (the destination) for the command using the F3 key and looking at the spot where you want the lowest point of your clone to build. Don't use this method if you're not looking at the block you want to use in your clone. [3] X Research source"
