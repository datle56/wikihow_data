      "title": "Soak washable clothing in a white vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Soak washable clothing in a white vinegar solution. Mix a solution of equal parts warm water and white vinegar in a large bowl. Submerge the clothing in the mixture for 10-20 minutes, then launder it as normal to rinse out the vinegar. Or, launder the clothing in a machine on a regular cycle, substituting an equal amount of vinegar for your regular detergent. [2] X Research source Always read the care label on an item of clothing to help you decide whether to hand wash the clothing or wash it in a machine. Hang the clothes somewhere well-ventilated to dry, like near an open window or running fan, for 4-5 hours. Avoid placing the clothes in the dryer. Applying heat to your clothes before the mothball smell is gone may set the odor permanently into your clothes."

      "content": "Treat non-washable clothing or furniture with vinegar spray. For clothes or furniture that can’t be laundered normally, mix equal parts warm water and vinegar in a spray bottle, then spritz them down with the solution. [3] X Research source Hang the clothing somewhere well-ventilated, like near an open window, for 4-5 hours to dry and air out. Or, bring your clothes to a dry cleaner to be treated. Dry cleaners have access to more specialized cleaning solutions that can tackle mothball smell."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda over smelly clothing or furniture. Baking soda is a powerful spot treatment for most any kind of odor. [4] X Research source Lay your clothes out flat, then sprinkle them (or your furniture) liberally with baking soda . Leave them for 5-6 hours, then shake out the baking soda outdoors, or vacuum it off your upholstery. You may need multiple rounds of this before the odor dissipates, so give your clothing or furniture a sniff after removing the baking soda, and repeat as needed."

      "title": "Place the clothing in the dryer on an air-only cycle.",
      "content": "Place the clothing in the dryer on an air-only cycle. This helps to run air through your clothing, which is then absorbed by the dryer filter, but it may take several cycles on an air-only or “fluff” setting. [5] X Research source Crucially, do not use any heat, since heat can set the odor into your clothes permanently. If you’re unsure if your dryer uses heat on these settings, it’s best to skip this step."

      "title": "Leave the clothing in the sun to bleach.",
      "content": "Leave the clothing in the sun to bleach. Sunlight, or UV light, naturally “bleaches” clothing and removes odors, leaving fabrics with that pleasant, laundry-line smell. [6] X Research source If possible, leave your clothes or furniture in direct sunlight, like placed near a window, or hang your clothing outside on a line, for 5-6 hours, or until the odor dissipates. Sunlight may also fade colored fabrics over time, so this is best done with light fabrics. Or, turn the clothing inside-out before laying it in the sun."

      "title": "Place activated charcoal near clothing to absorb odors.",
      "content": "Place activated charcoal near clothing to absorb odors. Activated charcoal is an excellent odor absorber, and can absorb that mothball smell off of clothes and the air around it. [7] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Simply leave a small bowl of activated charcoal in an enclosed room with your clothing. Check back every few days, and leave the bowl out for as long as it takes to banish the odor (this may take several days to a couple weeks)."

      "title": "Leave bowls of vinegar in closets and rooms.",
      "content": "Leave bowls of vinegar in closets and rooms. Like activated charcoal, white vinegar also makes a great odor absorber. If a mothball smell remains in a room, or if clothing cannot be washed, place a bowl of vinegar in the room, near where the odor is strongest. [8] X Research source Leave it for several days, or until the odor dissipated. If you don't have white vinegar, use a bowl of coffee grounds or lemon juice, instead."

      "content": "Treat floors with baking soda. For hardwood or tile floors, fill a bucket with warm water and add about 0.5 cups (110 g) of baking soda and 0.25 cups (59 mL) of dish soap, then stir it with a mop. [9] X Research source Mop the entire floor with the mixture, making sure the mop is only just damp so that water doesn’t pool, and let it air-dry.0 12/30/24 Repeat until the mothball smell is gone. For carpets, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the entire area and let it sit overnight. Then, thoroughly vacuum up the baking soda, and repeat the process as necessary."

      "content": "Get some natural airflow through the space to ventilate it. A cool breeze from outdoors can help naturally whisk mothball smell from both rooms and clothing. [10] X Research source For clothing stored in a place like an attic, open any windows on a breezy night. Remove your clothing from any closed storage containers, like boxes or trunks, and hang them up or spread them out. Just be sure to keep an eye on the forecast, and close any windows in the event of rain, snow, or strong winds."

      "content": "Wash your hands with lemon-scented dish detergent. Dish soap is tougher on smells than hand soap, and safe for skin in small amounts. [11] X Research source To get the mothball odor out of your hands, use a lemon-scented dish detergent, which has a strong odor that’ll mask the mothballs, to wash your hands thoroughly after handling mothballs. For very strong mothball smells, sprinkle baby powder on your hands after washing them and rub it into your skin. This helps further remove mothball odor."

Soak your hands in the tomato juice for 5 minutes before rinsing them off. Note that tomato juice doesn’t actually eliminate odors, only covers them. This may help mask your problem until it goes away naturally, but won’t solve it on its own. Similarly, you might mask the smell with citrus by rubbing the inside of an orange or lemon peel across your skin, or rinsing your hands with orange or lemon juice."
