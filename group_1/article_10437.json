      "title": "Choose the audience for your cow joke wisely.",
      "content": "Choose the audience for your cow joke wisely. One of the best ways to be funny and get a big laugh is to match the right joke to your audience. That means reading the room to make sure the people around you are in the right mood to laugh. And if you’re at a very serious event, Muñoz recommends being very careful about using humor and pay close attention to your audience’s reactions to your jokes. For example, your cow joke might kill at a party, but drops like a lead balloon at work. Listen to the people around you and pay attention to whether they’re laughing and what they’re laughing at. Choose jokes that are appropriate and easy to understand if you’re in a group of adults and children."

      "title": "Nail the timing of the setup and punchline.",
      "content": "Nail the timing of the setup and punchline. Anyone can tell a joke , but getting a laugh is a skill. One of the ways to make sure your cow jokes hit them right in the funny bone is to use a “pregnant pause” between the setup and punchline. A “pregnant pause” is when you wait a few extra seconds after the joke’s setup to build tension for the punchline. [6] X Research source The idea is that you give people just enough time to come up with their first answer to the setup. For example, the great comedic actor Gene Wilder was a master of the pregnant pause. He could transform simple dialogue into a hilarious joke with the use of a pregnant pause. For example, in the 1974 Mel Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles , he has the lines. “My name is Jim, but most people call me…Jim.” It wouldn’t be as funny without the pause."

      "title": "Stick to shorter jokes to keep their attention.",
      "content": "Stick to shorter jokes to keep their attention. A long joke can lose your audience’s attention. The good news is that you’ll get better at telling jokes the more you do it. Payne says you just have to be confident and believe in yourself when telling a joke. Practice your timing and cadence by telling short, snappy jokes. Then, move on to longer jokes that have small jokes peppered through them. [7] X Research source As you tell a longer joke, pay attention to the other person’s reactions. If they’re smiling and interested, keep going. If they seem bored, cut it short. Comedy relies on the element of surprise. That means a silly, lightning-quick joke can get a laugh before an extremely clever joke that takes longer to spool out. And don’t worry if people don’t laugh. Not getting laughs is just part of telling jokes, says Payne."
