      "content": "Complete the Desolate Deep Bestiary. To get to the Desolate Deep area, get on a boat and travel to the coordinates -790.2, 141.9, and -3101.9, between Sunstone Island and the Statue of Sovereignty. You’ll find diving gear by a red buoy; dive directly below the buoy, swim to the end of a tunnel, and find the bestiary’s entrance. Fish in the Desolate Pocket region and Brine Pool to complete the bestiary! [1] X Research source There are floating mines in the entry tunnel, so swim as close to the bottom as possible to avoid them. The NPC Clarence will show you the Brine Pool location, which is where you’ll find the fish that aren’t in the Desolate Pocket. However, you’ll need the Reinforced Rod to catch fish in the Brine Pool. See the instructions below if you don’t have it yet."

      "content": "Collect 5 Enchant relics and earn 150,000 tokens. You can fish for the Enchant relics or just buy them from Merlin—an NPC in a hut on Sunstone Island—for 11,000 tokens per relic. Three Enchant relics can also be acquired as a reward for collecting the Witch’s items (and putting them in her cauldron). The Trident Rod also costs 150,000 tokens, so you’ll need at least that much to buy it. [2] X Research source If you have no problem with spending lots of tokens, the total cost of the diving gear, Enchant relics, and Trident Rod is 220,000 tokens."

Dive into the sea on the opposite side of the Merchant and look for a purple choral flower in the sea bed. Swim through it and look for a small opening. Inside this opening, you’ll find a tunnel—and at the end is an altar with 5 pedestals. [3] X Research source Once you see the altar, you’ll know you’re in the right place!"

Put each Enchant relic on the 5 pedestals; this will cause them to start glowing, and a door (with the image of an eye on it) will open. Inside is the Trident temple, where you’ll see the Trident rod at the other end of the room on a pile of treasure. Congratulations! Now, you can claim the Trident Rod. [4] X Research source Normally, you must complete the Desolate Deep bestiary to enter the temple door. However, if you have a friend who completed the bestiary, they can open the door for you. The temple door is server-sided, meaning anybody on the same server can get in once it's open!"

      "content": "Passive abilities Fish caught with the Trident Rod have a 30% chance of getting the Atlantean mutation (meaning they’re dark turquoise with a value that’s 3x higher than usual). The Trident Rod also comes with the Stabbing Mechanic passive, which means the rod has a chance to “stab” a fish you’re reeling in as it moves across the bar, temporarily stunning it and granting a bonus to the catching progress. The rod’s Stabbing Mechanic can be invaluable when catching high-rarity fish since they move across the bar more often. It can also help you keep up a streak (if you have one going) and successfully obtain Exotic and Mythical fish."
