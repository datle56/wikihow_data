They may even pop into your thoughts at random or unexpected times. [1] X Research source If you're not attracted to a person, they probably won't wander into your passing thoughts. Ask yourself questions like: Do I frequently find myself wanting to be where they are? Am I disappointed when they don't return my texts or calls? Do unrelated things in everyday life trigger thoughts about them? Do I often think about them or fantasize about a relationship with them? Reader Poll: We asked 1178 wikiHow readers, and 69% agreed the surest sign of developing deeper feelings for someone is constantly thinking about them and fantasizing about being together .

If you suddenly care more than usual about your physical appearance if you know you're going to see them, you may be attracted to them. If you want someone to like you, you’ll want to look attractive to them. Ask yourself: Do I care more than usual about how my hair looks? Do I spend more time deciding on which outfit to wear? Am I wearing more perfume or cologne that normal?"

      "content": "Consider if you change the way you act when they’re around. If you like someone, you probably want to impress them. You may find yourself bragging more often or agreeing with things they say even if you have a different opinion. You may also feel clumsier or sillier than usual. If you tend to feel “not yourself” when you're hanging out with them, it may be a sign that you like them. Other behaviors to watch for: Do you feel like you can’t keep your eyes off of them? Are you nervous or feel strange when you make eye contact? Are you more energetic or self-conscious around them? Do you smile at them without even trying or thinking about it?"

      "content": "See if you’re suddenly interested in their interests and hobbies. Are you suddenly curious about theater just because they're involved in it? Another big sign that you're crushing on them is if your desire to be around them overrides any personal preferences you have. For example, if you aren’t a big country music fan but excitedly agree to attend a bluegrass concert with them, you probably like them. You might also do things like: [2] X Research source Agree with their political opinion even though you don't really agree. Be cool with eating foods you hate just so you can go along to their favorite restaurant. Laugh at all of their jokes whether they're funny or not."

      "content": "Ask yourself if you’re physically attracted to them. Everyone has physical preferences when it comes to romantic partners. If you look at them and think about kissing, hugging, and cuddling with them, you’re probably attracted to them. [6] X Research source Physical attractiveness is subjective and different people like different things. Think about this person’s overall appearance to see if you find them physically attractive. Physical appearance can include facial features (such as their eyes, nose, lips, cheekbones), hygiene, hairstyle, attire, and anything else that affects their appearance. If you normally prefer people with brown hair, don’t automatically write off a blonde or redhead. Attraction is complicated! Your physical preferences aren't a checklist."

      "content": "Name the things you don’t like about them to identify deal breakers. A deal breaker refers to a quality or characteristic that automatically cancels out the things you find attractive in a person. [7] X Research source For instance, there are some people who are totally grossed out by smoking. While this is not a physical characteristic, it is certainly something that can affect overall attractiveness. You may have physical deal breakers too, though. [8] X Research source If you’re feeling a little confused because part of you really likes this person, but another part of you wants nothing to do with them, there may be some kind of deal breaker holding you back subconsciously."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Kindness can be obvious, like volunteering to help those less fortunate. It can also just mean that they’re available to help out their friends or classmates. Seeing how they interact with others gives you clues about how kind and loving they would be as a partner."

Do you both care about humor, loyalty, compassion, and creativity? If so, the two of you could make a great couple. Think of specific examples and try to pinpoint whether this is worth pursuing or not. [14] X Research source Couples tend to be more successful when they’re on the same page regarding the way they look at the world.

You may say, “I just want you to know that I really value our time together and I like you!” Give them a second to respond, and ask them out on a date if they feel the same way. Don't take it personally if they don't return your affection. Say, “I understand how you feel and there’s no hard feelings.” If you were friends before you told them how you feel, let them know you’d still like to be friends."
