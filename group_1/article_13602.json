      "content": "Yes, tea is safe to drink after the date on the package. Tea actually has \"best by\" or \"sell by\" dates, not expiration dates. Manufacturers place “best if used by” dates on beverages such as tea to estimate when they will start to lose flavor and freshness, whereas expiration dates tell you when a product will be unsafe to consume. [1] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source Teabags can still be safe to drink after the \"best by\" date. Some teas may stay flavorful for many months after the “best if used by\" date passes. So don’t be put off if you pull old teabags out of the cabinet and discover they’re 2, 5, or even 10 years old. They may still make delicious cups of brew. Some teabags can go bad well before the \"best by\" date. That date means nothing if the tea has been improperly stored and allowed to absorb too much moisture. Always check teabags thoroughly before you brew with them to ensure they haven’t spoiled. The term “go bad” can be subjective when it comes to old teabags. Any bags with mold or discoloration on them or a rotting smell should go in the trash. But if the only thing wrong with it is a lack of smell or flavor, you can feel safe drinking it."

Meanwhile, a moldy, smoky, or stale smell means your teabags are moist and the tea has degraded.
