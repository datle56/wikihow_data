      "content": "Use a clarifying shampoo if regular shampoo doesn’t work. Clarifying shampoos are made to give your hair an extra deep cleansing – removing all the gunk and buildup that can cling to your hair over time that regular shampoos often aren’t able to remove. These kinds of shampoos are used in just the same way as regular shampoo. Simply apply the clarifying shampoo to your damp hair, massage it into your scalp and down the rest of your locks, then rinse it out completely. [2] X Research source Be sure to apply a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to your hair after using the clarifying shampoo as clarifying shampoo can remove many of the natural vitamins and minerals from your hair and dry it out. Using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner on your hair will help to replenish these minerals that have been stripped away."

      "content": "Try dry shampoo to soak up some of the excess oil. Before using the dry shampoo, run a clean, dry towel down the length of your hair. Rub the hair lightly, beginning at the roots, then working your way down to the tips. This will help soak up some of the oils on the surface. Then apply a dry shampoo powder to your hair. Spray some dry shampoo on your hair and work it into your scalp. [3] X Research source You might want to use a boar bristle brush to help distribute the oil buildup. If your hair is still quite oily, try adding some baby powder on top of the dry shampoo. Work it into your scalp until the white has fully disappeared."

      "content": "Use a bit of dishwasher detergent for oil that won’t come out. Dishwashing detergent is very good at removing gunk and grime from dishes – and it can work for your hair too! Just apply 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of dishwasher detergent to your hair and massage it into your scalp. Work it through the length of your hair. Rinse your hair thoroughly to make sure all of the detergent is removed, as it can be quite damaging to your hair if it is left in for too long. [4] X Research source Use a dishwasher detergent that is made for sensitive skin, as this type will be easier on your hair. Remember to shampoo and condition your hair after you rinse out the dishwasher detergent. This will help add some of the nutrients back to your hair that were stripped out during washing."
