    {
      "title": "Read your court's guidelines.",
      "content": "Read your court's guidelines. Every court should have guidelines that they provide to their jurors and juror candidates. You will be able to find it and FAQs online or in your jurist information packet. Some courts require a jacket and tie, others only require a collared shirt. Be familiar with your guidelines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay professional.",
      "content": "Stay professional. If you either want to look like a suitable candidate or you have already been selected to serve on the jury and are aiming to be jury foreman, you will want to look your best without looking flashy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be as comfortable as possible.",
      "content": "Be as comfortable as possible. Between either waiting for selection or courtroom proceedings and jury deliberation, you will likely be in your outfit for quite some time. Dress comfortably. Wear seasonal clothing, carry layers if necessary, and make sure that your socks and shoes don't pinch or constrict."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave beachwear at home.",
      "content": "Leave beachwear at home. Flip-flops, tank tops, short skirts and shorts are generally frowned on. In some locations you will be asked to leave and return at a later day when you are dressed appropriately. If it’s extremely hot outside, some modest women’s sleeveless shirts or dresses may be allowed. If you wear something that doesn't fully cover your shoulders, bring something to layer on top just in case."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress business casual at a minimum.",
      "content": "Dress business casual at a minimum. While you can dress more formally if you'd like—although it's better to leave that for the attorneys—, business casual is a must, especially if you are looking to get selected or given a leadership role. Women and men are generally comfortable and appropriate with khakis, slacks, button down shirts, sweaters, blazers or skirts that are at knee level or below."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid obvious brands and slogans.",
      "content": "Avoid obvious brands and slogans. If you are still going through selection, brands and slogans may single you out when you are being interviewed. Clothing that expresses political, religious or other opinions may lead to further questions and potential dismissal from the jury pool. You may be asked to leave if you are wearing clothing emblazoned with offensive words."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress more conservatively.",
      "content": "Dress more conservatively. A courtroom is a place where people of many generations will be in attendance. Most people dress as if they are going to church or work. There are better places to express your sense of fashion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear closed-toed shoes.",
      "content": "Wear closed-toed shoes. Some courtrooms require this, and sandals would rarely be considered appropriate anyway. More importantly, jury rooms can be cold and you may experience discomfort during a full day of jury service. Be sure to wear comfortable, breathable socks as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring extra layers.",
      "content": "Bring extra layers. Try a cardigan, a jacket, a scarf and/or tights to reduce your discomfort. If you wear several layers, you will be able to remove them or add them on as your body temperature changes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave unnecessary jewelry and loose change at home.",
      "content": "Leave unnecessary jewelry and loose change at home. Many courts require their jurors to pass through metal detectors. It will save you time and hassle if you can place all your metal items in your purse or bag, so that you don’t have to be swept with a detection wand each time you leave and return for lunch or breaks.

    },
    {
      "title": "Push the limits.",
      "content": "Push the limits. While you are required by law to participate, some people prefer to avoid jury duty. If this is you, you'll need to push the limits of what is acceptable attire. Dress too far off the beaten path and you may be asked to change and return again. Dress too standard and you run a higher risk of being selected. Understand your court's requirements and work to subvert them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress down.",
      "content": "Dress down. When in doubt, dress down. Even if your court has very strict rules and requires a jacket and tie, you can deliberately tie the tie incorrectly or wear an obviously miss-sized suit. You won't look good, but if you look sloppy and unprofessional your odds of being selected drop considerably. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay comfortable.",
      "content": "Stay comfortable. Even though you are trying not to get chosen, orientation and selection can sometimes still take quite a while. While you aren't planning on making a full day (or days) of it, you should definitely try to make sure you aren't itchy, hot, cold, or uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Display slogans, brands, and logos.",
      "content": "Display slogans, brands, and logos. Depending on your courtroom rules (and how well you layer your clothes when you walk in) you can get away with a lot here. While wearing a politically, religiously or racially charged slogan might be faux pas, it might also get you out of jury duty because you will seem biased or inflammatory. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear religiously and ethnically expressive clothing.",
      "content": "Wear religiously and ethnically expressive clothing. Ideal jurors are completely unbiased, so by displaying an obvious bias you can make yourself a less ideal candidate. [4] X Research source This is a great time to break out your yarmulke or even flag-colored muumuu if there is leeway in the guidelines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bling it up.",
      "content": "Bling it up. If possible, wear flashy and oversized costume style jewelry. As a general rule, you want to do anything that you can to make yourself noticeable or stand out in an unconventional or unprofessional way. [5] X Research source Garish jewelry and even makeup are a good way to do that."
