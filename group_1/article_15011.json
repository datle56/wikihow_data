[1] X Research source If you don’t have access to a covered place to park in the rain, then just close the car windows, so no more rain can get in."

      "content": "Park your car in full sunlight if it’s sunny out and open the windows. Sunlight will help dry your car out, so find the sunniest parking spot possible. Park somewhere that’s likely to be sunny for a while, because it generally takes at least 3 hours to dry out car seats. [2] X Research source If it’s relatively warm outside, with intense sunlight, the car will dry more quickly."

      "content": "Towel off as much of the wetness as you can. Press fluffy towels onto the car seats to soak up as much moisture as possible. Lean into the towels with your weight so that they soak up more moisture. [5] X Research source You may go through a large stack of towels in this process."

      "content": "Use a shop vac on the “wet” setting, if you have one. If you happen to have a shop vac, this a great time to use it. Position the vacuum to the “wet” setting, and run the nozzle all over the car seat, so that it sucks up the moisture. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a shop vac, get by with fans or a blow dryer."

      "title": "Position as many fans as possible pointing into the car.",
      "content": "Position as many fans as possible pointing into the car. You should park the car near an outlet, and plug a powerstrip into the outlet. Then you can plug all your fans into the powerstrip, and position them pointing in the open car doors or windows toward your car seats. [7] X Research source You should leave the fans blowing for at least 24 hours, but may need up to 48 hours."

      "title": "Use a blow dryer to tackle any remaining wetness.",
      "content": "Use a blow dryer to tackle any remaining wetness. You’ll have to park your car near an outlet so that you can plug in your blow dryer. Then hold the blow dryer about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the car seat and move it back and forth until it dries the moisture. If your blow dryer has multiple heat settings, put it on medium heat to avoid heat damage to your upholstery. [8] X Research source A blow dryer shouldn’t be your first tool of choice, because its strong heat can damage the seats. However, if you’ve already tried toweling, sunlight, a fan, and a shop vac, it’s time to give the blow dryer a try."

You can place the dehumidifier on the floor of the car or on the car seat, or you can run it in the garage with all your car windows open. [9] X Research source Dehumidifiers work by collecting the moisture that’s floating in the air, and storing it in a tank."

Mix 8 parts vinegar with 2 parts water in a spray bottle and spray the car seats and any other area of your car that’s smelly. Let it sit for about 15 minutes and then vacuum up the vinegar and the mold with a small handheld vacuum, or with the upholstery extension of a regular carpet-cleaning vacuum. The vinegar will help kill the mold. Make sure to use plain white vinegar, and not any other type of vinegar, like cider or balsamic."

It will take away the scent of the vinegar and any lingering scent of mildew. Coat the seats in a thin layer of baking soda. Let it sit for about 15 minutes and then vacuum it up with a handheld vacuum or the upholstery extension on a regular vacuum cleaner. You may need to use several boxes of baking soda."
