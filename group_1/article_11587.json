Once you feel like she's comfortable enough with you saying hi to approach her, just walk up to her some time and have a short conversation.

Don't try to engage a shy girl in class, or while you've got four of your friends with you, or it's going to be rough. Bring up something simple to talk about, something that you know you have in common, and have a short one-on-one conversation. If you're in class together, just talk about class: \"I really messed up that last test. It was so hard. How'd you do? Do you like this class?\" You could also arrange to talk one-on-one at a later time. For example, you could say something like, “Hey, do you have a minute to talk right after school gets out? I have a question to ask you.” Reader Poll: We asked 520 wikiHow readers how they prefer to get to know a girl, and 65% of them agreed that the best conversation topics are hobbies, interests, and extracurriculars.

This usually makes it worse. Instead of drawing it out, just exchange a short little chat and then break it off. Say, \"Hey, good talking to you. See you later!\" If it seems like she feels uncomfortable, don't draw extra attention to it. Just end the conversation in a friendly way, with a small compliment. \"It's so good talking to you. You're funny. Let's talk again soon.\""

Keep it simple and keep it short: \"Hey, I've always noticed you and I think you're a really sweet and really nice person. I like you a lot. Would you like to go out with me sometime?\" Sometimes, things like dances or other big events can be intimidating for shy girls. It's actually sometimes better to just keep it vague: \"Would you like to go out sometime\" might be better than, \"How about this Friday?\" You can also ask her if she would prefer a social event or something quieter. For example, you could ask if she’d prefer to go to an upcoming dance, or just go to a coffee shop and talk. It's always better to ask directly rather than indirectly!

This isn't because she doesn't like you, but because introverted or shy-types like to have their plans in place. Shy girls need a chance to get ready mentally for a date. If it's 4:30 on a Friday night and a shy girl doesn't have plans, she's probably looking forward to a quiet night at home. Make your plans ahead of time to give her enough opportunity to prepare. In general, try to make plans at least 1-2 days ahead of time at least."

If conversation is going to be hard, try to pick an activity that'll let her loosen up and have a good time, without having to do a lot of talking. Going for a bike ride, bowling, or playing mini golf might seem like silly ways to go on a date, but it's a good way to keep yourself active and busy. You'll have a fun shared experience. Dinner is a good opportunity to talk, but it might end up being pretty awkward if you have a hard time talking together. Alternatively, movies mean you can't talk at all. Not the best choices. Make sure whatever you do is quiet enough for her to talk if she wants to. If you go to a booming club with loud electronic music, you'll never be able to talk."

Make the time that you're together special, even if you're not doing something that sounds like a date. Cook dinner together, instead of going out to a fancy new restaurant. This gives you the chance to do an activity that will get you talking, even if you're just talking about the chicken and rice dish you're making together."

Of course, some girls might be more comfortable in group dates and feel more shy one-on-one. All girls are different. Talk to her and find out what she prefers and do what makes her feel comfortable.

But even if a girl isn't self-conscious, it's a good idea to offer compliments to make her feel comfortable and loved. Keep them simple and genuine to make a shy girl feel more confident around you. If she does, she'll open up more and be less shy in some cases. Don't pile it on, just keep it simple, and make it something that she has control over, not something abstract about her looks. \"Your eyes are pretty\" might be nice, but \"I love your hair like that\" is a great one, because she did her hair. You're complimenting her choice, not her looks. Make sure to compliment her personality traits as well, such as her intelligence, sense of humor, etc."

It doesn't mean she doesn't like you, or that she's about to dump you. It just means she's being who she is. Relax and move at her pace. If you call or text her and leave a message, don't get in touch again until she responds to it. You left the message. She'll get it. Let her decide how much of your relationship to share on social networking. Don't put up a bunch of pictures and updates about what you're doing together unless she wants to.
