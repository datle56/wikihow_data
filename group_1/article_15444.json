      "title": "Toast raw sesame seeds",
      "content": "Toast raw sesame seeds to give them a nuttier aroma and flavor. Raw sesame seeds are fine to use as-is, but toasting them is an easy way to ramp up their flavor profile. Buy toasted sesame seeds at the grocery store, or make your own in the oven or on the stovetop. To toast sesame seeds in the oven, spread the raw seeds evenly over an ungreased baking sheet. Bake them at 350 °F (177 °C) until they’re lightly browned and have a nutty aroma. This usually takes 5-15 minutes. To toast sesame seeds on the stovetop, spread the raw seeds evenly in a large ungreased skillet. Cook the seeds over medium-low heat until they turn light brown and give off a nutty scent. This typically takes only 2-3 minutes. Move the skillet constantly so that the seeds wouldn’t burn. As the skillet is getting heated, the seeds may start popping out of it. Consider using a mesh splatter screen to cover it. Store the toasted seeds in a tightly-sealed container and stash them in the refrigerator (for up to 6 months) or freezer (for up to 1 year). So long as the seeds don’t give off a rancid smell, they’re still fine to use."

Right before baking the shaped dough, spray or brush it with a small amount of water. Sprinkle on the sesame seeds and bake as directed by your recipe. Alternatively, try mixing sesame seeds right into your bread dough! You can also do this with cookie doughs and cake batters. The texture of the small seeds will be barely noticeable, but they’ll impart a slight nuttiness to the finished product."

Sesame brittle is one of the simplest—and most delicious—options: [3] X Research source Add sugar and honey in a 3:1 ratio (3 times as much sugar as honey) to a saucepan and heat it on medium, stirring often, until completely combined. Add sesame seeds in an amount equal to the sugar-honey mixture (for example, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of honey, and 1 cup of seeds) to the saucepan and stir them frequently until the mixture reads 300 °F (149 °C) on a candy thermometer.

      "content": "Blend a spoonful of seeds into your go-to smoothie recipe. Sesame seeds have a fairly mild flavor that complements any combination of fruits and veggies in a smoothie. Because of their small size, the seeds also break down easily in a blender—they’ll add some texture, but not grittiness, to your smoothie. If you like to sweeten up your smoothie a bit more, try honey, which pairs exceptionally well with sesame seeds."

      "content": "Make your own tahini for use in hummus and other recipes. Add 1 c (approx. 150 g) of sesame seeds and 2 tbsp (30 ml) of a mild-flavored olive oil to a blender or food processor. Combine the ingredients for 2-3 minutes until they form a smooth paste. Add more oil and continue blending for another 30-60 seconds if you prefer a thinner tahini. Add salt to taste, if desired. [5] X Research source Use raw or toasted sesame seeds. Toasted seeds will give your tahini a nuttier flavor. Instead of olive oil, try combining 1 1/2 tbsp (22.5 ml) of a neutral-flavored vegetable oil (like grapeseed oil) with 1/2 tbsp (7.5 ml) of sesame oil. Store the tahini in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month."

For example, if your recipe calls for 1 c of all-purpose flour, you can use 3/4 c of all-purpose flour and 1/4 c of sesame flour. Or, if your recipe calls for 200 g of all-purpose flour, you can use 150 g of all-purpose flour and 50 g of sesame flour."

Buy sesame oil at your favorite store, or try your hand at making your own ! Sesame oils that are lighter in color are best for cooking, while those that are darker in color are best for dressings."
