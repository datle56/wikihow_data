      "title": "Approach the butterfly slowly.",
      "content": "Approach the butterfly slowly. If you move quickly, the butterfly you’re trying to catch might fly away. Take slow and careful steps toward the butterfly from behind so it doesn’t get startled by sudden movements. Don’t yell or shout while you get closer to the butterfly. Try to get within 2–3 ft (0.61–0.91 m) of the butterfly before stopping. [1] X Research source Butterflies have compound eyes that can see 360 degrees around them at any time. Take your time and be patient if you want to catch a particular butterfly."

      "title": "Push your hand underneath the butterfly’s feet so it rests on your palm.",
      "content": "Push your hand underneath the butterfly’s feet so it rests on your palm. Slowly extend your open hand out towards the butterfly and hold your hand close to it. Once the butterfly is used to your hand being there, slightly push your hand under the butterfly’s feet. The butterfly will step onto your fingers if it feels comfortable. When it gets on your hand, slowly pull it away from the plant it’s resting on. [2] X Research source If you don’t want the butterfly to get away, cup your other hand over it while you walk around. Keep the hand the butterfly is on still while you slowly put your other hand over it. Leave a small hole so the butterfly has air."

      "title": "Let the butterfly fly away when it’s ready.",
      "content": "Let the butterfly fly away when it’s ready. Keep the butterfly in your hand to observe it while it rests. It may try to look for nectar with its proboscis or just relax when you’re holding it. When the butterfly wants to leave, it will fly away on its own. [3] X Research source Be careful not to squeeze the butterfly’s body or else it will die. Don’t touch the butterfly’s wings if you don’t have to. The scales on its wings could get damaged."

      "title": "Put sugar water on your hand so the butterfly can drink.",
      "content": "Put sugar water on your hand so the butterfly can drink. Mix together 1 c (240 ml) of water with 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and heat it until the solution turns clear. Then mix 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of the solution with 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 ml) of water to dilute it so it’s similar to nectar, the butterfly’s major food source. Let the solution cool before applying a small amount on your palm with a cotton swab. Butterflies taste with their feet, so hold your hand under them to get them in your hand. Alternatively, you can hold a piece of sweet fruit, such as watermelon or banana, to attract a butterfly. Don't add any coloring to your sugar water."

      "title": "Rub a leaf on your hand from a plant that butterflies normally land on.",
      "content": "Rub a leaf on your hand from a plant that butterflies normally land on. If you notice that the butterflies you want to catch stay near a specific plant, take a few leaves off of it. Rub the leaves on your palms to get their scent on your hands. Then, offer your hand to the butterflies so they can climb on."

      "title": "Stay close to flowers with bright colors.",
      "content": "Stay close to flowers with bright colors. Many butterflies are attracted to colored plants since their flowers have sweet nectar. Look for flowers that are orange, red, pink, or yellow when you try to catch the butterfly, and sit or stand near them. On a warm, sunny day, many butterflies will find their way closer to you. [4] X Research source Some butterflies can be found on certain plants. For example, Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on the milkweed plant so they can commonly be found there. Try wearing bright clothing as well"
