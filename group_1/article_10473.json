You’ll need 1.5 cups (350 mL) of organic rose petals, 1 cup (240 mL) of Epsom salt, 1 tablespoon (about 14 g) of baking soda, 1.5 cups (350 mL) cups of Himalayan sea salt, a glass jar, a mixing bowl, a spoon, rose essential oils, and a blender. [48] X Research source Begin by drying out one to two cups of organic rose petals in your microwave. Layer them on a microwave-safe plate between layers of paper towels. Microwave for 30-40 seconds and check them. Continue in 15-second intervals until the petals are fully dry. Mix the Epsom salt, baking soda, and Himalayan sea salt in your mixing bowl. Add 4-8 drops of rose essential oils. Blend your rose petals in your blender until they look like confetti. Add them to your salt mixture and use your spoon to mix. Finally, pour them into a glass jar and seal. To use, simply add 2 oz from the jar to your bath."

      "content": "Denim feathers Upcycle old jeans or denim scraps into bohemian feathers. For this advanced craft, you’ll need denim scraps (including some without seams), scissors, twine , fabric Mod Podge , wooden beads (10 millimetres (0.39 in), with a 5 millimetres (0.20 in) hole), a wooden stick, and push pins. [49] X Research source First, cut the outline of a feather shape from each denim scrap—it should look like a long teardrop. Cut a piece of twine that’s 2 inches (5.1 cm) inches longer than the denim scrap. Cover it with fabric Mod Podge and place it on the center of the cutout feather like a spine. Create a feather effect in your denim scrap by pulling out the threads to fray it on each side of the twine. Repeat with your other denim scraps and push a wooden bead down the twine of each feather to secure it into a loop. Insert push pins along the back of your wood stick. Use more twine to fix the feathers to them so they hang at different lengths. Your boho decoration is complete!"
