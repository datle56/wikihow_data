      "content": "Pálinka is a type of fruit brandy made exclusively in Hungary. First appearing in the 1600s, this classic drink is made through a process of fermentation and distillation. The term “Romanian pálinka” isn’t actually accurate, as the European Union actually created a “pálinka law” that only allows pálinka to be made and produced in Hungary (along with 4 Austrian regions). [1] X Research source Instead, Romanian pálinka is better known as “ţuică,” a type of plum brandy. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy homemade pálinka from a market stall if you’re in Hungary. Stop by a market stall and scope out any vendors selling fruits and veggies. Make a friendly purchase, and then inquire if they about any “házi pálinka,” or homemade pálinka in the area. With any luck, this person can lead you to a homemade pálinka seller at the market stall (or they might sell pálinka themselves). [3] X Research source A homemade pálinka seller will likely be selling other fruit-related wares, like jam. You definitely don’t have to be fluent in Hungarian to make this type of purchase, but it can help to learn and speak a few phrases so you can build credibility with the sellers. For instance, use “kapható” (kuh-pah-to), the Hungarian word for “available,” to see what’s in stock."

      "content": "Pour pálinka into a small tulip-shaped glass . Tulip glasses are great for spirits, and pálinka is no exception. Pálinka enthusiasts recommend swirling the glass around a little bit before you actually take a sip—that way, you can smell all the fruity notes of the drink. Only fill the wide, bottom bowl section of the glass with pálinka—not the entire thing. If you’d really like to pace yourself, start with a 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) serving of the drink before pouring yourself any more. [4] X Research source Pálinka experts advise against using shot glasses for pálinka, since they don’t let you enjoy all of the drink’s different flavor notes and aromas."

Pálinka comes in a variety of flavors, including apricot, plum, pear, cherry, and apple. [5] X Research source With that being said, there’s no rule against drinking pálinka like a shot! If gulping the drink quickly is more your style, feel free to do so."
