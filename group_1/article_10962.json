For instance, your foundation chain could consist of 19 (18 + 1), 22 (21 + 1), or 31 (30 + 1) chain stitches. To make a slip knot : Cross the attached end of the yarn over the working end to create a loop. Push the attached side of the yarn into this loop from underneath it, creating a second loop. Tighten the first loop to secure the second loop. Insert the crochet hook into the second loop and tighten it. To make a chain stitch : Wrap the attached side of the yarn in between the hook and the loop already on the hook. Pull this yarn through the loop on your hook to complete the stitch."
