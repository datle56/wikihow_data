To view the dump file's contents , you can use a Microsoft program called WinDbg. This program isn't preinstalled, but you can download it from the Microsoft Store . [3] X Research source First, open File Explorer and go to C:\\Windows\\Minidump. If there's a file inside, copy it to your desktop so you can easily scan it in WinDbg. Open WinDbg and go to File > Open dump file . Select the dump file on your desktop and click Open to view the file. Browse the contents of the dump file to determine the root of the DPC Watchdog Violation error. If you don't know what the driver is by its file name, you can search for it online to see what hardware it works for. If you're having trouble understanding what you see, you can try another free tool called BlueScreenView, though it's a third-party tool not created by Microsoft. You can download BlueScreen View from https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html (scroll all the way to the bottom for the download links)."
