      "content": "Determine whether your points are noncollinear. Noncollinear means that they are not on the same line. You can draw a circle from any three points, as long as they are not on the same line. [2] X Research source If you aren’t sure whether the points are collinear, lay a straightedge across them. If the straightedge passes through all three points, the points are collinear, and you cannot use them to draw a circle."

Draw a line connecting these two points. The line you draw is a perpendicular bisector. It bisects the line at a right angle. [6] X Research source"

[9] X Research source To set the width, place the tip of the compass on the center of the circle, and open the compass to any one of your original points. [10] X Research source For example, you might set the tip of the compass on the circle center, and reach the pencil to point B."
