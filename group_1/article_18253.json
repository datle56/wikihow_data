      "content": "Store the fruit at room temperature for 1 to 2 weeks if it isn’t ripe. This will help the ripening process. You can store them next to apples or pineapples to speed them up, but they’ll stay tough and firm for a couple of weeks. [1] X Research source You can also keep unripe persimmons in your fridge, but they won’t ripen as quickly. If your persimmons are already ripe, don’t worry about keeping them at room temperature. You can go straight to freezing them."

      "content": "Place the persimmons on a tray and freeze them for 1 to 2 hours. Spread your persimmons out on a baking tray in a single layer. Put the tray in the freezer for a few hours to make them firm and harden up. You can also put your persimmons in a bag, but they might take a little longer to get firm."

      "content": "Wrap each persimmon individually with plastic wrap. You can also use a plastic bag. Wrap each persimmon in one layer of plastic wrap to keep them from getting freezer burn. Freezing each one individually will make them easier to eat, too. [2] X Research source Wrapping the fruit after it’s already frozen will make it less likely to bruise."

      "title": "Place the persimmons back into the freezer.",
      "content": "Place the persimmons back into the freezer. They shouldn’t take long to freeze —an hour or two and they’ll be fully frozen! Make sure they aren’t squished behind anything or underneath anything in your freezer. If you’re worried about freezer burn, place your persimmons into an airtight container before you freeze them. You can freeze whole persimmons indefinitely, but they’ll start to lose their taste and texture after about 3 months."

      "content": "Let the persimmons thaw at room temp for 20 minutes before you eat them. When you want a deliciously cold snack, take a persimmon out of the freezer and let it sit at room temperature. Cut the top off and eat the insides with a spoon for a yummy treat. The persimmons will stay sweet even after they’re frozen."

[3] X Research source Once your persimmons are ripe, you can feel free to snack on a couple before you freeze them. They’ll taste sweet, not astringent, so they’ll be delicious!"

This can lead to some chunky pureé. If you don’t want to deal with a sieve, blitz your persimmon pieces in a food processor or a blender."
