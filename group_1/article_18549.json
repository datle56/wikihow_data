      "title": "Use cold stratification to germinate most maple seeds.",
      "content": "Use cold stratification to germinate most maple seeds. Cold stratification is the process of exposing seeds to cold and moist conditions that emulate winter weather to encourage germination. Many maple trees lie dormant over the winter and germinate as soon as the temperatures warm, so the cold stratification approach produces very high germination rates in these species. [1] X Research source This includes sugar maples , bigleaf maples, boxelder maples, Japanese maples, Norway maples, and some red maples. All of these species drop their seeds in autumn or early winter. If your red maple trees drop their seeds in spring or early summer, try germinating them in soil instead. If you’re going to plant your maple seeds outdoors, start this method 90-120 days before the last winter frost."

      "content": "Fill a plastic bag with growing material. Place a handful of peat moss , vermiculite , or germination paper in a small, plastic resealable bag. Tiny “snack-sized” bags work best; larger bags trap more air with the seeds, which can lead to fungal problems. For best results, use sterile material and handle it with disposable gloves to avoid introducing fungus. [2] X Research source Red maple seeds are sensitive to acidity. For this species, choose vermiculite (a neutral or basic substance) rather than peat moss (acidic). [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a few drops of water and optional fungicide.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of water and optional fungicide. Moisture is important to ensure the seeds germinate properly. [4] X Research source Add a couple drops of water to the growing material to dampen it slightly. If you see standing water or you can squeeze water out from the material, it is too wet. If you’d like, add a bit of fungicide , as well, to help prevent mold. Fungicide isn’t always necessary and may damage the plant if overused, so add it only in tiny quantities, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Some growers rinse the seeds in very diluted bleach solutions instead of using fungicide."

      "title": "Add the seeds to the bag and store it in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Add the seeds to the bag and store it in the refrigerator. Place your seeds in the bag, then, starting from the base, roll the bag to expel most of the air and zip it closed. For most species, the ideal stratification temperature is typically around 33.8-41ºF (1–5ºC). The crisper drawer of a refrigerator is usually about this temperature, making it a great place to store your seeds. [5] X Research source Ideally, use a thermometer to confirm the correct temperature. Some seeds may fail to germinate if the temperature is just a couple degrees off. If possible, keep boxelder and Norway maple seeds at exactly 41ºF (5ºC), and red maple seeds at exactly 37.4ºF (3ºC). [6] X Research source Other species are not as picky."

      "content": "Store them for 40–120 days, checking every week or two. Most of these maple species take 90–120 days to germinate, but the bigleaf maple and a few others can sprout in as few as 40. Every week or two, check on the bag to see how the seeds are progressing and make adjustments as needed: [7] X Research source If you notice condensation, pick up the bag and gently tap it to knock the water droplets off. Lay the bag back down on the opposite side, so the wet seeds have a chance to dry off. If the growing material has dried out, add a drop or 2 of water. If you notice any mold or black spots, remove the affected seed and throw it away. If the whole batch is molding, try a little fungicide. If the seeds have begun to sprout, remove them from the refrigerator."

      "title": "Plant the seeds in moist soil.",
      "content": "Plant the seeds in moist soil. Once the seeds have germinated, plant them ¼–1 in (0.6–2.5 cm) under moist soil. Most maples do well in partial shade, but look up the exact species for more specific information about planting conditions. [8] X Research source To increase the odds of survival, start the seedlings in an indoor seed tray instead. Fill the tray with 7.6–10 cm (3–4 inches) of well-draining potting soil, or an even mix of peat moss, rotted compost, vermiculite, and coarse sand. Water whenever the soil becomes completely dry. Transfer to planter pots once the second set of leaves appear."

      "title": "Follow this approach for mountain and Asian species.",
      "content": "Follow this approach for mountain and Asian species. Vine maple, striped maple, Amur maple, and paperbark maple are all tough to germinate and require extra attention, typically by being exposed to both warm and cold temperatures. This applies to most other species native to Asia, as well as mountain maples and rocky mountain maples. [9] X Research source All of the seeds in this category drop in autumn or winter. Left alone in the soil, they can take years to germinate."

      "title": "Weaken the maple seed’s outer hull.",
      "content": "Weaken the maple seed’s outer hull. Many of these species have an extremely hard hull (pericarp) and need a little help getting started. Growers often “scarify” the hull to greatly improve germination rates. There are a few different scarification methods to try: [10] X Research source Rub the base of the seed (opposite the wing) against a nail file or sandpaper. Stop as soon as you break through the hull, barely nicking the seed coat underneath. Soak the seeds in household-strength hydrogen peroxide for several hours, then rinse well. Soak the seeds in warm water for 24 hours. All of these methods help weaken or open the hull, allowing the seed to absorb water more quickly."

The US Forest Service recommends keeping most of these maple seeds at 68–86ºF (20–30ºC) for 30-60 days, though some, like the rocky mountain maple, may require up to 180 days. [11] X Research source These species have not been studied as thoroughly as other maple species, so exact guidelines may not be available depending on the type of seed you have."

      "content": "Cold stratify the seeds for 90-180 days. Transfer the seeds to a resealable plastic bag with a small handful of peat moss or other growing material. Store the bag in the refrigerator and check back every couple weeks to look for signs of mold, drying, or sprouting. Rocky mountain seeds ( Acer glabrum ) usually take the full 180 days to germinate. Other species can take as few as 90, but they are unpredictable. [12] X Research source Don't expect every seed to sprout. Germination rates as low as 20% are common for these species."

      "title": "Collect seeds in late spring or early summer.",
      "content": "Collect seeds in late spring or early summer. Silver maples and some red maples (but not Japanese red maples) will drop their seeds early in the growing season. These species do not go dormant, and there is no need for any special treatments, so their seeds can be germinated directly in soil. [14] X Research source Some red maple trees will not drop seeds until autumn or winter; these require cold stratification. Even the groves that drop seeds early usually have alternate years of good and bad seed production."

      "title": "Plant the seeds in a moist, sunny area immediately.",
      "content": "Plant the seeds in a moist, sunny area immediately. These types of maple seeds will die if they dry out in storage, so plant them shortly after you collect them. Choose moist ground with plenty of leaf litter and other material, and make sure the seeds get plenty of sun, as they don’t typically grow well in shady areas. As long as the soil doesn’t dry out, the seeds will require no maintenance and should germinate quickly. [15] X Research source Planting in partial shade may be okay depending on the species. Silver maples grow poorly in shade, while red maples can handle shade for 3-5 years but may have trouble growing if they remain under the canopy past that point. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave bare seedbeds undisturbed (optional).",
      "content": "Leave bare seedbeds undisturbed (optional). If some of the seeds fail to germinate, they will often sprout the following year. These are usually a minority of the seeds, but if you haven’t had much success, it could be worth leaving the area untended for a second season. [17] X Research source If very few of the seeds germinate and the climate has been fairly typical, the seeds most likely died in storage. Plant a new batch next year rather than waiting."

      "content": "How do I know when to collect maple tree seeds? Depending on the species, collect maple tree seeds in the spring or fall. Generally, when the seeds are ripe and ready to be germinated, they’ll fall off the tree. In some cases, though, it may be necessary to pluck the seeds from the branches. Most ripe maple tree seeds will appear brown when they’re ready to be picked. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Do maple tree seeds need cold stratification?",
      "content": "Do maple tree seeds need cold stratification? It depends on the species. Any maple tree that drops its seeds in autumn or early winter needs some form of cold stratification to germinate. Trees that drop their seeds in the spring, however, germinate quickly and the seeds can be planted directly in the soil. Be sure to check what kind of seeds you have before stratifying them.

      "title": "Why are my maple seeds not germinating?",
      "content": "Why are my maple seeds not germinating? Maple tree seeds may fail to germinate if there is too much or too little water or if the temperature is too high or too low. This is especially true for seeds that germinate through cold stratification, as some types need to be kept at a very precise temperature. Monitor the temperature, soil conditions, and light conditions of your seeds to keep them healthy. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "How do I keep pests away from maple seedlings? If you’re starting your maple seedlings in a seed tray, something as simple as putting a cover over them can keep pests like green flies and aphids away. If you’re growing your seedlings directly in the ground or if pests attack anyway, spray them lightly with a pesticide. [21] X Research source If you don’t want to use pesticides, another option is to mix a bit of dish soap with water and spray the seedlings. This should help keep aphids away."

      "content": "How fast do maple trees grow? How fast a maple tree grows depends on its species. Some take up to 30 years to reach maturity, while others take as few as 10. For example, a red maple tree typically grows 10-12 ft (3-3.6 m) in 5-7 years after it’s been established. Research different types of maple trees to determine how quickly they’ll grow.
