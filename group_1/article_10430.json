      "title": "Remove the subwoofer from the box if you already have it installed.",
      "content": "Remove the subwoofer from the box if you already have it installed. Locate the screws holding the subwoofer speaker in your box and loosen them with a screwdriver. Carefully lift the speaker out from the hole so all of the cords and wires pull through it without snagging. Set the subwoofer aside while you’re working on the box so it doesn’t get damaged. [1] X Research source Avoid leaving the subwoofer attached while you cover the box since the carpet won’t lay flush and you could damage the speaker."

      "title": "Measure the dimensions of the box to calculate the surface area.",
      "content": "Measure the dimensions of the box to calculate the surface area. Find the length, width, and depth of the box and write down your measurements. Set up the equation 2(L x W) + 2(W x D) + 2(L x D), where L is the length, W is the width, and D is the depth. Solve the equation with a calculator to find the total area you’ll need to cover with carpet. [2] X Research source For example, if your box is 24 × 12 × 10 in (61 × 30 × 25 cm), then your equation would look like 2(24 x 12) + 2(12 x 10) + 2(24 x 10). Next, simplify the parentheticals: 2(288) + 2(120) + 2(240). Then, multiply the numbers together: 576 + 240 + 480. Finally, add the numbers together to get the surface area, so the total surface area of the box is 1,296 square inches (0.836 m 2 ). If you don’t have a rectangular subwoofer box, then measure the area of each side and add them together."

      "title": "Cut liner carpet 6 in (15 cm) longer than the box’s end perimeter.",
      "content": "Cut liner carpet 6 in (15 cm) longer than the box’s end perimeter. Look for liner carpet that’s lint-free and matches the color of your vehicle’s interior or the space where you’re keeping the subwoofer. Measure the perimeter around the edge on the short end of the box and add 6 inches (15 cm) so you have some excess carpet. Use a pair of scissors to cut your carpet to the correct length. [3] X Research source For example, if your box is 24 × 12 × 10 in (61 × 30 × 25 cm), the perimeter on the short end would equal 2(12 + 10), which simplifies to 44 inches (110 cm). Add 6 inches (15 cm) to the length so the carpet is 50 inches (130 cm) long. Using carpet longer than the edge’s perimeter allows you to wrap the box with 1 continuous piece so you don’t have multiple seams. You can buy liner carpet online or from an auto supply or carpet store. Avoid using carpet that has thick backing on it since you won’t be able to bend or flex it around the box as easily."

      "content": "Trim the piece of carpet as wide as the box’s combined length and width. Add the box’s length and width together to find your measurement. Use your scissors and a straightedge to cut the carpet to the proper width so it can wrap around the shortest ends. That way, you won’t have unattractive seams around the edges of the box and it will look like a single piece. [4] X Research source For example, if your box is 24 × 12 × 10 in (61 × 30 × 25 cm), then the carpet width would equal 24 + 12, which would be 36 inches (91 cm)."

      "content": "Spread the liner carpet face down on a flat surface. Find a flat space in a well-ventilated area to work, such as in a garage or on a driveway, since the adhesive you’ll use creates harmful fumes. Lay your carpet on the ground so the good side is on the bottom, and smooth out any wrinkles so it’s flat. [5] X Research source Avoid putting the carpet face-up, or else it will be backwards when you attach it to the box. If you need to work indoors, open windows and run a fan to keep the space ventilated properly."

      "content": "Lay the box in the middle of the carpet so the speaker hole faces down. Set your box in the center so the carpet extends past the short ends by the same distance on each side. Test wrapping the carpet around the box’s longer sides to make sure it covers the wood completely, and adjust the box’s position if you need to. [6] X Research source If you keep the speaker hole face up, then the carpet seam will be on the front of the subwoofer box and it may not look as clean."

Dip a paintbrush in your cement and apply a thin layer to a side of the box that’s perpendicular to the carpet. Then spread the cement on the rectangular area of the carpet directly below the side you just worked on. [7] X Research source Contact cement is an adhesive that sticks to itself, and you can buy it from your local hardware store. You may also use a spray adhesive if you want. Still be sure to apply it to both the carpet and the box so it sticks better."

Test the adhesive with your finger to make sure it’s dry to the touch but still tacky.

Slowly lift the carpet and press it against the side of the box covered with adhesive. Wrap the edge of the carpet around the top of the box and smooth out any wrinkles from the bottom edge toward the top with your hand. [9] X Research source You may also use a plastic scraper to try and smooth out any wrinkles in the fabric. If there are wrinkles or folds you can’t get out, carefully peel the carpet back and stretch it again. Usually, you can readjust the carpet once or twice without reapplying adhesive."

Apply your contact cement to the next adjacent side and the carpet directly below it. After the contact cement dries, pull your carpet tight onto the wood and smooth it out. After you attach the third side, you should have 2 loose flaps of carpet that fold over onto the back of the box.

Smooth out any wrinkles as best as you can, working from the edge toward the center of the box. Then fold the second flap down so it slightly overlaps the first flap. Press the carpet down firmly so it adheres properly to the wood.

Lay a straightedge down so it’s parallel to the edges of the carpet and runs through the center of the box. Press a utility knife into the carpet at the edge of the box, and drag the blade along the straightedge so it cuts through both carpet flaps. If you aren’t able to cut through both pieces of the carpet in a single cut, go over it 1–2 more times until you feel the blade drag against the wood underneath. [15] X Research source Always cut away from your body so you don’t accidentally injure yourself if the blade slips.

Press down on the carpet to see where it feels loose so you know the hole’s location. Push the knife blade through the carpet and slowly slice toward the edge of the hole. Follow along the hole’s outline with the blade to remove the circular section of carpet. Work slowly so your cuts are precise and tight against the edge.

Paint a thin layer of the contact cement onto the exposed wood on the box’s short end. Then, thoroughly apply it to each of the carpet flaps. Allow the cement to dry for 10–15 minutes, or until it doesn’t feel wet anymore.
