If the song is slow and you don't want to get too fancy, an easy position is to just embrace each other if you don't mind getting close.

      "content": "Work on the traditional dancing hold for a bit of elegance. Traditionally, you have a leader and a follower in a dance hold. If you're the leader, face the follower and place your right arm on the other person's back on the left side just behind their shoulder. If you're the follower, place your left arm on top of the leader's right arm and grab their upper arm. Then, both of you extend your other arm out to the side and clasp hands.

[6] X Expert Source William Orrock Professional Dancer & Instructor Expert Interview. 5 July 2022. The reason you have a leader when you're dancing is so that you don't trip all over each other. To guide your partner as the leader, apply light pressure with both hands, moving your partner the direction you want to go. [7] X Research source For instance, if you want to start turning to the right, pull a little with your right hand on their shoulder while you push a little with your left hand that's clasped in theirs. If you're the follower, make sure you are relaxed, engage with your partner, and make sure you're paying attention to your partner's cues and moving with them.

To do so, step back a little and lift the other person's arm above their head. Then they can turn around under it while still holding on. [9] X Research source Don't get too crazy with your twirls. You don't want to take another couple out!"

Bring your left foot over and tap it next to your right foot on the upbeat (the light beats between the louder beats). Then go in the opposite direction. Step out with your left foot and tap with the right foot next to your left. [10] X Research source You can do this basic move by yourself on a fast song or with a partner on a fast or slow song. When dancing with a partner, get into the traditional dance hold. Both of you can step-touch at the same time, but you'll be stepping out with the opposite foot. So if you're the leader, you'll step out with your right foot first while your partner steps out with their left."

So if you want to turn to your right, step to the right and to the back a little. When you step with your left foot, step forward and to the right a bit instead of out to the left. With each step, you're moving to the right, which will eventually turn you toward that direction. [11] X Research source Always guide your partner when moving if you're the leader. As the follower, always pay attention to your partner's guidance!"

As the leader, step forward with your left foot and then step forward with your right foot on the beats; if you're the follower, step backward with your right foot and then backward with your left foot. Then, if you're the leader, you'll step to the left with your left foot and \"close\" the step by bringing in your right foot; the follower will do the opposite, stepping out with the right foot and bringing in the left foot to close. [12] X Expert Source Andrey Stanev Professional Dance Instructor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. These movements are considered \"slow-slow-quick-quick,\" meaning the forward/backward movement is done more slowly and the step out/close is done more quickly. [13] X Expert Source Andrey Stanev Professional Dance Instructor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Keep your back straight but bend your knees a little with this movement. If you're the leader, make sure you're gently guiding your partner around the room with hand pressure on the shoulder and through your clasped hands."

Bend your knees and dip your body slightly when you hear the \"boom\" part of the beat. Bounce back up when you hear the \"clap\" or the second part of the beat (known as the upbeat). So basically, you're just bouncing your body up and down by bending your knees. [14] X Research source To make this move look less stiff, move your upper body, too. Twist your upper body back and forth a bit on the beat or sway back and forth. Bring your arms up and snap along as you turn to the beat. Alternatively, just bend your arms at the elbows and swing them to the left and right as you turn your body."

However, when you step out with your left foot, go to the left but go back a step at the same time, so you're making a diagonal move. Bring your right foot back to meet your left and tap, then step out with your right foot to the right side. After tapping with your left foot, move it forward and to the left at the same time, making a diagonal movement. Bring your right foot up to meet it. [16] X Research source When you step out with your right, you're making the top of the box. Then when you move with your left, you go diagonally across the box. The right step at the back makes the bottom of the box, and then you move diagonally across it again. Start over again once you get back to your first position! This adds some fun movement without getting too crazy."

Pivot your feet slightly to the left by putting your weight on your heels and moving your toes around. Step back with your left foot and bring your right foot back to tap. Keep moving back this way for a few steps. To move forward, do the opposite, stepping forward instead of backward. [17] X Research source This is similar to the box move. However, instead of returning to the starting position, you keep moving backward or forward. Try swinging your hips out to the side as you step backward or forward."

[22] X Research source Keep the movement at the level you're comfortable with. If you don't want to hop or kick very high, that's fine! Also, don't worry about making a mistake. You're definitely not that only one."
