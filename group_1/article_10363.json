      "content": "Spray over the vents with a layer of spray paint. Follow the instructions provided on your spray can and shake your paint can thoroughly. Keep the can at least 6 in (15 cm) or so away from the surface of the vent so the spray paint doesn’t drip and create lumps on the surface. To coat the vent evenly, work in a slow, horizontal motion across the surface of the vent. [5] X Research source Be sure to paint over the screws as well."
