      "content": "Think about your brand identity. A logo should not be treated as a simple afterthought. The logo you design is going to be used to identify your brand or organization for years to come. A logo is worth putting time and energy into designing. Before you start designing a logo, take some time to think about your brand identity. If you are designing a logo for someone else, study the brand or have an interview with the brand owner. Here are some questions you should ask before designing a logo: What is the philosophy behind your brand? What makes you different from the competition? Are there any symbols or images that are representative of your brand? Are there any colors or color combinations that fit your brand identity?"

      "title": "Draw lots of rough ideas.",
      "content": "Draw lots of rough ideas. Once you have an idea of your brand identity, start sketching your ideas. You can do this on paper, or in Illustrator. Avoid adding color at this stage. Don't go with the first idea that pops into your head. Professional graphic designers will often draw hundreds of rough ideas. If you just want to create a vector version of an existing logo, you can trace over an existing raster image of a logo using Illustrator's Live Trace feature or manually using the Illustrator tools."

If you are designing for someone else, show it to the client and see if they have anything they want to change or add."

Click this icon and then click and drag the edges of the white artboard in the center of the screen to adjust the size of the artboard. Most logos are designed on a vertical rectangle-shaped artboard or an even square-shaped artboard. A rectangle-shaped logo will look good on banners, signs, and a social media cover page, but a square-shaped logo will fit into more platforms, such as the corner of a business card or social media profile icons."

A sans-serif font such as Helvetica can add a more modern look to a font. Avoid using overly decorative fonts that are difficult to read. Also, avoid mixing fonts in your logo design. If you download free fonts online, be aware of the licensing agreement for those fonts. Many free fonts are free to use for personal use but are not authorized for commercial use."

Designing a simple black-and-white logo to start with will ensure that your logo looks good in its simplest form. You can also use the Text on a Path Tool to add text in a circle or curvy shape."

You can also use the selection tool (the icon that resembles a black mouse cursor in the toolbar to the left) to change the size of your font by clicking and dragging the corners of your text object. Hold Shift to keep the text size proportional while resizing it with the selection tool. Leading: Leading changes the space between lines of text. Use the drop-down menu next to the icon that resembles an \"A\" on top of another \"A\" to change the leading. Kerning: Kerning adjusts the space between specific characters. To adjust the kerning, highlight the characters you want to adjust and then use the drop-down menu next to the icon with an \"A\" and a \"V\" being pushed together in the character menu to adjust the kerning. Tracking: Tracking adjusts the space between all characters in the text. Use the drop-down menu next to the icon that resembles an \"A\" and a \"V\" being pushed apart in the Character menu to adjust the tracking. Horizontal Scale: Horizontal stretches the characters horizontally making them wider or thinner. Use the drop-down menu next to the icon that resembles a \"T\" being stretched horizontally in the Character menu to adjust the horizontal scale of the text.
