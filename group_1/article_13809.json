      "content": "Start with dry hair. Wash and dry your hair as you normally would. If you have long hair or can feel any tangles then give it a quick brush. A mixed bristle brush works well—the nylon bristles will get bumps out while the boar bristles will smooth the surface of your hair for a shinier finish. [1] X Research source If you have short hair and need some extra volume or texture, add a small amount of dry shampoo. If you have curly locks, don't brush your curls or you may create frizz."

      "content": "Divide the ponytail into two sections. Twist the sections around themselves until you have one long twisted strand. [2] X Research source It doesn’t matter if you twist clockwise or anti-clockwise, just do whatever feels comfortable."

      "content": "Wrap the twisted hair into a bun. Form a bun by wrapping the twisted hair around your hair tie and tucking it into the base of your ponytail. Secure the bun in place with bobby pins if you need. Insert the bobby pins by placing the opening towards your scalp, pushing down and sliding into the knot. [3] X Research source You can also add ribbons, colorful clips, or flowers for decoration."

      "title": "Finish it off with some hairspray.",
      "content": "Finish it off with some hairspray. Whether your low bun is messy or sleek and sophisticated, always finish your look off with a spritz of hairspray to tame any flyaways. [4] X Research source For a softer look, you can leave some flyaway strands free, dangling out of the bun or around your face. Use a hand-held mirror to check your bun is balanced and that you have achieved the look you were going for."

      "title": "Tie your hair into a ponytail.",
      "content": "Tie your hair into a ponytail. Unless you have curls, brush your hair until it's smooth, then gather it up into a ponytail at the base of your neck. You can either secure the ponytail loosely with a hair tie or just hold it in your hands while you get ready to braid."

      "content": "Braid your ponytail. Divide the ponytail into three strands. Cross the right strand over the centre strand. Move the centre strand over so it is now the right strand. Cross the left strand over the centre strand and move the centre strand over so it becomes the left strand. Repeat this pattern until you have braided the ponytail from the hair tie down to the tips. Finally, secure the bottom with another hair tie. [5] X Research source You can attempt a French braided low bun if you're feeling adventurous. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Tie your hair up in a loose ponytail. A low messy bun can look fun and casual, and can also help to create a more voluminous look—particularly if your hair is short. Start by pulling your hair up loosely into a low pony tail and tugging at the roots to get a messy look. Add texture spray or back comb your hair a little to add extra volume if you need to. Don’t use a comb or worry about your strands being perfectly slicked back—some bumps are ok; in fact, they'll add to the messy look. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave loose pieces of hair free. To really nail the messy look, you can leave a few sections of hair out of the ponytail and pull these back individually, securing them with bobby pins. Remember to leave a few loose strands out and style them around your face, and you're done! One of the best things about messy buns is they work well on dirty hair, but you can still pull off the look with clean hair too—just work in a little bit of dry shampoo to add some texture and grip.
