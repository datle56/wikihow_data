      "content": "“Down low” may refer to a closeted gay person. More specifically, it refers to a gay man who maintains that he is straight in public settings, but who hooks up with other gay men in private. The term is primarily used in Black LGBT communities and on LGBT dating apps, like Grindr. “Can you keep a secret? I’m not super into girls. I’m sorta DL.” A person might be DL for a number of reasons, most commonly to dodge negative social consequences of being outed as LGBT. [2] X Research source This is usually the intended meaning when referring to a particular person, like when TikTok users say, “How to tell if someone is DL.”"

      "content": "“DL” emerged in Black LGBT circles in the 90s. It’s hard to pinpoint when exactly the term originated, but it was likely coined in the mid-90s. [3] X Research source Contrary to similar terms like “closeted,” “down low” described an active subculture of specifically Black men who identified with the term and found that it described their particular circumstances and the risks involved in being both Black and gay. [4] X Research source The concept of “down low” lifestyles was notably explored by the author E. L. Harris in the early 90s. Harris often wrote of the “double lives” of Black LGBT men. [5] X Research source Some think you can identify a DL person by their appearance or behavior, but this is a misconception."

King was then invited to speak on The Oprah Winfrey Show about his experience, which introduced thousands of viewers to the term, boosting its usage. [6] X Research source In 2005, the author Keith Boykin wrote the book Beyond the Down Low , in which he takes issue with and attempts to rectify parts of King’s book which Boykin found misrepresentative or distasteful. [7] X Research source Specifically, Boykin took issue with claims that DL men are responsible for increased rates of HIV and AIDS, which isn’t supported by research or evidence."
