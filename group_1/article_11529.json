      "content": "Pierce each egg with the pin at the bottom of the measuring cup. Your Dash Rapid Egg Cooker should come with a measuring cup to help determine the correct amount of water to use. This cup will have a sharp pin poking out of the bottom. Use this pin to poke a small hole in the larger end of each of your eggs. [1] X Research source Why is this necessary? There’s a small air pocket in the wider end of each egg. When you pierce your egg, this air gets released, which prevents it from cracking during the cooking process, makes it easier to peel, and gives it a more uniform shape."
