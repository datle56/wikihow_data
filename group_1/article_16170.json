      "title": "Match the size of your replacement and existing wire.",
      "content": "Match the size of your replacement and existing wire. For the best sound results, use stranded (not solid) speaker wire that's the same gauge (AWG) as your existing wire. Some wires will have the gauge printed down the side of the wire. If yours doesn't, place the wire in the holes of your wire cutter until you find the hole it fits in most closely. The number that's printed beside that hole is the wire gauge. [2] X Research source You can also cut a small piece of the wire and take it with you to a store that sells audio supplies so they can tell you. Speaker wire ranges from 10AWG (which is very thick) to 20AWG (which is very thin). 18 gauge (AWG) is the most popular size, and it's usually used for distances of up to 25 ft (7.6 m). 16 gauge is also common, especially for distances up to 50 ft (15 m). [3] X Research source You can splice 2 differently-sized wires together, as long as they're close in gauge (like 18AWG and 16AWG). If the extension of the wire is beyond 100 feet, consider replacing the wire with a thicker size."

      "title": "Measure and cut your extra speaker wire.",
      "content": "Measure and cut your extra speaker wire. Use a tape measure to find how much extra length you need on your wire. However, add at least 1–2 ft (0.30–0.61 m) to that measurement. You'll need a little extra slack in the wire, since too much tension could damage the connection on your speakers or amp or cause the wire to pull free. Then, use wire cutters to cut the extra speaker wire to that length. [4] X Research source Many wire strippers also act as wire cutters, so you may not need two separate tools for this. Consider off-setting the cuts on the negative and positive wire instead of cutting them straight across. For instance, you might make the positive end of the existing wire 2 in (5.1 cm) longer than the negative. Then, on the extension wire, you'd cut the positive side 2 in (5.1 cm) shorter than the negative. This off-set will make the finished wire less bulky, and there's no chance the positive and negatives will touch. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Strip the ends",
      "content": "Strip the ends of both pieces of wire. Your speaker wire should look like 2 small tubes attached together. Carefully pull these apart, so the wire forms a Y shape. Then, clamp a wire stripper about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) from the end of the wire—squeeze just firmly enough to hold the wire in place, but not so tightly that you damage the wire beneath. Pull the wire firmly with your free hand. The insulation should slide off, exposing the bare wire without damaging it. [6] X Research source Do this for both the positive and negative sides on the extension wire. If the bare wires are already exposed on your existing speaker cord, you may not need to strip them again. If the wires look frayed, though, it's a good idea to cut them shorter and strip them so you have a fresh piece of wire to work with. Cut the wire as close to the frayed pieces as possible."

Use your fingers to gently spread apart the strands that make up the wire to increase the contact between the two wires. Interlace the two bare pieces of wire through each other at the base so they make a V shape, then twist them together in a clockwise motion until they're connected tightly. [7] X Research source If there's any identifying feature on one side of the wire—like if one side is black and the other is colored, or if one side is striped, printed, stamped, or molded—that's the positive side. Also, if one side of the wire is silver and the other is gold, the gold side is positive. [8] X Research source"

Keep wrapping the tape over itself in a spiral until you've completely covered all of the bare wire. [10] X Research source Then, repeat that on the negative side of the wires. Do not leave any bare wire showing at all. If the positive and negative sides of the wire touch, your speaker could short out and be permanently damaged. You'll also risk being shocked if you touch the bare wire while the speaker is on. [11] X Research source Give each set of wires a light tug to make sure they're secure after you tape them.

      "content": "Go around the whole wire with more tape. Although all of the bare wire is now covered, you still have two separate pieces of wire that are split in the middle. This could potentially create a weak spot in the wire, so press the two sides together and wrap the whole thing in more electrical tape to create a secure single wire. Although this will help stabilize the wire, the connection could still loosen over time, especially if you move the wire or put a lot of pressure on it. Eventually, that could cause a short that could damage your stereo equipment. [13] X Research source"

Then, insert the positive end of the extension wire into the other end of the connector. Put the negative ends of the wires into a second connector in the same way. [16] X Research source Double-check that there isn't any bare wire showing on either side. If there is, pull that end of the wire out of the connector and cut the bare wire a little shorter. Make sure you choose the right crimp connector for your type of wire. They're usually color-coded—yellow for 10-12 AWG, blue for 14-16 AWG, and red for 18-22 AWG. You might see crimp connectors called butt connectors or butt splices—these terms all refer to the same thing!"

Place one end of the crimp connector into one of these channels, then press down hard on the tool to crimp the connector onto the wire. Do the same on the other side of the connector. Crimping the connector will lock it onto the wire, creating a permanent splice. Don't use pliers or any other tool to crimp the wire—it won't hold the connector securely in place.

Don't use the tape to stabilize poorly-secured connectors, though."

The positive side of the wire will be printed or stamped, or it may be red (the negative side will be black) or gold (the negative side will be silver). Lay the bare ends of each positive wire over each other to form an X. Then, rotate one side of the wire toward you and the other side away from you to twist the two wires together. [19] X Research source Keep twisting until the wires are connected firmly together. Tuck the ends of the wire in neatly—if they're sticking up, they could pierce through the electrical tape you use at the end."

Solder uses high heat, so it's important not to place the wires directly on a surface that could be damaged, like a wooden table. Try using a helping hands device to lift the wires—it's a small device with two metal clips that will hold the wire in place. [20] X Research source If you don't have a helping hands device, you can improvise by clamping the wire between two alligator clips, then standing the clips on end. This won't be super-secure, though, so try not to bump the clips or the wire while you're working. You could also work on a heat-safe surface, like a metal or concrete workbench."

Then, melt solder over this side as well, until the bare speaker wire is completely covered. [22] X Research source If you have enough room to maneuver beneath the wire, you could just hold the soldering iron and solder under the wire and melt it that way, rather than flipping the wire over. Once you've soldered the wire, let it cool for 5-10 minutes before you handle it. Repeat the whole process to connect the negative sides of the speaker wire."

Even though there's solder coating the wire, it still needs to be insulated—the solder is conductive, so if the positive and negative sides touch, the wire will short out. Wrap the whole splice in electrical tape, going from one end of the insulation to the other. Do this for both the positive and negative sides of the wire. To create a cleaner look, you can then pinch the positive and negative sides together, then wrap the whole thing in electrical tape as well. [23] X Research source You can also use heat shrink tubing to insulate the wires. Put the tubing on the wire before you splice the ends together, but keep it away from the heat of the soldering iron. Once the solder is cool, slide the tubing over the splice and use a heat gun or hair dryer to shrink it around the bare wire. [24] X Research source"
