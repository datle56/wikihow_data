    {
      "title": "Contact the admissions office.",
      "content": "Contact the admissions office. As soon as possible after you decide you no longer want to go to a school, you should talk to someone in admissions directly. The sooner you contact them, the more options you'll have. [1] X Research source Some university systems, such as those in the U.K. and Canada, allow a seven-day period during which you can decline admission to a college after accepting with no negative consequences. Check to see if there is such a deadline where you live. Typically it's best to call since admissions staff will be swamped with emails. You may want to follow up with a written letter discussing the phone call so there's a record. If there's someone specific you've been talking to about your admission already, try to get in touch with them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say what you want to happen.",
      "content": "Say what you want to happen. While you probably want to sound as professional and sophisticated, using academic lingo (such as \"reject\" or \"withdraw\") can be tricky. Use plain language when you speak to admissions, since those words may have specific meanings of which you're not aware. [2] X Research source For example, if you've decided you want to go to another school that gave you a better offer, or for another reason, simply say so. If you've decided you want to take a gap year, you may not have to decline admission. You can simply defer or postpone it. Again, rather than using those specific words, which may have a specific meaning for that school, simply say \"I want to start next fall instead of this fall.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain why you've changed your mind.",
      "content": "Explain why you've changed your mind. Give admissions staff a reason why you're declining admission to the school after you've already accepted, and be honest about that reason. Admissions staff will be more willing to work with you if you're straightforward with them. [3] X Research source In some cases, being honest about your reasons may open up other options for you. For example, admissions staff typically will be more willing to work with you if you have to decline admission for a reason outside your control, such as a serious illness or an ongoing family crisis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank admissions staff for their help.",
      "content": "Thank admissions staff for their help. Even if you don't get the answer you wanted, you want to be careful not to burn any bridges – especially if you think you might want to go to that school in the future. If you take an attitude or are rude, word of your behavior may spread. For example, suppose you're declining admission to Good University so that you can go to Best College. If you're rude to GU admissions staff, they may call the admissions office at BC and tell them about it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Forfeit your deposit.",
      "content": "Forfeit your deposit. Many colleges and universities in the United States and elsewhere require you to put down a deposit towards your first semester's tuition. If you decline admission to the school, that money may not be returned. [4] X Research source Check your admissions paperwork to see if the deposit is non-refundable. Even if it is, if you have a serious reason for declining admission, such as a medical crisis, you may qualify for an exception. If at all possible, you want to let them know that you've changed your mind about going there before you put down money for a deposit. That way you won't risk losing that money."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find out if the college supports a gap year.",
      "content": "Find out if the college supports a gap year. Gap years are a common tradition in the U.K. and some other countries, but have only caught on in the U.S. recently. If a college supports a gap year, they will defer your admission until the following fall. [5] X Research source A gap year allows you to postpone your higher education for a year while you travel, work for a nonprofit, or do other types of educational or exploratory activities. When you return, you won't have to reapply to the school. For schools that don't support or recognize a gap year, there may be other options available to you, or you may be able to postpone your admission a semester."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get started as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Get started as soon as possible. If you've decided you want to take a year off, you typically need to let the college know you want a deferral as soon as possible. Otherwise, the college may be less inclined to grant your deferral. [6] X Research source At the latest, you shouldn't wait until after your first tuition payment is due to ask admissions for a deferral. At that stage, it may be all but impossible for your admission to be deferred."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline your plans for your gap year.",
      "content": "Outline your plans for your gap year. You're not taking a gap year so you can lay around in your pajamas all year watching TV. A school will be more accepting of your decision to take a gap year if you have educational activities or opportunities lined up. [7] X Research source Some schools require a full, written proposal. Check with the school to find out what their requirements are and any due dates you need to be aware of."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send a written letter to the director of admissions.",
      "content": "Send a written letter to the director of admissions. Unlike if you're declining admission entirely, if you want to postpone your admission, make this request in writing. The director of admissions will be able to discuss the possibility of taking a gap year with you. [8] X Research source Use a business letter format – there should be a template on your word-processing app – and proofread carefully. Make a copy of your letter after you sign it, for your own records. If the school has any particular forms or information that you are supposed to provide, include that with your letter. If you don't hear anything within a reasonable amount of time, follow up with a phone call. Typically two to four weeks is a reasonable time, depending on how far away the school is. Allow longer for a response if the school is in another country."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow up with financial aid.",
      "content": "Follow up with financial aid. The school may contact any sources of financial aid you had, or that may be your responsibility. Make a quick call regardless to ensure they don't send any money to the school during your gap year. [9] X Research source It's also wise to follow up with both your financial aid sources and the school just before the school year starts to make sure nothing was sent for your tuition."
