      "title": "Sanding",
      "content": "Sanding Sanding requires a bit of manual labor, but it often removes a great deal of rust. First, apply a degreaser to clean your tool and wipe off any dirt and debris with a tack cloth . Let the tool dry, then scrub off as much rust as possible with steel wool or a stiff wire brush. Next, use a coarse-grit sandpaper on thick patches of rust, then switch to fine-grit for any remaining layers. Rinse and dry the tool completely when you’re done. [1] X Research source Depending on how rusty your tool is, sanding it may not remove all the corrosion. In this case, try one of the other methods listed below to finish the job."

      "title": "Vinegar and salt",
      "content": "Vinegar and salt After degreasing and cleaning your tool, place it in a container large enough to fit the entire metal part. Using 1/4 cup (31 g) of salt per liter (4.2 cups) of white vinegar, pour enough vinegar into the container to completely cover the metal part of the tool, then sprinkle the salt on top. Depending on how rusty the tool is, allow it to soak for 1-3 days, checking periodically to see if the rust has softened. Once it has, use a metal brush or steel wool to scrub the surface. Then, wash the tool with soap and water and allow it to dry. [2] X Research source Vinegar can also cause tools to rust if it isn’t cleaned off properly, so make sure to rinse your tools really well afterward. This method works well for large areas of rust, as well as hard-to-reach areas."

      "title": "Vinegar and water",
      "content": "Vinegar and water If your tools aren’t super rusty but could still use a vinegar bath, plant specialist Jon Rowland says, “Soak the rusted tools in [a mixture of] 50% vinegar, 50% water overnight or [for] at least 10 hours.” Check periodically to see if the rust has softened, and when it has, scrub it off with a brush. Once you’ve removed all the rust, clean the tools with soap and water, then hang them up so they can dry properly."

      "title": "Baking soda paste",
      "content": "Baking soda paste If your tool only has rust stains or small areas of rust, a baking soda paste may do the job. After degreasing and cleaning your tool, pour some baking soda into a bowl and add enough water to form a paste. Apply the paste to the rusted area and let it sit for a few hours. Then, use a brush to scrub off the paste and the rust. Rinse the tool with clean water and allow it to dry. [3] X Research source Usually, a 1:1 ratio of baking soda to water does the trick."

      "title": "Hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar",
      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar Hydrogen peroxide is a mild acid that can dissolve rust, especially when combined with other ingredients, like cream of tartar. Mix equal parts of hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar to form a thick paste. Apply the paste to the rusted area and let it sit for 30 minutes to a few hours. Then, buff the area with a damp sponge to remove the rust. Wash the tool with soap and water, then allow it to dry completely. [4] X Research source Because hydrogen peroxide is an acid, it can damage metal if it’s left on the surface too long. Clean your tools thoroughly after removing the rust to avoid further damage."

      "title": "Salt and lemon juice",
      "content": "Salt and lemon juice If your tool is flat or has only a small amount of rust, squeeze a small amount of lemon juice onto the affected area, sprinkle some salt on top, then add more lemon juice. The citric acid in the juice will react with the rust, while the salt acts as an abrasive. Use a scouring pad or the rind of the lemon to scrub and wipe everything off, then wash the tool thoroughly with soap and water and allow it to dry completely. [5] X Research source This method works best with flat surfaces because it’s harder to get into tight spaces than other methods. Make sure to remove all the lemon juice and salt. If it remains, it may react with the unaffected metal and cause damage."

      "content": "WD-40 While standard WD-40 is a lubricant, it can also sometimes help loosen rust bonds and make it easier to remove. Spray WD-40 on the affected surface and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Then, scrub it off with something abrasive, like steel wool. The WD-40 will also provide temporary protection against corrosion, preventing further rust. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Ketchup",
      "content": "Ketchup It may sound odd, but ketchup can sometimes remove small areas of rust due to its acidity from its high vinegar and tomato content. Apply ketchup liberally to the rusted area and let it sit for a few hours. Then, scrub the ketchup and rust off with a wire brush. Rinse the tool well with soap and water and allow it to dry completely before storing it. [7] X Research source While this is a natural rust-removing option, keep in mind that ketchup may attract insects and animals. If you’re doing this outside, cover the area to deter pests. Because ketchup has a thicker consistency than vinegar, it’s a good option for objects that would be difficult or impossible to submerge in a vinegar bath."

      "title": "Rust forms when iron reacts with oxygen and water.",
      "content": "Rust forms when iron reacts with oxygen and water. Iron (or steel) is highly susceptible to oxidation, meaning it easily reacts with oxygen. When water or moisture is introduced, it and the oxygen bond to the metal, causing oxidation. This leads to the formation of iron oxide, better known as rust. Tools often rust due to continued exposure to humidity or water vapor, which is why it’s important to keep them clean and dry. [9] X Research source Stainless steel and other metals do not rust, but they can corrode ."

Humidity can cause your tools to rust, so avoid storing them in areas like your basement or garage, if possible. If you can’t find a storage location with low humidity, set up a dehumidifier instead. [14] X Research source If you don’t store your tools in a toolbox, hang them up when you’re done using them. This keeps them off the wet ground and allows them to dry completely. If you keep your tools in a toolbox, keep the box moisture-free with silica gel packs ."

      "content": "How do I get rust off of large tools? If you have large rusty tools, like a shovel or hedge clippers, see if you can submerge them in a large container, like a 5-gallon bucket. Then, proceed to clean them with vinegar as you would smaller tools. If that isn’t an option, spray vinegar directly on the tool, then soak a towel in vinegar and wrap it tightly around the rusted part. [15] X Research source Place the tool in a plastic bag, tie it loosely, and let it sit for 24 hours. This should dissolve the rust so you can scrub it away with a scouring pad. After you’ve removed the rust, hose down the tool to remove any remaining flakes and dry it thoroughly."
