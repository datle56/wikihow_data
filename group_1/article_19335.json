      "content": "Pull out small patches of bindweed. If the bindweed is growing around the borders of your garden or in small groupings, you can pull it out. Use a pitchfork to gently turn over the dirt or soil underneath the plant so you can pull out the roots, which can grow to 10 ft (3.0 m) deep. It’s important that you remove the roots to discourage new shoots from growing. Dispose of both the roots and the plant immediately in the trash. [1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source If you can’t dig out the roots because of other plants nearby, use a hoe to cut off the bindweed at ground level. Repeat the process as new growth appears. It's best to dispose of it in the trash. If you compost the bindweed, it could spread to your compost bin."

      "content": "Wrap the bindweed around bamboo canes to isolate it. At the beginning of the growing season, stake bamboo canes around your yard. Then, twine the bindweed so that it grows around the bamboo canes rather than climbing up your walls or spreading across your garden. This will allow you to spray weedkiller on the bindweed without harming your other plants. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply weedkiller to isolated patches. If the bindweed is well away from other plants, or has wound its way around the bamboo canes, the best way to get rid of it is to use glyphosate weedkiller, like Roundup. Liberally spray the plants, especially where the roots come up from the ground, then allow the weedkiller to soak into the root system. Use 2 or 3 applications in a single growing season to ensure the bindweed will be destroyed. [3] X Research source Please note: The WHO considers glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen. Its use is prohibited in some states and countries. Please check with your local laws and use caution if handling this chemical. Glyphosate weedkiller will destroy other plants, like flowers and vegetables, so be sure to spray it only on the bindweed. Glyphosate weedkiller can be found at garden centers and superstores and also comes in a gel that you can paint on individual leaves."

      "content": "Let the plants die to ground level before pulling them out. If you’ve treated the bindweed with glyphosate or another weedkiller, wait about 3 weeks before removing the plants. This gives the chemicals a chance to penetrate the roots and allows the bindweed to die down to ground level, making it easier to remove. Don’t forget to dig up the roots as well.

You can treat soil where you’ve removed bindweed already as well as soil beneath existing plants. Repeat the application every 3 to 4 months to ensure the bindweed doesn’t grow back.

      "content": "Put down a heavy layer of mulch to discourage new growth. Even though you may have removed all the visible bindweed, any leftover seeds or roots can begin another infestation. Lay down several inches of bark, wood chips, or another heavy mulch to prevent sunlight from reaching the remnants of bindweed."

      "content": "Pull bindweed weekly. The best way to keep bindweed from getting out of control is to pull it out as soon as you see it. Young shoots are much easier to get rid of than established vines. Take time each week to scour your garden for bindweed. Carefully dig out the roots and the plant from the soil and dispose of them.

      "content": "Ensure your soil is healthy. Bindweed flourishes when the soil is out of balance, has pH issues, and/or has high levels of magnesium and potassium. Add humus materials (like decayed plant matter), calcium, and phosphorous to your soil to amend it. Adjust the soil pH so that it fits into the recommended range based on the vegetation you are growing. [8] X Research source"
