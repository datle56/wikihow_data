      "content": "A disconnected undercut has short sides and a long top with a distinct separation. The “undercut” part of this haircut technique refers to the difference in length between the top and sides—if the hair is worn straight down, it hangs over the shorter section, so the shorter section is cut “under” the longer. The “disconnected” part refers to the sharp line between the top and the sides—the longer and shorter sections don’t fade or taper into each other. [1] X Research source In a disconnected undercut, the top of the hair can be styled in a variety of different ways. Some of the most popular undercut styles include the textured crop , slicked back, pompadour , and side part . The disconnected undercut is classic and modern at the same time. It’s been around since at least the 1920s, but it remains a popular choice today. For a more modern look, choose a high transition point and pair the undercut with a bold, edgy style like a slick back or quiff ."

      "content": "Describe the disconnected undercut you're looking for in detail. The disconnected undercut is a fairly standard cutting technique, so your barber or stylist is probably going to know what you mean when you ask for it. But be prepared to go into more detail to make sure you're getting the cut you want—like how long you want the sides to be, exactly where you want the disconnect to land, how long you want the top, and how you plan to style your hair. Choose a disconnect that lands right at the roundest part of your head for a natural look. If you want an edgier look, choose a disconnect that’s just above or just below the roundest part of your head. If you have long hair and want a subtle undercut, choose a disconnect closer to the nape of your neck or just above your ears. If you’d like, you can ask your stylist to blend the top and bottom sections in the back near the crown of your head—this will help make your hair a little easier to style. But there shouldn’t be any blending on the sides. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Textured crop with disconnected undercut The textured crop—or French crop—is a slightly shorter variation on the disconnected undercut. In this edgy style, the hair on top is usually worn brushed forward and to the side, and the sides and back are kept very short. [3] X Research source Where have you seen it? This classic style was given new life by Cillian Murphy’s character Thomas Shelby in the show Peaky Blinders . How to style: Add texture with sea salt spray or texturizing powder , and brush the hair forward, to the side, or up and back."

      "content": "Slick-back with disconnected undercut If you want a bold, edgy look, wear your disconnected undercut combed straight back. Wear it sleek and shiny for a more classic throw-back look, or wear it combed back and a little messy for a more modern take. [4] X Research source Where have you seen it? If you’re a fan of Peaky Blinders , you’ll recognize this as the look Arthur Shelby wore. You might also recognize it as the haircut worn by Brad Pitt in Fury or by Ruby Rose in Orange Is the New Black . How to style: Use a gloss pomade for a high-shine finish, or go with matte clay or pomade for a less shiny, more natural texture."

      "content": "Pompadour/Quiff with disconnected undercut For a more modern take on the slick back undercut, wear your hair styled up and back in a quiff or pompadour. The pompadour is a neater version of the style, combed into a more meticulous shape, while a quiff is styled in more of a casual, windswept look. Where have you seen it? In recent years, the pompadour or quiff undercut has been worn by icons like David Beckham and Harry Styles. How to style: Work a little pomade , styling cream , or clay into your hair while it’s still damp. Then, use a round brush to pull your hair up and back as you blow dry it."

It’s flattering and versatile—you can get a more retro look by styling it sleek and close to your head, or a more modern look by adding more volume and texture. As a bonus, this is a great style if your hair is thinning or receding. [5] X Research source Where have you seen it? David Beckham sometimes wears his signature quiff combed over to the side. How to style: Work in a strong hold product like styling glue , then use a comb to create your part before combing your hair down, to the side, and back."

      "title": "Long hair with disconnected undercut",
      "content": "Long hair with disconnected undercut A disconnected undercut is a great way to lighten up long hair. The disconnect is usually placed a little lower—over the ears or just above the back of the neck—for a more subtle look that you barely notice when your hair is down. For a more noticeable effect, opt to have the disconnect placed higher. Where have you seen it? Kurt Cobain is probably the icon most well-known for wearing a long undercut. A slightly shorter variation of the style worn parted down the middle—the curtain undercut—was sported by ’90s heartthrobs like Devon Sawa, Leonardo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp, and Jared Leto. How to style: Add a little texturizing powder if you want a piecey look to your hair—otherwise, just whatever you normally do to maintain your long hair is fine."

This is a cute, fun style that’s a little bold and edgy, but still versatile. The hair on the top and sides is cut into a classic pixie , with a disconnected undercut just above the nape of the neck. [6] X Research source Where have you seen it? This carefree look has been worn by Rihanna, Pink, Katy Perry, Issa Rae, and Scarlett Johansson. How to style: To style your pixie cut , add a little mousse , volumizing spray , or texturizing powder for lift at the roots. You can also add light-hold gel or sculpting cream if you want a sleeker look."

      "content": "Use a comb to make a straight part where you want the cut to start. If you’re planning to cut an undercut yourself , decide where you want the disconnect to be. Then, use the tip of a comb to section your hair in a horseshoe shape all the way around to the crown of your head. [7] X Research source Take your time to make sure the line is very straight and symmetrical on both sides. This is one of the most important steps in getting a neat, clean undercut, especially if it’s disconnected. [8] X Research source Each time you trim your undercut , be sure to use the exact same part. Otherwise, the undercut section will “creep” higher, and the section on top will get narrower with each cut. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Shave the sides and back up to the part line with a 1–3 guard. Working slowly and carefully, glide the clippers over your hair in the opposite direction your hair grows—usually, from the bottom of your hair up toward the part line. Focus on one section at a time so you don’t miss any parts. Choose a 1 guard for hair that’s about 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) long, a 2 guard for hair that’s about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) long, and a 3 guard for hair that’s about 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) long. If you go longer than a 3, the hair on the back and sides will be too long to give you the sharp difference needed for an undercut."

Distribute your preferred product evenly through your hair, then style your hair with your fingers or a comb. [13] X Research source Pomade: Use a gloss pomade if you want a shinier finish, or a matte pomade or clay if you’d prefer a more natural look. [14] X Research source Styling cream: Styling cream , lightweight gels , and mousse can be a good option for thinner hair that only needs a little hold or you want to add volume. Styling glue: Use a thick styling glue if you need a lot of hold, like if your hair is thick or coarse. Sea salt spray: If you want a messier, more natural look, spritz some sea salt spray through your hair while it’s damp, and either blow dry it or let it air dry."

Because the back and sides are worn shorter in a disconnected undercut, you’ll need to stop in for a touch-up every 3–6 weeks or so. Otherwise, the shorter sections will grow out to give you a shaggy look, and the difference between the top and sides will be less obvious. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Disconnected undercuts work great on square, round, or oval faces. These face shapes tend to be wider across the cheekbones, and the added height of a disconnected undercut can help draw the eye upward, making the face look longer and more balanced. That said, the disconnected undercut is a technique that can be paired with a variety of different hairstyles and face shapes. [16] X Research source If you have a longer, more narrow face, consider a longer undercut—like the curtain-style undercut that was popular in the ’90s."
