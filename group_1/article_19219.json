      "content": "Put paper towels between the stain and the other side of the fabric and a small amount of alcohol. Before using any alcohol-based products on the stain, place a few paper towels or an old towel underneath the stain to keep the stain from bleeding through as you clean. [1] X Research source That way, if the dye from the marker starts to spread, it will bleed onto the paper towels or old towel rather than the other side of the fabric. If the paper towels underneath the stain start to get too soaked at any point, replace them with clean ones to make sure the dye doesn't transfer to another part of the fabric."

      "title": "Use rubbing alcohol to break down and remove the marker stain.",
      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol to break down and remove the marker stain. Dip a clean sponge in rubbing alcohol until it's soaked but not dripping. Dab the alcohol-soaked sponge around the stain first to prevent it from spreading, then dab it directly on the stain. [2] X Research source Continue dabbing the stain with alcohol for about 1 to 5 minutes, dipping the sponge in more alcohol as needed. Make sure that you dab the marker stain with an absorbent towel instead of rubbing, as this can spread the stain or cause it to set deeper into the fabric. Rubbing alcohol can be used on most types of fabrics. Very delicate fabrics such as silk, however, may be damaged by alcohol and should be dry-cleaned instead."

      "title": "Spray on an alcohol-based hairspray for easy application.",
      "content": "Spray on an alcohol-based hairspray for easy application. Hold the hairspray bottle a few inches away from the stain, aiming the sprayer directly on the stain. Then, spray the hairspray onto the stain until it is completely saturated. Allow the hairspray to soak in for about 3 to 5 minutes, then use a clean paper towel to dab away at the stain. Repeat this whole process as needed until the marker ink has lifted. Like rubbing alcohol, alcohol-based hairspray works to break down the chemicals in the permanent marker, making it easier to remove. [3] X Research source Hairspray works particularly well on thicker, tougher fabrics, such as upholstery, carpets, and leather."

      "content": "Try an acetone nail polish remover on sturdy fabrics. Dip a clean sponge or cotton ball in acetone nail polish remover until it's soaked but not dripping. Dab the nail polish remover directly onto the stain, adding more polish remover as needed until the stain has lifted. [4] X Research source Most acetone nail polish removers contain both alcohol and acetone, both of which can help dissolve and remove permanent marker stains from fabrics. Acetone can be tough on delicate fabrics, such as thin cotton or linen. As a result, only use acetone nail polish remover to get rid of permanent marker stains on sturdier fabrics, such as thick cotton towels, carpet, or upholstery."

      "title": "Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to remove marker from clothing.",
      "content": "Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to remove marker from clothing. Squeeze a quarter- or dime-sized dot of hand sanitizer onto the stain, depending on how big the stain is. Gently spread the hand sanitizer over the stain in a circular motion with a clean sponge. Let it settle for about 15 minutes. If the stain is still there, repeat this whole process until the stain is removed. [5] X Research source Because hand sanitizer is made for your skin, it tends to be gentler than other alcohol-based options, making it a good option for more delicate fabrics and clothing.

      "title": "Rinse the fabric with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the fabric with cold water. After using any alcohol-based products on the stain, rinse the fabric with cold water to get the product out of the fabric once the marker stain is gone. Or, if the fabric is machine washable, you can run it through the laundry with your normal detergent after the stain has lifted — make sure to do that separately from other pieces.

      "content": "Mix a white vinegar and dish soap solution for synthetic fabrics. Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar, and 2 cups (470 mL) of cold water in a bowl and stir to combine completely. Then, use a clean sponge to dab the solution onto the stain. Blot the stain for a few seconds with more solution and a clean paper towel every 5 minutes for 30 minutes, letting it rest in between blotting. [8] X Research source Then, pour cold water over the stain to flush the solution. Dab the fabric with a clean paper towel to dry the area. White vinegar and dish soap solution is generally effective at removing permanent marker stains on synthetic fabrics, such as upholstery fabrics and synthetic carpets."

      "content": "Use baking soda for a multi-purpose marker-stain remover. Stir 1 tablespoon (14.4 grams) of baking soda into 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL) of cold water to make a paste. Then, spread the paste evenly over the stain. Gently rub the paste into the stain in a circular motion. Let it sit on the stain for about 15 minutes to an hour, then wash in the washing machine as usual. [9] X Research source Baking soda can be used to remove permanent marker stains from upholstery and carpets, as well as clothing fabrics. You can also try a baking soda toothpaste instead of making your own paste. However, because toothpaste may contain other ingredients that could affect the fabric, make sure that you test it out on a spot that isn't visible first. If your fabric is not machine washable, try sprinkling baking soda on the stain until it is covered. Use a toothbrush to scrub the baking soda into the fabric until the stain starts to lift, then use cold water to flush the baking soda off the fabric. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak your clothing in milk to remove permanent marker stains. Fill a bowl with regular cow's milk. Then, put the entire marker-stained portion of the fabric into the bowl. Make sure that it is completely saturated in the milk. Let the stain soak in the milk for about 15 minutes, then remove it and wash in the washing machine as usual. [11] X Research source Because milk can sour and cause a bad smell, make sure that you are able to machine wash or thoroughly clean the milk from the stained fabric after the stain has lifted."

      "content": "Use a stain remover formulated specifically for ink stains. These products are available widely online, as well as in hardware stores and drugstores. To use these products, make sure that you follow the instructions on the label, as the instructions may vary depending on the specific type of fabric and how long the marker stain has been on the fabric. A few effective ink stain removing products include Amodex Ink Remover and The Laundress Stain Solution."

      "content": "Try an all-purpose fabric stain remover if the stain is fresh. If you are able to apply a stain remover to the permanent marker stain quickly, an all-purpose stain remover might be able to remove the stain before it sets in. Several companies, such as Tide and Shout, make easy-to-use and readily available stain removers that, while not formulated specifically for marker stains, can still be effective if you can start working on the stain quickly. Several companies also make on-the-go stain removing products that allow you to start working on removing the marker stain even if you are away from home."

      "content": "Get rid of the marker stain with bleach if the fabric is white. If you get permanent marker on white fabric, such as white clothing, sheets, or a tablecloth, you can remove the marker stain by washing the fabric with bleach . If the fabric is machine washable and bleach safe, you can add bleach to your laundry and run the washing machine with hot water. If the fabric is bleach safe but not machine washable, you can soak the fabric in bleach for 10 minutes and rinse with cold water to remove the marker stain. Make sure that you always check the tag on the fabric to make sure that it is bleach safe. Otherwise, using bleach may ruin the fabric, even if it is white."
