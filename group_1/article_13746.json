This is a performance, not a contest. When you’re in the figure four leglock, be careful not to apply too much pressure on your opponent’s left foot, ankle, calf, or knee. Use just enough to maintain contact, and no more, to spare them any real pain. Remember: [12] X Research source This is a performance, so just act like you’re straining to keep him trapped, instead of actually trying to. Putting too much pressure down on their leg can cause them serious injury. Everyone’s body is different, which means some people can’t take as much pressure as others. Always practice with your willing partner/opponent before performing this move for others so you know each other’s limits."
