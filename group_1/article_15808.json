      "content": "Ask if you can help with the bill if your date picks it up. When the bill comes to the table, your date may pick it up to look at at, indicating they want to pay. If they do, offering to help pay lets them know they don't have to pick up the whole bill if they don't want to, but it won't offend the chivalrous types that prefer to pay. [1] X Research source You could say, \"Hey, do you want some help with the bill?\" or \"Would you like to split the bill?\""

      "content": "Discuss your sexual history only if you want to have sex. If you're okay with having sex on your first date or even wanting to do so, discussing your sexual history is fine to establish you have been recently tested. It signals to the other person that sex is an option. Otherwise, avoid the topic. [2] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"I've been sexually active within the last few months, but I've been tested since then.\""

      "content": "Suggest a second date in a casual way. If you'd like to see the person again, make it known that you'd like that. However, don't demand a time frame, which can be off-putting. Just bring it up as an option. [3] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I enjoyed our evening a lot. I hope we can do it again sometime.\" Alternatively, you could say, \"Thanks for the evening. Let's do it again soon.\""

      "content": "Offer a hug or kiss at the end. If you enjoyed the date, a little physical affection at the end can go a long way towards showing you want another date. However, always ask first, as some people are not as open to physical contact. [4] X Research source You can say, \"Hey, do you mind if I give you a hug or kiss?\""

Just be casual about it, and don't make the other person feel uncomfortable. [5] X Research source For instance, you might write, \"I really had a good time last night. Let's do it again sometime!\" Alternatively, you might say, \"Thanks for a great evening last night! Hope to see you again soon.\" Avoid going overboard, such as \"I had SOOO MUCH FUNNNN.

You don't have to say \"Let's never do this again.\" However, you can subtly let the person know that you're not that interested. [6] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"I enjoyed tonight. You're easy to talk to.\" That tells the person that you enjoyed their company, but you don't necessarily want to do it again if you leave it there. Alternatively, you might say, \"Thanks for dinner.

If you hug or kiss the person at the end of the date, that typically signals to the other person that you may want another date. A hand wave or sometimes even a handshake is appropriate, as that tends to indicate friendship rather than something more intimate. [7] X Research source If the other person looks like they want to kiss you, make a movement to go or turn away. You don't have to kiss them, and just avoiding the kiss altogether instead of saying something about it lets them save face. If that doesn't work, you can say, \"That's sweet of you, but I'm not comfortable kissing or hugging on a first date.\""

Tell a waiter or staff person the situation, and ask them to call the police."
