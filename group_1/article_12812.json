      "content": "These signs are the same gesture, but have different meanings. Both the devil horns hand sign (commonly called “sign of the horns” or “hand-horns”) and the rock sign (commonly called “rock on” or “rock and roll”) are made by extending the index and pinky fingers and holding down the 2 middle fingers with the thumb. While they’re the same gesture, the devil horns sign came about first: it’s an ancient sign to ward off evil. The rock sign appropriated the devil horns sign and turned it into a symbol of heavy metal and rock music. [1] X Research source Both of these signs come from the sign of the horns gesture , which we talk about in the section below. This gesture isn’t just popular in heavy metal and rock circles: it’s also a common hand sign in other religions and used by many different sports fans . We’ll talk about all its other meanings in the sections below, too!"

      "content": "The devil horns hand sign is an Italian gesture to ward off the evil eye. According to Italian superstitious beliefs, making the devil horns hand sign (also called the sign of the horns) is a way to repel the evil eye , which is a malevolent gaze that’s thought to bring you misfortune. If someone fears they’re being targeted by the evil eye, they’ll point their fingers downward or horizontally to drive off any bad intentions. [2] X Research source In Italian, the devil horns hand sign is called le corna (“horns” in Italian) or mano cornuta (“horned hand”). The devil horns hand sign is an apotropaic gesture, or a superstitious gesture that’s meant to prevent or protect against evil forces. It’s similar to knocking on wood to prevent bad luck. [3] X Research source Your hand position matters. If you point your fingers up, it’s thought that this inflicts the evil eye , especially when you point at someone. In some beliefs, it’s also a way to call out infidelity. What about backwards vs forwards? Some say making the devil horns backwards (palm facing out) is a way to inflict the evil eye, while making it forward (palm facing you) wards it off. Other countries, like Greece, Portugal, and Spain, use the devil horns hand sign to ward off the evil eye, too."

      "content": "The rock hand sign means “Rock on” or “Good times.” If you’ve ever attended a metal or rock concert, you’ve probably seen the crowd throw up the devil horns hand sign as they headbang to the music. This is a common way for fans to express their affiliation with the culture and enjoyment of the music—it’s like saying, “I am metal and I belong,” or more simply, “Rock on!” [4] X Research source The rock sign can also be used as a greeting between heavy metal or rock fans. Many musicians throw up the sign as they walk onto the stage to welcome their fans to the concert. This gesture is also a way to express enjoyment or respect. Concert-goers will hold up the sign to indicate they approve of the music and band. The rock sign is also a popular emoji .

      "content": "The rock sign was popularized by Ronnie James Dio. In 1979, Ronnie James Dio became the lead singer of Black Sabbath , taking over when Ozzy Osbourne left the group. Osbourne was famous for flashing the peace sign (✌️), so Dio wanted his own gesture to help connect with the fans. He remembered his Italian grandmother making the devil horns hand sign to ward off evil, so he started to make the sign during concerts. The gesture caught on and the rest, as they say, is history! [5] X Research source In interviews, Dio asserted that he was not the first metal or rock singer to use this gesture. In fact, there are images of John Lennon ( The Beatles ) and Geezer Butler ( Black Sabbath ) making the sign prior to 1979. [6] X Research source Dio also claimed in interviews that the rock sign is not a sign of the devil. He recognized it as an appropriation of the Italian gesture to ward off evil that has become a symbol of rock and roll. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "The devil horns sign is not related to the devil, though some believe it is. The devil horns hand sign is primarily used as an apotropaic gesture to ward off evil or to celebrate heavy metal or rock music. However, due to its association with heavy metal and some satanic religions, some people see the gesture as a sign of the devil. [8] X Research source It’s important to remember that the devil horns hand sign gesture has different meanings across many different cultures. While people may view this gesture as a sign of the devil, it is not inherently demonic or satanic. Some Christians may see the sign of the horns as an occult symbol. Because it's associated with superstitious beliefs (warding off evil), they might choose not to make this sign. Note : It’s unclear why this gesture is called the devil horns. The original Italian name for this gesture, le corna , most likely refers to bull horns, which are commonly associated with strength and protection. [9] X Research source"
