      "title": "Open or unlatched dishwasher door",
      "content": "Open or unlatched dishwasher door Modern dishwashers will not turn on if the latch on the door isn’t closed correctly. Either there’s a mechanical switch your door isn’t reaching when you close the door, or your dishwasher has a sensor that checks to see if the door is sealed all the way and it’s not detecting that to be the case. [1] X Research source Diagnosing the issue: Inspect the latch at the top of the door to see if it’s dirty or damaged. Try closing the door firmly and listen for a click. Fixing the problem: Try closing the door firmly and running the cycle—you may just not be closing the door hard enough. If that isn’t it, try cleaning the latch with a wet cloth and closing the door again. If that also doesn’t work, the door probably isn’t the problem."

      "title": "Closed supply valve",
      "content": "Closed supply valve If you just installed the dishwasher or you were working on your sink, you may have simply forgot to turn the water supply on. Your dishwasher links up to the sink’s water supply, but it usually has a separate, dedicated valve on the connection. [2] X Research source Diagnosing the issue: Go under your sink and follow the supply line that runs from the back of your dishwasher to the water line in the wall. Turn that valve all the way to the left to open it up. Fixing the problem: If the valve opens to the left, you’ve solved your problem. If the supply line was already open, this wasn’t the issue."

      "title": "Drain hose positioned incorrectly",
      "content": "Drain hose positioned incorrectly Drain hoses typically need to sit 20 inches (51 cm) off the floor or water can siphon back into the machine when it tries to drain. The drain hose also must have a slight dip the middle to prevent sewer gases from building up, but it can’t dip so low that water can’t get out. Any of these drain issues will prevent your dishwasher from working correctly. Diagnosing the issue: Open your dishwasher’s manual to determine what the drain hose clearance requirements are. Then, inspect the shape and angle of your drain hose to identify if there’s an issue. Fixing the problem: Reinstall the drain hose so that it sits at an appropriate level. Use zip ties or cable management strips to hold the hose in place by tying it to the supply line above it under the sink."

      "title": "Inlet valve blockage",
      "content": "Inlet valve blockage The inlet valve is the dampener that opens to allow water into the machine. If it’s filled with debris or it’s exceptionally old and it has locked up, water may not be able to enter your machine. [3] X Research source Diagnosing the issue: Listen when your machine turns on. If you hear humming noises but there’s no water, your valve is probably blocked. The older your dishwasher is, the more likely the inlet valve is to fail, so keep the age of your dishwasher in mind. Fixing the problem: You need a new inlet valve. Contact an appliance repair company to do the work. Alternatively, you can reach out to your dishwasher’s manufacturer and order a replacement to try repairing it yourself."

      "title": "Blocked overfill float",
      "content": "Blocked overfill float The overfill float is a small assembly that raises up whenever water levels get too high in the dishwasher. When that happens, the machine automatically stops feeding water to the dishwasher. If the float gets stuck though, the dishwasher won’t fill with any water next time you go to use it. [4] X Research source Diagnosing the issue: The float is usually disc-shaped and made of plastic. Look for a 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) disc at the base of your machine. If it’s popped up, your float is stick. Fixing the problem: Push the float up and down a few times to remove any mineral deposits. If this doesn’t fix it, contact a dishwasher repair company to have them rewire your float or replace it."

      "title": "Kinked or damaged hoses",
      "content": "Kinked or damaged hoses Behind your dishwasher at the back (or under the kickplate on the front) there are a bunch of hoses. These drain, supply, and overflow hoses can get kinked and block water flow if you installed the dishwasher incorrectly. Alternatively, if the dishwasher is old, the hoses may be damaged or clogged. [5] X Research source Diagnosing the issue: Visually inspect the hoses for kinks. If they’re especially old or dirty, it may be time to replace them. If there are any kinks, this is probably the source of your issue. Fixing the problem: Remove any kinks by reinstalling the hoses. If the hoses are especially old, purchase fresh replacements and install them."

      "title": "Blown breaker fuse",
      "content": "Blown breaker fuse Kitchen appliances often have dedicated fuses on your home’s electrical panel. If the fuse for your dishwasher happens to be blown, Diagnosing the issue: Just check to see if the dishwasher is powering on at all. If it isn’t and you know it’s plugged in, you probably blew a fuse. Fixing the problem: Go to the electrical panel and find the fuse for the dishwasher. If it’s flipped off, reset it. If this keeps happening in the future, contact an electrician."

      "content": "You likely have mineral deposits blocking the upper rack spray arm. The top rack gets its water from a dedicated spray arm underneath the top shelf. Physically remove the spray arm (it should pop off with a gentle amount of force). Then, rinse the arm under warm water while using a toothpick to scrape off any mineral deposits inside the holes. [6] X Research source You can probably get away with using white vinegar to remove any calcium deposits too, but check your manual first to make sure it’s safe."

      "content": "Partial filling indicates your dishwasher probably has electrical issues. Modern dishwashers have all kinds of sensors, controls, and components that help it clean dishes efficiently. If your dishwasher is only filling up partially and then shutting off, your machine could have a blown thermal fuse, electronic control board issues, or some other electrical problem. Consult a professional dishwasher repair company for repairs."
