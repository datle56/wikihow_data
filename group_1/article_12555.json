      "content": "Think about what your design is going to represent. Maybe you are advertising your cleaning company, your rock band, or your favorite sports team. Maybe you’re using a personal illustration. The purpose of the design will determine the design. If you are advertising a company, band, sporting team, or brand, you will likely need to focus on logo . The Nike swoosh logo, for example, is a very simple but effective design. A design for a sporting team might feature the team colors or the team’s mascot. A design for your band might focus on an image of the band or a graphic that represents the band’s style or sound. If you are making a t-shirt to showcase a personal illustration or drawing, you will need to focus on how it will look on a t-shirt. Think about how original the illustration is and how the colors are working in the illustration. Consider using a photo in your design. Use your own photo. You may use a picture made by someone else, but only if you have acquired the legal rights to use that image. You can also buy a stock image."

      "title": "Pick a color scheme.",
      "content": "Pick a color scheme. When designing a t-shirt, its important to think about color contrast. This means how certain ink colors in the design will appear against a lighter colored shirt or a darker colored shirt. Certain ink colors look more vibrant on a lighter or darker shirt on the computer screen than they actually do when printed. [1] X Research source When using lighter shirts, avoid pastel colors like yellow, light blue, or light pink. These colors will be visible on the shirts but may not be legible at a distance. And if you are designing a shirt with a logo, you want to make sure that logo is legible from far away! If you decide to use pastel colors, add an outline of a darker color to the lighter color to highlight the text and make it easier to read. Darker colored shirts look good with lighter ink colors, such as pastels. But be careful when using darker ink colors on darker colored shirts like cardinal (dark blue), maroon, or forest green. These colors may look great on the computer or in a drawing, but when they print, the shirt color sometimes distorts the ink color. As a result, they can appear more brown or dull. If you decide to use Adobe Illustrator to create your design, the Global Colours settings can help immensely with color schemes. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Add dimension to the design.",
      "content": "Add dimension to the design. Once you’ve added your colors to the design, it may look good but still a bit flat or one dimensional. To create more depth to a certain area of the design, add a color that is the shade of the color beneath it. This will brighten up the design and give it some dimension. [3] X Research source If you plan to use software with a high capacity for manipulation (such as Adobe Photoshop , InDesign, Gimp , Adobe Illustrator , or Paint Shop Pro), you can use a standard image and radically transform it to fit your needs. Creating a vector outline on Inkscape is an especially effective way to resize a photo if necessary."

      "title": "Balance your design.",
      "content": "Balance your design. This means combining all the parts or elements to form a whole. How you do this depends on the composition of your design. Maybe your design has a lot of smaller elements, like stars, plants or animals. Or may it is one large design with one main figure or image. Think about how you can make the design look cohesive, so that all the parts or elements fit well together. A balanced image will immediately draw the eye in rather than away from an image."

      "content": "Determine the placement of the design on the t-shirt. Would your design work better as a centered image, an image on the top left of the t-shirt or as a wraparound image? If you are designing a t shirt for a brand or company, a simple design in the center of the shirt may be the most effective. Don’t forget you can also use the back of the t-shirt to include a branding slogan (“Just Do It”). Or a song lyric from a song by the band you are designing the shirt for."

Keep in mind color contrast and dimension. Make sure the image is balanced and cohesive. [4] X Research source When in doubt, get a second opinion. Ask friends, family, or coworkers what design and color scheme they like best."

      "title": "Use Adobe Photoshop to touch up your paper sketches.",
      "content": "Use Adobe Photoshop to touch up your paper sketches. If your paper sketches are not high quality or drawn with clear lines, this option may not work. If your sketch is high quality: Scan the sketches to your computer. Then, retouch them in Photoshop. Clean up the lines. Play with the filters, colors, brightness, contrast, saturation, or any other effects at your disposal. Add lines, flourishes, splatter effects, and other embellishments that might make the design more dynamic and balanced (where appropriate). Make sure that the entire layout is internally consistent by keeping proportions reasonable, styles consistent, and colors cohesive."

      "title": "Add text to the design, if desire.",
      "content": "Add text to the design, if desire. Look for a font that complements your overall design, rather than overwhelm it. The font should work with the image(s) in your design to create a balanced design. Think about the fonts on some of the more well known logos or designs. The font should relate back to the company or brand’s overall style. Nike’s Just Do It’s slogan, for example, is in a bold and simple font, just like their bold and simple swoosh logo. In contrast, the font used for a sports team or a garage rock band may be more elaborate or ornate. Make sure any filters you are using on the design are also applied to the font. If you are working with layers on Photoshop, you will need to drag your font layers below the photo effects layers. [5] X Research source Use free fonts from an online site like defont.com. You can also access free brush designs from brusheezy.com. [6] X Research source Look at how to add fonts to your PC , Illustrator , or Photoshop if necessary. If you’re feeling adventurous with design, you can make your own ."

Or make your own by buying a mesh screen and a canvas stretcher frame. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple the edges down so that the mesh is taut.

[9] X Research source You can also use a coating tray to apply the emulsion to the screen. Do this by placing the screen on a clean towel and tilting it away from you slightly. Place the coating tray at the bottom of the screen and carefully pour the emulsion on the screen as you move the tray up the screen. Leave the emulsion to dry in a completely black room for about twenty minutes. Use a fan to help the screen dry. [10] X Research source"
