      "content": "Wear a thin camisole in a complementary color. Avoid basic tank tops, which may look too casual with a formal dress. Look for more luxe materials such as lace or silk, and stay away from anything too bulky, which might add unwanted lumps to the silhouette. [1] X Expert Source LaTricia Brown Master Tailor & Creative Director Expert Interview. 9 July 2021. Match the camisole to the color of your dress if you want it to appear as if it’s part of the outfit rather than something you added later to cover yourself up. Layer a bra under your camisole for support or choose one with a built-in shelf bra for added coverage. If you want something smoothing and slimming, look for a camisole that doubles as shapewear ."

      "content": "Keep fabric in place with double-sided fashion tape . If you’re worried about a wrap dress opening too much at the top or a plunging neckline exposing too much skin, this can keep things where you want and fix the gaping . [4] X Research source Peel off one side of the tape and place it on the skin of your chest beneath where you want the neckline to hit, leaving a little bit of space for the edge of the fabric so the tape won't show. Smooth the tape down , then peel off the other side and place the fabric over it. Do this on each side of the neckline as needed. Use the prepackaged length of the tape or cut it to the size you prefer. Don’t tug too much on the fabric when you stick it down, as this could create tension and cause the tape to fall off. Take some extra tape with you wherever you go in case it comes off and you need to reapply it."

      "content": "Layer a scarf or shawl for added coverage. An airy scarf or shawl in a classic color or pattern can be a stylish addition to a work outfit or evening attire. Most importantly, it’s an excellent way to cover both your chest and your arms for a more modest look. [5] X Research source Drape a shawl over your shoulders and tie it in a loose knot at your chest. This has the added bonus of keeping your arms warm if you’re wearing a sleeveless style. Tie your scarf in a large bow at your chest for a statement-making look that also draws attention away from a low neckline. Let the scarf hang long down your torso without tying it, and buckle a thin belt around your waist to keep it in place. This will also cinch you in and flatter your shape."

      "content": "Use a brooch to pin a plunging neckline closed. If your neckline leaves enough fabric to pull closed, try fastening the two sides together with a sparkly pin. There’s no need to add any other accessories—a brooch does double duty. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a brooch that works, a safety pin can also do the trick, as long as you’re able to hide it under the fabric. Look for safety pins in the same color as your dress if you can’t keep the silver from showing."

      "content": "Add a snap closure to a wrap dress for versatility. Just because you want to cover your cleavage for a particular event doesn’t necessarily mean you wouldn’t want to opt for a more plunging neckline on another occasion. Put the dress on and use a pencil to mark where you want the snaps to go. Put one mark on top of the bottom layer of fabric and one on the underside of the top layer of fabric. Sew the snaps on by threading through the back side of the fabric where you placed your marks. Take your dress from day to night by wearing it closed at the office and open when you go out."

      "content": "Shorten the straps of the dress to pull the neckline higher. Sometimes, long straps make a dress hang too low on your torso, resulting in a more revealing look. By tightening the straps, you can add both modesty and comfort. [10] X Research source Cut the straps off the back, then cut off the excess, using the piece you removed on one strap to measure on the other strap. Sew each strap back in place with several knots, ensuring it's not twisted before you start. Avoid shortening the straps if your dress has a band or seam under the bust, which could place it too high for a comfortable fit. Keep in mind that this will also make the armholes smaller. Make sure they’re in a comfortable position before changing anything."
