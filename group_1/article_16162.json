      "content": "Listen to yourself. Self expression, which is the ability to communicate and demonstrate your feelings honestly, is an important factor in embarking on the journey of finding out who you really are. You can start finding who you are by listening to yourself, how you feel, and how you want to react to a situation. This can get you more in tune with your feelings and emotions, helping you begin to express yourself. [2] X Research source Pfaffenberger, Angela H.

You may also not know how to safely express your emotions. [3] X Research source You may not have had a lot of experience in really tuning into to how you feel. It is common to stuff emotions away, to feel embarrassed or ashamed of emotions you may have, or hide your emotions completely. [4] X Research source Kahn, Jeffrey H. and Garrison, Angela M. Emotional Self-Disclosure and Emotional Avoidance: Relations with Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety. Journal of Counseling Psychology. Oct 2009. v56, n4 p573-584 For example, your friend forgets that you are supposed to hang out and doesn't show up or call you. It is okay to feel angry and upset about this situation. Acknowledge that your emotions of anger and sadness are valid and understandable. Do not belittle your feelings, even if she apologizes. You had a right to feel them and legitimize them. Getting closer to your emotions will get you more in touch with who you really are. The closer you feel to your authentic self, the less anxiety, depression, and overall dissatisfaction you may feel in your life in general.

      "content": "Focus on how your body reacts. This may be a new experience for you. One of the best ways to tune into how you feel is being aware of your body. One easy way to test this out is notice how your body responds to an emotional situation. You can start with something very easy, such as anger expressed through road rage. Whether you ride the bus or drive a car, you have probably become frustrated or angry with traffic and can identify this feeling of anger. Notice what parts of your body become tense, what happens to your breathing, and what happens in your abdomen or stomach."

      "content": "Own your emotions. You may be in the habit of telling yourself that you’re just being silly for feeling a certain way. You may also tell yourself not to feel a certain way. As you become more accustomed to recognizing your body’s response to emotions, it will be more difficult to just shrug off emotions. Your body is responding for a reason, and it is important to validate that. Get out your journal and start keeping a log of all the different feelings you had that day. [8] X Research source For example, write things like, \"Today at work my boss made me really angry.\" Validate that anger and write about why you were angry. Do this for all the emotions you feel each day. You may be surprised at the rich emotional landscape you actually have inside of you once you start paying attention. Humans are naturally emotional beings, and it is easy in a fast-paced world to become disconnected from how you really feel. [9] X Research source Koole, Sander L.

Don't edit yourself and make it as raw and as graphic as you like.

      "content": "Express yourself safely. You need to figure out how to translate your emotions from their raw, unedited state into something productive that won't hurt others. Part of learning how to express your emotions is learning how to express them safely without hurting yourself or others. Use your journal to reframe your angry thoughts into sentences that express and validate how you feel , but won’t get you fired or in trouble. [12] X Research source For example, instead of screaming at someone and telling them you hate them, use your journal to write down different ways of expressing this that won’t have negative consequences on your life. Write phrases in your journal such as, \"When my boss does this, I feel angry.\" or \"When my parents yell at me, I feel angry.\" You are giving yourself the power to feel your emotions without letting your emotions have power over you. This works for other emotions as well. [13] X Research source Wang, Yu and Kong, Feng. The Role of Emotional Intelligence in the Impact of Mindfulness on Life Satisfaction and Mental Distress.

This will allow you to let your emotions to guide you in knowing when it is time to speak up, or when it is appropriate to express your emotions privately and move on. For example, employers can be very frustrating. However, you have to ask yourself in any given situation what the benefit will be to you. Will your boss hear you? Will your boss understand? Would it be healthier to express your anger at home, writing about it in your journal than to engage in confrontation? You want to make sure you are true to your emotions and act on the right form of expression. [14] X Research source Betzler, Monika. Making Sense of Actions Expressing Emotions.

Taking time to sit and paint or draw can also be relaxing. Don’t judge your abilities. Expressing yourself creatively is not about becoming the next Leonardo da Vinci, it’s about the act of creating. Learning to express yourself means learning to get to know yourself. Unleashing the creative side of yourself can be a surprising and fulfilling way to get a handle on who you really are inside.
