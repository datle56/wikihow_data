      "content": "Wash the uncut okra. When you’re ready to cook, rinse the whole okra pods under running water. Use your hands to lightly rub down each pod to remove any dirt or pesticides from the surface of the veggies. [2] X Research source Don’t wash the okra until right before you are ready to slice and cook it; otherwise, it could get slimy. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dry the okra thoroughly with a paper towel or cloth. When the inside of okra interacts with liquid, it can become gooey. So make sure to dry off all water before you start slicing. [4] X Research source Rubbing your okra dry also helps scrub off some of the fuzzy hairs on the surface of the pods. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut off the tough stem.",
      "content": "Cut off the tough stem. Using a sharp paring knife, slice off the thicker end of the pod, which can be bitter and hard to chew. Try not to cut into the seed pod itself, especially if you’re planning to cook the okra whole. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak whole pods in vinegar to further reduce sliminess.",
      "content": "Soak whole pods in vinegar to further reduce sliminess. Some cooks swear by soaking okra in a vinegar bath to help minimize the slime factor. To give it a try, mix vinegar (any kind) and water in a large bowl and dip the okra in for a quick bath. [7] X Research source Make sure to rinse and dry thoroughly before cooking."

      "title": "Slice okra into smaller pieces for stewing or frying.",
      "content": "Slice okra into smaller pieces for stewing or frying . Using a sharp paring knife, cut off the pointy end of the pod. Then slice the okra crosswise into evenly spaced rounds about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick each. [8] X Research source To reduce sliminess, try frying the okra for about one to two minutes, which breaks down the mucous membrane around the seeds. Slicing okra this way will release more of the gooey substance from the inside of the pods. This can be used to thicken soups and stews such as gumbo. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut pods lengthwise to roast or pan sear.",
      "content": "Cut pods lengthwise to roast or pan sear. Use a sharp paring knife to slice each pod in half lengthwise. Be careful to make both halves even, otherwise the okra will cook unevenly. [10] X Research source Slicing okra lengthwise and cooking it at a high heat can help reduce sliminess by thinning out the veggie’s interior gel. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave the pods whole to boil, grill, or pickle.",
      "content": "Leave the pods whole to boil , grill, or pickle . Many recipes call for whole okra, with only the tough stems removed. If you’re going to cook okra whole, try to select smaller pods. This may help ensure less slimy and more flavorful results, as larger pods often contain more mucilage (the substance that causes gumminess). [12] X Research source"
