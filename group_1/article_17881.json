      "content": "Use a witty line to make her laugh (and boost her confidence). According to dating and relationship coach Julianne Cantarella, “women always find humor attractive.” Being playful is one of the best ways to connect with someone and make them feel comfortable around you. So, use any of the following options to impress your crush or girlfriend: Your smile could disarm a bomb. You dropped something…My jaw. Your charm should be a tripping hazard. If you were a triangle, you’d be acute one. You might be the sole cause of global warming. If you were words on a page, you’d be fine print. It must get tiring running through my mind all day. If you were a Transformer, you’d be Optimus Fine. Did you swallow magnets? Because you’re attractive. You know, you’re almost as amazing as pizza. Almost. I’d say bless you, but it looks like you already have been. Whoever said “nobody’s perfect” has clearly never met you. Is it exhausting being this amazing, or does it come naturally? Do you have an inhaler? Because you just took my breath away. Could you turn down your greatness? You’re blinding us mere mortals. Hanging out with you is like finding an extra fry at the bottom of the bag. Serious question: Do you ever have a bad hair day or a bad anything day? When I send your pic to the group chat, which one do you want me to use? You’re like the human version of an espresso shot…You instantly brighten my day. Are you a magician? Because every time I look at you, everyone else just disappears."

      "content": "Highlight her best qualities to make her feel special. If you’re not in a relationship, avoid commenting on her appearance or attractiveness. Focus on a non-romantic quality that you admire about her, such as her skills, interests, personality, or style. This shows that you pay attention to her and appreciate her authentic self, which is the ultimate compliment! You amaze me every day. Your smile makes me weak. Your laugh is music to my ears. Your mom must be really pretty. You have superior taste in music. You have the best sense of humor. You’re the definition of a green flag. You’re like sunshine on a cloudy day. You’re the most stylish person I know. You have a heart of gold. Never change. I love the way you curled your hair today. There’s something really special about you. You’re my favorite person to spend time with. I could stare at you for hours and not get bored. Cute, smart, and silly? You’re the total package! I’d rather lose sleep than lose time talking to you. When I look at you sometimes, I get a little dumb. My face hurts from how much you make me smile. Your smile is so contagious that I can’t help but smile too. You’re the kind of girl that can make a guy forget his name. All of my friends think you’re out of my league. And I agree. Want to know a secret? You’re the coolest person I’ve ever met."

If you’re in a relationship with her (or want to take things to the next level ), frame your compliment so it describes how she makes you feel. Dating expert John Keegan says “being over the top [can be] really nice.” So, think about how she’s affected you, and don’t be afraid to get sappy and affectionate! You deserve the world. You take my breath away. Every love song reminds me of you. I feel so lucky to be a part of your life. When you smile, my heart skips a beat. Nobody makes me feel the way you do. Your beauty radiates from the inside out. I’m in awe of your strength and resilience. You inspire me to become a better person. You make every day feel like an adventure. You make me forget about all of my problems. You’re the most captivating person I’ve ever met. Every time I hang out with you, I lose track of time. You’re the reason I wake up with a smile on my face. You make the mundane moments in life feel magical. I love every inch of you. It’s like you were made for me. Everything sounds beautiful when it comes out of your lips. Thank you for being a good listener. I feel heard when I talk to you. You look beautiful today, but then again, you look beautiful every day. You’re insanely gorgeous, and that’s the least interesting thing about you. I appreciate how open-minded you are. It makes our conversations much more interesting."

Tell her that she’s beautiful in a way that gets her hot and bothered. Use words that imply intimacy like “sexy,” “hot,” or “kissable,” and mention all the things you want to do with her in the bedroom—as long as she feels comfortable with dirty talk . I’m addicted to you. You dominate my mind. I want to kiss you all over. You have very kissable lips. I can’t wait to get you alone. You’re sexy, fine, and all mine. You’re a real-life Jessica Rabbit. Your hips are driving me insane. You were in my dream last night. You’re really hot when you’re bossy. Damn, that dress was made for you. You’re such a dork. It’s making me hot. I’ve been thinking about your lips all day. You make me not want to be a gentleman. You’re the type of girl I see in my fantasies. Those heels make your legs look even hotter. I love how you can turn me on without even trying. I was feeling off today, but you just totally turned me on. If being sexy were a crime, you’d be serving a life sentence. You know you’re the hottest person in the room right now, right? I can’t keep being near you like this…It’s turning me on too much."
