      "content": "Determine a color that suits you. Before you start this process, it's best to give yourself some time to figure out the look you want to create. Look online for inspiration, and read reviews for different types of lightening and coloring products. Depending on the route you choose to go, your results may be permanent, so it's important to plan carefully! You might choose to match your eyes or use another color that flatters your skin. Alternatively, if there's a color you've always loved but that doesn't really flatter you, a dip-dye can be a great way to enjoy it without using it to frame your face. Just make sure you don't dip too deeply--keep it at the tips of your hair."
