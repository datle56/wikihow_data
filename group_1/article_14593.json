      "title": "Separate the hair into sections.",
      "content": "Separate the hair into sections. Each section will form a loc. Start separating sections of hair on the back of your head first. Use a comb to separate the hair into a 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) thick section. Use your free hand to hold the section of hair together. [1] X Research source If you want fatter locs, you can separate a thicker section of hair. Use sections that are 1 inch by 1 inch (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) square at the base for medium locs, or double the size for a large loc. Backcombing works best on hair that’s 6 inches (15 cm) or longer, but can work with hair as short as 3 inches (7.6 cm). Backcombing an entire head of hair can take up to 4 hours to complete."

      "title": "Comb the section of hair up towards the scalp with a dread comb.",
      "content": "Comb the section of hair up towards the scalp with a dread comb. Start by combing the section of hair 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the roots, towards the direction of the scalp. Comb over the same section 5-10 times until the hair starts to bunch up towards the scalp, then slowly make your way down, towards the ends of the hair. Continue combing in 3 inches (7.6 cm) sections until the entire portion of separated hair is backcombed. [2] X Research source You can purchase a dread comb online or at a beauty supply store."

      "content": "Push a crochet needle through the hair to loop it further. Grip the hair between your index finger and thumb, a couple of inches (about 5 cm) away from the root. Hold the section of hair tightly and run the crochet needle in between your fingers, through the hair several times. Your hair will bunch up even further. Continue doing this down the length of the hair until the entire section is knotted and looped. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tie rubber bands on the end and root of the loc.",
      "content": "Tie rubber bands on the end and root of the loc. After you use the comb and needle, the hair should resemble a dread. Use small rubber bands to secure it at the base of the loc and at the end of the section of hair. This will hold it in place and allow it to keep its form. [4] X Research source If you plan to go out in public before you have finished dreadlocking your hair, you may wish to use rubber bands that are the same color as your hair to create a more natural appearance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply dread cream to the loc.",
      "content": "Apply dread cream to the loc. Look for products like locking gel, lock and twist gel, or beeswax. Dread cream will prevent hair and scalp dryness and will promote the forming of dreads. Squeeze a generous portion into the palm of your hand, then apply it from the root to the end of the loc. [5] X Research source Gels tend to build up on the hair less than heavier products like wax. You can also use some natural, botanical oils with a little bit of a gel. Oil keeps the hair protected before you put the gel on top of it."

      "title": "Roll the loc in between the palms of your hands.",
      "content": "Roll the loc in between the palms of your hands. Put the loc between the palms of your hands and roll it back and forth several times so that it forms into more of a rounded shape. Start from the root and work your way down to the end of the loc. This will help form the locs and make them look uniform. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat the process on the rest of the hair. Continue dreading each section of hair in even sections until the entire head has been dreaded. Do not attempt to backcomb the sections again, or you’ll have to restart the knotting process. Remove the rubber bands once you’ve dreaded all the hair. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Twist the section of hair with your fingers. Grab the ends of the section of hair in between your index finger and thumb and twist it in 1 direction. Use your other index finger and thumb to hold the twist in place as you twist the end even further. Continue twisting it in the same direction until the entire section of hair is twisted."

      "content": "Pull the tip of the section apart towards the root. Once the hair is fully wound up, grab the end of the section with both hands and pull the ends of the hair in opposite directions. This will divide the sectioned hair and start the knotting process for the dreads. [9] X Research source Your section of hair should pull apart easily and shouldn't be painful."

      "content": "Secure rubber bands near the end and root of the dread. Once you’ve knotted the entire section of hair, you can secure the dread with a rubber band at the root and the end of the dread. This will make it easier to work on the rest of the hair without messing up the locs you already created. [11] X Research source You can apply loc cream to the dreadlock to prevent scalp and hair dryness."

      "title": "Stop combing your hair.",
      "content": "Stop combing your hair. Stop using a comb or brush and don’t use your hands to untangle knots in your hair. This will create natural knotting that will happen over time and will eventually form a “natural” dreadlock. This method of dreadlocking straight hair is also called the neglect or freeform method. Do not style your hair when trying to form dreadlocks using the natural method."

      "title": "Avoid washing your hair for a few months.",
      "content": "Avoid washing your hair for a few months. During the time when your locs are forming, washing them or getting them wet may cause them to unravel. This is especially true of straight hair. Try using a dry shampoo to clean your hair until your locs have had a chance to get established."

      "title": "Don’t condition your hair.",
      "content": "Don’t condition your hair. Conditioner detangles and softens your hair, which is the opposite of what you want to happen when trying to achieve locs using the natural method. You can wash your hair with water and shampoo or soap once the locs have had a few months to set, but do not use any conditioner."

      "content": "Spray salt water on your locs to speed up the process. Mix a couple of tablespoons of salt into a spray bottle with water and spray it onto your locs twice a day. This will increase the friction among the hair strands and create more loops and knots. [13] X Research source You shouldn't need to use creams, waxes, or hair products when forming natural dreads."

Over time, your hair will start to form locs if you don’t condition or brush it. The natural method is the longest method to achieve dreadlocks and should only be attempted if you have patience.

Since you have little control over how your locs form with this method, it’s important to separate your hair when it becomes severely matted or your locs become too big. If you notice that your locs are fusing together into a giant loc, separate them into smaller pieces by pulling them apart. [15] X Research source"
