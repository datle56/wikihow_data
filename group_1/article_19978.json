      "content": "Head to the Third Sea. Level 1500 or above is required to enter this area. Go to the Castle On Sea. It is in the center of the Third Sea. Obtain The God's Chalice. Elite Pirates have a chance to drop the chalice. The chalice will spawn in one random chest around the map 4 hours after a server starts. After someone finds it, the timer will reset. Put in the Legendary Aura Colors. You need to put 3 aura colors in the pads. The 3 aura colors can be put in by anyone, not necessarily by the holder of the God's Chalice. Place the God's Chalice on the pedestal."

If you have a Portal Fruit (highly recommended), you can use it to teleport to Hydra. Do not kill rip_indra; the boss needs to be summoned and alive for the start of the puzzle."

If the raid boss rip_indra is alive, the door here will glow, meaning you can enter it. If the boss isn't alive, the door will be gray, and you won't be able to pass."

      "content": "Light the torches within 5 minutes. As soon as you enter the glowing door, you'll be transported to the Floating Turtle with a Holy Torch and a message on your screen that says you have 5 minutes. You have to light them in this order: 1st torch: inside the arches of a bridge. Follow the path as soon as you enter the island from the main dock, then take the first right fork. Take the second right, where you'll see a bridge. Jump up, and you'll see the torch in the left-most alcove. The first torch inside the arches of this bridge is closest to the part where you start the puzzle. 2nd torch: behind the tree on the arch of a broken bridge. Leave the same way you entered and keep it right. You'll pass a pink mushroom on the right and see another bridge archway in the distance. There is where you will find the torch. The second torch will be near the bottom of the bridge. 3rd torch: on a wall near barrels, on top of a pineapple house that's above a giant leaf, on a tree on the right side. Leave the way you came, and you'll see pineapple houses on a dirt road. Follow that road, keeping to the left, and you'll see pineapple houses on leaves. It's in the pineapple house on the right side of the road. The third torch is in the highest pineapple house, on a tree with 3 houses on it, by the jungle pirates. 4th torch: on a shipwreck near the Mythological Pirates. Continue down the dirt road and take a left past an NPC. Follow the road leading to a mansion and take another left as soon as you see a \"!\" on the wall. Start climbing and you'll find the wrecked ship. The 4th torch is the easiest and is located on the deck of the shipwreck behind the mansion. 5th torch: on a house near the Forest Pirates. Return to the main road and find a small house with a red roof next to a knocked-over building. Find the torch on the back of the house with the red roof. The 5th torch is located next to the mansion in the forest pirate area."

      "content": "Defeat Longma. Once you light all 5 torches, you'll open a secret passage near the Fishman Captains and Fishman Raiders. Go inside that secret passage and you'll find Longma. Luckily, this boss doesn't have a lot of HP compared to others. Longma regains her health every 5 seconds and she does not take any damage. Once you defeat this boss, he drops the Tushita weapon. [1] X Research source After killing the boss you have a guaranteed drop chance to get the Tushita. After finishing the quest you can enter the hideout anytime even after the five minutes is up."
