      "content": "Class width is the spacing among groups in a frequency distribution table. More precisely, class width equals the difference between the lower numbers in consecutive classes. What’s that mean? Say, for example, you have a first group (class) of items (numbers) ranging from 60-69, and a second class ranging from 70-79. Since the difference between 70 and 60 is 10, the class width equals 10. [1] X Research source Setting a consistent class width across groups gives each group equal parameters. This is important when you’re making a frequency distribution table, since you want to show how the items (numbers) are distributed among equal segments of the entire range."

Determine the range —the gap between the smallest and largest items—by subtracting the smallest from the largest. For instance: [2] X Research source Items (e.g., grades): 64, 68, 73, 75, 78, 79, 81, 83, 83, 84, 89, 90, 91, 94, 96, 97 Largest item (97) minus smallest item (64): 97-64=33 Range: 33"

      "content": "Select between 5 and 20 classes (groups) to sort the items into. There’s no hard-and-fast rule on the number of classes to break a set of items into. A very general guide, though, is to use 5 groups for 20 or fewer items, and 20 groups for 100 or more items. Ideally, each group will end up with at least 1 item in it. Some people also prefer to use an odd number of classes (5, 7, 9, etc.), so that there’s always a class that serves as the midpoint (class 3 in a 5-class setup, etc.). [3] X Research source In our example of number grades, there are 16 items. Since this is fewer than 20 items, we’ll follow the “rule of thumb” and use 5 classes."

While 33/5=6.6 , it’s standard procedure to round up to the next whole number; in this case, 7. Therefore, the class width is 7. (Strictly speaking, you’re done calculating class width at this point, but we’ll keep going to fill out the classes in a frequency distribution table.) [4] X Research source You’ll often see the “class width formula” defined as (max-min)/n , with “(max-min)” representing the range calculation and “n” referring to the number of classes."

So, assuming that you want the class width to be equal for each class, set the low parameter for the first class at 64. [5] X Research source NOTE: In some cases you may prefer for the first (lowest) and/or last (highest) classes to extend beyond the smallest or largest item. You might, for example, want the first class to start at 60 (or even 0) instead of 64, and the last class to end at 100. This is generally fine to do if it suits your needs."

So adding the class width to the starting point of the first class gives you the starting point of the second class. To get the end point of the first class, simply subtract 1. Here’s how it looks in our example: [6] X Research source The first class starts at 64. 64+7 (class width) =71 (start of second class). Since 71-1=70 , the first class includes all items between 64 and 70.
