      "title": "Engage her about her work or personal projects.",
      "content": "Engage her about her work or personal projects. Capricorns are naturally ambitious, hard-working people. Most will enjoy discussing their professional goals and the progress they've made toward them. Try talking to her about whatever she's doing to get ahead in life — whether this includes a nine-to-five job or personal projects like art, writing, etc. — and don't be surprised if she's ready to talk about these things at great length. Work may be a topic that you find boring, but don't have to sound like you're asking her robotic questions at a job interview when you talk to her about hers. In fact, with some creativity (and an air of gentle mischief), you can add a little flirty zest to these normally dry questions. Here are just a few examples: Bland questions: \"Where do you work?\" \"What do you do?\" \"Do you enjoy that?\" \"Where do you see yourself in five years?\" Zesty questions: \"So, what's your plan for making your first million?\" \"What's your next step in life?\" \"Are you more of a Gordon Gekko person or a Lorenzo Anello person?\""

      "title": "Subtly bring up your own professional achievements.",
      "content": "Subtly bring up your own professional achievements. Because they value ambition and determination, most Capricorns respect someone who's worked hard and achieved big successes. However, Capricorns are modest and conservative at heart, so they're unlikely to respond well to extravagant boasting. Instead, try dropping subtle hints about your accomplishments by working them into the conversation naturally. [2] X Expert Source Tara Divina Vedic Astrologer Expert Interview. 20 November 2019. See below for a few examples: Blunt brags: \"You see these shoes? These are real alligator skin.\" \"We should go cruising in my new Bugatti this weekend.\" \"I just won employee of the month at my dad's real estate business for the fifth time in a row!\" Subtle sweet-talking: \"I'm hoping to use my signing bonus to do something nice for us.\" \"I only wear this watch on special occasions — I bought it for myself when I got my Master's.\" \"I don't usually do this, but I like to enjoy something nice after things go well at work.\""

      "title": "Play to her sense of competition — gently.",
      "content": "Play to her sense of competition — gently. Capricorns aren't generally people who will shy from a little friendly sparring. Planning dates that involve some degree of competition can lead to great fun and some serious romantic sparks. However, intense, heated competition is a no-no. Too much competition can lead to resentment and, in addition, Capricorns aren't likely to enjoy the embarrassment of losing at a high-stakes game. Good date ideas: Bowling, cards, mini golf, shooting/archery, arcade games, board games with drinks. Bad date ideas: Street racing, one-on-one street rules basketball, high-stakes poker. If you're dominating at your competition, it may be a good idea to let your date win at least once at whatever you're doing to prevent embarrassment. Try not to make it too obvious that you're letting her win — this can be more embarrassing than losing in the first place."

      "title": "Give her thoughtful gifts that she's likely to use.",
      "content": "Give her thoughtful gifts that she's likely to use. Most Capricorns are practical people that are likely to appreciate a gift a little more for its value and usefulness than for its symbolic meaning. While a piece of jewelry or a bouquet of some fragrant flowers is almost always a sweet gesture, you'll want some of your gifts to be a little more down-to-earth. Try to get her things she'll get continued, long-lasting use and enjoyment out of, rather than one-time thrills. The ideal practical gift for a Capricorn woman depends on her personal hobbies and interests. For instance, if she enjoys drawing, try getting her a high-quality sketch pad and a set of professional pencils. If she's a natural-born athlete, get her a membership to an exclusive gym with the finest exercise equipment. There's no \"right\" answer here — it all depends on the woman."

      "content": "Occasionally treat her to high-status outings. While Capricorns are unlikely to appreciate gaudy, ostentatious displays of wealth, they are naturally status-conscious and will enjoy sampling the finer things in life every once in a while. To celebrate special occasions (and sometimes \"just because\"), make an effort to treat your Capricorn lover to a fancy time out. Good date ideas: Museums, operas, fancy restaurants, film festivals, art shows, weekend getaways, wineries, etc. Short on cash? It's possible to enjoy the finer things in life on the cheap if you're creative. For instance, try checking a local university's \"events\" website — it will usually be possible to see traveling speakers, attend book signings, and more for very cheap or even free."

      "title": "Agree about your long-term goals early on.",
      "content": "Agree about your long-term goals early on. One of the biggest hazards to a successful relationship with a Capricorn woman is that, if your goals don't seem compatible, she'll probably simply move on. Save yourself the pain of having this difficult conversation after a years-long relationship by double-checking your long-term goals for compatibility within the first six months of your relationship or so. Questions that you'll want to be able to answer include: Do either of you plan on getting married in your lifetime? Do either of you want kids? Do either of you want pets? When do you want to settle down? How much would you like to save and how much would you like to spend? What major purchases would you like to make? How do you plan on living your life?"

      "title": "Give her the freedom to have some say in your plans.",
      "content": "Give her the freedom to have some say in your plans. No couple's long-term plans align perfectly — some amount of compromise is necessary for a long-term relationship to work. When the time comes to start talking about which specific compromises you intend to make, be sure to make her an equal partner in the decision-making. Not only is this common courtesy — it's also a smart move for long-term happiness. Your partner is much more likely to respect your desires if you're willing to sacrifice things so that she can achieve hers."

      "title": "Let her determine the pace of the relationship.",
      "content": "Let her determine the pace of the relationship. Unless you're a Capricorn yourself (or you have a temperament like one), there's a very good chance that your female Capricorn lover will take a longer time to warm up to additional commitments in your relationship than you will. Let her take her time. An initial reluctance to dive head-first into a new relationship isn't likely a reflection of her feelings toward you personally — it's a result of her naturally cautious, deliberate approach to life's decisions. Give her time to open up to you and you'll be glad you waited."

      "title": "Treat her with respect.",
      "content": "Treat her with respect. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it's worth mentioning because this tends to be more important for a Capricorn woman than it does for the average woman. As noted above, Capricorn women are somewhat status-conscious. This means that they tend to notice when they're treated in ways that diminish their status and that they may get embarrassed about certain breaches of etiquette that other women might not even notice. Be respectful to your Capricorn lover — this doesn't mean that you have to be deathly serious around her, but it does mean that you'll want to act differently around her than you would around your closest friends. Things to consider include: The language you use around her (especially with regards to crude words, etc.) The way you speak about her in public The way you talk to your friends about her The minor courtesies you show her (holding her hand to help her up a step, giving her your coat when it's cold, etc.)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't be put off by her guardedness.",
      "content": "Don't be put off by her guardedness. As noted above, Capricorns tend to be traditional, business-minded, somewhat conservative people. This can lead them to seem standoffish or even cold at first. Understand that, at the heart of every Capricorn, there's a person who's capable of deep emotion and compassion. While the average Capricorn may not be as open about her emotions as, for instance, the average Leo, she is still plenty capable of forming strong emotional bonds, given enough time."

      "title": "Avoid coming across as needy or desperate.",
      "content": "Avoid coming across as needy or desperate. Capricorns pride themselves on not relying very heavily on others to achieve their goals. Since your Capricorn partner is likely to be an independent, driven soul, don't drag her down by constantly bombarding her with pleas for attention and affection. Instead, cherish the tender moments you do share, as these are sure to be genuine and unforced. In addition, be ready and willing to periodically entertain yourself — Capricorns won't die if they don't get to see you for a single day, so you shouldn't either. Behaviors you'll want to avoid: Calling or texting many times per day, frequently asking for confirmations of her affection, acting jealously, attempting to alter her schedule."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid coming across as lazy or unmotivated.",
      "content": "Avoid coming across as lazy or unmotivated. Few things are less attractive to a Capricorn than someone who refuses to at least try to solve their own problems. Don't let your Capricorn lover ever start to see you as a bum. Try to maintain ambitious professional goals, even if you can't achieve all of them. Similarly, don't take your relationship for granted — always show your partner that she's important to you. Make a sincere effort to put in hard work in your professional and personal life and she will value you for your efforts. Sometimes, life deals difficult hands that force us to become less active than we previously were. For instance, illnesses, family problems, and unexpected layoffs may temporarily force you to take a less active role in achieving your goals. In these cases, don't give in to feelings of inadequacy — a smart Capricorn woman will be able to tell the difference between someone who won't work hard for their goals and someone who is temporarily prevented from doing so."

      "title": "Conversely, avoid showy displays of dominance.",
      "content": "Conversely, avoid showy displays of dominance. With their independent-minded personalities, Capricorns do not like being controlled by their significant other or having this sort of one-sided relationship implied in any way. Take a hands-off approach to your partner's life — she should be free to make her own decisions and form her own opinions. Above all, she is not someone to be possessed, controlled, or otherwise trifled with. Be prepared to respect your Capricorn lover's independence or risk losing her. Behaviors you'll want to avoid: Speaking for your partner at social events, apologizing for her opinions when they differ from yours, violating her privacy or personal space, trying to control her behaviors, etc."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't expect her to \"fix\" any deep-rooted problems you have.",
      "content": "Don't expect her to \"fix\" any deep-rooted problems you have. For better or for worse, Capricorns focus most of all on their own problems — not their partner's. While a good Capricorn woman will always be willing to offer compassionate words of support and a loving shoulder to cry on during difficult times, they generally won't be satisfied in a relationship where they're expected to spend all of their excess energies helping you. Capricorns expect their partners to be self-reliant and to get the help they need when they are truly in trouble so that it doesn't begin to affect the relationship. Problems you won't want to unload on your partner: Depression, substance abuse issues, stress from family conflicts, workplace stress, mental health issues, risky behaviors, poor self-control, difficulties from previous relationships, etc."
