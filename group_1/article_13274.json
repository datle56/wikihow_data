      "title": "Keep a journal.",
      "content": "Keep a journal. One reason it can be hard to stop thinking about something is because we keep trying to force those thoughts out of our minds. Unfortunately, this can often emphasize them even more, and bring in unhelpful feelings like guilt or shame (\"Why can't I stop thinking about this?\"). Keep a mental health journal to give yourself space to explore your feelings and thoughts, even the ones that cause you sadness or anxiety. [1] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Keeping a journal allows you to acknowledge your thoughts and feelings and give them space to just exist. Write an entry any time you feel overwhelmed by things that you don't want to think about. Get the thoughts down on paper, then shut the book and go and do something else. Try to think about when these things you don't want to think about first began. Did something happen to trigger them? What experiences surround them? Does thinking about them interfere with your ability to live your daily life? Journaling may improve your mental stability by relieving symptoms of anxiety and depression. Writing your thoughts down in your journal can also offer insights on patterns of upsetting thoughts and help you understand potential triggers. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Journaling about unwanted thoughts can bring up repressed memories. If you have experienced a great deal of abuse or a difficult childhood, journal only with the help of your therapist."

      "content": "Break the rumination cycle. Ruminating refers to mulling an issue over and over in your mind. Typically, this involves a negative thought or worry. If you feel the need to distract yourself from your thoughts, you may be ruminating. It's important to overcome this habit because rumination is closely linked to major depression. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Here are just a few ways you can jump off the rumination train: Find other sources of self-esteem. You may be thinking about a perceived flaw constantly because you see it as being a huge part of your self-concept and identity. Beyond the one flaw, highlight other areas in which you have talents and strengths. That way, any single criticism (from others or yourself) won't cause you so much distress. Problem-solve bit by bit. If you find yourself ruminating on an issue, make strides to resolve it. This may seem overwhelming at first but if you break the larger problem down into smaller pieces, you can work towards figuring out one piece at a time. Then, the problem won't seem so daunting. Let go of extreme expectations and standards. Some people expect 100% perfection or effort from themselves or others at all times. These are unreasonable and unattainable expectations that keep you from adapting to the challenges of life. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If you are one of these people, you might begin to feel low or upset when your standards are not met. Retrain yourself to have feasible expectations of both yourself and others. Remember, everyone is only human - and humans can't be perfect."

      "content": "Engage in mindful meditation . [5] X Research source Mindfulness means being aware of the present moment.This is the practice of being present in the here and now. The idea is to slow down your thoughts and become aware of constant thoughts that keep popping into your mind. If you are a beginner, choose a spot that is quiet with little distractions. Sit comfortably, whether on a chair or on a floor cushion. Cross your legs (if on the floor). Straighten your upper body and place your hands on your thighs. Take a deep, cleansing breath, pulling in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on your breath - only on your breath. When you find your attention straying from your breath, just note that and return to your breath and stay there. For starters, aim for approximately five or ten minutes of mindful meditation before building up to longer periods. Some types of mindfulness meditation encourage you to focus only on your breath while others acknowledge each thought that comes into your mind.

      "content": "Continue mindfulness practices in all your activities. A wonderful way to stay in the moment and avoid getting lost in negative thoughts is to practice mindfulness routinely. This can be very effective for minimizing rumination and easing your mind of troublesome worries or concerns. When you wake up in the morning, take a deep, calming breath. Do some light stretching and think about how each stretch feels to your body's muscles and joints. Drink a glass of water and notice the temperature, the consistency and how it feels going down your throat. Stay present in each activity that you take part in throughout the day: showering, brushing your teeth, eating, driving, working, etc.. As you go throughout each activity, refrain from casting judgments about what you're doing or letting your mind wander. When you notice your mind wandering, return to the activity at hand and consider how the activity affects each of your senses."

Being creative can maximize your well-being and give you positive feelings about what you're doing with your time.

Preparing a meal can bring about feelings of accomplishment and build your confidence. What's more, you can share what you make with others to spread these good feelings around. One precaution to consider when it comes to cooking or baking is to not let this activity become an unhealthy behavior in which you overeat to soothe an uncomfortable mood or distract yourself from upsetting thoughts. Include others in your cooking sessions to minimize the opportunity to eat emotionally - and to help you clear the dishes after. [8] X Research source file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/Eating.pdf"

      "content": "Try a puzzle. Puzzles are frequently used in educational therapy because they require focus, patience, and creativity. They can help with distraction, unorganized thinking, and trouble with motivation. For this reason, they also work as a good temporary distraction, because you have to concentrate on solving the puzzle. [9] X Research source Find puzzles that you enjoy and will hold your attention. Crossword puzzles and Sudoku are very common puzzles that are easy to find almost anywhere. You could also try a jigsaw puzzle, if you enjoy putting things together.

      "content": "Watch TV or a DVD or look at memes. Humor is good for distracting yourself from negative thoughts or memories. Looking at a meme account with a long history is also a great way to keep yourself chuckling and in good spirits. Head to Instagram and search for \"#meme\" until you find an account that has a style of humor that you enjoy. Beware that watching TV in excess is a sedentary behavior which can be linked to a shorter lifespan and obesity. [10] X Research source Avoid snacking while watching TV as this can lead to mindless eating, and may only make you feel worse. Try balancing your TV time with physical activity such as watching while walking on a treadmill or an elliptical. If you do not have access to such equipment, you can simply perform a series of exercises during commercials or about every 15 to 20 minutes."

Research has also shown that it's helpful to reduce stress and promote relaxation. [11] X Research source Music with about 60 beats per minute can encourage your brainwaves to synchronize with that beat, resulting in a relaxed state. While popular conceptions suggest that only \"soft\" music, such as classical, jazz, or New Age, are relaxing, new research suggests otherwise. A recent study showed that listening to \"extreme metal music\" helped participants process feelings of anger and return to feeling positive and even inspired.

You can even give your friend/relative a heads up that you are calling to get your mind off a specific topic - that way they don't inadvertently bring it up. If your friends, parents, siblings, or other loved ones live nearby, set up a date to hang out with one another. Go on an outing together. See a movie, go bowling, go swimming, or participate in a shared hobby. Not only will spending time with others make you happy, it can also prolong your life. Scientists are now comparing loneliness to the equivalent of using tobacco - it can be detrimental to both mental and physical health."
