Cinnamon and turmeric have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Keep in mind turmeric can tinge your skin an orange color so you may want to try the paste on the inside of your wrist or behind your ear before you use it on your face."

      "title": "Use lemon juice on the pimple.",
      "content": "Use lemon juice on the pimple. Lemon juice is a good natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. Try to use fresh lemon juice for this method. [7] X Research source Put one to two drops of lemon juice on a cotton swab and dab it on the pimple. Keep it on for five minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. Repeat this method three to four times a day with a fresh cotton swab. Lemon juice is slightly acidic so it may sting a little when you apply it to the pimple. It also has bleaching qualities so make sure you do not go out in the sun right after you have used the lemon juice. The bleaching effect could make the pimple lighter, leading to a spot on your skin that is lighter than your skin tone."

      "title": "Try applying aloe vera.",
      "content": "Try applying aloe vera . Aloe vera is an herb that has been traditionally used to promote healing and to soothe inflamed or irritated skin.

You can also find packaged aloe vera at your local health food store or online. Dip a clean cotton swab into the aloe vera gel. Then, apply it directly to the pimple and let it dry. Rinse the area off with warm water. Repeat applications of 100% aloe twice daily. If you are using an aloe vera leaf, you can store it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.

[8] X Research source Put one to two drops of the eye drop solution on a cotton swab and apply it to your pimple. Keep in mind this method won’t last long, usually no more than an hour, so it may be better to use it just before or during your special event."

      "title": "Use aspirin paste.",
      "content": "Use aspirin paste. Aspirin contains salicylic acid, which can help to reduce inflammation and redness on your skin.

      "content": "Try a spot treatment that contains salicylic acid . You can also use an over-the-counter spot treatment product that contains salicylic acid on the pimple to reduce redness. Salicylic acid can be found in the form of a gel or a lotion. You can then apply a small amount of the gel or lotion directly to the pimple. Let it dry overnight. [10] X Research source Look for salicylic acid products that contain .05 to 1 percent salicylic acid with a pH of three to four. Use 2 percent for salicylic acid for stubborn acne. You may also find salicylic acid in cleansers, but the acid works best if it is given time to dry and set in your skin so the cleanser may not be as effective as a toner, gel, or lotion. You can find spot treatments with salicylic acid at your local drugstore or in the beauty aisle. Many major brands use salicylic acid in their spot treatment products. You can also use a product containing benzoyl peroxide , if you'd like. However, it's best to only use one treatment at a time, so don't use benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid together.

      "content": "Cover up the pimple with makeup. If none of the natural or professional products work on your pimple, you may need to use makeup to hide it. You can use makeup concealer over the pimple so it is less noticeable. [12] X Research source Apply foundation and/or tinted moisturizer to your face. Then, apply a skincare serum or face moisturizer to the pimple. This will give the area around the pimple more moisture and calm down the red skin. Take your concealer and draw a small X over the pimple. You may use the wand if your concealer comes with a wand or use a small makeup brush to apply the concealer. Draw a circle around the X. Using a clean fingertip, lightly tap the concealer into your skin. Dab, rather than rub, the concealer around and over the pimple. You should then apply foundation with a brush to set the concealer. This will ensure the concealer stays over the pimple."
