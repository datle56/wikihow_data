      "content": "Halibut and flounder taste similar, but flounder is more delicate. Halibut has a dense, firm texture that’s ideal for baking , grilling , searing, and steaming. [1] X Research source Flounder has thinner, fattier filets than halibut, so it doesn’t hold up on the grill. Instead, it’s best served poached, sautéd, or steamed. [2] X Research source Halibut cheeks are meaty cuts near the lower eye, and seafood lovers claim they have a sweet, luxurious flavor, similar to scallops. Flounder has a mild, sweet taste, similar to branzino. It’s extremely versatile and forgiving, so you don’t have to be too worried when cooking it. [3] X Research source Halibut becomes mushy when overcooked, so take it off the heat when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius)."

      "content": "Halibut is slightly cheaper per pound than flounder. Although fish prices fluctuate with supply, the average retail price for flounder filets ranges from $8-12 per pound ($17.64-26.46 per kg). [6] X Research source Halibut, however, can be found between $7-9 per pound ($15.43-19.84 per kg). [7] X Research source If you can’t find fresh halibut or flounder, purchase frozen filets instead. Frozen fish is often cheaper than fresh fish, and there’s no difference in taste or nutritional value between the two. [8] X Research source Fresh filets often remain in your grocery store for over a week, while the fish you find in the freezer aisle is frozen right after it’s caught."

[9] X Research source Flounder, on the other hand, ranges from 1 lb (0.5 kg) to 3 lbs (1.4 kg), with the largest varieties weighing up to 17 lbs (7.7 kg).

      "content": "Halibut have pointed bodies, while flounder have a rounder shape. Unlike other flatfish, halibut have forked, crescent-shaped tails, and a wide, diamond-shaped body. They have small scales buried in the skin, giving them a smooth, glossy texture. [13] X Research source Since flounder are shorter in length than halibut, they appear more round and oval-like. Their skin is also quite thick, so it’s usually skinned before cooking . [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Halibut are right-eyed, while most flounder are left-eyed. All flatfish have both eyes on one side of their head, allowing them to see when they’re buried on the seafloor. However, left-eyed halibut are extremely rare: only 1 in 20,000 halibut have eyes on the left side of their head. [15] X Research source Halibut and flounder are born like normal fish, but they flatten a few days after hatching. During this process, their eyes shift to one side, where they remain close together for the rest of their lives. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Both halibut and flounder can change color to match their habitat. Halibut and flounder are typically mottled gray, olive, brown, or black, but they have pigment-packed chromatophore cells that allow them to change color instantly. [17] X Research source When they swim near the surface to feed, their skin becomes almost translucent in color, helping them avoid predators below, but they become more spotted and textured as they return to the ocean floor. [18] X Research source The underbelly or “blind side” of both species is a white or dusky color, much lighter than the eyed side."

Summer flounder (also known as fluke) live in coastal waters, from eastern Florida to Nova Scotia, but they’re mainly found in the mid-Atlantic region near Cape Cod and the Carolinas. [22] X Research source Flounder live in a wide range of waters from shallow estuaries to depths of over 500 ft (150 m). [23] X Research source They prefer living in temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius), but winter flounder can survive icy conditions of 28.4 degrees Fahrenheit (-2 degrees Celsius)–the freezing point of seawater.

[26] X Research source Summer flounder is also known as fluke, and they’re the most important commercial flatfish on the east coast. [27] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Male and female halibut live up to 55 years old, but flounder have much shorter lifespans. Female southern flounders live up to 7 years old, while males rarely live past 3 years old.

While the Pacific halibut has small, smooth scales, the arrowtooth flounder has coarse scales and sharper teeth."
