      "content": "Open a pistachio from the crack. If there is already a crack in the nutshell, then your job will be much easier. First, squeeze the two half-shells to widen the crack until it won't get any bigger. Then, peel the pistachio open from the crack. Wedge your thumbnails into the crack and pull them apart in opposite directions. Use your forefingers to brace the nut so that you can apply more force to the shell. Try using an already-opened shell half to pry open a new pistachio. The shells are sturdy enough that you can use them to open one other. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Crack an un-cracked pistachio.",
      "content": "Crack an un-cracked pistachio. The pistachio is more difficult to open if the crack is very small, or if there is no crack at all. Place the pistachio on a clean, sturdy surface like a plate, a counter-top, or a cutting board. Then, gently tap the nut with a hammer or another heavy object until a crack forms in the shell. Finally, use your thumbnails to pull the shell all the way open. Use a nutcracker, if you have one. The nutcracker is a tool specifically designed to open up thick nutshells. Place the pistachio between the two arms of the nutcracker, then squeeze the two arms shut to crack the nut."

      "title": "Consider buying pre-shelled pistachios.",
      "content": "Consider buying pre-shelled pistachios. You can buy the nuts already opened, if you like, which makes them somewhat easier to eat. However, be aware that pistachios sold in the shell are typically less expensive. They may also be more likely to be organic. Studies have shown that eating pistachios in the shell slows down the eating process and lowers overall consumption. Pistachio nuts contain three to four calories each—fewer than almost any another nut—but it can be easy to eat a lot of them when they come pre-shelled. Consider keeping pistachios a \"slow\" snack by de-shelling them yourself. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Suck on the pistachio shell.",
      "content": "Suck on the pistachio shell. This step is optional, but many pistachio eaters love to absorb the salty exterior of the nut shell before they crack open the meat within. Put the whole pistachio into your mouth, and let your mouth absorb the salt. Remove from your mouth once the taste subsides. You can also suck on the shells after you have separated them from the nut. This way, you can simply spit out the shell out into the garbage once you've finished sucking it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat the nut.",
      "content": "Eat the nut. Once you've removed the shell, the pistachio is ready to consume. You can eat the pistachio raw, or you can add it to a larger dish. The pistachio nut is relatively soft and oblong. The color should be some combination of green, brown, and purple. Do not worry if the nut skin appears blotchy and mottled – this is normal!."

      "title": "Discard the shells in a separate bowl.",
      "content": "Discard the shells in a separate bowl. Once you have shelled each pistachio, eat the nut and place the nutshell into a discard pile. This might be your hand, or a cup holder, or a separate bowl. If you scatter the shells back in with the unopened pistachios, they will get in the way when you try to eat more of the nuts."

      "title": "Use pistachios in trail mix.",
      "content": "Use pistachios in trail mix. These nuts are small and low-calorie, but they are rich with flavor and nutrients. A handful of pistachios can help ward off hunger pangs, which might come in handy during prolonged activity. Furthermore, the nut is a great source of protein and fiber."

      "title": "Replace fattier nuts.",
      "content": "Replace fattier nuts. Pistachios are packed with nutritional value, but they contain many fewer calories than fat-rich nuts like walnuts and macadamias. Try incorporating more pistachios into your diet if you are trying to lose weight, or if you're just trying be more mindful about your nut consumption. One pistachio contains 3-4 calories, on average. Some dietitians suggest a daily portion of 30 grams, or about 49 pistachios – which translates to roughly160 calories. In comparison, an equivalent portion of walnuts contains 190 calories, and the same portion of macadamia nuts contains 200 calories."

      "content": "Grind pistachios into nut-meal. Use a blender, a mortar and pestle, or any food-grade grinder. You can mix the nut powder into smoothies, sprinkle it into your cereal, and even use it as a baking ingredient. If you are blending the pistachios into a smoothie anyway, you can leave them whole and add them directly to the mix."
