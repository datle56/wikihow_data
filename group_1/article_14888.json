      "title": "Infuse ½ of a sliced lemon into every 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of filtered water.",
      "content": "Infuse ½ of a sliced lemon into every 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of filtered water. Slice the lemon thinly and then place it in a cup or pitcher. Pour filtered water over the slices to begin infusing the fresh lemon into the water immediately. It should take 5-10 minutes for the first hint of lemons to infuse into the water. Taste the water as it diffuses, and remove the lemons from the water when you’ve reached your desired taste. [1] X Research source For a subtle lemon infusion, remove the lemons after only 5 minutes. For a more intense lemon flavor, leave the lemons in warm water for 30-45 minutes or 2-3 hours in cold water."

      "content": "Drink lemon water in the morning to rehydrate. Your body can become dehydrated overnight due to a loss of water. Have a glass or mug of lemon water first thing when you wake up to reap positive benefits, like increased energy in the morning. Lemon juice also contains important nutrients like potassium, which is an electrolyte that can prevent muscle cramping during physical activity. [3] X Research source In addition to preventing cramping, potassium, which is found in many citrus fruits, also helps to maintain the body's fluid balance, leading to better hydration throughout the day. You can also use this time in the morning to relax and plan for your day."
