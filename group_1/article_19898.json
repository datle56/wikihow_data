      "content": "If it is an oily stain, avoid using water. If the stain is oily, avoid the obvious temptation to rinse it under cold water straight away. Oil repels water, so any water than comes into contact with the stain could contribute to it setting more strongly. [1] X Research source Instead, dab it with a dry paper towel. Oily stains have a variety of sources, but most commonly include: Grease stains. Mascara. Lipstick. Foods which are rich in oil or butter."

If the stains comes from a non-oily source, then usually the first thing to do is dab off any excess and then rinse it in cold water. If you hold the garment under the tap so that the water is hitting the back of stain, it can help to flush out the stain from behind. [2] X Research source Holding the stained side facing the flow of water could press the stain further into the fabric. Typical non-oily stains on white clothes can include: Sweat stains . Non-oil based makeup. Foods that aren’t oily. Blood . Toothpaste . Dirt."

      "content": "Obtain hydrogen peroxide and dishwashing liquid. There are any number of possible homemade stain removers, but one particularly effective and simple one requires just hydrogen peroxide and dishwashing liquid. [3] X Research source The recipe is easy, just pour two parts low-strength (3/4%) hydrogen peroxide and one part dishwashing liquid into a bucket. These parts will be quite small, but will depend on how much of the cleaner you want to make. You can try this for oily and greasy stains, as well as normal dirt and food stains. This homemade cleaner can work on cotton, canvas and other clothing fabrics. It is not recommended to use it on silk or wool."

      "content": "Do a spot test. With all stain removers, but especially homemade ones using chemicals, it is recommended that you do a spot test before applying a lot of the stain remover to your fabric. A spot test just means testing out a very small amount of your mixture on a discreet part of the fabric. You are checking to be sure that the stain remover does not discolor or damage the material. This mixture should be safe for all colors, but do a spot test to check before proceeding."

      "content": "Spray the cleaner directly onto the stain. Fasten the lid of the spray bottle securely, and test it once by spraying it into the sink. Once you are happy with it, spray the solution directly onto the offending stain or stains. Apply it liberally to the stain and leave to it soak for a few minutes or longer, depending on how patient you are. Rinse it off with cold water. If necessary, repeat this for harder stains."

      "content": "Consider soaking it for larger or stubborn stains. If you have larger stains that wouldn’t be tackled best with a spray bottle, you can modify this method to suit your needs. A diluted version of this cleaner is great for soaking a larger garment in. Simply add the same ratio of hydrogen peroxide and dishwashing liquid to a bucket of hot water. Place your clothes in the liquid and leave it to soak. Rinse it off, and repeat if necessary. You may find gently rubbing the affected area while it is submerged will help loosen the stain."

Baking soda is one of the classics of stain removal. It is well-known as something to grab if there is a spill. Just make a quick paste with some water, gently apply to the stain and let it sink in.

      "content": "Use white wine. One of the worst things to spill all over your white clothes is red wine , but, perhaps surprisingly, a good remedy for this is to spill more wine on yourself.

[7] X Research source Dab at the edges of the stain gently with some kitchen towel to prevent it spreading. [8] X Research source This won’t make the stain disappear, but can help it come out in a normal wash subsequently."

[9] X Research source Dust off any excess chalk before putting the garment in the wash. Only wash it in cold water, and don’t put it in the dryer as this can cause the oil to set.

Hydrogen peroxide is a commonly used example of an oxidizing bleach which is often used to tackle stains. Chlorine bleaches are much stronger, more toxic, and should be used with care. [11] X Research source Chlorine bleaches will damage colour on fabrics, but for white fabrics that is less of a problem. If you use bleach regularly in your machine washes you may find some yellowish marks appear on white clothes. [12] X Research source"
