Choose a few toys that move around or have rolling balls so your cat has something to chase and keep them distracted. Since your cat will have more physical and mental stimulation, they’re going to give you some more space when you’re home. [11] X Research source Rotate out old cat toys and swap them in with new ones so your cat doesn’t get bored of playing with the same thing every day. If you don’t want to spend money on toys, you can try using crumpled balls of paper or toilet paper tubes as simple toys. Try giving your cat toys with catnip so they’re more likely to play with them. You could even spray their toys with a catnip spray to make them more enticing."
