      "content": "Get yourself an exercise mat. Yoga mats aren't just for toting around and looking hip! They actually provide some protection for your bones and joints during floor exercises, and the foam surface provides grip, making it easier to hold poses, and preventing you from injuring yourself or pulling a muscle.

      "content": "Find a space. To do Pilates mat exercises, you need a large open space and a flat surface. A living room or bedroom will work if you can move some lighter furniture around. Make sure you have enough room to: Lie down on your back and extend your arms and legs out 90 degrees to the sides. Stand up and stretch your arms to the ceiling without touching the ceiling. Lie down on your back in the same position (legs stretched out toward one wall and arms stretched out toward the other)."

      "content": "Learn the proper breathing technique. A major part of Pilates is learning the controlled breathing, which helps you concentrate, oxygenates the blood, and helps you coordinate your movements. Proper breathing should be practiced throughout the entire workout. To breathe properly for Pilates: [2] X Research source Lie flat on your back with your neck long and relaxed. Place one hand on your ribs and one on your lower abs. Inhale deeply through your nose, pushing air into your abdominals and filling your ribcage. Exhale through the mouth and push the air out by contracting your abdominal muscles. Continue inhaling and exhaling in this way."

[3] X Research source Not only will you get a better workout by focusing on these things, but you'll also prevent injuries. Always keep your core engaged during your Pilates workout."
