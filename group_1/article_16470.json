      "content": "Build your self esteem . A lot of the time, people can love us with all their hearts and we will still feel unloved. Usually, this is because we have a hard time believing that someone else could love us because we can't love ourselves. If you feel unloved by others, the best place to start is to learn to love yourself first. Build your opinion of yourself by celebrating your positives and embracing your negatives. Stop holding yourself to an ideal of perfection and realize that you are fine just the way you are. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Build your self confidence . Self confidence is an extremely attractive quality in a person. When people see that you think you can take on the world and win, they begin to believe it too (and they love it!). Build your self confidence by taking on challenges in your life, speaking up for yourself, and doing things that make you proud of who you are. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand what love looks like . Make sure you know what love really looks like. Sometimes, really horrible people in our lives will convince us that love looks different than it actually does. Don't let them get you confused: love should never hurt, love shouldn't feel one-sided, and love shouldn't feel conditional. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look at how they act.",
      "content": "Look at how they act. Look at how the person or people that you love act. Do they say mean things to you? Do they physically hurt you? Do they blow you off when you really need them? Do they ignore you when you tell them how you feel? These are bad signs. If, however, they maybe don't say it but they do show it by being there for you, trying to avid hurting you, and never giving you reason to think they think less of you, they probably love you but are just bad at showing it. [6] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 544 wikiHow readers what makes them feel unloved, and 54% of them agreed that they never feel like they’re good enough for their partner. [Take Poll] Your partner should never make you feel like you’re unworthy of their love. Look for someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are."

      "content": "Look at how you act. Are you carrying all the weight in a friendship or relationship? Do you do way more for them than they do for you? Do you shower them in kindness and you're just met with empty thank yous and no reciprocation? These are bad signs. If, however, you feel like you get out as much as you put in, things are probably okay."

      "content": "Be open about your feelings. This is hard, but this is the best way to stop the feeling of being unloved. Tell the people in your life that you love how you feel. Tell them that you're having problems. And when they say that they love you, take them at their word. Give them the opportunity to show it. Stop shutting them down or second-guessing their feelings. They probably do really love you."

      "content": "Opening yourself to new love. You might not feel loved if you have a very specific idea of what love looks like or where it comes from. Take a look at how you define love and think about maybe redefining it. Love doesn't have to come from a romantic relationship, and it doesn't have to include expensive gifts, cards on birthdays, or meeting some list of required qualities. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Date someone new. If you really think a romantic relationship is what's best for you, you can try dating someone new if you're ready (emotionally) to be with another person. Just remember: you should never enter a relationship expecting that the other person will make all of your problems go away or think that you can't be happy unless you're in a relationship. These are not healthy ideas. If, however, you're ready for the hurdles of being with someone else, you can get a boyfriend or get a girlfriend ."
