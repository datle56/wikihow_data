      "content": "Hold a heavy-gauge metal nail file in your dominant hand. Invest in a metal nail file, which is sturdier than an emery board. Hold the file, and have your dog sit or lie down or stand and, if necessary, gently drape your upper body over your dog to keep it still. [1] X Research source You can purchase a metal nail file at a pet store or pharmacy; you don’t need to use one specifically labeled for pets. Coarse emery boards work in a pinch, but they’ll wear out quickly, especially if you have a larger breed. Filing a dog’s nails manually is time consuming if you’re doing it as an alternative to using clippers. If you do clip your dog’s nails, you can use a file to smooth over rough edges after clipping."

Spread the toes and, if it has a long coat, carefully hold back fur so you can access the nails.

      "content": "File the tip of a nail until it's even with your dog's paw pads while it is standing. Let your dog know that it’s doing a great job as you begin to rub the tip of a nail with the file. Make about 10 to 15 passes in the same direction to file the nail bit by bit. Periodically, put down the file and give your dog a treat to help keep it calm. [3] X Research source Aim to file a nail until it’s even with your dog’s paw pads while your dog is standing on the ground. At a proper length, you shouldn’t be able to hear the nails tapping when your dog walks. You should also be able to slide a piece of paper between your dogs claws and the ground while your dog is standing. It's unlikely you'll hit the quick with a manual file, but you should still stop filing when you reach the nail's curve or see a grayish oval in the filed surface."

      "content": "Work on 1 or 2 nails per filing session. It’ll most likely take multiple sessions to finish 1 paw, especially if you’re using a file as an alternative to clipping. File a couple of nails at a time, and be sure to give your dog a break if it gets too stressed. Dogs usually tolerate filing better than clippers and grinders, so it could become part of your bonding routine. Hold your dog and file a few nails during your cuddle sessions. File your dog's nails regularly to keep them short; the process will take longer if you let the nails grow too long."

      "content": "Train your dog to be comfortable with the grinder’s sound. Offer treats as you let your dog see and sniff the grinder. Then turn it on, offer reassurance, and give your dog a steady stream of treats while the grinder buzzes. Turn off the grinder after 10 or 15 seconds, and stop giving your dog treats. [4] X Research source Offering treats while the grinder buzzes teaches your dog to associate the sound with rewards. As you practice, keep the grinder turned on for gradually longer periods of time. When your dog consistently remains calm with the grinder turned on, try holding the tool near its paw. Remember to give it treats while the grinder is buzzing. You can find nail grinders online and at pet stores. Small, battery-powered grinders make less noise than heavy duty tools and may be more tolerable for your dog."

Don’t press hard, and hold the tool to the nail for just a couple of seconds. The vibration will probably spook your dog, so offer reassurance and be sure to have treats handy. [6] X Research source Bit by bit, pass the grinder over the nail in the same direction until it’s flush with your dog’s paw pads. They should be short enough so that you don’t hear clicking when your dog walks. Depending on the grinder's power and the nail's length, it'll take at least 2 or 3 passes. If possible, have a helper offer treats while you grind your pup’s nails. Gradually file layers off of the tip, and don’t grind past where the nail begins to curve."

      "content": "Make sure the grinder doesn’t overheat due to friction. Lightly holding the grinder to the nail for 2 to 3 seconds at a time helps prevent it from overheating. Still, you should test it periodically to make sure it’s cool to the touch. Turn it off, let tip stop spinning, then touch it quickly to the back of your hand. If it feels hot, stop filing your dog’s nails and let the grinder cool. Check your dog’s nail, and hold a cool, damp cloth over it if it feels hot."

It’s harder to hit the quick with a grinder, but you still need to use caution. If your dog has light nails, stop grinding before you reach the pink, opaque area at the base of the nail. You can’t see the quick if your dog has black nails, so stop trimming when you see a grayish oval in the cut surface. The quick is a network of blood vessels and nerves at the base of the nail. Regularly trimming your dog’s nails will cause the quick to recede and make nail care easier. If you do cut the quick , don’t panic. Offer your dog reassurance and hold gauze, styptic powder, or cornstarch over the wound for at least 2 minutes to stop the bleeding.

      "content": "Try to grind your dog's paws weekly. Grinding is faster than manually filing, but it’s still more time consuming than using clippers. Additionally, your dog may only tolerate the sound and vibrations it makes in short intervals. Grind 1 or 2 nails per session, and try to finish off 1 paw per week. Filing your dog’s nails regularly will help keep them short. If you let the nails grow out, grinding will be more tedious."

Grasp your dog’s paws, toes, and nails before introducing it to nail trimmers. Hold its paws, carefully separate the toes, massage its paw pads, and gently squeeze the nails. As you do so, offer treats and lots of praise so your dog learns that good things happen when you touch its paws.

It’s wise to practice when your dog is tired out after a brisk walk or playtime. [11] X Research source At any point in training, take a break if your pooch gets stressed. Signs that your dog needs space include yawning, heavy panting, growling, yelping, and barking. Additionally, watch out for side eye glances; if your dog is calm, you should only see a bit of the whites of its eyes. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Restrain your dog gently if it doesn’t sit still. If your dog has a calm disposition, you may be able to teach it to sit or lie down while you trim its nails. If you have a small breed, you might be able to hold it in your lap while you trim its nails. For a squirmy dog or large breed, drape your arms and upper body over your pet just firmly enough to prevent it from wiggling. Hold the trimmer in your dominant hand and your dog’s paw in the other hand. Use your upper body and elbows to keep your dog still as you trim. While restraining your dog may be necessary, do your best to use treats and praise to create a positive association with nail trimming. Handling your dog roughly or restraining it without offering treats and praise will teach it to fear trimming. It’s wise to have someone who your dog knows well assist you, especially when you first begin trimming your dog’s nails."
