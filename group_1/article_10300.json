      "title": "Set the apple on a cutting board with the stem side up.",
      "content": "Set the apple on a cutting board with the stem side up. Keep the cutting board on a flat, stable surface. Make sure it can't slide around while you're coring the apple. Since you're going to be using a knife, it's easy to slip and nick your fingers if you're not careful. Try putting something underneath the cutting board to help hold it in place. [1] X Research source A damp towel or paper towel works well in a pinch when dealing with wobbly cutting boards. There are also non-stick cutting board mats you can get online and at kitchen supply stores."

      "title": "Poke the tip of a paring knife into the top of the apple.",
      "content": "Poke the tip of a paring knife into the top of the apple. While holding the apple steady, push the knife into it about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) away from its stem. You are aiming for the spot where the core ends. Cutting any closer to the stem could puncture the core and leave you with more of a mess to clean up later. If you don't have a paring knife handy, another thin blade will do. Choose the thinnest one you have in order to limit damage to the apple's flesh while you go after the core."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the blade all the way through the apple.",
      "content": "Push the blade all the way through the apple. Hold the knife steady as you push it straight down so it doesn't cut into the core. Watch out for the sharp tip of the knife coming through the bottom's end! Tip the apple over on its side for a moment so you are able to see where the knife emerges. [2] X Research source Coring is easiest with a knife that is longer than the apple. That way, you can remove the entire core in one go. If you don't have a knife like that, stick with a paring knife and scrape away any parts of the core left behind after the initial cut."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut all the way around the core to separate it from the apple.",
      "content": "Cut all the way around the core to separate it from the apple. Hold the apple steady and carefully cut in a circle without slicing into the core. Keep the blade 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from the stem the entire time. This can be a little tricky to do at first, but it becomes much easier with practice. It leaves the core loose inside the apple, making it easy to remove by hand. If you're having trouble keeping the cut consistent all the way around the stem, try making more incisions. Place the knife on another side of the stem and push it all the way through the bottom again. Do this 4 times on all sides of the stem, then cut in a circle to connect the incisions."

    {
      "title": "Remove the knife and push out the core with your thumbs.",
      "content": "Remove the knife and push out the core with your thumbs. Raise the knife slowly so you don't lose control of it. Set it aside, then give the stem a good, hard push. The core will pop out through the bottom of the apple. If it is stuck, cut around the core again to separate it from the rest of the apple. Another option is to use the tip of the knife to pry the core up toward you. Once you are able to get a firm grip on it, pull it up to remove it. Knife control is important when doing this, so raise it with patience rather than yanking it toward you."

      "title": "Cut around the inside of the apple if you notice any seeds remaining.",
      "content": "Cut around the inside of the apple if you notice any seeds remaining. Sometimes these parts break off the core and get left behind. Put the knife back in the hole and scrape around the outside edge. Push the inedible bits out through the holes in the apple to throw them away. Once you're sure you got all of the black seeds and stringy bits of the core, you're ready to cook the apple. [3] X Research source You could also use a melon baller to scoop out the insides. Twist the melon baller around to clear out the cut, leaving it clean and consistent."

      "title": "Place the apple on a flat surface with the stem face up.",
      "content": "Place the apple on a flat surface with the stem face up. Set it up on something stable and damage-resistant like a cutting board. Coring tools are pretty sharp, so don't sacrifice your countertop for the sake of an apple core. Make sure you have plenty of room to hold the apple steady while coring it. [4] X Research source Test the cutting board or surface by attempting to move or shake it. If it seems unsteady, expect it to move at the worst time. Try putting a wet towel or a non-slip mat underneath a cutting board to steady it."

      "title": "Place the apple corer on the center of the apple.",
      "content": "Place the apple corer on the center of the apple. If you have a tube-shaped corer, position it so the apple's stem is in the middle of the tube. Push the corer down until it begins cutting into the apple. If you have a combination corer and peeler, position it 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from the core with the serrated edge facing inward. Push the tip down into the apple to begin separating its flesh from the core. [5] X Research source The easiest type of corer to use is one with a long handle and a circular tube with a serrated bottom edge. The tube fits over the core, holding it together while you pull it out. When using the vegetable peeler type of corer, you have to twist the blade around in a circle to cut out the core. The motion is the same as when using a tube-shaped corer, but it takes a little more work to rotate the corer by hand. You could also use a flat, ring-shaped corer. This type slices up the apple while removing the core. It's great for cutting an apple into wedges with one fell swoop."

    {
      "title": "Twist the corer as you push it toward the bottom of the apple.",
      "content": "Twist the corer as you push it toward the bottom of the apple. This takes a little bit of force, so keep a firm grip on both the apple and the handle of the corer. Rotate the corer back and forth while pushing down on it. As long as you keep the apple still, the corer will go straight down toward the opposite end of the core. [6] X Research source If you're using the blade-type corer, push it down into the apple and begin rotating it around the core. It will separate the core from the rest of the apple."

      "title": "Pull the corer out to remove the center membrane and seeds.",
      "content": "Pull the corer out to remove the center membrane and seeds. What happens next depends on what kind of corer you have. With many tube-shaped corers, all you have to do is pull the handle back to take the core out with it. For blade-like corers, lift the blade out and then push the core out with your fingers. [7] X Research source Check the inside of the apple for leftover seeds. Corers are better at cleaning out an apple than knives, but a loose seed or core fragment can fall out of the tool and get left behind."

      "content": "Set the apple on a stable cutting surface. Use a cutting board to prevent your countertop from getting damaged. Start by standing the apple up on the board with the stem face up. Make sure the cutting board can't move at all while you're working. [8] X Research source Stabilize the cutting board by placing a towel or mat underneath it if needed."

      "content": "Cut the apple in half to expose the core. Use a sharp knife to split the apple. Hold it steady and cut vertically through it to the bottom. Try to slice through the center in a single, clean motion. You will end up going straight through the core, but that is okay. [9] X Research source If you wish to quarter the apple, you could turn the halves over onto their cut sides. Slice them top to bottom down the middle. Whether you do this before or after removing the core doesn't make much of a difference."

      "title": "Scoop out the core using a spoon or melon baller.",
      "content": "Scoop out the core using a spoon or melon baller. Keep the apple halves flat against the cutting board with the skin side down. This will give you a clear view of the seeds and the fibrous sheaths in the center of each slice. They are pretty easy to remove by digging into the apple's flesh right where it meets the hard, stringy core. Clean out both halves to leave the juicy part of the apple intact. If you quartered the apples, an alternative way to remove the core is by cutting underneath it. Use a paring knife to cut diagonally down to the center point underneath the core. Turn the apple slice around and cut from the other side to cleanly lift away the core."

      "title": "Slice away the stem and bud on each half with a paring knife.",
      "content": "Slice away the stem and bud on each half with a paring knife. Keep the apple halves skin side down on the cutting board. The stem and bud are on the ends of each half, right above the removed center. Hold your knife parallel to these parts and cut diagonally down underneath them. Slice diagonally down from the opposite side to complete the cut and remove the inedible parts. [10] X Research source There are pieces of the stem and bud on both halves, so remember to get them all. You will need to make a total of 4 cuts on each half, 2 apiece for each stem and bud. Another way to do this is by scooping out the stem and bud with a melon baller or spoon. It is less precise than cutting, so it takes away more of the juicy flesh."

      "title": "Peel",
      "content": "Peel the apple using a paring knife or vegetable peeler. If you have a good vegetable peeler handy, use it for an easy way to remove the apple's skin. Drag it from the top of the apple to the bottom to remove a layer of skin. After setting aside the peel, rotate the apple and use the peeler again and again to expose the juicy flesh. [11] X Research source If you're using a knife, slip the tip of the blade underneath the skin. Peel from side to side across the apple, moving slowly to keep the blade as close to the skin as possible. Although using a knife gets easier with practice, you could slip and cut into the good part of the apple if you're not careful."

      "title": "Set the apple down on a flat surface with the stem side up.",
      "content": "Set the apple down on a flat surface with the stem side up. Stand the apple on a safe, stable cutting board. Make sure the board won't slide out of place while you attempt to cut the apple. As long as the board is secure, cutting the stem out is a quick and safe process. [12] X Research source For your own safety and the sake of the apple, slip a damp towel or non-stick mat underneath a cutting board to prevent it from moving while you work."

      "title": "Slice across the apple to separate part of it from the stem.",
      "content": "Slice across the apple to separate part of it from the stem. Pick up a sharp chef's knife and position it about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem. Hold onto the apple with your other hand to stop it from moving. When you're ready, slice straight down, all the way to the bottom of the apple. This will separate part of the apple, leaving the core untouched and standing on your cutting board. Cut as close to the stem as you can to save the edible portions of the apple. If you cut too close to the stem, you might end up taking out some of the core. Cut the hard, stringy core chunks off the apple slices before using them."

      "title": "Turn the apple and cut away the other sides to remove the core.",
      "content": "Turn the apple and cut away the other sides to remove the core. Rotate the apple so an uncut side faces you. Cut across it again and then all the way down to the bottom. Keep the knife 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem at all times so all the cut parts are even. When you're done, you will have 4 apple chunks that are clean and easy to slice up into whatever size you need. For example, lay the portions flat on the cutting board and cut them from top to bottom to create slices. Cut the slices from side to side to create smaller apple chunks."
