      "content": "Heat a beaker and Petri dishes in a 350 °F (177 °C) oven for 2 to 3 hours. To sterilize your equipment, cover the top of a 1,000 ml (34 fl oz) laboratory beaker with foil. You'll also need to put foil over 6 to 10 glass Petri dishes. Put all of your equipment into a cold oven and then turn it on to 350 °F (177 °C). Heat the equipment for 2 to 3 hours and let them cool completely before you continue to make the agar. [1] X Research source If you don't have Petri dishes, use glass baby food jars with the labels removed. Cover them with foil and sterilize them in the oven along with the beaker."

      "content": "Pour the medium ingredients into the beaker. Once the beaker is cool, set it on your work surface. To save time, use nutrient agar powder, which works for any type of experiment you're doing. Pour 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 ml) plus 1 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoons (22 ml) of distilled water into the beaker along with 2 1/2 teaspoons (4.6 g) of agar powder. If you want to make a homemade medium using pantry items, put these ingredients into the beaker instead: [2] X Research source 1 beef bouillon cube 2 teaspoons (8 g) of sugar 1 cup (240 ml) of distilled water 1 packet (2 1/2 teaspoons or 7 g) of unflavored gelatin"

      "content": "Bring the mixture to a boil on a hot plate for 1 minute. If you have a scientific hot plate, turn it to high and set the beaker on it. Wear heat-resistant gloves and very carefully swirl the beaker to combine the mixture. Boil it for 1 minute as you swirl the beaker. [3] X Research source If you don't have a hot plate, put the beaker into the microwave and heat it for 10-second increments until the mixture boils. Ensure that the agar powder or bouillon mixture dissolves completely."

      "content": "Cool the agar medium to 120 °F (49 °C). Turn off the heat and leave the agar medium to cool for a few minutes. Then, insert a thermometer to see if it's cooled to 120 °F (49 °C) before you pour it into the Petri dishes. [4] X Research source If you don't have a thermometer to check the temperature, wait about 10 to 15 minutes before using the medium."

Dip a clean cloth in isopropyl alcohol or a diluted bleach mixture and wipe it across your work surface to remove bacteria. To dilute bleach, mix 1 part bleach with 4 parts of water.

As soon as you've covered the bottom of the Petri dish with 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of medium, put the lid on to prevent contamination.
