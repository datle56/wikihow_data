      "title": "Look for an opportunity to get airborne.",
      "content": "Look for an opportunity to get airborne. In Mario Kart Wii, you can't do tricks just anywhere. For aerial tricks, first, you need to go off of a jump, a ramp, or anything else that will put you in the air. Most tracks have plenty of opportunities to get some airtime. The most obvious spots for doing tricks are often the boost ramps that glow with a rainbow color — any of these will give you a chance for a trick. Some tracks, like Coconut Mall, even force you to go off one of these. [1] X Research source However, even tiny bumps in the track that send you off of the ground for a second or so can give you a chance to do a trick, so be ready!"

      "title": "Shake the WiiMote as you leave the ground to do a trick.",
      "content": "Shake the WiiMote as you leave the ground to do a trick. As you go off of the ramp or jump, shake or flick the WiiMote in any direction. Do this with some force so that the controller registers your motion, but not so hard that you aren't ready to start steering as soon as you hit the ground. If you get the timing just right, you should do a trick! You will feel the controller rumble, hear an audio cue, and your racer will cheer. Each direction that you shake the WiiMote (up, down, left, or right) should make you perform a different trick. However, the boost you get from each will be the same."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep under control once you land.",
      "content": "Keep under control once you land. If you do a trick, when you make it to the ground safely (in other words, as long as you're not hit by a shell, etc.), you will get a quick, small boost of speed — sort of like a mini-mushroom. Be careful to control your steering when you get this boost. While the boost is great for passing the racers next to you, it can also make it a little harder to dodge obstacles since you'll have less time to react."
    },
    {
      "title": "String together many tricks to keep your speed up.",
      "content": "String together many tricks to keep your speed up. You can only perform one trick per jump , so you'll only get a max of one boost per jump. However, if you can do several jumps in a row and pull off a trick each time, you'll get a significant speed boost. Pulling off lots of tricks in a row without crashing or going off the course can be really tricky, so keep practicing! Once you master this skill, you'll have a big advantage over tough opponents."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go off of a ramp or jump.",
      "content": "Go off of a ramp or jump. The way that you do tricks on a non-WiiMote controller is a little different — some players even believe that it's easier. [2] X Research source To start, go off a jump (just as you would if you were using a WiiMote.)"

    {
      "title": "Use the directional pad as you enter the air.",
      "content": "Use the directional pad as you enter the air. The GameCube and Classic controllers don't have motion sensitivity, so instead of shaking them, you must hit one of the four directions on the D-pad to do a trick. The D-pad is the cross-shaped directional button on the left side of the controller — it is not the stick you use to steer. Note that the D-pad is in a different location on the Classic Controller than it is on the GameCube controller. On the Classic Controller, it is above the left stick used for steering, while on the GameCube controller, it is below it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick the landing.",
      "content": "Stick the landing. Once again, if you pull off the trick correctly, you will get an audio cue and your character will cheer. When you hit the ground safely, you will receive a short boost. As with the WiiMote, the different directions of the D-pad will cause you to perform different tricks. However, they all give the same amount of boost when you hit the ground."

      "title": "Pick a motorcycle before the race.",
      "content": "Pick a motorcycle before the race. In addition to the tricks you can pull in the air, you can also get a boost on the ground by pulling a wheelie. However, this option is only open to motorcycles — four-wheeled karts are not able to do wheelies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the controller up while at cruising speed.",
      "content": "Lift the controller up while at cruising speed. To perform a wheelie, first, start driving and build up a good amount of speed. When you come to a straight length of road, lift the controller up. The front wheel of your motorcycle should lift off of the ground. When you do a wheelie, you should notice that you immediately begin to go a little faster at your top sped. If you're using the steering wheel, be sure to keep it level while you lift it to avoid accidentally steering."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the controller down to end the wheelie.",
      "content": "Push the controller down to end the wheelie. When you want to exit the wheelie and resume normal driving, make a downward motion with your controller. The front wheel of the motorcycle should return to the ground and you should be able to steer normally."
    },
    {
      "title": "Save wheelies for straightaways.",
      "content": "Save wheelies for straightaways. When you do a wheelie, you'll notice that your steering is affected dramatically. You only have a little control over the direction you go, so even minor turns can be tricky. Because of this, it's best to use wheelies only when you're on a section of track where you don't have to do very much maneuvering. Long, straight stretches are best. You'll also want to be careful of the other racers around you when pulling a wheelie. If another racer bumps into you while your wheel is in the air, you'll lose control and your speed will plummet."

      "title": "Reach cruising speed.",
      "content": "Reach cruising speed. As with aerial tricks, the way that you pull a wheelie with a non-WiiMote controller is a little different than with a WiiMote. Start as you normally would by accelerating until you're near your top speed."

    {
      "title": "Hit up on the D-pad to do a wheelie.",
      "content": "Hit up on the D-pad to do a wheelie. When you're ready to do a wheelie, press the upper direction on the D-pad (the same cross-shaped pad you used to do tricks in the air.) Your racer should pull a wheelie."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hit down on the D-pad to end the wheelie.",
      "content": "Hit down on the D-pad to end the wheelie. When you're ready to end your wheelie, press the lower direction on the D-pad. Your racer should drop the motorcycle's front wheel and you should be able to steer like normal once again."
