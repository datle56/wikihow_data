In the aftermath of an affair, it's usually best to wait a few days to sort through your thoughts and feelings before you decide what you're going to do. Tell your partner that you can't pretend like everything is fine and you need a few days to sort through how you feel. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If it's possible, arrange for one of you to stay somewhere else for a few days. If that's not an option, at least try to separate yourselves as much as possible. For example, you might have your partner move into a spare bedroom or sleep on the couch for a few nights."

You might feel angry and frustrated one minute, then sad, overwhelmed, or even guilty the next. All of those feelings are normal and understandable. [2] X Research source Psychotherapist Kelli Miller notes that \"a lot of emotions are happening at once... There's a lot of grief that goes on once you find out that your partner has cheated. There's a lot of anger, clearly there's some sadness.\" [3] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. If you're feeling sad, go ahead and cry it out rather than trying to put on a brave face. Just tell yourself, \"I'm feeling really hurt and betrayed and there's nothing wrong with me feeling that way.\" When you feel angry, look for healthy ways to let that anger out . For example, you might write a letter to your partner (you don't have to give it to them). You could also go for a run or go out in the woods somewhere and scream. Take slow, deep breaths if you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed. It will help you focus on your senses and bring you back into the present."

When you've been cheated on, it's easy to fall into the trap of believing that it wouldn't have happened if only you'd looked or acted in a certain way. But your partner made the decision to betray you and they are the only one who is to blame. [4] X Research source Psychotherapist Kelli Miller agrees that this is about your partner \"feeling something and they're not able to communicate that effectively to you. They were missing something.\" [5] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Your partner might also try to make excuses or deflect some of the blame. For example, they might claim you weren't paying them enough attention or that the two of you have been arguing a lot lately. But the truth is that none of these things justifies cheating—no matter how unhappy they were, they could've handled things differently."

Give yourself a day or two to wallow, then push yourself back into your normal routine as much as possible. Make time for things that make you feel good, such as watching your favorite show or movie, walking in your favorite park, or picking up your favorite treat from a nearby restaurant.

In the long run, though, none of these things will make you feel any better—and they could make things a lot harder if you eventually decide to stay together and work on the relationship. [10] X Research source It's also a good idea to hold off on talking to your friends about the situation—at least for a day or two until you've cooled off. The urge to trash-talk your partner can cause you to say some things that you might later realize you didn't really mean.

If you feel as though you can never fully trust them again, it's probably time to make a clean break. Sometimes ending a relationship can feel like a personal failure or like giving up, and it's totally normal to feel that way. But if the relationship truly isn't working for you anymore, ending it is an act of self-care and shows that you respect yourself.

Try to do this regardless of whether the two of you have decided to stay together or to call it quits. For licensed therapist and certified sexual therapist Charity Danker, the process starts with acceptance, \"and that acceptance can either be, I accept you and I'm going to stay with you or I accept that this happened [and] I'm going to choose to move on.
