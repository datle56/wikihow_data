      "title": "Choose your Pokémon.",
      "content": "Choose your Pokémon. Deoxys is a Psychic-type that is weak against Ghost-, Dark-, and Bug-type Pokémon. It is especially strong against Fighting-type and Poison-Type, so avoid bringing any to the fight. Deoxys is Level 30, so make sure your party is ready to handle that. To make Deoxys easier to catch, bring a Pokémon with the \"False Swipes\" move. This will allow you to get Deoxys down to 1 HP without knocking him out, making him much easier to catch."

      "title": "Stock up on Poké Balls.",
      "content": "Stock up on Poké Balls. You will want a good number of Ultra Balls to capture Deoxys. Try to have at least 20 to be on the safe side. You will have a better chance of capturing Deoxys if his health is low, so you may not need as many if you have a Pokémon with \"False Swipes.\" Make sure to have enough healing items for a prolonged fight as well. Deoxys can hit pretty hard, so you may need to patch your Pokémon up after the fight."

      "title": "Consider your Master Ball.",
      "content": "Consider your Master Ball. If you've beaten the game, you'll have a spare Master Ball, which can be used to catch Deoxys without a fight. There are other Pokémon you might want to use this on, however, so decide if you want to use it on Deoxys. If you want, you can cheat to get unlimited Master Balls, but you must be using CodeBreaker , a cheat that comes built-in to the Visual Boy emulator . To use CodeBreaker to get more Master Balls, click the Cheats menu and select \"List...\" Click the CodeBreaker button. Enter \"Master Ball\" as the description. Enter 82005274 0001 into the \"Code\" field and press OK . Enter a PokéMart in the game and go to buy something. The pointer will be showing the \"Ultra Ball\", but you will actually be purchasing the \"Master Ball\" for $0. Buy as many as you'd like."

If you have the ability, use \"Paralyze\" or \"Sleep\" to make Deoxys easier to capture. Once Deoxys' health bar is red, start throwing your Ultra Balls until it is captured."
