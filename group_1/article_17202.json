In chemistry, the EF is the simplest way to describe a compound—it is basically a list of the elements that make up a compound, organized by percentage. It's important to note that this simple formula does not describe the arrangement of the atoms within the compound, it simply states which elements compound is made of. For example: [1] X Research source A compound that is made up of 40.92% Carbon, 4.58% hydrogen, and 54.5% Oxygen would have an empirical formula of C 3 H 4 O 3 (we will go through an example of how to find the EF of this compound in Part Two)."

      "content": "Understand the term 'percent composition'. 'Percentage composition' refers to the percent of each individual atom in the whole compound that we are looking at. To find the empirical formula of a compound, we must know the percentage composition of the compound. If you are finding the empirical formula for homework, you will most likely be given the percentages. [2] X Research source In a chemistry lab, to find the percentage composition, the compound would be examined through some physical experiments and then quantitative analysis. Unless you are in a lab, you will not need to actually do these experiments."

To find a gram atom, the equation is: The percent of the element in the compound (%) divided by the element’s atomic mass. [3] X Research source For example, let’s say that we have a compound that is made up of 40.92% carbon. The atomic mass of carbon is 12 so our equation would be 40.92 / 12 = 3.41."

After you have found all of the gram atoms in your compound, look at all of them. To find the atomic ratio, you will have to pick out the gram atom that is the smallest out of all of the gram atoms that you calculated. You will then divide all of your gram atoms by the smallest gram atom. For example: Let’s say that we are working with a compound that has three gram atoms: 1.5, 2 and 2.5. The smallest gram atom out of those three numbers is 1.5. So to find the atomic ratio, you must divide all of the numbers by 1.5 and then separate them with the symbol for ratio : . 1.5 / 1.5 = 1. 2 / 1.5 = 1.33. 2.5 / 1.5 = 1.66. So your atomic ratio is 1 : 1.33 : 1.66 ."

      "content": "Understand how to convert numbers of atomic ratio into whole numbers. When writing an empirical formula, you need whole numbers. This means you can’t use a number like 1.33. After you have found your atomic ratio, you need to convert any partial numbers (again, like 1.33) into whole numbers (like 3). To do this, you have to find a whole number that can be multiplied by each individual number in your atomic ratio to get a whole number. For example: Try 2. Multiply the numbers in your atomic ratio (1, 1.33, and 1.66) by 2. You get 2, 2.66, and 3.32. These are not whole numbers so 2 doesn’t work. Try 3. You get 3, 4, and 5 when you multiply 1, 1.33, and 1.66 by 3. Therefore, your atomic ratio of whole numbers is 3 : 4 : 5 ."

Number of gram atoms of carbon = 40.92 / 12 = 3.41 Number of gram atoms of hydrogen = 04.58 / 01 = 4.58 Number of gram atoms of oxygen = 54.50 / 16 = 3.41"

[5] X Research source You write the ratio like this: value Carbon : value Hydrogen : value Oxygen . Carbon: 3.41 / 3.41 = 1 Hydrogen: 4.58 / 3.41 = 1.34 Oxygen: 3.41 / 3.41 = 1 The atomic ratio is 1 : 1.34 : 1 ."

Our smallest whole number that can be multiplied with the numbers in our atomic ratio to create whole numbers is 3. 1 x 3 = 3 (this works because 3 is a whole number). 1.34 x 3 = 4 (4 is also a whole number). 1 x 3 = 3 (again, 3 is a whole number).
