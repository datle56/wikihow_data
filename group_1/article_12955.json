      "content": "Dinna fash means “don’t worry” or “don’t fuss.” The phrase is used to comfort someone who’s anxious, upset, or concerned over a certain issue. It can also be interpreted as “don’t be troubled” or “don’t bother with that,” similarly to how the English “don’t worry” is used to tell someone not to go out of their way. [1] X Research source The meaning of “dinna fash” comes from fâcher, a French word meaning to upset, annoy, or vex someone. [2] X Research source “Dinna” is simply the Scottish contraction of “do not.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dinna fash is a 16th-century term from the Scots language. The phrase is particularly associated with Northeastern Scotland, where the Doric dialect of the Scots language was widely used. Scots, along with Gaelic, are the two major indigenous languages of Scotland. [4] X Research source Scots was actually used more widely in the Lowlands of Scotland, while Scottish Gaelic was the dominant language of the Highlands. The Doric dialect of Scots, however, was popular in the Highlands. Doric dialects are described as rougher but more genuine forms of language, as opposed to the Attic dialects of more cosmopolitan and urban areas. Both Scots and Gaelic have diminished in usage since Scotland was united with England in 1707 (to the chagrin of many past and current residents). [5] X Research source However, both Scots and Gaelic are protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (1992) and have seen an uptick in usage and interest during recent years.

Dinna fash yersel, it was an accident. = Don’t get frustrated over something accidental.
