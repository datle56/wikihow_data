      "content": "Create distance between yourself and the attacker, if possible. If it turns out that you must face a knife-wielding attacker one-on-one, start by backing away. Try to put as much distance as possible between yourself and the attacker. Experts recommend seven yards as a distance that will keep you safe from a knife attack. To prevent yourself from getting in a situation where somebody is attacking you with a knife in the first place, try using two of the three forms of self-defense on a regular basis, situational awareness and verbal de-escalation.

      "title": "Use an object as a shield.",
      "content": "Use an object as a shield. If you want to disarm an opponent or attacker, you will have to do so at the right moment. While you are waiting, you can protect yourself by using an object as a shield. Try to find a hard, rigid object such as a board or trash can lid, but any object (even a coat, blanket, etc.) can help. Hold the object in front of you to protect yourself against sudden attacks. A shield will help keep your vulnerable areas protected. Remember that your most vulnerable areas are at your core (chest, abdomen), so keep those protected above all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your body perpendicular to the attacker.",
      "content": "Keep your body perpendicular to the attacker. Try not to stand directly in front of the attacker; this makes you more vulnerable to attacks. Instead, remain to the side of the attacker if at all possible. That way, you will have a chance to see if the attacker turns to lunge toward you, and have slightly more time to react. When an attacker is punching, jumping, kicking, or stabbing at you, it's critical that you be moving your feet to protect yourself and put yourself in a better position. Even if you can't avoid or block an attack entirely, you can still hopefully mitigate whatever damage they otherwise would have caused.

    {
      "title": "Block and redirect attacks.",
      "content": "Block and redirect attacks. If the attacker lunges at you before you are able to get the knife, step to the side out of his/her way. The attacker may then turn around to face you again. Be prepared and move to the side of the attacker, so that you can avoid direct stabs in your direction."

      "content": "Deflect the attacker’s arm if he or she strikes. If the attacker lunges at you and you are not able to get out of the way, grab the attacker’s arm as he/she moves toward you. Use both of your hands to grab on, if possible. Yank the attacker’s arm and use the attacker’s momentum to throw him/her to the ground, making sure to keep the knife pointed away from you."

    {
      "title": "Stop an underhand knife attack.",
      "content": "Stop an underhand knife attack. If the attacker lunges at you using an upward motion, use the blade of your hand to chop into the attacker's hand. Do this forcefully, and it will push the attacker’s arm backward. Use your hands to push and hold the attacker's arm back so that the knife stays away from you. Slam the attacker’s arm into a hard surface or apply pressure until the knife falls from his/her hand."

      "content": "Throw the attacker from the ground. If the attacker lunges toward you with the knife, back away and pretend to fall down so that you are still facing the attacker. Prop yourself up on your forearms, keep your left foot raised, and wait for the attacker to approach. When the attacker is within reach of your feet, put your left foot against his/her heel. Slam your right leg against the back of the attacker's knee as hard as you can, pushing the attacker away. If you do this correctly, your attacker will fall face first, with the knife aimed away from you."

      "content": "Get ahold of the attacker’s limb with both hands. When you are ready to remove the knife from the attacker’s hand, grab his/her arm as quickly as you can. Use both of your hands if possible. Try to stabilize the attacker’s arm (hold it in place). This will be difficult since the attacker will probably try to get out of your grip, so you must hold on as firmly as you can."

      "title": "Injure the attacker’s hand.",
      "content": "Injure the attacker’s hand. Slam the attacker’s hand against a hard surface as quickly as you can. You can even try to break the attacker’s wrist or hand if necessary. If you cannot slam the attacker’s hand against anything, focus on applying as much pressure as you can to his/her arm until it is injured. If this goes well, the attacker's on the knife will loosen, and the weapon will fall away."

      "title": "Keep the knife away.",
      "content": "Keep the knife away. Once the attacker is disarmed, make sure that the knife is far out of his/her reach. Kick, push, or fling the knife as far as you can so that the attacker cannot reach it. Once the attacker is disarmed, try to flee to safety."

      "title": "Use a weapon if necessary and possible.",
      "content": "Use a weapon if necessary and possible. If the attacker still attempts to harm you after you disarm him/her, and you cannot get away, try to use a non-deadly weapon (not the knife) to defend yourself. You could: Throw sand, rocks, or other small objects at the attacker. Hot coffee or ice water can even do the trick. Hit the attacker with whatever object is at hand: a stick, chair, book, etc. You can even use a coat like a whip to strike the attacker."

      "title": "Incapacitate the attacker.",
      "content": "Incapacitate the attacker. If you do not have any object at hand to help you, try and injure or immobilize the attacker using your own body. For instance: Headbutt the attacker in his/her abdomen. Strike the attacker in the face, especially the eye, nose, or temple. Kick the attacker in the knees or groin."

Your first tactic should be to run away, if you can get away without harming yourself. If you cannot escape the area, try to hide in a secure location, such as a room that can be locked, or behind a cover of some kind. You should fight back against the attacker only as a last resort."

However, if it is at all possible at any point during the confrontation, move away from the attacker. [8] X Research source You can begin by trying to back away from the attacker. When you are several yards away, you can attempt to flee. If the attacker becomes distracted or moves away from you, use the opportunity to run away as fast as you can until you are in a safe location. Do not run in a straight line; instead, move in a zig-zag or more erratic motion. This will confuse the attacker, helping you to escape. [9] X Research source"
