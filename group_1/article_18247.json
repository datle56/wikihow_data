      "content": "Store your meat in the refrigerator until it is ready to prepare for freezing. You should store fresh, raw meats in your refrigerator for no more than 2-3 days before freezing them. Your refrigerator’s temperature should be kept at 40 degrees F or below at all times to ensure peak freshness and safety of all foods.

If you are freezing ground hamburger, you can divide it into 1 pound increments, or form it into quarter pound patties. Do not rinse the meat before freezing. It isn’t necessary, and can cause crystallization on the meat when it freezes. If you want to rinse the meat, do it right before cooking.

      "title": "Place the meat in the center of a large piece of freezer paper or plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Place the meat in the center of a large piece of freezer paper or plastic wrap. If you are using freezer paper, make sure that the paper side is touching the counter and the meat is resting on the waxed side. Freezer paper is similar to wax paper. It has a plastic or wax coating on one side, which helps keep meat juices from leaking out. Meat markets and grocery stores use this paper to wrap raw meats in. [5] X Research source If you can’t find freezer paper, regular wax paper, parchment paper, or even plastic wrap will do. [6] X Research source If possible, use freezer bags. They're usually thicker and protect the meat while reducing the amount of ice crystals."

      "content": "Pad any bones with small pieces of paper towel so they won’t pierce the wrapping. If any bones pierce the wrap, air will get into the packaging and compromise the quality of the meat. Wrap small pieces of paper towel around the bones, then continue to wrap as instructed."

      "title": "Wrap each piece of meat tightly.",
      "content": "Wrap each piece of meat tightly. Bring the top and bottom of the freezer paper or plastic wrap together over the meat, then fold the freezer paper down towards the meat, making small folds, each 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm). Push all the air out of the bag before sealing it. That is key to preserving the texture of the meat."

      "content": "Wrap the meat again, this time in aluminum foil or a zippered plastic bag. This step is optional, but double-wrapping will help keep air away from the meat and cut down on the risk of freezer burn. [7] X Research source If storing the meat in a plastic bag, make sure to push all air out of the bag before closing. In the plastic bag, place each individual patty or piece of meat between two pieces of freezer paper to help keep them separate when they’re frozen. This will make them easier to quickly grab from the freezer, and it will also speed the thawing process.

Then you can place it into a large plastic freezer bag, or wrap it tightly in freezer paper and tape it closed to seal. Store the giblets, heart, and liver separately in a large plastic zip-top bag for freezing.

The date lets you know how long each piece of meat has been frozen, and the contents let you know what cut of meat you’re grabbing from the freezer without opening the package.

      "content": "Place the meat in the coldest area of the freezer. Separate the pieces or bags to allow the meat to freeze faster. Once the meat is completely frozen, you can rearrange the layout of the freezer. If the meat doesn’t freeze quickly enough, ice crystals can form in the meat. These crystals contribute to freezer burn and to the loss of juices while the meat is thawing out."

If you’re only freezing your meat for a short amount of time (a couple of weeks), it’s okay if the freezer’s temperature fluctuates a little from the door opening and closing. Just be sure to eat the meat quickly."
