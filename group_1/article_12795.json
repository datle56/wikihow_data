      "title": "Speak up",
      "content": "Speak up . It's important to be heard when you speak, so raise your voice! If you tend to whisper, mumble or speak with your head down, it is much easier for people to talk over you or ignore you. [1] X Research source However, this doesn't mean you should shout - rather, you should vary the loudness of your speech depending on the situation. For example, if you're addressing a large group of people it will be necessary to speak loudly in order to project your voice. But speaking too loudly in normal, everyday conversation is unnecessary and can give the wrong impression."

      "title": "Slow down",
      "content": "Slow down . Speaking too quickly is a bad habit and it can be difficult for people to keep up with you or even understand what you're saying. This makes it easy for them to tune out and stop listening. [2] X Research source Therefore, it's important to slow down your speech by saying your words more slowly and pausing between sentences - this helps to add emphasis to what you're saying and gives you a chance to take a breath! On the other hand, it's a good idea not to speak too slowly. Speaking too slowly can be monotonous for your listeners, so they may become impatient and just tune out. The ideal speaking rate is somewhere between 120 and 160 words per minute. However, if you're giving a speech, it's a good idea to alter the speed at which you speak - speaking slowly can help to emphasize a point, while speaking more quickly can give the impression of passion and enthusiasm.

      "title": "Enunciate",
      "content": "Enunciate . Speaking clearly is possibly the most important aspect of developing a good speaking voice. You need to pay close attention to each and every word you say - pronouncing it fully and correctly. [4] X Research source Make sure to open your mouth, loosen your lips and keep your tongue and teeth in the correct position as you speak. This may also help eliminate or disguise a lisp , if you have one. It might feel odd at first, but if you consistently make the effort to pronounce your words correctly, it will soon come naturally to you. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice deep breathing",
      "content": "Practice deep breathing . Deep breathing is essential for a full, rich speaking voice. The majority of people breathe too quickly and shallowly when they speak, which results in a more unnatural, nasal tone. [5] X Research source Your breath should come from your diaphragm, not from your chest. To figure out if you're breathing correctly, place your fist on your abdomen, just below your last rib - you should feel your stomach expand and see your shoulders rise and fall as you breathe. Practice your breathing by inhaling deeply, allowing the air to fill your belly. Breathe in for a count of 5 seconds, then exhale for another 5. Get used to this method of breathing, then try to work it into your everyday speech. Remember that sitting or standing up straight, with your chin up and your shoulders back, will help you to breathe deeper and project your voice more easily. It will also give you an air of confidence as you speak. Try to breathe at the end of every sentence - if you use the deep breathing method, you should have enough air to get through the next sentence without having to pause for breath. This will also give your listeners a chance to absorb what you're saying."

      "title": "Vary your pitch",
      "content": "Vary your pitch . The pitch of your voice can have a real impact on the quality of your speech and the impact it makes on your listeners. In general, speaking in a shaky or unsteady pitch gives the impression of nervousness, while an even voice is more calming and persuasive. [6] X Research source Although you shouldn't try to change the natural pitch of your voice (no Darth Vader impressions, please), you should make an effort to control it. Don't let your nerves get the better of you and aim to achieve a fuller, smoother pitch. You can practice controlling your pitch by humming a tune, or simply by reading a piece of text aloud to yourself. Keep in mind that it's not necessary to maintain a steady pitch at all times - some words should be voiced in a higher pitch in order to add emphasis."

      "title": "Do some vocal exercises",
      "content": "Do some vocal exercises . Practicing vocal exercises can be a good way to develop your natural speaking voice. Practicing while looking in the mirror is the most effective way to achieve this, as are some of these ways: [7] X Research source Try to loosen your mouth and relax your vocal cords. You can do this by yawning widely, wiggling your jaw from side to side, humming a tune, and gently massaging your throat muscles with your fingers. Increase your breathing capacity and volume by fully exhaling until all of the air is completely expelled from your lungs, then take a deep breath and hold it for 15 seconds before exhaling again. Work on your pitch by singing the sound \"ah\", first at your normal pitch, then getting progressively lower. You can also do this with each of the letters of the alphabet.

      "title": "Practice reading aloud",
      "content": "Practice reading aloud . In order to work on pronunciation, pace and volume, it is a good idea to practice reading aloud. [8] X Research source Pick a passage from a book or magazine, or better yet, find a transcript of a famous speech (such as one by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) and read it aloud to yourself. Remember to stand up straight, breathe deeply and open your mouth fully when you speak. Stand in front of a mirror if it helps. Keep practicing until you are happy with what you hear. Then try to employ the same techniques as part of your everyday speech."

      "title": "Record yourself",
      "content": "Record yourself . Even though most people don't like listening to the sound of their own voices, it's a good idea to record yourself speaking. [9] X Research source This can help you to pick up on any faults that you wouldn't normally pick up on, such as mispronunciations and speed or pitch problems. Nowadays, most phones will have a recording option that you can use to listen to yourself. You could also use a video camera (which could be helpful to check your posture, eye contact and mouth movement)."

      "content": "See a voice coach. If you're really worried about improving your speaking voice - for something like a debate, speech or presentation - then it might be a good idea to book an appointment with a voice coach. They can identify your individual speech issues and help you to correct them. A voice coach is also a good idea if you have a native or very colloquial accent that you're trying to minimize or eliminate. Getting rid of an accent is a difficult thing to do, so seeing a professional can really help. If seeing a voice coach seems a little extreme, then consider practising in front of a particularly articulate friend or family member. They may be able to pick up on any issues and give you some helpful pointers. This will also help you to feel more confident about speaking in front of others."

      "title": "Smile as you speak.",
      "content": "Smile as you speak. People will judge you and the content of your speech more favorably if you use an open, friendly, encouraging tone (as opposed to an aggressive, sarcastic or bored one). A good way to make your tone more friendly and warm is to smile while you speak. Not a crazed grin, mind you, but even a slight upturn of the corners of your mouth can make the sound of your voice more appealing - even over the phone. Of course, smiling isn't always appropriate, especially if you're discussing a serious issue. But just remember that inserting emotion into your voice (whatever emotion it may be) can do wonders."
