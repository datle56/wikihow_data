If you cannot leave the pimple alone, you can try to exfoliate it with natural, gentle scrubs; however, many skin specialists do not recommend exfoliation as it is a bit like pulling off a scab before it falls off on its own and can cause scarring on the surface of your skin. Gentle exfoliation can help to pull out any sebum, cell debris, or embedded hairs that are causing the deep pimple and speed up healing of the pimple."
