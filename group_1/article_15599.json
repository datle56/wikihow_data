      "content": "Elder Futhark is the oldest runic alphabet used by ancient Germanic and Norse peoples. This system of writing first appeared in Scandinavia around 160 CE and remained the dominant alphabet for Germanic-speaking peoples until about 700 CE, when the Younger Futhark alphabet became more prominent (these were the runes used during the Viking Age). The name “Futhark” comes from the first 6 runes of the alphabet (Fehu, Uruz, Thurisaz, Ansuz, Raidho, and Kenaz) and the sounds they make (F-U-Th-A-R-K). The runes’ angular shapes were designed to be inscribed easily into wood, metal, and stone for protection, spellcasting, and divination, as well as for practical communication. [26] X Research source Each of the 24 runes in the Elder Futhark alphabet has a literal translation and phonetic sound and a deeper spiritual lesson or reminder. For example, Fehu literally means “cattle” and makes the “F” sound, but also represents material wealth and how it can impact your life. [27] X Research source The word “rune” comes from the Old Norse word for “secret letter.” It was believed that each rune contained a hidden message or meaning and could be used to cast spells. The act of writing itself was considered magical or sacred. [28] X Research source"

It consists of the first 8 runes (Fehu, Uruz, Thurisaz, Ansuz, Raidho, Kenaz, Gebo, Wunjo) and is ruled by Freyja, the goddess of love, fertility, and war. Hagall (Heimdall’s Aett) represents change, the underworld, and the subconscious. It consists of the second set of 8 runes (Hagalaz, Naudhiz, Isa, Jera, Eihwaz, Perthro, Algiz, Sowilo) and is ruled by Heimdall, the Norse god responsible for guarding Asgard (the realm of the gods). Tyr (Tyr’s Aett) symbolizes spirituality, emotions, and how you interact with the world around you. It consists of the final 8 runes (Tiwaz, Berkano, Ehwaz, Mannaz, Laguz, Ingwaz, Dagaz, Othala) and is ruled by Tyr, the god of war, justice, and heroic actions."

According to legend, Odin (the Allfather) hung from the branches of Yggdrasil, the word tree, for 9 days and nights with no food or drink. During this time and thanks to his sacrifice, Odin gained knowledge of the runes and their meanings from Yggdrasil and passed the knowledge on to the vitki (a class of Norse sorcerers who practiced rune magic and divination). The runes gave the vitki and others the ability to cast spells and divine the future. [30] X Research source Norse mythology is full of stories of people using runes for magical purposes.

It’s unclear exactly where this runic alphabet came from, but there are some clear influences from Greek and Roman letters. The most common theory suggests that the Greek script (which was not standardized between 700 and 400 BCE) may have reached Scandinavia and Germanic-speaking peoples via Eastern European tribes. [31] X Research source The earliest confirmed runic inscription was found on a comb from Denmark (around 160 BCE) and reads harja (“comb” or “warrior”). The writing was so clear that experts think the script must have been in use for at least 100 years before that. The earliest runes have lots of variation, meaning they were used to write out a variety of Germanic languages and dialects (there is no single language that corresponds to the Elder Futhark)."

From the Nordic regions of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, the Elder Futhark writing system traveled to England and other Viking outposts in Germany, Russia, Poland, Hungary, and even Asia Minor. As the runic alphabet spread, variations in its use, alphabetical order, and even the shapes of the symbols increased—there was no single, standard runic alphabet. At this time, the Elder Futhark was used to write down languages including Proto-Germanic, Proto-Norse, Proto-English, and Proto-High German. [32] X Research source"

Most of the runic inscriptions we know of today contain down-to-earth messages meant for everyday use, such as identifying tomb markers or creating warning signs in dangerous or spiritual places. However, runes were more highly valued for their magical properties. They could be carved into weapons or protective talismans to imbue them with defensive powers, cast as runestones to predict the future, and used to write out spells and curses or heal the sick.

      "content": "After 700 CE, the Elder Futhark branched off into newer runic alphabets. As variations in the Elder Futhark became more pronounced, new alphabets emerged. The Younger Futhark was in use from about 700 to 1200 CE and was a condensed, simplified version of the Elder Futhark. Eight runes (Gebo, Wunjo, Eihwaz, Perthro, Ehwaz, Ingwaz, Dagaz, and Othala) were dropped from the alphabet and the remaining runes took on multiple possible sounds. The aett system stayed in place, but with 3 groups of 6, 6, and 4 runes. The Younger Futhark was the writing system used by the Vikings. [34] X Research source The other major runic alphabet to emerge was the Anglo-Saxon Futhark . This alphabet began emerging in Britain and Frisia (the Netherlands) as early as the 5th century CE. Unlike the Younger Futhark, this system added runes (between 4 and 8 of them, depending on the region, language, or time period). These runes were primarily used to write Old English and Old Frisian until around 1000 CE. The Younger Futhark later developed into the Medieval Futhark in the 13th century CE. It was then that runes became standardized. Runes gradually faded away during the Middle Ages as Latin letters became more dominant, but were still used for ceremonial purposes, amulets, or personal letters."

Only about 400 Elder Futhark inscriptions have been found and translated, although historians predict this is only a small fraction of what once existed. Most inscriptions are found on military equipment, coins, jewelry (bracelets, brooches, combs), and runestones. Many of these runic carvings are damaged from wear and tear and are only partially legible. Here are some of the most noteworthy runic inscriptions (Elder and Younger Futhark) we know of so far: The Vimose inscriptions (Denmark, 160 CE): This collection includes the Vimose comb (the earliest datable Elder Futhark inscription) reading harja , as well as inscribed buckles, spearheads, sheathplates, and other military equipment. [35] X Research source The Rakkestad inscription (Norway, c. 400 CE): This runestone predates the Viking Age by 400 years and is one of the few runic inscriptions found in Norway (the majority are concentrated in Sweden). The Stenkvista and Skåang runestones (Sweden, 6th century CE): The Stenkvista runestone is one of several stones referencing Thor and depicts his hammer, Mjolnir. The Skåang stone contains an Elder Futhark inscription from the 500s and a second, Younger Futhark inscription added during the Viking Age. The Rök runestone (Sweden, early 9th century CE): This 5-ton carved stone in rural Sweden contains over 700 runes carved into its 5 sides. The author was a man coping with the death of his son who also warned about extreme environmental challenges we know suspect occurred between 775 and 810 CE. [36] X Research source The Jellings runestones (Denmark, 10th century CE): Two massive rune stones mark the graves of King Gorm the Old and his wife Thyra.

Shake the bag while you focus on your question or concern about the future. Then, draw runes one at a time and lay them out in a rune spread. Similar to a tarot card reading, you can draw just one rune, lay out 3 to represent the past, present, and future, or use any other configuration you like. Using each rune’s meaning as a guide, interpret the answer to your question. For example, if you’re wondering if you’ll move soon and pull Dagaz, meaning “new day,” you just might have a change of scenery coming your way.
