      "content": "Pucker your lips and suck your cheeks in. To start exercising your cheek muscles, make a face as though you just ate a lemon or something remarkably sour. Your lips should be in a slight pucker or pout and your cheeks should be partially sucked in. Your teeth should not be clenched together, as this can prevent you from sucking your cheeks in, but your lips do need to be closed. [2] X Research source Note - this method is a folk remedy. In other words, it's not supported by any sort of scientific evidence, but rather by vague, unverifiable, anecdotal evidence. Thus, it is not guaranteed to work. Your cheeks should naturally indent inward, with the deepest part of the indentation resting in between your top and bottom teeth, roughly halfway between the front and back of your mouth. Try eating or drinking something sour if you have a hard time imagining the appropriate facial expression - your natural reaction to sourness is what this exercise is imitating."

      "content": "Press and hold the indentations. Locate the areas on your cheeks where the indentations are the deepest. Gently hold this spot down on both cheeks using both index fingers. Keep your fingers firmly fixed to these spots as you prepare to move your mouth. You can also hold these spots with your thumb or the rounded end of a pencil if you find it easier."

      "title": "Smile and reposition your fingers as necessary.",
      "content": "Smile and reposition your fingers as necessary. Gradually ease your expression into a wide grin, keeping your fingers fixed to the same spots on your face. Your smile should be wide and open-mouthed, as natural dimples generally appear when someone has a fairly wide smile. Your fingers should now be positioned near the corners of your smile, where dimples would naturally occur if you had them. [3] X Research source Check your appearance in a mirror. If the location of your fingertips seems slightly off, you may need to slightly slide your fingertips across your cheeks to the proper location. Press your desired dimple area firmly with your fingertips or with the rounded end of a pencil. For temporary dimples, release immediately. Take a picture, if desired. [4] X Research source Note that these dimples will disappear as soon as you relax your mouth."

      "content": "Continue pressing for 30 minutes or more. To train your cheeks into forming more lasting dimples, you will need to continue to firmly hold these indentations in place for at least 30 minutes. The longer you can hold your “dimple” marks in place, the more luck you will have in getting them to last. In the past, there were actually mechanical devices aimed at creating dimples by applying consistent pressure to these spots on your face. [5] X Research source These devices were never scientifically proven to work, but some swore by them. This dimple exercise mimics the action of such a machine."

      "content": "Repeat daily. Continue practicing 30-minute dimple “exercises” on a daily basis for several weeks. If a month passes and you still have not created lasting dimples, you may want to move on. Since this technique is not supported by scientific evidence, but by hearsay, if you don't eventually have success, it may simply not work for you."

      "title": "Smile wide!",
      "content": "Smile wide! Look into a mirror and smile a wide but natural smile. Gauge the general location where you want your fake dimples to be. [6] X Research source When you smile, natural creases should form outside of your mouth. Your “dimples” should fall just outside of these creases, beginning roughly around the area just above the upper points of your lips. Make sure to smile broadly, but not unnaturally so. Real dimples are most prominent during particularly wide smiles, so you will get a better idea for where your cosmetic dimples should be if you make a wide grin, rather than a reserved one. Don't be shy ! Note - this method works best to create temporary dimples suitable for pictures. It may look unnatural if worn out in public."

      "content": "Mark the tops of your new dimples. Dimples usually appear as short lines or slight crescent shapes. Using a dark brown pencil eyeliner or eyebrow pencil, make a small dot at the top of where you want your desired dimple line to be. Dark brown works bests because it blends into the skin more naturally. Black and colored eyeliner should be avoided."

      "content": "Draw a small crescent moon shape on your cheek. With the tops of your dimples marked, relax your mouth. Draw a small, slightly curved line starting at the dot you have marked. Use the same eyeliner or eyebrow pencil you used to create the dot. [7] X Research source The line should extend no further than 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the dot. It should be just barely curved - slightly straighter than the curve of a fingernail."

Use your fingers or a smudge stick to blend the line into your skin, rubbing the line up and down rather than side to side. [8] X Research source One application may not create a line of suitable darkness, so you may need to draw over the line and blend it in several times."

Do not attempt to perform a cheek piercing at home. Only go to reputable, qualified professionals - ones that have the training and tools necessary to minimize your risk of infection or complication. [10] X Research source Most professional body piercers will refuse to perform a dimple piercing on anyone under the age of 18, even with a guardian's permission. The precise age cutoff, however, differ based in the laws in your state or country. Note - many professional body piercers discourage dimple piercings at all ages. While ear and nose piercings only cut through skin and cartilage, dimple piercings cut through muscle. As a result, there is a greater risk of nerve damage than with other complications. Oral piercings of all types can also cause long-term damage to your teeth and gums. [11] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source"

The needle used to pierce your cheek must be sterile beyond a shadow of a doubt. Never, ever receive a piercing using a dirty needle.

      "content": "Maintain proper treatment after the piercing is done. New piercings require special care to reduce the risk of infection or complication. Ask your piercer for instructions - you will probably need to clean the pierced area with saline solution several times each day until the piercing heals. The body piercer may provide you with a solution, but if not, you can make one by adding 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt to 8 oz (250 ml) of pure distilled water. Apply the saline solution with a sterile cotton swab. Swab the area next to the jewelry rod and gently clean beneath the head of the jewelry. Avoid playing with the jewelry as it heals. Fiddling with your jewelry can transfer bacteria from your hand into the wound, and also causes the piercing to shift from its original location, irritating the wound."

The piercing needs to heal with the jewelry in before it can be safely removed. Removing the jewelry prematurely may allow the piercings in your cheeks to close up. Waiting at least one month (and up to three) should provide your cheeks ample time to partially heal. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As soon as you remove the piercings, your skin will begin the process of healing itself. Until the skin heals, you will have two small holes in your cheek. After the skin heals, however, you should be left with two dimple-like indentations in your cheek. Take care, during this time, to keep track of the types of jewelry you are wearing in your dimples. Some people can have allergic reactions to certain types of metal used in jewelry, especially cheaper varieties. Note - piercings are semi-permanent! Your new \"dimples\" will be in your cheeks at all times, regardless of the expression on your face."
