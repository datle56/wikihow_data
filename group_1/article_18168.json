      "content": "Cross of the old address with a black permanent marker. Use a thick black marker to completely cover the address written on the envelope or package.

      "title": "Put the new address underneath the old one if you know it.",
      "content": "Put the new address underneath the old one if you know it. Use a black marker and write in large block letters. Put the phrase “Forward to:” above the name on the envelope first, and then write the address. Keep your writing neat and legible so your mail carrier can read it. [6] X Research source Do not change the name or return address in the upper left corner of the piece of mail. If you know the recipient but not their new address, call them ahead of time to ask them about their current address."

      "title": "Write “Moved-Return to Sender” if you don't know the person's address.",
      "content": "Write “Moved-Return to Sender” if you don't know the person's address. If you're not sure who the recipient is or if you don't know their new address, use big block letters above the person's name to write the phrase. That way, the person who sent the mail will get it back so they can ask the recipient for their new address. [7] X Research source This also works well to get rid of unwanted junk mail. Instead of “Moved,” write “Refused” on the mail instead."
