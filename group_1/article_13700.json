      "content": "Lie on your back. Bridge pose, or short bridge, is a beginner backbend exercise that’s common in yoga and Pilates. It’s not nearly as strenuous as the full gymnastics bridge. It is performed on the ground, and the shoulders never leave the floor, so it’s a good move for beginners. [1] X Research source Bridge pose is good for stretching the spine, neck, thighs, and hip flexors. This exercise will work best if you're on a cushioned but firm surface, such as a carpeted area or an exercise mat on the floor."
