The most common two types are residential and non-residential, meaning you live at the institution while studying or you study away from the main campus most of the time. Decide which sort of training would be best for your lifestyle, then do an online search to find the best options in your area. For example, if you want to be fully immersed in your training and can leave your current house and lifestyle to do it, you might look for full-time residential training at theological institutions near you. Some theological institutions, like Trinity College Bristol , provide the option of doing your training part-time that's geared towards working people. Learning takes place just a couple of evenings a week. If there aren’t many theological institutions near you, research non-residential options. You may be able to choose to complete part of your training online, meaning you would only need to commute to some of your classes."

This helps you practice the things you’ve learned and gain real experience. [5] X Research source A deacon is one level below a priest.

If they do allow you to legally oversee the wedding, they may ask to see your official ordination certificate, so have that on hand just in case. If you don't qualify as an authorized minister, you can still speak at the ceremony. However, an authorized minister or registrar must be present to witness the wedding and sign the marriage document to make it legal.
