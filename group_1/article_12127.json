      "content": "Apply a warm washcloth to your nose and face several times a day. The heat will open up your blood vessels and make it easier for fluid to escape. Place a washcloth in warm water but make sure that the water is not too hot so that you do not burn your skin. Ring out the excess water and then place the washcloth over your face and nose. Relax for about five to 10 minutes, and then remove the washcloth."

      "content": "Blow your nose gently. Blowing your nose hard and fast can get rid of germs and mucus from your nostrils, but the high pressure can also force it back into your nose and sinuses. Instead, blow your nose gently to get more mucus out of your nose. Using a soft tissue, close one nostril by pressing your finger against one side of your nose, and blow gently out the open nostril.

      "content": "Sit up. Although you may want to lay down to rest while you are sick, laying down can make it harder for your sinuses to drain. Sitting up rather than laying down will help to drain your nose. Sitting up will pull the fluid out of your nose and make it easier to clear.

      "content": "Wash out the mucus with a neti pot. Pouring lukewarm water inside your nose can help clear the mucus buildup. Try using a neti pot, which is a container used to pour salt water through a long thin spout into the nose. Fill the neti pot with a solution of lukewarm water and salt. This solution is meant to mimic natural body tissues and fluids.

To use a neti pot, tilt your head sideways over the sink and place the spout of the neti pot in the upper nostril. Breath through your mouth and gently pour the solution into your upper nostril so that the liquid drains through the lower nostril. Repeat on the other side. Rinse the device after each use with sterile, boiled or filtered water."

If you are on any medications or if you have a medical condition, then you should speak to your doctor before trying any over the counter medicines or nasal sprays. For example, if you have an enlarged prostate, glaucoma, heart disease, high blood pressure, or thyroid disease, check with your doctor or pharmacist before use because all decongestants, including sprays, can worsen these conditions. Your doctor can advise you on what medicines are and are not appropriate for you. Keep in mind that the potential side effects of decongestants include: Irritation to the lining of your nose, which may include nosebleeds A skin rash Headaches Dry mouth Restlessness or anxiety Tremor (uncontrollable shaking and trembling) Problems sleeping (insomnia) Rapid and/or irregular heartbeat Noticing your heart beating inside your chest (palpitations) Increased blood pressure"

      "content": "Consider taking an over-the-counter decongestant. Over-the-counter decongestants (those not requiring a prescription) include phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine as main ingredients. They work by constricting the blood vessels in the nose. This reduces how much blood flows through the area so that swollen tissue inside the nose shrinks and air can pass through more easily. [9] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Phenylephrine comes as a tablet, a liquid (spray), or a dissolving strip to take by mouth. Also, it is an ingredient in many cold/flu medications. Follow directions on the bottle on its use.

Using a nasal spray for more than three days can lead to rebound congestion, a condition in which the congestion returns.

Do not use both at the same time as this can increase risk of side effects.

      "content": "Tell your doctor about all of your symptoms. Your doctor will take a detailed history of your current symptoms and past medical history as well as any associated symptoms/signs such as fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, etc. During your exam, your doctor will look at the inside of your nose with a penlight, check your ears for any fluid buildup, touch your cheekbones and/or forehead for sinus tenderness, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes around your neck. Your doctor may also order blood work to check the number of immune fighting cells present in your body (WBC). If they are elevated, chances are there is an infection or something causing inflammation such as allergies. Your doctor may refer you to an ENT physician (ear, nose, and throat doctor) for the referral if further expertise or tests are needed."

Your nasal discharge is green and is accompanied by sinus pain (pain around your cheekbones or forehead) or fever. This may be a sign of a bacterial infection. You have asthma, emphysema, or you are taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as steroids. This may increase the risks of infections.
