      "content": "Remove any roots and excess green stems. Start by cutting off any roots at the base of your leeks (on the end of the white bulb), as well as the dark green part at the top. When you trim off the greens, leave some of the pale green stem above the white bulb at the bottom. [1] X Research source If you wish, you can save some of the darker green parts for flavoring soup stock or broth."

      "title": "Rinse the outside of your leeks.",
      "content": "Rinse the outside of your leeks. Once your leeks are trimmed, give them a quick rinse with cool water to remove any obvious dirt and grime on the outside. Because of the way they grow, leeks tend to trap a lot of dirt and grit between their layers. Before you can freeze your leeks, you will need to clean them thoroughly. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut your leeks into halves or quarters lengthwise.",
      "content": "Cut your leeks into halves or quarters lengthwise. Place the leeks on a cutting board or plate and slice them lengthwise with a sharp knife. [3] X Research source If you like, slice each half lengthwise a second time to create quarters. If you wish, you may then chop the halved or quartered leeks into smaller crosswise sections."

      "content": "Rinse the cut leeks under running water. Take each section of sliced leek and rinse it under cool water. Gently spread apart the layers with your fingers to remove any trapped dirt and grit. If you chopped up your leeks, gently swirl them in a bowl of cool water instead. Once they’re rinsed, transfer them to a dry bowl using a slotted spoon. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a large pot and a wire blanching basket. While you don’t have to blanch your leeks before freezing, doing so can help your frozen leeks stay fresher and more flavorful for longer. [5] X Research source You will need a large cooking pot and a blanching basket or pasta strainer. If you don’t have a blanching basket or strainer, a mesh cooking bag will also work. If you choose not to blanch your leeks, try to use them within 1 to 2 months after freezing. [6] X Research source"

The goal of blanching is to stop enzyme action in the vegetable without actually cooking it. In order to prevent cooking, you will need to immediately move the leeks into cold or icy water once they are done blanching. [11] X Research source Use water that is chilled or no warmer than 60° F (15.6° C). Let the leeks sit for a minute or 2 so that they have time to cool all the way through."

[12] X Research source Once they are drained, spread them out on a plate or baking sheet and allow them to air dry for a few minutes. You can also gently pat the leeks with a clean, dry kitchen towel to soak up any excess moisture. Freezing your leeks with too much moisture on them can reduce their quality and storage life.

Place the tray full of leeks in your freezer and leave them for 20-30 minutes, then check to see if they are frozen. If not, give them some extra time.

If you store your leeks in a tightly sealed container and maintain your freezer at a consistent temperature of 0° F (-17.8° C) or lower, they will stay fresh for a long time. [16] X Research source Frozen leeks can stay good for up to a year. [17] X Research source Make sure to label your container with the date so you will know how long they have been frozen. Leeks that are improperly stored or frozen for too long will become mushy. If you did not blanch your leeks before freezing, you may notice a decrease in quality and flavor after 1 to 2 months.
