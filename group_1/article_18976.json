The application consists of 7 mandatory parts: [4] X Research source A fee of $85 The application form Your resumé A personal statement Your LSAT scores 2-3 recommendation letters.

      "content": "Include an addendum. Particularly if there are discrepancies in your application, such as a low GPA and high LSAT, consider including an addendum to explain them, preferably in a way that turns a weakness into a strength. For example, if you had low undergrad GPA, you might address it up front, and explain that between working your way through school and your commitment to an extracurricular (sports, student government, debate, etc.), it was difficult to maintain your grades, but you learned valuable things from these other experiences.

      "content": "Pick a good major. You can major in anything and get into Harvard law, though you’d do best to avoid criminal justice, which is not considered an academically rigorous major. [7] X Research source The key is to pick a subject that is rigorous, that you enjoy, and in which you can make good grades. If you want to study chemistry, go for it, but know that you will need to supplement your major with electives that demonstrate your reading, research, and writing skills. Here are some common “pre-law” majors. [8] X Research source History – Teaches strong reading, research, and writing skills, as well as a basic knowledge of U.S. laws and politics. [9] X Research source Philosophy – Teaches logic, critical analysis, close reading, and writing, and is considered a very rigorous major. [10] X Research source Economics – Teaches analysis and logical thinking. A senior thesis that displays research and writing skills will boost your application. Economics is considered preferable to business. [11] X Research source Political Science – Teaches strong reading and presentation skills, as well as a basic knowledge of the U.S. legal system. However, political science is considered a less rigorous major, so you will need a very good GPA. If possible, do a senior thesis to supplement your courses and show strong research and writing skills. [12] X Research source English – Shows strong reading and writing skills, but you will need to supplement your course work with research heavy courses. Science majors – The difficulty of these majors makes a high GPA even more impressive. That said, you will need to take electives to show you are strong in reading, writing, and research. Also, your application will be stronger if you say you are planning on being a patent or intellectual property lawyer. [13] X Research source Art/Music/Film – Harvard law actually likes students with less traditional backgrounds, though to get in with a major in the arts you will need a great GPA, supplemental course work in fields like history, economics, or philosophy, and preferable a senior thesis.

Harvard law accepts students from a wide variety of majors, but to maximize your chances of getting in and succeeding in law school, you’ll want to be sure to take courses that develop your reading, research, and writing skills. For example, if you’re an economics major with practice researching and analyzing data, you might want to take some history or literature electives to show that you also have developed reading and writing skills. [15] X Research source Consider taking: [16] X Research source Courses with term papers – Term papers might not be fun, but they require reading, research, and writing, making these classes the ideal preparation for law school. Courses that emphasize reading – Literature, philosophy, history, and political science. Courses that emphasize textual research – Economics, psychology, sociology, history, or any course with a term paper. (The key here is textual research, so lab work will not be as useful.)

And if your GPA and LSAT aren’t as good as you'd like, they can make all the difference. The key is to start early – schools like Harvard are less impressed if you only participate your senior year – and to focus on quality over quantity. Pick 1 to 3 activities and really commit to them. [19] X Research source Non-profit work – The larger and more prestigious the organization, the better. Think Habitat for Humanity or a Community Law Project or Clinic in your area. [20] X Research source Legal internship – Most legal internships are for non-profits, government, or the American Bar Association. They are good summer experiences, but not necessarily better than any other extracurricular activity. Debate – Debate teaches you a number of skills useful in law: memorization, crafting arguments, speaking extemporaneously, and analyzing texts, amongst them. [21] X Research source Pre-law – Pre-law societies run activities like mock trials and cross-examination exercises, and often have journals that you can contribute to. Participation builds valuable skills and shows a passion for law. [22] X Research source Model United Nations – Allows you to practice diplomacy and mediation. And since most law cases are settled before trial in mediation or arbitration, this is a vital skill. [23] X Research source Student government – Just serving is not enough. Focus on what you have done for your school and the specific changes you have implemented.

And if you take the right job, it can also give you exposure to the field of law. Any job in an intellectual field – teaching, working in government, clerking – will boost your resume, but here are some of the best jobs to consider: Paralegal or legal assistant – These jobs will not necessarily give you an advantage over other jobs – indeed, Harvard Law likes people with eclectic backgrounds – but they certainly won’t hurt you, and more importantly, they can help you to decide if law is right for you. [27] X Research source A non-law job related to the law field you are interested in. If you are interested in corporate law, you might work in business.

Grad GPAs are not factored into LSAC’s GPA calculations, but they are reported and can shows that you have matured as a student. [30] X Research source Graduate degrees can yield fresh recommendations from professors. Your degree can make you a more viable candidate for certain fields of law.

The question types are: [33] X Trustworthy Source Law School Admission Council Nonprofit organization which supports law schools and students in the applications process and administers the LSAT Go to source Reading Comprehension (one 35 minute section) – You will be asked to read a text and then answer questions about its content and structure. This question format will be familiar if you have taken the SAT, only the texts you must read will be more difficult. Analytical Reasoning (one 35 minute section) – Also known as Logic Games, these problems test your deductive reasoning and ability to structure data, and are of the type: “Jill, Bob, Susan, Erik, and Stan must be seated at the same table. Jill can’t sit next to Susan or Erik. Bob must be beside Stan…” Most test takers find them the most challenging part of the test.
