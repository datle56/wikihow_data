Size doesn't matter at this point, but make sure the canvas is bigger than 100 pixels on each side. To change your canvas size, follow these steps: Windows 10: Click on the Home tab, then click Resize . Change the vertical and horizontal to the same number (any number is okay, as long as it's bigger than 100). Windows 11: Click File > Image properties and change the width and height to the same number (any number is okay, as long as it's bigger than 100)."

On Windows 10, you cannot do this, so your icon must always have a solid background color. Click Layers in the top bar. A sidebar will appear showing the layers in your image. You automatically start with one layer, as well as a background layer (which is at the bottom of the sidebar). Hover the background layer and click the eye icon to disable the background. You will see that your canvas is now a gray checkerboard. When you save the image, any part of the canvas that shows the gray checkerboard will be transparent."
