This includes all forms of swearing. The only exceptions are experiences marked as 17+ in which the developer allows swearing in the chats. [1] X Research source Even if a developer allows you to swear in a 17+ experience, the rules against bullying, harassment, hate speech, incitement to violence, and strong sexual language still apply. For example, shouting an expletive after a jump scare or after an ambush would be allowed. Calling another player an expletive would not be allowed."
