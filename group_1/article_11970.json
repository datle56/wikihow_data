      "content": "Move target items out of your cat’s reach. The first way to deal with your cat’s feline pica is to cut off its access to the items it chews or eats the most. Move plants to high shelves, hide wires and cords (e.g. with plastic tubing), and keep laundry tucked away in drawers or closets. If your cat has a habit of chewing bedclothes, keep it locked out of any bedrooms."

      "content": "Dissuade your cat with a bad-tasting spray. To keep your cat from chewing or eating certain items, spray those items with a bitter taste deterrent spray for pets. These non-toxic sprays have an unpleasant flavour that will make once-coveted non-food items unappealing to your cat. Purchase a bitter spray online or at a pet store. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Offer safe alternatives to chew.",
      "content": "Offer safe alternatives to chew. If your cat has a compulsion to chew, offer it suitable alternatives like durable chew toys, rawhide bones, or dental sticks. If your cat compulsively eats plants, give it cat-friendly alternatives to your houseplants like a pot of grass or catnip, available at pet stores. Treat-filled puzzle toys will occupy your cat for hours and provide the chewing fix it needs."

    {
      "title": "Keep your cat busy.",
      "content": "Keep your cat busy. If you suspect that boredom may be causing your cat’s pica, trying enriching its environment and giving it things to do. Get scratching posts, puzzle toys, cat trees, and interactive games to keep your cat stimulated and busy. Try to engage your cat in at least 15-20 minutes of play each day, such as chasing or hunting games."

      "title": "Feed your cat more fiber.",
      "content": "Feed your cat more fiber. Ask your veterinarian if increasing your cat’s fiber intake would be a suitable way to curb its feline pica. Your cat’s pica may be due to it not feeling satisfied after eating its current diet, particularly if it is being fed high-carbohydrate dry cat food. High fiber, low-calorie food will allow your cat to consume more without increasing its calorie intake, and leave it feeling full for longer. Be sure to consult with your vet before altering your cat’s diet, as a large increase in fiber may cause digestive distress."

      "title": "Avoid change to your cat’s environment.",
      "content": "Avoid change to your cat’s environment. Stress can be a key factor in incidences of feline pica, so minimize stress as much as possible for your cat by avoiding change to its environment. Keep your pet’s litter box, food bowl, bed, and favorite toys in the same spot, and keep a solid routine for mealtimes. If a life event makes change a necessity (e.g. moving to a new home), keep things as familiar as possible for your cat by providing it with familiar items and introducing change slowly. [4] X Research source For example, if you move to a new house, set up all of your cat’s things (e.g. cat bed, litter box, toys) in a small room and let it get settled before introducing it to the rest of its new home."

      "content": "Buy a synthetic pheromone spray. Synthetic pheromone sprays mimic a cheek pheromone that cats release when bonding with each other or their owners, creating a calming effect. Ask your vet if this kind of spray would be an effective tool for dealing with your cat’s pica. For example, brands like Feliway, a synthetic pheromone available in spray or room diffuser form, are available through veterinary clinics or online. [5] X Research source"
