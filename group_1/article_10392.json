      "content": "Cut a piece of fabric large enough to cover both sides of your shelf. Measure your shelf to find the length and width of both sides, then measure the front edge of the shelf as well. Cut out a piece of fabric that can fold over both sides and the front edge of your shelf. [1] X Expert Source Tanglewood Sue DIY & Upcycling Specialist Expert Interview. 24 March 2021 Cotton fabric works the best for this project, since it is thick and sticks well to glue. [2] X Research source If you are using light colored fabric, paint your shelf the same color as your fabric so that it doesn’t show through. You can use patterned fabric for a fun accent piece, or solid-colored fabric for a more neutral shelf."

      "content": "Paint Modge Podge onto 1 side of the shelf with a paint brush. Spread a thin layer of Modge Podge glue on top of the shelf. Make sure to cover the entire side so that your fabric sticks to it evenly. [3] X Research source You can find Modge Podge at most craft supply stores. Modge Podge is a liquid glue, finisher, and sealer product that is usually used for decoupage projects. You can also spray the shelf with a low-tack adhesive so you're able to reposition the fabric.

      "content": "Place your fabric on top of the Modge Podge. Line up the edges of the fabric with the edges of the shelf. Leave the end of the fabric hanging off the front of the shelf so you can wrap it around and underneath. [5] X Research source Make sure you smooth down the fabric well with your hands after you place it on top of the Modge Podge. If your shelves are lined with a wooden rim or you don’t mind leaving the bottom part uncovered, you can trim your fabric so it only fits on the top part of the shelf."

      "content": "Paint Modge Podge onto the bottom side of the shelf. Flip your shelf over and cover the other side with a thin layer of Modge Podge. You only need a thin layer to make your shelf sticky, so you don’t need to add a lot. [8] X Research source If your shelf is attached to the wall or a cabinet, carefully paint glue on the underside of the shelf without flipping it over."

Smooth it down with your hands to get rid of any creases or bumps. [9] X Research source The bottom of your shelf will probably be the most visible when you hang it up, so make sure this side looks really good."

      "content": "Let your shelves sit for 4 days to dry. Since your shelves have a lot of Modge Podge on them, they will need a while to dry. Leave them in a cool, dry place in your home to set before you hang them up or put books and knick knacks on them. [12] X Research source Make sure the uncovered side of your shelves faces the wall when you hang them up so that you can’t see it."
