      "content": "The phrase means “Do you feel beautiful?” “Bonita” is the Spanish word for “beautiful,” and “Do you feel bonita” is usually phrased as a question—so it means asking someone if they feel beautiful. It’s also a viral TikTok trend, although the full viral phrase is, “Do you or do you not feel bonita?” [1] X Research source For example, you might jokingly ask someone if they “feel bonita” after giving them an over-the-top makeover!"

      "content": "The scene from Family Guy went viral on TikTok in January 2023. In December 2022, TikTok user @spencerkennedy62 posted a video with the “Do you feel bonita” clip in it; then, in January 2023, another TikTok video using the audio from that clip went viral on the platform. That video has been deleted, so its creator is unknown, but other TikTok users quickly began using the “Do you feel bonita” audio in their own videos. [3] X Research source For example, TikTok user @the.cheeese.mann (whose account is no longer active) posted a reanimation of the original Family Guy scene with the audio clip included, which gained around 4 million plays in 18 days. After that, the audio in @the.cheeese.mann’s video became the main audio clip used by other creators. By March 7, 2023, there were over 141,800 videos using the “Do you or do you not feel bonita?” audio on TikTok."

      "content": "Lip sync to the dialogue while acting out funny scenarios. “Do you or do you not feel bonita?” is mainly used in silly skits wherein one person forces another to dress up, wear something fancy, or even just does their makeup or hair in an elaborate way while the other person seems unenthusiastic about it. You could do something similar with a friend, partner, or family member! For example: @krissieswanger's TikTok playfully references “self-care” as she makes her partner do facials with her. This TikTok from @bilalahy involves the creator lip-syncing to the Family Guy audio, pretending to be his girlfriend doing his makeup (and then showing his own reaction to it). This TikTok shows creator @taymccomish putting on a pair of hoop earrings and lip syncing to say they make her feel “bonita.” In this TikTok , creator @shane_beveridge is using a glamor filter on their phone to jokingly show that it makes them feel “bonita.”"

      "content": "Do a silly skit about dressing up your pet. Another popular TikTok trend involves users putting clothing or harmless accessories (like bows and hats) on their pets with the Family Guy audio playing in the background. It’s a fun way to joke about the long-suffering way pets put up with being doted on by their human caretakers! For example: [4] X Research source In this TikTok , creator @weeniecole puts a hat on her cat and asks if he “feels bonita.” And in this TikTok , creator @vanillamace puts fake eyelashes on her cat while lip-syncing to the “Do you or do you not feel bonita” audio."

      "content": "Pretend to be giving someone a supportive pep talk. Some TikTok users make videos pretending the “Do you or do you not feel bonita?” audio is them giving insecure friends or loved ones a pep talk to help them feel more beautiful. In turn, the “I feel bonita” response is their loved ones begrudgingly accepting the support. For example, this TikTok from @spillinthetee has the caption, “Me getting ready if my bestie starts feeling insecure” (and this TikTok from @duhveena has a very similar theme, too)."
