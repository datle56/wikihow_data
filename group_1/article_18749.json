This way, when you're training or traveling through dangerous areas, like caves, tall grass, and dungeons, you can escape to the entrance of the area with Dig if necessary. You might also give this ability to a Pokémon you don't plan on using much so you don't have to sacrifice valuable ability slots, as each Pokémon can only have a maximum of five abilities at any time. TM's are one-time use items. This means if you trade the Pokémon you teach TM28 to, you won't be able to teach the ability to another Pokémon. In this situation, you'll have to raise a Pokémon that learns Dig naturally. [3] X Research source"

This route is in western Hoenn; it connects to Rustboro City and Rusturf Tunnel. Walk in this area until you randomly encounter Nincada.

However, you should be careful not to do too much damage; doing so will result in the Pokémon fainting and you having to find a new one to capture. Nincada is a small bug-type Pokémon with a decent defense power. It is weak against flying, fire, water, and ice type attacks. It is strong against fighting, poison, and ground type attacks. Trapinch is also a ground-type Pokémon with decent attack power. It is weak against water, grass, and ice type attacks. It is strong against poison and rock attacks. [8] X Research source Once Nincada or Trapinch is weakened by your attacks and has low HP, you'll have to throw a Poké Ball to capture it. Be sure you have enough of your best Poké Balls in your inventory before leaving to capture one. If you find that your Pokémon are too strong and do too much damage to either of these wild Pokémon, you might want to use attacks Trapinch and Nincada are strong against. This will do reduced damage. This way, you can do small amounts of damage until the Pokémon is weakened enough for you to catch it."
