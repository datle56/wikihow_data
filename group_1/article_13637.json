      "content": "Read the question carefully. Start by reading the exam question slowly and carefully. [2] X Research source If you are taking a physical test, use a blank sheet of paper to cover the possible answers below the question. This will allow you to focus on just the question. You can also read the question more than once to ensure you understand it. Take your time and do not rush through the question."

    {
      "title": "Analyze the wording of the question.",
      "content": "Analyze the wording of the question. Look for any negative phrases in the question, such as “Choose an answer that doesn’t describe…”. Check if there is a judgement phrase in the question like “Choose the most correct answer” or “Choose the best option.” [3] X Research source You should also analyze the question for any phrasing that asks for multiple answers to the question, such as “Choose more than one answer” or “Choose two of the four options.”"

      "title": "Come up with your own answer to the question.",
      "content": "Come up with your own answer to the question. Before you dive into the possible answers provided for the question, see if you can answer it on your own. Think about the question and come up with your own answer based on your existing knowledge. [4] X Research source Doing this can help you think of an answer before you look at the multiple choice options. Chances are, the answer you come up with is one of the options for the question. If you can’t come up with your own answer, don’t fret. You can use the answers provided to come up with the right answer for the question."

      "content": "Look for qualifiers. Qualifiers are words that express specific circumstances or conditions. These will help you limit the number of possible answers. There are a few categories of qualifiers: Indications of time: before, after, while, always, never Superlatives: most, least, most common, fastest, the best, the only Conditionals: each time X happens, if X happens, unless X, assuming X"

      "title": "Review all the possible answers.",
      "content": "Review all the possible answers. Once you have processed the question, look at all the choices presented to you. Most multiple choice exams provide four to six possible answers per question. In some cases, you may only be given two options. [5] X Research source Take your time and read over each possible answer. Do not skim or skip over any possible answers. This will ensure you make an informed decision about the correct answer to the question."

      "title": "Eliminate the answers that appear incorrect.",
      "content": "Eliminate the answers that appear incorrect. Put a small mark by answers that appear incorrect right away. You may know that one or two answers are incorrect, or have a strong feeling they are not right. Eliminate any answers that seem incorrect to you, based on your interpretation of the question. [6] X Research source Look for possible answers that have “always,” “never,” and “none of the above” in them, as they are usually incorrect. When you go over the answers, avoid thinking that your instructor is trying to trip you up with sneaky or confusing options. Most instructors won't give you \"trick\" answers like this."

      "title": "Look for an answer that fully addresses the question.",
      "content": "Look for an answer that fully addresses the question. Ask yourself whether the answer you have chosen fully answers the question. Do not go for an answer that only partly answers the question, as it is likely incorrect. Trust your gut feeling and go for an answer that responds fully to the question and seems correct to you. [7] X Research source For example, you may be torn between two answers for the question. Try out both answers for the question. Read the question to yourself and place each answer at the end of the question. Pick the one that appears the most correct to you."

      "content": "Answer the questions in order. Do not skip around on the test and answer the ones you know first. Skipping around can waste valuable time, especially if you are doing a timed exam. Try to work through each question one at a time and in order so you make sure you answer them all to the best of your ability. [8] X Research source If you get stuck on one question, try to work through it slowly. If you are really stumped, put a star or mark next to it so you know to come back to it at the very end of the exam."

      "content": "Do not leave any questions unanswered. Doing this can make you lose points on the exam. In some cases, leaving the questions blank will gain you no points or the instructor may deduct points. Choosing an answer based on your judgement and knowledge may land you at least one or two points more on the exam. [9] X Research source When in doubt on an answer to a difficult question on the exam, go with your best judgement and choose the best answer you can identify from the list of options."

If you have struggled with multiple choice exams in the past, you may ask the instructor if they can provide practice tests for the course. You can also ask them for examples of questions from old exams. [12] X Research source Use the old exams and example questions to prepare for the test. Study the structure of the questions as well as the provided answers. Take several practice tests to get better at multiple choice style exams.
