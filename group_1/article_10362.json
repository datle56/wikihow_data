      "content": "Match your makeup to your skin tone. A close match between your concealer, foundation, and skin tone will give you the most natural look. Look at your inner wrist under natural light to determine whether you have warm, neutral, or cool undertones . Visit a beauty store and test out a variety of products that are designed to flatter your shade and undertones. [1] X Research source Note that some products change color slightly after 1-2 hours of contact with the oils in your skin. For instance, the perfect shade of foundation might get yellowy by the end of the day. Try out samples to see what looks and feels the best after a full day of wear. If your skin gets paler or darker depending on the season, pick one set of products to match your summer skin tone and another for your winter shade."

      "content": "Opt for mattifying concealers, liquid foundations, and setting powders. Makeup products that create a matte finish will visually soften and smooth the texture of your skin. Refrain from using dewy, luminous foundations and powders all over your face, since these tend to emphasize the texture of your skin. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick products that are labeled as non-comedogenic or oil-free. Unfortunately, some makeup and skincare products can clog your pores, which can make your acne worse. Read the labels on the products you choose to make sure they say they're non-comedogenic or oil-free. This means they shouldn't clog your pores.

      "title": "Choose lightweight, blendable, full-coverage products.",
      "content": "Choose lightweight, blendable, full-coverage products. Full coverage cosmetics are desirable as they will create an even canvas of color across your face. This will make any indentations less noticeable. Look for a full-coverage product that still feels lightweight and blendable on your skin. Products that offer moisturizing or emollient properties will blend nicely without leaving a dry, cakey residue. Products with words like “camouflage” in the title are designed to cover up areas of discoloration, from dark spots to tattoos. These could be a good solution if your acne scars are significantly darker than the rest of your face. [4] X Research source If you want full coverage over your scars but lighter coverage on the rest of your face, try using a medium-coverage foundation or even a highly pigmented tinted moisturizer that is designed for layering."

      "title": "Select long-lasting formulas.",
      "content": "Select long-lasting formulas. Many foundations and powders promise “24-hour coverage” or “long-lasting” coverage. Stick with a product like this to avoid midday touch-ups. Additionally, if you anticipate sweat, tears, or being around water, select waterproof cosmetics. However, don't wear waterproof products often, as they can clog your pores. [5] X Research source If you wear waterproof products, make sure you use a makeup remover that's formulated to remove them. If you leave makeup on your face, it may clog your pores."

      "title": "Choose a “pore-eliminating” foundation primer for your base layer.",
      "content": "Choose a “pore-eliminating” foundation primer for your base layer. Makeup primers and foundation primers create a uniform base layer that other cosmetic products can be layered onto. Many primers enable long-lasting wear, and a primer described as “poreless,” “pore-eliminating,” or “skin-smoothing” will establish a smoother skin texture. [6] X Expert Source Ashleigh Grounds Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. Primers help keep your makeup in place so it lasts longer. Primers won’t literally remove your pores but will instead fill them in, helping mask the indentations left by acne scarring and creating the appearance of a smoother canvas for cosmetics to be applied to.

      "content": "Try concealers that are specially formulated for use on acne scars and breakouts. Look for a product containing phrases like “breakout concealer” or “acne concealer” on the labels. These are designed to treat current breakouts and prevent future irritations. [8] X Research source For deep scarring, silicone-based acne scar fillers apply a layer of silicone to the surface of your skin.

      "content": "Use a color-correcting concealer to cancel out dark spots. Acne has a cool tone, so using warm shades can balance it out. If you have light skin, use a golden peach concealer. For medium skin, choose a peach undertone. If your skin is dark, opt for a dark orange tinted color-corrector. Stipple the color-corrector onto clean, moisturized skin and seal it with a finishing powder. It might look a little odd at first, but once you layer foundation over the color-correcting product you’ll see the dark spots disappear.

[11] X Expert Source Ashleigh Grounds Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. Try not to blend the foundation into the color-correcting product below. The goal is to keep these layers separate so that they each do their job separately."

      "title": "Try airbrush makeup or spray-on foundation.",
      "content": "Try airbrush makeup or spray-on foundation. Airbrush makeup kits are typically sold at professional-level prices and will require some practice before you achieve a flawless, evenly layered finish. But you can pick up a spray-on foundation product to get similar results. These types of products deliver a fine mist evenly across your skin, which can be layered for the perfect amount of coverage. Mist and spray foundations are pricier than liquid formulas but they allow you to emulate the look of airbrush makeup at home without the equipment investment. [12] X Research source Airbrush makeup tends to photograph well, so consider booking the services of a makeup artist for a special event. If you’re a makeup artist, consider airbrush equipment an essential part of your kit. Clients typically pay more for airbrushing services. Your clients with acne scars may appreciate having the option to experience the pampering and uniform finish."

Make sure to wash it after each use to prevent bacterial growth. [22] X Research source You can layer buildable products for more coverage over darker spots.

Move across your face until you get a complete layer of coverage. [24] X Research source Choose a translucent powder to set your makeup for a natural day look. If you're doing a night look, pick a powder that matches your skin tone for additional coverage. However, using a powder that's your skin tone can create a heavy look.

Although luminous products won’t provide good coverage for scarred areas, a dash of fluid or powder highlighter can restore a glow to your matte face. The trick is to place highlighter sparingly on smooth parts of your skin. It will help your favorite features stand out while drawing attention away from the scarring. [25] X Research source Try dotting highlighter along the tops of your cheekbones, above your browbone, or at the tip of your nose. You can also dab it in your inner eye and across your lid."
