If you’re on a low-potassium diet, then consume no more than 2,000 mg per day so normalize your levels. Keep track of your diet and stay within this range. [2] X Research source Your doctor or dietitian may suggest a different daily level. If so, follow their instructions."

You can eat most of these foods without worrying about going over your daily limit, but still pay attention to serving sizes so you don’t accidentally eat too much.

You can have some medium-potassium foods as long as you’re careful to limit how much you eat. In general, cut out high-potassium foods entirely. Medium-potassium foods include asparagus, carrots, collard greens, Brussel sprouts, corn, cherries, grapefruit, pears, and oranges. High-potassium foods you should eat cautiously include avocados, bananas, dried fruits, artichokes, honeydew, potatoes, spinach, beets, bran, chocolate, granola, milk, and peanut butter.

Start by washing and peeling the food. Slice it into 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) sections and rinse them off in warm water. Then soak them in warm water, using at least 10 times more water than food. Leave them for 2 hours, then rinse them off once more before cooking them. [10] X Research source Leaching doesn’t take all of the potassium out of these foods, so watch your portion sizes so you don't eat too much.
