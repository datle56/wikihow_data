Reader Poll: We asked 1258 wikiHow readers who've asked someone out, and 55% of them agreed that the best way to do so is by casually suggesting to hang out and spend time together. [Take Poll] So if she asks to hang out a lot, even if she doesn’t directly call it a date, she’s probably into you!"

You may be in a relationship before you know it! [11] X Research source Subtly express your queer preferences to let her know you dig her as more than a friend. Try saying something casual like, “My ex-girlfriend would’ve hated this place,” or “It’s a lesbian community. I’d fit right in.” Is it possible for a straight woman to be attracted to another woman? Absolutely! Remember, sexuality is fluid. Let your feelings come and go as they please."

Maybe you’re happily in a relationship or don’t view yourself in anything but a heterosexual relationship. Either way, if she’s showing obvious flirtatious signs, put her down gently . Try bringing up your sexual preferences or current relationship with something like: “I’m flattered, but I’m not into girls that way. But I’d love to hang out as friends sometime, if you’re cool with that.” “My partner and I used to come here all the time.” “I’m straight, but I’ve got a friend who’s available.”"

It’s totally fine to keep the friendship or conversation going without labeling yourself or confessing an attraction. Know that there’s no pressure to define or identify your sexual orientation. Follow your heart and do what’s best for you. If you’re close friends, consider being honest with her. Express that you’re unsure if you like her romantically by saying something like, “I like you, Betty, but I’m not sure if what I’m feeling is something for a friend or something more,” or “When you say things like that, are you flirting with me? Because it makes me feel uncomfortable.”"

      "title": "Admiring a friend often differs from being sexually attracted to a friend.",
      "content": "Admiring a friend often differs from being sexually attracted to a friend. When you admire someone, you may find yourself thinking, “Wow. I wish I was like them.” Perhaps you look up to their work ethic or kind nature. Romantic attraction, on the other hand, could lead you to think, “I really want to kiss them right now.” If you’re romantically attracted to someone, you think of them as an intimate partner you want to sexually or passionately interact with. [14] X Research source Can friendship lead to attraction? Definitely, especially in WLW relationships. Women often form close bonds with each other before they start dating—first being friends and then becoming lovers. Not all romantic attraction is physical; there’s also emotional attraction. Do you want to share intimate secrets and details with this person more than other friends? If so, you may be attracted to them emotionally. Remember, it’s okay to be confused by your feelings. Listen to them, acknowledge them, and do what’s best for you."
