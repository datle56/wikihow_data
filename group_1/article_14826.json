      "content": "Pedal quickly toward a turn. The faster you’re going when you get to the turn, the easier it will be to get your back tire to skid. Riding downhill toward a turn can help you pick up speed. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Lean in the direction of the turn once you reach it.",
      "content": "Lean in the direction of the turn once you reach it. Shift your body weight in the direction you’re turning so your body and bike are at about a 45-degree angle from the ground. Keep leaning as you go around the corner of the turn. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re taking a left turn, lean your body to the left."

    {
      "title": "Shift your weight forward as you go around the turn.",
      "content": "Shift your weight forward as you go around the turn. To shift your weight, lean slightly forward over your handlebars. This will lighten the load on your back tire, which will let it skid off the ground. As you’re going around the turn, you should start to feel your back tire skidding outward. Gently press the rear brake if you need help getting the tire to break loose. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Extend your inside foot out so it’s hovering slightly above the ground.",
      "content": "Extend your inside foot out so it’s hovering slightly above the ground. Your inside foot is your foot that’s closest to the inside corner of the turn. Continue to hold your foot out just above the ground as you go around the turn. [4] X Research source For example, if you’re taking a right turn, your right foot would be your inside foot. If you feel like you’re skidding out of control or your bike is going to spin out, plant your inside foot on the ground to stabilize yourself."

      "title": "Bring your body and bike upright again once you complete the turn.",
      "content": "Bring your body and bike upright again once you complete the turn. This will help your back tire regain traction after skidding. To bring yourself upright on your bike, stop leaning into the turn and pull your body weight up. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice skidding at slower speeds first.",
      "content": "Practice skidding at slower speeds first. Skidding is easier when you’re going faster, but higher speeds can increase your chances of wiping out. When you first start out, approach turns slowly and work on leaning into the turn and shifting your weight forward. Once you get the motions down, gradually increase your speed going into the turn.

      "title": "Try skidding in a gravel parking lot before you practice on a trail.",
      "content": "Try skidding in a gravel parking lot before you practice on a trail. Use cones or another marker to indicate where you should turn in the parking lot. Then, pedal toward that spot and try to get your back tire to skid outward as you go around the turn. Practicing in a parking lot is safer than practicing on a downhill trail, and you won’t have to worry about damaging the trail. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Skid around wide, round turns when you’re starting out.",
      "content": "Skid around wide, round turns when you’re starting out. Thin, sharp turns give you less room for error and less time to skid, so they're not the best to practice on. Look for turns that are round and wide so you have more time to work on your form as you go around them. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Be persistent.",
      "content": "Be persistent. Skidding is an advanced biking move, and it can take a lot of practice to get it down. If you keep spinning out or your back tire isn’t skidding outward, try adjusting how much you’re leaning in and shifting your weight forward. You can even ask someone to film you practicing so you can see what your form looks like. Keep practicing and eventually you’ll get there!"
