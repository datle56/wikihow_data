This method works if and only if: [1] X Research source There are no exponents on the variables There are only two variables, neither of which are fractions (for example, you would not have 1 x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{x}}} The equation can be simplified to the form y = m x + b {\\displaystyle y=mx+b} , where m and b are constants (numbers like 3, 10, -12, 4 3 , 3 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{3}},{\\frac {3}{5}}} )."

If your equation is already in the right form, y = m x + b {\\displaystyle y=mx+b} , then simply pick the number in the \"m\" position (but if there is no number written in front of x then the slope is 1). [2] X Research source That is your slope! Note that this number, m , is always multiplied by the variable, in this case an \"x.\" Check the following examples: y = 2 x + 6 {\\displaystyle y=2x+6} Slope = 2 y = 2 − x {\\displaystyle y=2-x} Slope = -1 y = 3 8 x − 10 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {3}{8}}x-10} Slope = 3 8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{8}}}"

You can add, subtract, multiply, and more to isolate a variable, usually the \"y.\" Just remember that, whatever you do to one side of the equal sign (like add 3) you must do to the other side as well. Your final goal is an equation similar to y = m x + b {\\displaystyle y=mx+b} . For example: Find the slope of 2 y − 3 = 8 x + 7 {\\displaystyle 2y-3=8x+7} Set to the form y = m x + b {\\displaystyle y=mx+b} : 2 y − 3 + 3 = 8 x + 7 + 3 {\\displaystyle 2y-3+3=8x+7+3} 2 y = 8 x + 10 {\\displaystyle 2y=8x+10} 2 y 2 = 8 x + 10 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2y}{2}}={\\frac {8x+10}{2}}} y = 4 x + 5 {\\displaystyle y=4x+5} Find the slope: Slope = M = 4 [3] X Research source"

While finding the slope, keep in mind the following information to help you check if you're on the right track: [4] X Research source Positive slopes go higher the further right you go. Negative slopes go lower the further right you go. Bigger slopes are steeper lines. Small slopes are always more gradual. Perfectly horizontal lines have a slope of zero. Perfectly vertical lines do not have a slope at all. Their slope is \"undefined.\" [5] X Research source"

The line can be curved or straight -- it doesn't matter. Think of it as how much the line is changing at any time, instead of the slope of the entire line. How you take derivatives changes depending on the type of function you have, so review how to take common derivatives before moving on. Review taking derivatives here The most simple derivatives, those for basic polynomial equations, are easy to find using a simple shortcut. This will be used for the rest of the method."

      "content": "Understand what questions are asking for a slope using derivatives. You will not always be asked to explicitly find the derivative or slope of a curve. You might also be asked for the \"rate of change at point (x,y). You could be asked for an equation for the slope of the graph, which simply means you need to take the derivative. Finally, you may be asked for \"the slope of the tangent line at (x,y).\" This, once again, just wants the slope of the curve at a specific point, (x,y). To calculate the slope of the tangent line, you need to take the first derivative, and add in the x value into your derivative to get your slope. For this method, consider the question: \"What is the slope of the line f ( x ) = 2 x 2 + 6 x {\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x} at the point (4,2)?\" [12] X Research source The derivative is often written as f ′ ( x ) , y ′ , {\\displaystyle f'(x),y',} or d y d x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}}}"

      "content": "Check your point against a graph whenever possible. Know that not all points in calculus will have a slope. Calculus gets into complex equations and difficult graphs, and not all points will have a slope, or even exist on every graph. Whenever possible, use a graphing calculator to check the slope of your graph. If you can't, draw the tangent line using your point and the slope (remember -- \"rise over run\") and note if it looks like it could be correct. [15] X Research source Tangent lines are just lines with the exact same slope as your point on the curve. To draw one, go up (positive) or down (negative) your slope (in the case of the example, 22 points up). Then move over one and draw a point. Connect the dots, (4,2) and (26,3) for your line."
