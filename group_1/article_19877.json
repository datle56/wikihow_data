      "title": "Practice good personal hygiene.",
      "content": "Practice good personal hygiene. Before you meet with the person, take care of basic grooming: shower, comb your hair, brush/floss your teeth, apply deodorant, and put on fresh clothing. You might also chew mint gum and lightly spritz on perfume or cologne. [1] X Research source When you look and smell your best, you feel great. As a result, you come off as more confident and likeable to others."

      "title": "Smile when you see them.",
      "content": "Smile when you see them. A real smile conveys interest and excitement about the other person, so show your pearly whites when you greet them. Smiling when you see the person also makes you appear more attractive and likeable. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Display good posture and open body language.",
      "content": "Display good posture and open body language. How you hold your body can make you appear more confident and encourage others to approach you. Sit up straight, pull your shoulders back, and lift your chin. Uncross your arms and legs, make eye contact, and turn to face the person. [3] X Research source You might also power pose to seem more confident by placing your hands on your hips or folding your arms behind your head to form an inverted triangle. Whatever pose you choose, make sure it's relaxed, not forced. Forced body language looks awkward and makes people think that you're trying to put on a show. You may want to practice open, confident body language when you're alone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remember their name and something about them.",
      "content": "Remember their name and something about them. Remembering and using someone's name makes them feel special, so use it regularly in conversation. You can also show you like them (and ultimately make them like you) by following up on some tidbit of information you know about them. [4] X Research source For example, you might say, “Hey, Noah! How did that math test go?” if the last time you spoke they mentioned having to study. Resist the urge to cyber stalk them to learn their interests. If you start talking to them about an interest they haven't told you about, the situation could get awkward. They may also draw the conclusion that you have an unhealthy interest in them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respect others' boundaries and personal space.",
      "content": "Respect others' boundaries and personal space. You want to increase the odds of someone liking you by avoiding any awkwardness or discomfort. Recognize their personal space by standing at least an arm's length away when talking. Also, don't pry into their personal business or bring up sensitive topics. [5] X Research source Once you're sure the person likes you, you can move closer during conversation. Also, they may eventually feel more comfortable disclosing personal topics once they know you better. Respecting boundaries also applies to social media. Don't flood the person's social media profiles or push your virtual relationship further than is appropriate for your level of in-person relationship. The person could see your advances as out of place and inappropriate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get them talking about their hobbies and interests.",
      "content": "Get them talking about their hobbies and interests. If you can spot some common interests that the two of you share, that's a great place to steer the conversation. If not, ask some open-ended questions to learn more about what the person likes. Also, a good way to attract this person is to become friends with them and create a bond! [6] X Research source For example, you might ask, “What brings you to this conference?” or “What sort of music do you like?” Open-ended questions require more expansive answers that keep the conversation going."

    {
      "title": "Make a thoughtful gesture.",
      "content": "Make a thoughtful gesture. Do something for the person without them asking. However, make sure that you aren't acting inappropriately. Choose something that would commonly be done by a friend or acquaintance, whichever is appropriate for your relationship. For example, if they miss a class, ask them if they want a copy of your notes. If they're ill, bring them chicken noodle soup."

      "title": "Be an attentive listener.",
      "content": "Be an attentive listener . People enjoy talking about themselves, so let them. Orient to face them and listen to their entire message without interrupting. [7] X Research source Once they pause, paraphrase what they said back to them to be sure you're clear on what they're sharing. This lets them know that you're truly listening and provides the chance for them to clear up any misunderstandings so that you fully get their message. Listen with your whole body. Make eye contact with the other person, lean forward a bit, nod in agreement or understanding. Keep in mind that if you spend the whole time talking about yourself, you won't get to know the person better, and they may not think you’re interested in them. Let them do most of the talking."

    {
      "title": "Pay them a compliment.",
      "content": "Pay them a compliment. Compliments make people feel special, but it also endears them to you. Comment on their appearance, a particular skill they have, or an insight they make during conversation. Try not to focus on only one area, like appearance. [8] X Research source Say, “Cool shirt! I'm a Harry Potter fan, too\" or “Wow, that's a really neat idea!”"

      "content": "Ask them for help or advice. Naturally, people are attracted to people who are able to accept guidance and are willing to learn.

[10] X Research source You might say, “Hey, I remember you said you're good with computers. My laptop keeps freezing up. Can you take a look at it for me, please?”"

    {
      "title": "Do a favor.",
      "content": "Do a favor. The same logic that ensures someone will like you if you ask them for help works in reverse. Help the person in some small way and they will like you even more. [11] X Research source If you know the person always forgets their pencil when they come to class, have one ready for them. If they desperately need someone to watch their pet over the weekend, offer to do it."

      "title": "Prioritize spending time with them.",
      "content": "Prioritize spending time with them. Typically, people want to spend time with people who act like they want to spend time with them, so show the person that you enjoy their company.

      "content": "Let your quirks show. You may think it's a good idea to act totally cool in front of this person. In reality, they’ve got quirks and they'll feel much more comfortable around you if you don't hide yours. Sing a tad off-key without being embarrassed, confess that you still watch your favorite childhood cartoons, or admit that you dip your fries in barbecue sauce. [13] X Research source Sharing the little silly things that define you will bring you closer to the other person. Also, a minor disclosure deepens your relationship, since you probably haven't told everyone this information."

      "title": "Communicate honestly, but with tact.",
      "content": "Communicate honestly, but with tact. Most people like others who are able to give it to them straight. Lying or fudging the truth may make you seem untrustworthy, so aim to be truthful. You should still exercise tact, though. [14] X Research source For instance, if the person asks if you like their favorite movie, say “Hmm, it's not really my thing, but I did like the main character's personality. I can see why you like him—he's hilarious!” Don't say, “No, I hate that movie!”"

      "title": "Stand behind your values and beliefs.",
      "content": "Stand behind your values and beliefs. One thing that's distinctive about you is the principles and convictions that you hold dear. Those things are at the core of who you are, so it's important to stay true to yourself, even at the risk of someone not liking you. Sticking to your beliefs takes courage. It's not easy to be the one who stands up to a bully or refuses to go along with a harmful or dangerous prank.

      "title": "Respect yourself.",
      "content": "Respect yourself. Having healthy self-respect means you like yourself no matter what. When you're communicating with others, avoid comparing yourself to others or belittling yourself in any way. [15] X Research source Remind yourself of your strengths by listing them out to yourself. You might say, “I'm a great listener” or “I can make people laugh.” Respecting yourself also means not doing anything that goes against your personal beliefs or values. Self-respect is key to earning respect from others. It's difficult for people to treat you with real regard if you don't treat yourself well."

      "title": "Set your intention.",
      "content": "Set your intention. When you have a clear intention, it helps you focus your thoughts, energy, and actions toward your desired outcome. Take some time to think about what kind of love you want to manifest. Do you want a long-term relationship or a casual one? What kind of qualities are important to you in a partner? How do you want to feel in the relationship? What are you looking for in a relationship? Writing down your intentions can be helpful in clarifying what you want to attract. You could try writing a letter to your future partner, creating a vision board, or keeping a journal of your thoughts and feelings about love. You can also write them in a specific format depending on what manifestation method you are using. Try to frame your intentions in positive language. For example, instead of saying “I don’t want to be alone anymore,” you could say “I am ready for a loving relationship.” This helps you focus on what you want to attract, rather than what you want to avoid. Remember that you are deserving of love and trust that the universe will bring the right person into your life at the right time. It’s also important to be open to receiving love in unexpected ways and to take action towards manifesting-love, such as joining a dating app or pursuing hobbies that interest you."

      "content": "Live with the Physical Law of the Universe. Physical laws of the universe are vital for manifestation. The physical laws of the universe govern everything in the universe, so if you can tap into such universal power, you can almost certainly manifest anything you desire into your real life. According to the law of attraction, when people focus on positive thoughts and feelings, they will attract positive experiences and circumstances into their lives, while focusing on negative thoughts and feelings will attract negative experiences. This law is often associated with the idea that “like attracts like” and that people can manifest their desires through positive thinking and visualization. By shifting your energy and thinking to align with your desired outcome (expect someone to like you in this case), you can eventually attract the necessary situations and opportunities to make it a reality."
