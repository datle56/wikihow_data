      "content": "Turn off the harsh overhead light and use small lamps instead. Low light in warm tones creates a feeling of privacy and intimacy. Place your lights along the outside walls of the room to enhance the relaxed feeling of the room. Fairy lights are another inexpensive option for low light. To set the mood even further, swap out your regular bulbs for colored bulbs . Red and purple light build feelings of love, romance, and intimacy. Extend your soft lighting into the bathroom as well—there's nothing like that bright overhead bathroom light to put a damper on the mood!

      "content": "Candles provide intimate, dramatic soft light. Candles of different heights and colors create more texture and ambiance. If you're buying candles specifically for the occasion, go for LED candles —they're safer and more economical since you can use them over and over. [1] X Research source Keep candles towards the perimeter of the room and make sure they're on a stable surface, especially if you have open flames. If you're using scented candles, make sure the scents complement each other (like sandalwood and rose) and you don't have more than one or two—you don't want them to be overpowering."

      "content": "Patchouli and rosewood are known as aphrodisiacs. Jasmine and cherry blossom are other romantic options that help put you in the mood for love. [2] X Research source Tread lightly with the sense of smell—you don't want to be overpowering. But a single scented candle or stick of incense can enhance the romantic atmosphere. If an open flame makes you nervous, put a couple of drops of essential oil in a vaporizer instead."

      "title": "Rose petals add a touch of drama to your romantic scene.",
      "content": "Rose petals add a touch of drama to your romantic scene. Real rose petals can get pricey, but artificial rose petals provide the same ambiance at a fraction of the cost. Arrange the petals in a heart shape on the bed, scatter them around the bed, or create a path from your front door for your partner to follow straight to your romantic scene. [3] X Research source If your partner loves flowers, add a few long-stem roses for an extra dramatic touch. You might set them in a vase beside the bed or lay them on the pillows—just be careful of the thorns!"

      "content": "Mosquito netting or curtains create a private little cocoon. You don't need a canopy bed frame to have a romantic canopy. Buy a bed canopy that's specifically designed to hang from the ceiling and drape the fabric around the sides of the bed. [4] X Research source Hang curtains or even sheets from the ceiling for another option. Drape the fabric loosely so that it billows around the bed. Add layers of drapes to your windows to create a more romantic scene."

      "content": "Mix smooth, silky fabrics with plush fabrics to delight the senses. When you make the bed, flip the sheet upside down. Then, you'll get the front side of the decorative hem when you flip the sheet over the blanket. If your sheets are smooth, put a woven or textured blanket over top, then add a cloud-like comforter. [5] X Research source Throw blankets are a great way to add texture as well—try one in faux fur or velvet."

      "title": "Use different sizes and shapes of pillows",
      "content": "Use different sizes and shapes of pillows to create points of interest. Different covers or pillow shams add texture and variety as well. If you don't have extra pillow shams handy, wrap a pillow in a blanket. You could even use a sweater or shirt and tie the sleeves around the pillow to hold it in place. [6] X Research source Put your largest pillows in the back to anchor your display. Then gradually work out to the smallest pillows in front."

      "content": "Many people think of champagne as the most romantic drink. If you and your partner enjoy a little alcohol, there's no doubt that champagne should be your drink of choice for your romantic evening. Chill the bottle ahead of time so it's ready to go, and set it out with two matching flutes. Strawberries and chocolate are other sexy treats you can have available if you think you and your partner are going to get the munchies. Besides, playing around with chocolate syrup can be a lot of fun."

      "content": "Put any oils, lubricants, condoms, or toys in a pretty basket. Regardless of what you have planned, you want everything to be ready to go—there's nothing sexy about hunting for something you need. Line your basket with a piece of cloth that matches your color scheme (washcloths or hand towels work great for this purpose). Why not give your partner a massage with a special massage oil ? It's a great way to start a romantic evening."

[7] X Research source Reflecting small lights and candles can also make the room feel brighter. Place a mirror facing the bed if you're not shy—many couples find it sexy to watch themselves in the mirror."

      "content": "Make your own playlist for a personal touch. R&B and jazz are commonly considered pretty sexy and romantic genres, but go with what you and your partner enjoy. If you're creating a playlist, include songs that are meaningful or significant to you as a couple. [8] X Research source Keep the volume low enough that the music is just noticeable. If you're using the speakers on your phone, make sure you turn off notifications so you don't get interrupted!"
