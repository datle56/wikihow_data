[6] X Research source If you are unsure or don't want them to know what you are doing, don't lie to them, tell them to mind their own business, or get defensive, just say \"I don't know\". Sometimes it can be enough to hush them up. If they persist, just carry on saying I don't know. Eventually, they will stop asking. Lying and getting defensive only makes them think you have something to hide and it can cause the nosey person to bother you more or get angry."

If you catch someone going through your personal possessions, (i.e. going through your diary, looking through your drawers, private papers, emails, documents, etc.) challenge him or her by asking what are they doing or say, \"Can I help you there?\". If you are brave enough, say in a calm voice, \"Please ask my permission before looking through my private possessions.\" Be calm. If you get angry or on the defensive, it could be taken as a signal that you have something to hide."
