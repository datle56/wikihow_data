      "content": "Make sure your dog gets a pre-breeding health check. Before you decide to breed your dog, you should make sure that they are healthy enough to do so. Make an appointment with your vet. Explain that you are planning on breeding your dog, and ask the vet to examine your dog to ensure they are healthy enough for breeding.

Canine STDs can infect both dogs and cause breeding complications. Try saying, \"Dr. Johnson, I am interested in breeding Fluffy. Can you examine her to make sure that she's healthy enough to have a litter?\""

      "content": "Know when your female dog is in heat. Not knowing when your dog is capable of mating is a common problem. When your female dog is in heat, her eggs mature, making her fertile and capable of producing puppies. If your female dog is not in heat, she cannot mate. In order to address this problem, you should be aware of your female dog’s heat cycle. You should look for: [2] X Research source Swelling of the vulva Tendency to mount objects or other dogs Vaginal discharge ranging from pink to red"

      "content": "Avoid breeding your female dog at first heat. While it might be tempting to allow your female dog to mate during her first heat, you should avoid it entirely. While a female dog will go into her heat when it is between 6 and 12 months old, the dog is still maturing and should not mate. You should wait to breed your female dog until it is at least 2 years old. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure your male dog is ready to mate. While a male puppy might engage in mounting behavior as early as 3-4 weeks of age, a male dog will not produce sperm until much later. You should wait until your male dog is at least 2 years old before you allow it to mate. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand dog intercourse.",
      "content": "Understand dog intercourse. The breeding tie is the intercourse between a male and a female dog. The male’s penis will enter the female’s vagina. The penis glands will then swell inside the female’s vagina, creating a tie. It's important that the two dogs not be separated during this time. The tie will last for 10-30 minutes, and during this time the majority of the male’s sperm will be deposited in the female’s vagina. [5] X Research source If this is the female dog's first time breeding, then it's a good idea to hold the dog in place. Otherwise, it may move out of nervousness, potentially breaking the tie. If you have specific questions about dog intercourse, ask your veterinarian when you take your dog in for its next checkup."

      "content": "Prevent injuries during the breeding tie. After the male’s penis enters the female’s vagina and creates a breeding tie, it is important that you actively work toward preventing injuries to one or both dogs. You should stay near the dogs during the tie. Work to keep both animals calm, and do not let the female squirm free from the tie as this can injure the animals. [6] X Research source Make sure the male dog’s penis has retracted after the tie, as an injured dog will have difficulty breeding in the future."

      "content": "Understand some dogs will reject each other. A common mating problem is when a dog refuses to mate with another dog. For example, a female dog might refuse a male dog because he is her housemate. Submissive males, on the other hand, might refuse to mate with dominant females. If your dog refuses to mate with a particular dog, try using another mate."

Examples include persistent estrus, split heat, and hypothyroidism.

If your dog is having reproductive issues that cannot be easily solved by you or your vet, consider taking your dog to a reproductive specialist. Veterinary teaching hospitals, for example, often have such specialists.

This will help facilitate the movement of genes within a breed between locales. This is especially important if you are dealing with a breed whose population is small. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, you should not breed your dog with a dog that lives in your town. If possible try to make connections with a breeder in another part of your state or country. Make sure you ask for the genealogical history of any dog you choose to mate with your dog. This can ensure that you are not breeding your dog with a distant (or close!) relative."
