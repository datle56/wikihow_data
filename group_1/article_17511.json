      "content": "Treat cavities as soon as you notice them. A cavity is a hole in your tooth. These gaps make it possible for damaging bacteria to get inside your tooth.

      "content": "Consent to a filling for partly rotten teeth. If only part of a tooth is rotten, it may be possible to fill a cavity hole. Talk with your dentist about the types of fillings that are available, including silver, composite resin, or copper. The filling process is done in-office and usually only requires local anesthesia. [4] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. However, it’s possible that your dentist will suggest a crown or another procedure after working to prepare a tooth for a filling."

      "content": "Get a crown if the tooth is not salvageable. If the tooth is beyond repair or compromised by multiple fillings, you may need to get it crowned. This is where your dentist will place a “cap” or molded covering over the entire tooth. [5] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. The tooth itself will be filed away to remove any rotten portions. This procedure usually takes a few hours and requires a local anesthetic.

This is an in-office procedure where your dentist will place tiny shards of good bone in rotted areas. Your dentist may also graft new tissue on to spots where your gums have receded.

      "content": "Remove the tooth entirely if it is rotting your gums. If the tooth is decayed to the point where it’s causing gum problems, your dentist may advise pulling it out completely. This is a procedure that requires local anesthesia and can usually be done in your dentist’s office. After the tooth is pulled, your dentist may put a bridge in to hold the space in your mouth.

      "content": "Ask for fluoride treatments. Your dentist can apply a fluoride treatment to your teeth during a regular office visit. This coating protects your teeth from additional rotting, and can make fillings last longer. Fluoride carries very few side effects. Ask your dentist about fluoride toothpaste. This is a great way to get extra fluoride if a coating treatment is not an option. If your child is suffering from rotting teeth, be careful when using fluoride toothpaste or treatments. Exposing a child to extra fluoride can actually speed up any damage to teeth."

[11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Most dentists will not seal teeth that are already beginning to rot due to cavities.
