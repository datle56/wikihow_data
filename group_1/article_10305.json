      "content": "Mix 1 tbsp (10 g) of cornstarch with ½ tsp (1.3 g) cocoa powder OR bentonite clay. Although you can use cornstarch as a dry shampoo on its own, adding a bit of cocoa powder or bentonite clay will help the powder match your hair color more closely. If you have brown or black hair, combine 1 tbsp (10 g) cornstarch with ½ tsp (1.3 g) unsweetened cocoa powder. [1] X Research source If you have blonde hair, add ½ tsp (1.3 g) bentonite clay instead of cocoa powder. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that everyone’s hair color is different! Feel free to slightly adjust the amount of cocoa powder or bentonite clay you add to match your unique shade. If your hair is super bright blonde, grey, or white, you may not need to add any cocoa powder or bentonite clay—plain cornstarch should work just fine. If you have darker hair and decide to add cocoa powder, it will perfume your hair with a lovely chocolate-y aroma, as well!"

[3] X Research source A blush brush or face powder brush will work very well for this. Once you’ve applied the powder, gently massage it into your hair with your hands. If you don’t have a makeup brush to use, no worries! Go ahead and sprinkle the cornstarch onto your hair and work it in with your hands."

      "content": "Prolonged or excessive use may dry out your scalp and hair. Cornstarch absorbs moisture, which is a good thing if you’re trying to get rid of greasiness between washes. However, if you leave the cornstarch on your hair for too long or use it very often, it can be a bit too drying. This can lead to brittleness and breakage. Excessive dry shampoo use in general can also irritate your scalp and cause your hair to look a little duller. [11] X Research source To avoid this, make an effort to use your cornstarch dry shampoo sparingly. When you apply the powder to your hair, only let it sit for a minute or two before brushing it out. For best results, use your cornstarch dry shampoo only 1-2 times per week, and try not to use it two days in a row. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Is cornstarch dry shampoo okay to use on all hair types? Cornstarch dry shampoo works well on a wide variety of hair types, and it’s usually suitable for straight, wavy, and curly hair. However, if you have very tight curls, it may be harder to evenly distribute the cornstarch and brush it out completely when it’s done soaking, so you may prefer a more traditional store-bought dry shampoo. Additionally, if you have very dry, color-treated hair or a sensitive scalp, it may be best to avoid cornstarch dry shampoo. Since it absorbs moisture, it may cause skin irritation, excess dryness, or breakage.
