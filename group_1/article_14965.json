      "content": "Stay alert at all times. In most Indian cities, though there are lanes, people don't use them and may cut in front of you without warning. Animals or children may come in your way. Whenever your foot is not on the accelerator, it should be resting on the brake."

      "content": "Remember that there are all sorts of vehicles on Indian roads such as bullock carts, cycles, rickshaws, three-wheelers, cars, SUVs, trucks, buses, etc. There are no separate lanes for slower moving vehicles so be prepared to drive slowly using brakes very often. There are hardly any automatic transmission vehicles in India so be prepared for a manual transmission. If you rent a stickshift but are used to an automatic then ensure that its clutch pedal is light else you will end up building a stronger calf muscle."

      "content": "Learn that a marriage party, minister or religious processions are regular and can hold up traffic. Don't be shy in taking alternative routes in such situations, like driving on the side unpaved road (if it's there) or cutting the traffic like others."

      "content": "When driving to a small town or rural village, roads will be too narrow for two lanes. Therefore, traffic coming in the other direction will have to travel on the same path as you. When a car is coming towards you, move to the LEFT so that you are only taking up half the road. It's ok if the left side of your car isn't on the road anymore. The guy coming towards you will do the same thing on his left side. After you have passed each other, come back onto the road."

      "content": "In many places in India commercial vehicles, such as trucks and buses, will have signs that read \"Sound Horn\". This means that if you honk they will move over slightly so that you may pass. Honk only once and do it politely, if they do not move simply stay behind them. Although they may move to the side, make sure to check for oncoming traffic before you pass. [4] X Research source When honking, make sure you are not in a quiet zone (generally around hospitals) as this is illegal and very disrupting to hospital patients."

Avoid any such pandemonium and try to settle things quickly."
