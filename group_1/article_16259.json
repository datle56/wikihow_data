      "content": "Choose a foundation, tinted moisturizer, or sunscreen to use as your base. Before you can start creating your fake abs, you need to have some sort of canvas for the makeup to hold on to. This base or \"canvas\" can be a foundation that closely matches your skin tone , a tainted moisturizer, or sunscreen. You can also use a tinted sunscreen, or you can create your own by mixing little bit of liquid foundation that is close to your skin tone with your sunscreen. Choose something that suits your needs: Foundation will give you the most coverage and will help even out your skin tone. A cream foundation will be more opaque than a liquid foundation. A tinted moisturizer will help moisturize and condition your skin, as well as even out your skin tone. It will not have the same coverage as foundation, however. Sunscreen will protect the tender skin on your abdomen against sunburn. If you add some foundation to it, it will also help even out your skin tone a little."

      "content": "Choose a powder bronzer. You want the bronzer to be about two shades darker than your skin tone. Do not use a shimmering bronzer, as shimmer causes things to pop outâ€”use a matte bronzer instead. [1] X Research source You will be creating fake shadows to give the illusion of a toned abdomen, so you want something that looks natural. If you cannot find a non-shimmering bronzer, you can substitute a brown eyeshadow or pressed powder foundation instead, as long as it is no more two shades darker than your skin tone."

      "title": "Choose a powder highlighter.",
      "content": "Choose a powder highlighter. You want the highlighter to be a shade lighter than your skin tone. This powder can be shiny, as shine causes things to pop out. If you cannot find powder highlighter, you can substitute with pressed powder foundation that is several shades lighter than your skin tone, or a pale ivory eyeshadow."

      "title": "Find a powder brush and two creasing brushes.",
      "content": "Find a powder brush and two creasing brushes. You will need two types of brushes: a large powder brush, and a creasing brush. If you cannot find a creasing brush, you can substitute with a small, round-tipped makeup brush. You will need two of these creasing (or round-tipped) brushes: one for the bronzer, and one for the highlighter. If you cannot find a second creasing brush, you can use the same brush for both the bronzer and highlight. Just make sure you clean the brush by swiping it over a tissue until you cannot see any more bronzer on it."

You want your abdomen to be exposed. Do not wear the same outfit that you plan on wearing later with your fake abs. Not only do you risk staining your outfit, but the makeup stains might give your secret away."

Be sure to cover any areas of your abdomen that will be exposed, and to blend in the edges if you are using foundation or a tinted moisturizer.

You can tell if it has dried out if your skin no longer looks shiny, moist, or dewy. When in doubt, you can always touch your abdomen with your finger. If your finger comes away with makeup, moisturizer, or sunscreen on it, then you need to wait longer."

You do not have to flex your abdomen the entire time, but it is a good idea to do so before drawing each line to ensure that you are placing the shadows in their proper locations."

They begin just below your ribcage and extend down towards your belly. Once you have found them, draw a line down each one using your bronzer and brush. If you flex your abdomen, you may find some horizontal grooves to either side of your belly button. They extend from the belly button and connect with the vertical lines you have just drawn. If you wish to have a more defined abdomen, you can fill them in with bronzer, just as you have the other lines."

You may also have to brush side-to-side to blend further. This blends the lines in, and makes the shading less harsh. If the lines appear too dark, do not panic! Simply take some pressed powder foundation that matches your skin tone, load it up onto your powder brush, and brush it over your abdomen. This will help lighten the shading and blend everything together."

If necessary, apply more bronzer or highlighter, but be sure to blend it again. To make it mostly waterproof, you can spray a layer of hairspray on top of the makeup. If your highlighter is too light and your bronzer is too dark, and blending did not help, you can further soften it by going back over it with pressed powder foundation. Simply swivel your powder brush into some pressed powder foundation that closely matches your skin tone, and dust it over your abdomen."
