Note that the results are only temporary, though, and may only last a day or two. [1] X Research source Body wraps are commonly offered at spas. Do an online search for reputable, well-reviewed spas near you to see what’s available. Be sure to ask your spa about the ingredients in the body wrap before-hand. If you have any health conditions and/or are taking medications, consult with your doctor to ensure that none of the ingredients in the body wrap will cause problems for you.

      "content": "Try fasting. Fasting involves abstaining from some or all kinds of food and drink; it can help you temporarily lose a few pounds, but generally the weight will come back on once you start eating again. Fasting for a few days won’t hurt most healthy people, as long as they stay hydrated. Fasting for longer periods of time, however, is dangerous. [4] X Research source A water fast would be to only drink water for a set period of time — not eating or drinking anything else. Another type of fast is to only consume liquids — generally fresh fruit and vegetable juices, and broths. Yet another type of fast is to consume mostly liquids, with one light meal each day — usually comprising vegetables, whole grains, and maybe lean protein. [5] X Research source Don’t fast if you have diabetes; it can lead to dangerous drops and rises in blood sugar. You should also not fast if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you suffer from any chronic health conditions. If you’re unsure about whether you can safely fast, ask your doctor.

Shapewear is a word for undergarments made from rigid yet flexible fabrics that are specifically designed to smooth out our trouble zones — flattening the stomach and love handles, pulling in the thighs, and lifting the bum. You can purchase shapewear at most department stores, in the section where you would buy underwear. Corsets can also pull you in at the stomach and waist and help you look much trimmer. Note that shapewear and corsets — or any extra-tight-fitting clothing — can cause health issues if worn over a prolonged period of time. Health risks include meralgia paresthetica (painful burning and tingling in the thighs); digestion issues, including acid reflux; and an increased risk of blood clots in people who have circulation problems.

[8] X Research source Lowering your sodium intake, increasing your fibre intake, exercising, having your body wrapped, and — perhaps counterintuitively — drinking more water, can all help with shedding water weight. If you are a woman, you’ll likely retain more water when you're menstruating. If you know that you’ll be menstruating during a trip or special day where you want to look your thinnest, you might consider extending your birth control pill if you take the pill (this can postpone your period). If you’re not on the pill, battle water retention by consuming lots of fibre and water, and avoiding sodium."

A diet of lean proteins and vegetables is your best friend, particularly when you’re trying to jumpstart your weight loss. Eat as many whole foods — for example, raw fruits and veggies, chicken, raw almonds, and rice — as possible. When you do buy processed foods, look at the nutritional value to ensure that the products are low in sugar, saturated fat and salt, and high in fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals."

To figure out how much water you should drink each day, divide your body weight in half: that’s how many ounces you s should drink per day. Example: a 150-pound woman should drink 75 ounces per day of water. Not drinking enough water can slow your metabolism. Drinking at least 8 glasses of water per day will help keep you burning calories — you’ll burn more than you would if you drank less than 8 glasses per day.
