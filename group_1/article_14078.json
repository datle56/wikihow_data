As soon as the song starts, the starting player reaches over with their right hand and claps the person to their left’s hand. Then, that person does the same so the clap goes around in a circle.

[4] X Research source If another person tries to clap your hand right when the song ends, you can try to move your hand away. If the person misses your hand, then they’re out of the game instead.
