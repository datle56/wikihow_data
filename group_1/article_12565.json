      "title": "Choose an area that gets 6–8 hours of sun daily.",
      "content": "Choose an area that gets 6–8 hours of sun daily. Since most flowering plants and vegetables require full sun to grow properly, opt for the sunniest area in your yard to place your garden. If the area doesn’t get a lot of light during the day, you may still be able to grow plants that thrive in the shade. [1] X Research source Plants that don’t receive enough light won’t produce as many blooms or grow as well."

      "title": "Pick a spot that’s close to a water source.",
      "content": "Pick a spot that’s close to a water source. Try to find an area that either has a natural water source or sits close to your outdoor hose attachment. That way, the soil will stay moist and make it less likely to dry out and kill your plants. If you aren’t able to place your garden directly by a water source, make sure it’s as close as possible.

      "content": "Opt for a place where you can easily access your garden. Look for a place in your yard where you can see your garden from a window or a spot in your yard so you’re able to enjoy it. Make sure you can walk into your garden with ease to make it easier to take care of your plants. Avoid placing it anywhere that’s difficult to get to, or else it may become more of a hassle.

      "title": "Measure the space you have available for your garden.",
      "content": "Measure the space you have available for your garden. Stretch a measuring tape across the length of the area, and record the measurement on a piece of paper. Then take the measurement for the width of the area. Double-check your measurements to make sure they’re accurate so you can plan the space efficiently. [4] X Research source Typically, plots grow best in rectangular areas, but you can make your garden a different shape, such as a triangle or circle, if it fits the space better."

      "title": "Plan the layout for your garden to scale on a piece of graph paper.",
      "content": "Plan the layout for your garden to scale on a piece of graph paper. Draw the outline on the paper so each grid square equals 1 ⁄ 2 or 1 square foot (0.046 or 0.093 m 2 ). Start by sketching longer rectangles for your garden beds so they’re to scale for the actual size you want them. Then divide the rectangles into smaller sections for each different plant you want to put in them, assuming that 1–2 plants usually take up 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ). Be sure to leave a 18 in (46 cm) space between garden beds so you can easily walk between them and care for your plants. [5] X Research source For example, if you want a garden bed that’s 3 by 8 feet (0.91 m × 2.44 m) and each square on the graph paper equals 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ), then you would draw a rectangle that’s 3 squares tall by 8 squares long. This bed would leave enough room for 24–48 plants. Work in pencil so you can erase and make changes to the design easily. Look online for digital garden planners to help you design the layout."

      "content": "Use square-foot gardening for the most compact growing system. Make a grid on your design so each square is 1 by 1 feet (30 cm × 30 cm). Make a list of the plants you want to grow and label each square on the grid with one of the plants from your list. Make sure you know the final growing sizes so you can easily manage how many plants of a species you’ll be able to grow in the square. [6] X Research source Typically, you can fit 1–2 individual plants of a species in 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ) area, but you may be able to plant more if they’re small growths.

      "content": "Arrange your design so there are focal points. Aim to have 1–2 aspects of your garden design unique so they stand out from the rest of your plants. This could be a statue, fountain, or small tree placed in the center or on either side. Take into consideration where you want people to focus or have their attention drawn to when they look at your garden, and plan your design around those spots. [7] X Research source Focal points help your garden feel more inviting and make them more visually pleasing. Paths in your garden can also help draw people’s eyes in certain directions to help then flow visually."

      "content": "Put similar plants across from one another to create rhythm and symmetry. Rather than putting different plants in each of your garden beds, opt for using the same plant or ones that have similar textures or colors so they’re across from one another. That way, when you look at your garden, it will look inviting and make the area feel more balanced. Make sure the plants on each side of your garden have approximately the same sizes, or your garden design may look messy or unbalanced. [8] X Research source"

Look for raised beds or containers that are around 4 feet (1.2 m) wide and 12 inches (30 cm) deep so the plant roots have room to grow. Avoid getting beds any wider since it can make it more difficult to care for and harvest your plants. If possible, orient the beds so they run from north to south to allow your plants to get the most amount of light during the day. [11] X Research source If you don’t want to use raised beds, you can still plant in rows directly in the ground. Build the planting beds if you aren’t able to find preconstructed ones in the sizes you need. You can make your own beds for cheap using plywood.

Try to include at least 1–2 types of flowering ornamental plants in each of your garden beds where you plan on growing vegetables. Opt for plants that have different leaf shapes and a variety of blooms to make your garden look visually interesting. Talk to the employees at a local gardening center to find out what plants are the most compatible so they don’t compete for nutrients. [13] X Research source Some ornamental plants you can use in your garden include hostas, hibiscus, allium, salvia, lavender, and sedum. [14] X Research source Flowering ornamental plants also attract beneficial insects that kill other pests and help pollinate.

Try to put the trellis or fence along the north side of your garden so plants growing on it can get the most light throughout the day. Aim to have a 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) tall trellis to help it support the most growth. [17] X Research source Avoid placing a trellis or fence where it casts shade on other plants, or else you could make them grow less efficiently. [18] X Research source Trellises and fences work well for plants vine-like plants, such as peas, beans, squashes, and tomatoes.

Then choose varieties of plants that thrive in the latter half of the growing season to replace the plants that grew earlier. That way, your garden will always produce fresh vegetables or blooms throughout the entire year. [19] X Research source For example, you can plant radishes or lettuce in the spring to harvest in the late summer. Then you may grow summer squash in the same location to harvest in the fall.

Begin pruning at the start of the season to help promote new growth, and in the middle of the season to help keep your garden looking clean. Remove any stems or branches that have damage or look leggy with a pair of hand pruners. Make cuts at a 45-degree angle to help reduce the chance of rot.
