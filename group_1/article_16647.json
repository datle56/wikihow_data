Check the width of the top and bottom of the door opening and write those measurements down so you don’t forget. [1] X Research source Standard doors are usually 32–36 in (81–91 cm) wide. Your door will probably be around that, but be sure to take an exact measurement. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut two 2 in (5.1 cm) x 4 in (10 cm) boards to fit that space. Measure the wood and find the length that matches the width of the door space. Mark a straight line at each spot with a pencil and straightedge. Then use a circular saw or table saw to cut along those lines and get two wood boards that will fit in the space. [3] X Research source Always wear gloves and goggles while you’re using a saw. Keep your fingers far away from the blade while it’s on. Be sure to use a straightedge or ruler to make a straight line on the wood. Otherwise your cut might be crooked. Use a 2 in × 6 in (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) board if the wall is 6 in (15 cm) thick.

      "title": "Place a bead of caulk along the top and bottom edges.",
      "content": "Place a bead of caulk along the top and bottom edges. Hold the caulk gun at the bottom corner of the door frame, right in the middle. Squeeze the trigger to release the caulk and move the gun across the floor slowly to run a bead across the whole opening. Do the same on the top when you’re finished. This provides a bit of extra insulation for the space. [5] X Research source Latex caulk is best for this because it expands and fills gaps well. You don't need silicone caulk unless you're making a water-tight seal, like for a bathroom. [6] X Research source This step is more important if you’re sealing an outside-facing door. If it’s an inside doorway, then the extra insulation isn’t as important. The caulk dries in about 30 minutes, so place the wood boards right after you place it. Caulk is easy to remove while it’s still wet. If you get some in a spot you didn’t want it, just scrape it off with a putty knife and rub the spot with a wet towel."

Hold it so it’s flush with the opening on either side, then press it down into the caulk. Do the same for the top. [7] X Research source If the wood isn’t totally even with the space, you can still slide it back and forth a bit to fix it. You might need to tap the wood with a hammer to fit it into place. This is normal."

Put 2 more at the center and then 2 in the opposite corner. Do the same for the top 2 in (5.1 cm) x 4 in (10 cm). [8] X Research source If you have a nail gun, this job will be a lot easier.

This should be the same on both sides, but check each side individually to make sure. [9] X Research source Be sure you measure the space between the 2 in (5.1 cm) x 4 in (10 cm) boards or your measurement will be too long. A standard door is usually 78–80 in (200–200 cm) high. Your measurement will be at least 4 in (10 cm) less than that because of the 2 in (5.1 cm) x 4 in (10 cm) boards on the top and bottom."

[14] X Research source For example, of the space is 32 in (81 cm) wide, then the midpoint is 16 in (41 cm). Mark this on the top and bottom boards and place the stud right on that point. If this is an outside-facing wall, then put some caulk on the top and bottom of the wood to make a tighter seal."

Then do the same for the bottom of the board to secure the stud. [15] X Research source Toenailing is much easier with a nail gun or drill.

[29] X Research source Be certain to sand the joint compound well, otherwise, it will make an uneven finish when you paint. If one side is an exterior wall, then you can use house siding or the material that covers the exterior of your home."
