    {
      "title": "Lose control of yourself.",
      "content": "Lose control of yourself. Natural laughter usually comes as a surprise or as the result of a stimulus, like tickling. This results in an unplanned vocalization - laughter! By its very nature, laughter is irregular, so the measured tones of your fake laughter can easily be spotted. [1] X Research source Add variety to your laughter by starting with low tones and ending with a higher pitch, or vice versa."

    {
      "title": "Speed up the rate of your laughter.",
      "content": "Speed up the rate of your laughter. Listeners are more likely to believe a fake laugh is real when the speed is increased. [2] X Research source Instead of slower, deeper laughs, you might try imitating a lighter, quicker giggle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add breaths to your guffaws.",
      "content": "Add breaths to your guffaws. Human brains distinguish between real and fake laughter by the breath inserted between your chuckles and chortles. [3] X Research source Allow your breath to come in staggered, haphazard intervals to cue your friends that you did find the joke funny, even when you did not. More breathiness will make your laugh sound more genuine. There are typically more breathy parts in natural laughter than faked. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Laugh according to your gender.",
      "content": "Laugh according to your gender. Both men and women have been found to tend toward different laughing styles, and using these might help you fool your audience. Women tend to laugh in a more lyrical, sing-songy way, while men more frequently grunt or snort in amusement. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Regulate within normal boundaries.",
      "content": "Regulate within normal boundaries. This is a tricky part of faking a laugh, as laughter is the spontaneous explosion of vocalized joy. Too much regulation will come across as false and unnatural, but the opposite is also true. Laughing too much can signal your listener that you don't actually find what is being said is humorous. [6] X Research source Aim for a volume for your laughter that is around the same volume of those laughing around you, or that is about the same volume as conversation. A general guideline when faking: don't allow your laughter to be so loud that you cannot hear conversation over it."

    {
      "title": "Start loud and act embarrassed.",
      "content": "Start loud and act embarrassed. You might have the experience of laughing out loud at something at an inappropriate moment. Laughter sometimes strikes when it's less than convenient, but you can use this to your advantage when faking. Make your first bark of laughter loud enough to get attention, and then cover your mouth and pretend to be embarrassed. [7] X Research source Be sure to smile throughout this process. Smiling triggers tiny muscles in your face to flex and wrinkle, imitating the look of natural laughter. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Taper off at the end of your fake laugh.",
      "content": "Taper off at the end of your fake laugh. A common error of inexperienced fakers is cutting a laugh off too abruptly. Natural laughter is rarely cut off suddenly. To imitate natural laughter, allow your tee-hees to dwindle until you feel the moment is right to stop. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Observe the expressions of those around you. When you notice the upward-pointing \"laugh lines\" softening back to a more neutral expression, you should begin wrapping up your laughter."

      "content": "Prime yourself for laughter. If you're already in a good mood, it'll be easier for you to shift gears into laughing mode.

      "content": "Open yourself to the laughter of others. This is the main reason why laugh tracks have been used in sitcoms and other comedic television shows - the sound of laughter is contagious. [14] X Research source Listen carefully to the laughter of those around you, and see if you can catch the chuckle-bug."

      "title": "Laugh grammatically.",
      "content": "Laugh grammatically. Laughs occur predictable throughout language. Though there are exceptions, generally laughter occurs at the end of phrases or during pauses in speech. To give your fake laughter the best chance of passing as real, you'll want to \"punctuate\" your speech with it, instead of choosing a time to laugh randomly. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep a mental laugh bank. There are some images that, no matter how frequently you see them, still strike you as hilarious. Or maybe there's a joke that gets you laughing no matter how many times you hear it. Keep these in your mental \"laugh bank\" for use when you need to fake a laugh. [16] X Expert Source Ben Whitehair Acting Coach Expert Interview. 3 June 2021. Funny events from your personal life, like the antics of a comedic aunt or cousin at a family party, can serve well as laugh bank material."

      "content": "Identify when fake laughter is inappropriate. This doesn't simply include somber events, like funerals and passport photos, but also higher-risk situations, like job interviews. If your interviewer cracks a joke and you don't find it funny, he may detect insincerity in your fake laughter, and it could affect your chances of getting the job."

      "content": "Give a polite smile in place of a laugh. This is an obvious way you can show your social support to your conversation partner without coming across as dishonest.

      "content": "Crack a joke in response. When a joke is made that falls flat, you might pick it up by putting a twist on it or by making a joke of your own. Humor is a social tool that we use to express shared values and joys, and by cracking a joke of your own, you can show your social support. An example of this might look like: Boss: What do you call a cow with no legs? ( followed by silence ) You: Hungry?"

      "content": "Offer a reasonable excuse. There are many reasons you might not find a joke funny. For example, you may have heard the exact same joke a few days earlier, ruining the punchline for you. Some other excuses you could offer: \"Sure I thought it was funny. I was just laughing on the inside.\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you - what did you say?\""
