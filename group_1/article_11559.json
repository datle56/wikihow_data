      "title": "Opt for intimate settings.",
      "content": "Opt for intimate settings. Some believe Cancer women do not love big, rowdy establishments. They tend to be drawn to intimacy, so they may dislike a rowdy bar as a date setting. Opt for a smaller, intimate location where it is easy to converse. [1] X Research source For example, book a corner table in a tiny, romantic restaurant. You can also try a first date at a quiet coffee shop. If you go out to a bar, make sure it's quiet. Bars with loud music and huge crowds are unlikely to win a cancer woman's favor. A restaurant with cozy lighting, seafood — since Cancer is a water sign — and a band playing some soft music is also a great idea."

      "content": "Take trips together. Some think Cancer women love traveling. A good way to plan a date is planning short trips. Take her away for the weekend on occasion to somewhere she has never been before. A Cancer woman will appreciate this gesture. [2] X Research source You do not need to spend a fortune on a trip. A day trip to a nearby city can be a great way to spend a Saturday with a Cancer woman. Remember that Cancer women prefer intimate settings. When planning activities for a day trip, look for locations that are quiet and low-key over loud bars and crowded restaurants."

      "content": "Plan events with a few close friends. If you're planning something like a birthday party for a Cancer woman, smaller is generally better. Cancer women have a few close relationships and prefer to spend time with small groups of people, since they tend to be a bit on the shy side. Gather a Cancer woman's close friends for events rather than inviting, say, everyone from her office or casual acquaintances from school. [3] X Research source You can, for example, have a birthday party for your Cancer woman in your home. Invite a few of her closest friends and plan low-key activities like board games. If you take a Cancer woman out for her birthday, invite only a handful of friends and choose a quiet location."

For example, you don't have to spend a lot of money on a fancy restaurant. Instead, plan an intimate picnic lunch in an area that's personally meaningful for you, like the park where you first met."
