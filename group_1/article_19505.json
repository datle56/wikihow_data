      "title": "Wash your face every day, being careful not to overwash.",
      "content": "Wash your face every day, being careful not to overwash. Pores enlarge when they become clogged with dirt, oil, or bacteria, causing them to become inflamed. Washing your face regularly but not too often — once in the morning, once at night — will help keep your pores looking smaller and feeling better."

      "content": "Apply ice cubes to your face. Place the ice cubes gently along your pores for 15 to 30 seconds. This will have a tightening effect on your skin. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a light scrub.",
      "content": "Use a light scrub. A scrub, as opposed to a wash, usually contains very small beads or other massaging implements (think finely ground apricot cores, for example) that assist in unclogging pores. Certain light scrubs can be used nightly instead of face wash. If you're going to use a scrub instead of a wash, leave it at that. Don't wash your face afterwards; it's an either/or thing. Excessive washing of your skin can cause irritation and redness, rendering any gains in pore-reducing virtually useless."

      "content": "Try a yogurt mask. Plain yogurt contains lactic acid and probiotics, [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source which when applied to the skin, help keep the bad bacteria that causes acne in check, thereby reducing the appearance of pore size [3] X Research source . Apply a thin layer of plain yogurt over face and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Longer than 10 minutes can irritate the skin. Use only about once a week. As with most masks, less is often more, so don't be tricked into thinking you need to constantly be exfoliating."

      "title": "Eat healthy.",
      "content": "Eat healthy. Eat a diet rich in lean proteins, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids. Drink plenty of water instead of sugary, caffeine-laden drinks. Avoid excessive milk and dairy, which have hormones that make acne worse. [4] X Expert Source Melissa Jannes Skincare Specialist Expert Interview. 30 August 2019. Get plenty of vitamin A, vitamin C, and B-vitamins. Vitamin C can help minimize lines, scars, and wrinkles [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source , while vitamin A acts in a similar way. Oranges produce firmer skin and rebuild collagen, which may contribute to increasing the elasticity of your skin and reducing your pore walls [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source . Tangerines also have this effect."

      "title": "Use alpha and beta hydroxy acids, or AHAs and BHAs.",
      "content": "Use alpha and beta hydroxy acids, or AHAs and BHAs. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source AHAs and BHAs are chemical, rather than natural, exfoliants. They weaken the binding properties of lipids, which keep the dead skin cells on the outer skin intact even after they should be sloughed off. BHAs are better at really penetrating pores because they're lipid-soluble, meaning they can cut right through the oil or sebum in your pores. Use chemical peels like AHAs and BHAs no more than once or twice a week. Just because you do it more often doesn't mean it's better for your skin. You may need to use these products less frequently if you find it is irritating your skin, causing skin tightness or redness, or if you are using a stronger product. [8] X Research source Always consult with your dermatologist before using any of these products."

Note that there isn't good evidence for sandalwood's effectiveness, but if you want to try it anyway, mix together a paste of sandalwood powder and water, applying to face. Leave for 10 to 20 minutes before rinsing off with cool water. Just be careful because sandalwood can dry out your face. [9] X Research source"
