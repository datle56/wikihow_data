[1] X Expert Source Alyson Garrido, PCC Career Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. Dress more conservatively on the first day if you have no other coworkers to benchmark your attire against. Business casual is often thrown out there to describe how your employer thinks you should dress at work. The problem is that the expectations of individual companies often differ. For example, one company might want you to dress in business attire, minus a suit coat and tie, while another company may encourage you to wear khakis or jeans. When you are told to dress business casual, it is best to ask for details. Ask if your employer has an employee handbook that more clearly delineates the company's business casual policy."

      "content": "Dress formally for interviews. If you're going on an interview and you don't know what your interviewer expects you to wear, the standard is business formal. Remember, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed. Those who are interviewing for a job in business, banking and wealth management, politics, academia, engineering, or health sectors should dress business formal unless otherwise instructed. If no clothing type is specified, and the company you're interviewing for is outside the sectors listed above, stick with business casual. Try to dress 1 level more professional than the dress code for your interview. If the business allows casual clothes in the office, interview wearing business casual clothes.

      "content": "Choose from a variety of shirts. Women have a few more options in this department than the men. Opt for conservative and not too revealing. Blouses, plain shirts, cotton shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, vests, and sleeveless shirts are all acceptable. Tucked-in or untucked can both go, depending on the shirt. Unusual patterns are acceptable, as long as they are not wild. The standard, however, is a monotone shirt. Use a collar for a more formal look, and collarless shirts for a less formal look."

White button-down shirts are the most formal and therefore the safest. Unlike pants, all manner of shirt colors are acceptable: Purple, pink, yellow, blue, and red. Choose shirts (and pants) in \"formal\" fabric: Cotton is king, and comes in many different flavors. Wool is acceptable, if itchy. Silk, rayon, and linen are frowned upon. Choose shirts in \"formal patterns: Oxford, plaid, and poplin are a little less formal, but perfectly acceptable. Twill, herringbone, and broadcloth patterns are more formal and nice to use if sprucing up. [5] X Research source Hawaiian and other irregular patterns are considered too casual."

Pleated pants and dark colors are more formal, conservative choices. If you want to be on the safe side, over dressing is less frowned upon than under dressing. Pants should extend to the top of your shoe, or slightly longer. Pants that don't reach down to your shoe are considered high-water pants; pants that fold and bunch up near the feet are considered too baggy. Avoid pants in loud colors such as red, yellow, and purple. Camouflage is not allowed, neither are white pants — they feel a little too informal for even business casual.
