      "title": "Decide what job you would like to do.",
      "content": "Decide what job you would like to do. Jobs can be divided into 2 categories: active and passive. Active jobs require you to move your character around, and are better if you get bored easily. They also pay a bit more per task. Passive jobs don’t require you to move around, but can be boring. They typically pay less per task but are more efficient. This means you can earn more money in a shorter amount of time with a passive job. Active jobs include the pizza delivery job, the fisherman job, the janitor job, the miner job, the mechanic job, the stocker job, and the woodcutter job. Passive jobs include both cashier jobs (Bloxy Burgers and Bloxburg Fresh Foods), the hairdresser job, the pizza baker job, and the seller job. While all jobs were designed to pay equally, overall, most players would agree that the hairdresser, Bloxy Burgers cashier, and the pizza delivery job are the best/most interesting jobs."

      "title": "Boost your moods before working.",
      "content": "Boost your moods before working. There are four moods/motives/needs in the game: hunger, energy, hygiene, and fun. Keeping these moods maxed out or in the green zone lets you earn more money while working than if your moods are low (higher moods = more pay!). Do the below in-game actions to raise each mood before you head to your in-game job to work. [1] X Research source Hunger: If your character is not hungry or starving, your other moods will decrease more slowly. Eat foods (obtained through a fridge, by cooking, or by purchasing), or drink drinks (such as smoothies). Energy: If your energy is higher, you'll walk faster and get paid more. This is especially important if you want to work an active job. Sleeping, use a shower or bathtub, sit on a couch or chair, eat/drink, or purchasing a mood boost. Drinking coffee and sleeping in a bed are the fastest ways to get more energy. Hygiene: If your character's hygiene is higher, your character will not emit flies or a green stink cloud. Interact with any of the items under the \"Plumbing\" section, swim in a pool, or use a mood boost. Hairbrushes, perfume bottles, and toilets also help. Take a shower to quickly raise your hygiene mood. Fun: Fun is the most important mood to have raised when working. If your character's fun is higher, you'll get paid exponentially more than if it’s lower. Interact with a TV, computer, toy, pool, or a book, or purchase a mood boost. Purchase the Marvellous Mood gamepass for 180 Robux to retain higher moods longer. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Invite friends to your server. Ask your friends who play Roblox if they want to join you in the game. Working with friends nearby can help keep your moods high and make your job pay higher for longer. Plus, they can keep you from getting bored by chatting with you. Another option is to send friend requests to other players in your server who are also working. Just make sure they get to know you before you send a friend request, so they’re more likely to accept it."

If you have a few hundred Robux and want to earn more Bloxburg money when working in the game, the Excellent Employee gamepass increases how often you get promoted and how much money you get while working. Currently, it costs 300 Robux. [3] X Research source Remember, Robux cost real money to buy. Spend them wisely!"

If you have a certain amount of money you want to reach (i.e. $10k in 20 minutes), you'll feel more motivated to work until you reach your goal than if you didn’t have one. You can even reward yourself if you reach your goal by buying something cool for your in-game house. Set realistic goals. Unless you're level 50 with the Excellent Employee gamepass on a certain job, you're probably not going to make $100k in 10 minutes."

      "content": "Go to work. There are two ways to go to work. The first way is to teleport. Press the icon of a person at the bottom right corner of the screen. There, press the right and left buttons until you find the job you want, and press “Select.” This will teleport you to your workplace. The second way is by using a vehicle (which can be purchased in Build Mode or Mike's Motors) or simply walking to your workplace. When you step in your workplace, you should be transformed into your work uniform. After you choose a job, you can still do other jobs in the future. Sadly, you can’t work from home or be self-employed at this point."

This is a good reason to try to stick to the same job over time. [4] X Research source While it’s fun to try different jobs, leveling up in your favorite job will help you make money faster in the long term. Challenge yourself to reach your job’s highest level (50)—you’ll earn the Excellence Award! It could take months or years to reach the highest level of a job. Don’t be discouraged—it just means more time to play the game, chat with friends, and have fun."

      "content": "Entertain yourself while working. Doing a job in Welcome to Bloxburg may get boring and repetitive after a while, but if you want to make money, you have to stay motivated. Increase your motivation by entertaining yourself while you work. Put a show, movie, or YouTube video on in the background. Or, listen to music or a podcast. You can even call a friend to catch up while you play."

      "content": "Spread out the times you work each week. In the end, working for an hour on one day will get you the same amount of money as working for 15 minutes a day over four days. If you feel like work gets boring fast, splitting it up can help you stay motivated to work by breaking it up into short periods of time. This is also helpful for maintaining a streak—join the Bloxburg game for at least a few minutes per day for multiple days in a row. Long streaks earn you money and BloxBux."

To help keep your focus on the tasks of your job, hide the money counter on the bottom-right corner of the screen. It's okay to check once in a while, but try to avoid checking it every couple of minutes."

At level 14 of the athletic skill, you earn $2,500—and at level 29, you earn $20,000. Other skills like gardening are important to level up so you can plant and farm more expensive plants. Boost your athletic skill at the Bloxburg Gym. Note that exercising lowers your energy and hygiene moods, but increases your fun mood. [5] X Research source Purchase and play instruments to level up the music skill. Or, use the DJ Booth at home or at the Beat Nightclub.

      "content": "Spawn the cheapest plot and keep your house value low. Instead of buying a medium or large plot as soon as you can afford it, consider going with the cheap small plot to save money. Keep your house value low to keep your house bills low by not adding too much furniture or other home upgrades. Over time, these small savings will allow you to save up money to purchase major upgrades and a larger plot without going broke. Another way to reduce bills is to place a solar panel on your plot. If you don’t play the game all the time, go to options and toggle off “Automatically Pay Bills.” This way, you won’t keep being charged each week when you’re logged off for a long time."

Seasonal or limited foods that are only available around the holidays or during in-game events are rare, meaning other players could be willing to give you a decent amount of money for them.

Sadly, few people are willing to donate, so it may take you a long time to get money this way. Never trick people into giving you money. It’s not nice—and they could report you, resulting in a ban from the game. If someone refuses to donate, don't rage at them or keep bothering them. When you earn your own money in the game, you’ll probably want to keep it for yourself, too."

If you're willing to splurge, though, this method may be for you. Remember that USD $0.01 is equivalent to 1 Robux, so you may not want to spend USD $60 on $500,000 in-game money."
