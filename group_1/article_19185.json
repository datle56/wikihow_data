Crying clears your mind and helps you vent your emotions. Repression never helps anyone, so be honest about your ever-changing feelings. [2] X Research source If you don't feel like crying, maybe head to the gym and find an available punching bag or go for a long, hard run. Vent your anger and hurt with someone close to you. Try to avoid doing something you would regret; just remember the person you are venting to is just trying to help.

Let yourself mourn and start fresh, with no lingering reminders or memory triggers of what once was. [5] X Research source You don't necessarily have to throw out his/her old stuff or your mementos.

Doing this will help you process your emotions. Reread your words and try to identify what is really bothering you - and what you need from a relationship going forward. What, in your mind, was the reason for the failure? Write also to yourself. Tell yourself in words why the relationship wouldn't have worked, regardless of who ended it.
