      "content": "Choose 2 colors of flat nail polish that look nice when mixed together. For best results, choose 2 primary colors, or a primary color and a related secondary color. For example, you could do blue and yellow or pink and purple. Avoid using contrasting colors, such as orange and blue, otherwise the transition point where they blend together will turn out murky. A flat/crème formula will work the best. [2] X Research source Keep color mixing in mind. If you use blue and yellow, the transition point will be green. If you use blue and orange, however, the transition point will be brown. Consider testing the colors on a piece of paper first. Apply a stroke of each color, then blend them together at the seam with a toothpick."

If you are working with a primary color and a secondary color, start with the primary color. [3] X Expert Source Lindsay Yoshitomi Nail Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2019. If you are working with bright or neon nail polish, apply a thin coat of white nail polish instead. This will help make your actual colors show up better. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Brush on liquid latex to the skin around your nails and allow it to dry. This technique can get messy, so having a barrier between your skin and the nail polish will make cleaning up easier. Liquid latex is the easiest product to use because it dries fast. [5] X Expert Source Lindsay Yoshitomi Nail Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2019. You can also try school glue (clear or white), or even some petroleum jelly. You can buy liquid latex online, from well-stocked beauty supply stores, and from costume shops that sell makeup."

Use a generous amount and make sure that the colors overlap in the middle. [6] X Expert Source Lindsay Yoshitomi Nail Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2019. If you used primary colors, you’ll get a secondary color in the middle. For example, if you used blue and yellow, you’ll get green in the middle. If you used a primary color and a secondary color, you’ll get a tertiary color in the middle. For example, if you used pink and purple, you’ll get a purple-pink in the middle. If you used blue and green, you’ll get blue-green."

[7] X Expert Source Lindsay Yoshitomi Nail Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2019. Repeat this step 2 more times, once with the sponge a little higher on your nail and once with the sponge a little lower. This will help further blend the colors together. Your second color may not show up very well. Don’t worry; the next step will fix that. Save time by doing the rest of your nails while the first coat dries."

If the sponge hasn't been completely soaked through, you can flip it over and use the other side. [8] X Research source Do not wait for this second coat to dry.

You can use a regular top coat or a matte top coat. Make sure that you extend the top coat over the top edge of your nail.
