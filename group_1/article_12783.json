      "title": "List your personal values.",
      "content": "List your personal values. If you are in charge of the company or leading the creation of the code of ethics, you should consider your personal values. Factor in what you value in life as an employee, as a boss, and as a person. These values can then inform your company's code of ethics. [1] X Research source You may ask yourself, “What do I believe in?” “How would I like to behave around others?” “How would I like to treat others?” \"How would I like others to be treated?\" Common personal values may be \"reliability,\" \"dependability,\" loyalty,\" and \"honesty.\" You may also think about how you have treated others in the past. Consider how you have dealt with moral dilemmas or ethical issues. Do you feel you acted correctly? If so, you may use this as a model for the code of ethics. If you're not sure what your values are, take 7 days and jot down every single moment that lifts you up or makes you feel excited, engaged, or lit up. Then, look for patterns in the list that can give you insight into what's important to you. [2] X Expert Source Dawn Smith-Camacho Career & Life Coach Expert Interview. 13 May 2020."

      "title": "Discuss the company's values.",
      "content": "Discuss the company's values. Ask a team of your employees to list the company's values. Have the team to look back at any ethical issues or moral dilemmas the company dealt with in the past. Consider how the company responded to these issues and what could have been done better or be improved. [3] X Research source Have the team consider, “How would the company like to treat ethical issues?” “How would the company like to treat employees and clients?” “What does the company believe in and how does this inform their values?” If the company already has a mission statement, you may use it to inform the company's values. For example, the company's mission statement might be, \"We serve the needs of our customers and our employees with integrity and honesty.\" Often, a company's mission statement will say a lot about what the company values and how it approaches ethics."

      "title": "Review codes of ethics written by others.",
      "content": "Review codes of ethics written by others. To help you identify your values and ethics, look at examples of code of ethics from other people and other companies. Contact other companies in your field and ask them for a copy of their code of ethics. Don't be afraid to use language from other code of ethics. Use it as a guide or reference and make it your own. If you use content from other code of ethics, make sure you cite them, especially if you are quoting the content word for word."

      "content": "Have an introduction or prologue. Start the code of ethics with an introduction or prologue that explains why the code is important and what the purpose of the code is. Address what the code is meant to accomplish. Note the scope of the code and who it applies to. [6] X Research source Note in the introduction whether the code of ethics is mandatory for all employees.

      "content": "List the core values. Make a list of the core values and provide a brief summary of what the value means to the company. There is no set number of values needed for a code of ethics. You may have four to eight core values or one to five core values.

    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss the importance of these values.",
      "content": "Discuss the importance of these values. You can also mention why the core values are important, focusing on each value listed.

[8] X Research source For example, you may note, “Professional integrity is important to us as a company because we believe employees should act with consideration for others.”"

[11] X Research source You can also make a point to revisit the code of ethics once a year and review it. Add or revise sections of it as you see fit. Make sure it feels relevant and up to date so it gets used on a regular basis."
