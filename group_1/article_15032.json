      "content": "Pick your flowers. Most flowers air-dry best when they are just beginning to open. They will continue to open slightly as they dry, and a fully open flower may lose its petals. [1] X Research source This method works best for small, sturdy blossoms, such as lavender or larkspur. [2] X Research source Wilting and pest damage becomes more obvious after drying. Choose only the best flowers, and pick extra in case of problems. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Prepare the flowers in bunches.",
      "content": "Prepare the flowers in bunches. Strip each flower stem of all leaves. Separate the flowers by species, then make bunches with up to 10 flowers of a single type. Large flowers such as hydrangeas, roses, and peonies should be dried individually instead. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Strawflower and some other species have weak stems that break apart when dried. Cut the stem off instead and thread florist's wire through the base of the flower. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie the end of each bunch with a rubber band.",
      "content": "Tie the end of each bunch with a rubber band. Wrap a large rubber band around two or three stems, wrap it several times around the whole bunch, then finish by wrapping it around another two or three stems. [7] X Research source The stems will shrink as they dry, but the rubber band will stay tight around them. The rubber band shouldn't press so hard that it creases the stem; this can cause damp pockets and lead to rot. If you're concerned about this, tie the bunch with twine or raffia instead. You may need to re-tie the twine halfway through drying."

    {
      "title": "Hang the bunches upside-down.",
      "content": "Hang the bunches upside-down. Keep them in a warm, dark, dry location to prevent rot and minimize fading. [8] X Research source Air circulation helps the flowers dry and prevents mold, so keep the bunches spaced out in an area with a good cross-breeze, at least 6 inches (15cm) below the ceiling. [9] X Research source You can hang the flowers from hooks, nails, or coat hangers. One easy way to do it is a paper clip bent into an S-shape. Poke one end underneath the rubber band, and the other end over the hook. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wait for 2–4 weeks.",
      "content": "Wait for 2–4 weeks. The flower is ready when the petals are crisp to the touch. Occasionally a bunch will take longer than four weeks, usually because the room isn't ideal or the flower petals are unusually thick. The stems usually dry completely straight. If you want a more natural, curved look, submerge the stems in warm water until soft. Bend them however you like, and hold them in position with weights until they dry again. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Preserve them with hairspray (optional).",
      "content": "Preserve them with hairspray (optional). A light mist of aerosol hairspray or floral sealer will set the flowers' shape. This will make them less susceptible to breaking or dropping petals. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose your flowers.",
      "content": "Choose your flowers. Microwaving works best for flowers with many petals, and no hairy or sticky surface. Roses, zinnias, and marigolds are good options, although varieties with thick petals might not work out. [13] X Research source Pick the flowers when half-open and firm, before petals start dropping. Cut the stems pretty short for this method — about 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm)"

      "content": "Wire the flowers (optional). The stems won't be flexible after microwaving. If you want to bend the flowers for an arrangement, stick a 20–24 gauge wire through the base of the flower, then wrap it in a helix around the stem. Though it is best not to use metal in a microwave oven [14] X Research source If the flower doesn't have a thick base, stick the wire through the center of the flower and into the stem. Push it down as far as you can to hide the wire from view."

Silica gel is the best option for delicate and colorful petals, but you can use clay cat litter instead, or a 50/50 mix of borax and cornmeal. Fill the container to a depth of 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm).

Pour more desiccant slowly over the flowers, burying them. Use a toothpick to rearrange the petals if they get bent out of shape. Start with just one or two flowers in case they end up burnt. It will get easier as you learn how much drying each flower will take."

If not, heat them for 1-minute intervals, checking after each one. This step can take a lot of trial and error, since there's so much variation between flowers and microwaves. Some thin flowers like daisies do best at low microwave settings, just above defrost. [16] X Research source Others with many, thick petals can take as long as 8 minutes on medium or high temperatures."

[17] X Research source The desiccant (especially silica gel) can take a long time to cool to a safe temperature. Leave dahlias, pansies, and peonies for 36 hours instead. Larger, thicker flowers such as roses and carnations may be ready in as few as 10 hours. Keep this out of reach of children and animals."

The low heat will dry the flowers slowly; leave them in the oven for several hours. [20] X Research source The total drying time will vary based on the type and number of flowers you used. A well-ventilated convection oven will do the best job. Do not try this with a normal oven. Normal ovens contain too much moisture and usually have a minimum temperature much higher than 100ºF (38ºC)."

Whichever desiccant you choose must be completely dry to be effective. Here are the most common options: Silica gel: the fastest option, available at garden supply stores. Although more expensive, it can be reused many times (see Tips below). Borax and white cornmeal: a cheap and lightweight option. Mix in equal quantities, or with as little as 1 part borax to 6 parts cornmeal — it shouldn't make much difference. Fine sand: this just supports the shape of the flower, allowing the air to dry it. The slowest option, but sometimes the cheapest."

      "content": "Choose a container. If you have plenty of material, pick a container that can fit the entire upright stem. Most people save on materials and just cut off the flower stem, leaving a blossom that can fit in a shallow container. Different materials require slightly different setups: [22] X Research source For silica gel, use a container that can be sealed airtight. A coffee can is a good option for a single flower. For borax or sand, use an open container. A strong cardboard box is ideal, but check the base for holes first."

      "content": "Bury the flowers in the desiccant. Pour your material into the container, to a depth of 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm). Place the flowers upright in the material, making sure they're stable. Sift or slowly pour more desiccant on top of them, until they are buried. If using sand, you don't need to bury the flowers completely. The sand is mostly for support, and air exposure can help dry the petals. Flowers from the daisy family dry best upside-down instead. [23] X Research source Some flowers, such as snapdragons and delphiniums, dry best when laid horizontal. [24] X Research source If the stems are still attached, fill the container as deep as necessary to hold them."

Check after a few days, using a toothpick to probe the petals and test for dryness. Silica gel is the fastest means of drying flowers; most take only 2-4 days to dry completely, while thick flowers can take up to a week. [25] X Research source When silica gel turns pink, it's absorbed as much moisture as it can. Borax mixtures can take 5–14 days to dry the flowers. Sand takes longest of all, usually about 14–21 days.

      "content": "Remove carefully. Tip the container sideways and tap the sides until the flower is exposed. Gently remove the dry flower, supporting it from underneath. Brush away the packing material with a small brush. If the material is clinging to the flower, pour a thin stream of sand from about 12 inch (30cm) above the flower. This should dislodge the stuck particles. [27] X Research source Removing the flowers too soon can cause drooping. Test the edge first for a crisp, papery feel before you pick it up. Floral sealer or hairspray will postpone breakage."
