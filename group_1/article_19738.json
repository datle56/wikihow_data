      "content": "Understand what can cause a lazy eye. Amblyopia occurs when the brain has difficulty communicating with the eyes correctly. It may occur when one eye has significantly better focus than the other. On its own, amblyopia can be difficult to spot because it may not present with any visual difference or deformity. A visit to the eye doctor is the only way to accurately diagnose a lazy eye. [2] X Research source Strabismus is a very common cause of amblyopia. Strabismus is a misalignment of the eyes where one eye turns inward (esotropia), outward (exotropia), up (hypertropia), or down (hypotropia). It is sometimes known as a “wandering eye.” Eventually, the “straight” comes to dominate the visual signals to the brain, causing “strabismic amblyopia. However, not all lazy eyes are associated with strabismus. Amblyopia may also be the result of a structural problem, such as a droopy eyelid. [3] X Research source Other problems in the eye, such as a cataract (a “cloudy” spot in the eye) or glaucoma, can also cause a lazy eye. This type of amblyopia is called “deprivation amblyopia” and usually must be surgically treated. Severe differences in the refraction between each eye can also cause amblyopia. For example, some people are nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other (a condition known as anisometropia). The brain will choose one eye to use and will ignore the other. This type of amblyopia is known as “refractive amblyopia.” Occasionally, bilateral amblyopia can affect both eyes. For example, an infant may be born with cataracts in both eyes. An eye care professional can diagnose and provide treatment options for this type of amblyopia."

A professional eye exam is the only way to determine for sure whether your child has a lazy eye, but there are some symptoms you can look for. [4] X Research source Becoming fussy or upset if you cover one eye. Some children may become fussy or upset if you cover one of their eyes. This could be a sign that the eyes are not sending equal visual signals to the brain. [5] X Research source Poor depth perception. Your child may have trouble with depth perception (stereopsis) and may also have trouble seeing movies in 3-D. Your child may have trouble seeing distant objects, such as a chalkboard at school. Wandering eye. If your child’s eyes appear misaligned, she may have strabismus, a common cause of amblyopia. Frequent squinting, eye rubbing, and head tilting. These may all be signs of blurry vision, which is a common side effect of amblyopia. Difficulty at school. Sometimes, a child may have difficulty at school due to amblyopia. Speak with your child’s teacher and ask whether your child is making excuses when asked to read from a distance (e.g., “I feel dizzy,” or, “My eyes are itchy”). [6] X Research source You should ask your eye care professional to check for misalignment or vision problems in children younger than six months. At this age, your child’s vision is still developing so much that at-home tests may be ineffective.

Observe the child’s eyes carefully as you move the object. You should note if one eye is slower than the other while following the object. Cover one of your child’s eyes and move the object again: left, right, up and down. Cover the other eye and repeat the test. Make note of how each eye responds.

Working with photos gives you more time to scrutinize the indicators that may signal a problem. This is especially useful for infants and young children, who may not keep still long enough for you to examine their eyes. [9] X Research source You can use existing photos if they show the eyes in clear detail. If you don’t have any photos that are suitable, ask someone to help you make some new photographs. Use the reflection from a small penlight to help rule out a lazy eye. Ask your assistant to hold a small penlight about three feet from your child’s eyes. Ask the child to look at the light. As the light is shining on your child’s eyes, take a picture of the eyes. Look for symmetrical reflection of the light in their iris or pupil area. If the light reflexes are in the same spot on each eye, then your child’s eyes are likely straight. If the light reflexes are not symmetrical, then one eye might be turned inward or outward. If you're unsure, take multiple photos at different times to recheck the eyes."

An eye care professional will assess your child’s eyesight and condition of the eyes themselves to determine if your child has a lazy eye.

[13] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Retinoscopy. The doctor may use a handheld tool called a retinoscope to examine the eye. The retinoscope shines a light into the eye. As the beam moves, the doctor can determine the refractive error (e.g., nearsighted, farsighted, astigmatism) of the eye by watching the retina’s “red reflex.” This method can be very helpful in diagnosing tumors or cataracts in infants, too. Your doctor will likely use eye-dilating drops to examine your child with this method. Prisms. Your eye doctor may use a prism to test the eye’s light reflex. If the reflexes are symmetric, the eyes are straight; if they are not symmetric, the child may have strabismus (a cause of amblyopia). The doctor will hold the prism over one eye and adjust it to determine the reflex. This technique is not as accurate as some other tests for strabismus, but it may be necessary to use when examining very young children. Visual acuity assessment testing (VAT). This type of testing includes several types of exams. The most basic uses the familiar “Snellen chart,” where your child will read the smallest letters he can on a standardized letter chart.

Photoscreening is especially helpful with very young children (under age three), children who have difficulty sitting still, non-cooperative children, or children with disabilities such as Nonverbal Learning Disorder or autism. The test usually takes less than one minute. Cycloplegic refraction test. This test determines how the eye structure displays and receives images from the lens.

Gradually increase the time until your child wears the patch for the correct length of time every day.
