      "content": "Clean your keyboard. If you live in a highly dusty or dirty area (like with a pet that sheds a lot), then your keyboard will probably accumulate that dust and dirt under the keys. In the process of cleaning your keyboard, make sure you tilt it to see if any dirt or dust falls out on its own. If you're using a mechanical keyboard (the keys are high off the board), then you can use a key puller to remove every key and clean under it. For those using a laptop keyboard or a normal keyboard that doesn't have the feature to pull off keys, you can use a can of compressed air to clean the dust and dirt from your keyboard or put a tiny bit of isopropyl alcohol underneath the key and hit it a couple times. Make sure to only do this with the computer completely powered off."
