      "title": "Wash your hair with shampoo.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with shampoo. Exfoliating your scalp works best on freshly washed hair. So, hop in the shower or bath and give your head a nice scrub. Make sure all the suds are washed out before you get out. Some products work as a pre-shampoo treatment, so always check your exfoliant’s label before hopping in the shower. If you’re using a DIY treatment, it’s most likely best to wash your hair first and exfoliate after."

      "title": "Massage your scalp with product and rinse thoroughly.",
      "content": "Massage your scalp with product and rinse thoroughly. Being too rough on your scalp or over-exfoliating can lead to hair loss and damage. So, to avoid this, start slow. Use gentle circular motions to massage your chosen exfoliating product (scalp scrub, serum, etc.) into your hair for about 5 minutes. Place your scalp scrub or serum on your fingertips or massage it in with an exfoliating hair brush . Rinse the product out when you’re done, and you’re good to go. When in doubt, follow the product’s instructions on how to apply the specific product."

      "title": "Exfoliate your hair once a week or month.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your hair once a week or month. Depending on your hair type, you may need to exfoliate once a week or once every month. Start by exfoliating once every 2 weeks, then try once a week if you don’t see results. If exfoliating every 2 weeks hurts your scalps, wait another 2 weeks before exfoliating again. Avoid exfoliating your scalp before a chemical or color treatment, which could cause skin irritation. If you have eczema, consult your dermatologist before exfoliating to find the best schedule for you and your skin."

Add a few pumps of spray-on sunscreen to your scalp to help reduce sensitivity. While there’s no evidence backing up this hack, many hairdressers and exfoliators swear by it."
