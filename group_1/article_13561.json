      "content": "Go slowly. If you lower yourself into the split too fast, then you can seriously injure yourself. Find a speed that works for you.. Always ease yourself slowly into the splits. By going slowly, you avoid injuries. Not only will injuries prevent you from doing the stretch immediately, it can potentially prevent you from practicing for a long time. Itâ€™s more important to practice consistently than to attempt to do the splits fast"

      "title": "Lower yourself.",
      "content": "Lower yourself. Once you are warmed up and feel relaxed, start to lower yourself very carefully. Continue going down until you feel pain or discomfort. Once you feel any major discomfort, other than the minor pain that comes from stretching, stop. As you lower yourself, keep your hands to your side so that you can support your body weight. If you feel pain after you are done with the side splits, then you forced yourself too hard into the stretch. Wait until the pain is completely gone before attempting the stretch again."

      "title": "Hold the position.",
      "content": "Hold the position. Once you have achieved the split, hold it for as long as you can. Start setting time limits. Try to hold it for 15 seconds, then 30 seconds. Try to work your way to a minute. [2] X Research source Remember to always do the splits comfortably. Do not hold the position if you feel any major discomfort. Straddle stretch (if wished): get into a straddle and try to touch your nose to each knee and then to the floor. Sit with one leg behind you and one leg tucked underneath you. Sit like this for a while."

      "title": "Do stretches.",
      "content": "Do stretches. Do lower back and inner thigh stretches for 10 or so minutes. Butterfly stretch. This stretch is mainly useful for box splits, although it increases all round leg flexibility. Sit on the floor, with your back supported, and push your feet inwards, using your elbows to push your knees down. Make sure to do this against a wall so you don't end up using your inner thighs to keep you upright. Pike stretch. Do this standing up and sitting down. Stand straight and touch your toes for as long as you can, keeping your legs completely vertical. Note that the older you are, the more difficult it is to stretch. This is because your body dehydrates as it gets older, causing the lubricants between your tissues to decrease. This means that it will take longer for you to do the splits. [7] X Research source It doesn't mean that you can't do it though; take it slowly."
