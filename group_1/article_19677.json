      "content": "The vinegar smell will go away on its own if you let fresh air in. Vinegar is a natural deodorizing agent. It binds to molecules in the air and absorbs whatever smell those molecules are causing. Crack your windows and introduce some fresh air. In a few minutes, whatever vinegar you’re still smelling will bind to the new air molecules and that odor will go away. [1] X Research source For added oomph, cleaning expert Susan Stocker shares that \"you can try to put a glass full of coffee grounds on a [nearby] counter to absorb the smell.\" If you’re cleaning a car, just leave the windows open for a few minutes. For a fridge, try leaving the door open for a minute or two. There’s no set time that the vinegar smell will linger. It depends on the air flow in the space. However, vinegar actively looks for things to bind to. In most cases, it won't take more than 5-15 minutes for the smell to go away."

      "title": "Increasing the air flow",
      "content": "Increasing the air flow will remove the vinegar smell faster. Circulating the air in your home will clear out that vinegar odor in no time, so turn any ceiling fans on. If you have any standing or desk fans , turn those on as well and set them to oscillate back and forth. If you’ve got central air in your home, turn it on as well to encourage even more air flow. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to change the temperature in your home, set your central AC to “fan” mode. This way, it’ll blow air without heating or cooling it."

      "content": "Removing humidity from the air will extract that vinegar odor faster. Go to wherever the vinegar smell is the strongest and plug a dehumidifier in. Let it run for 10-15 minutes and your vinegar smell will disappear entirely. An air purifier will also do the trick if you don’t want to dry the air out too much. Simply plug an air purifier in wherever the vinegar smell is the strongest and let the purifier run. [3] X Research source A dehumidifier and/or air purifier are just generally good appliances to have around if you want to improve the air in your home."

      "content": "Any scented candle will mask the odor of vinegar. If you keep any candles around your home, grab a scented candle and light it. Set the candle in whatever area where the vinegar smell is the strongest and just let it burn. The vinegar odor will go away soon enough. [4] X Research source Burn your candles safely . Do not leave your home or leave the candle unattended."

      "content": "For a more spiritual vibe, use incense to cover up other odors. Any kind of incense will help mask the smell of the vinegar. Grab an incense stick , light the tip, and then set it in your incense holder. The vinegar will latch on to the smoke molecules and disappear in no time. [5] X Research source You can burn a sage smudge stick if you want to purify your home while masking the vinegar smell."

      "content": "Choose your favorite essential oil and diffuse it in the air. If you use aromatherapy, set a diffuser out wherever the vinegar smell is strongest, fill it with water, and add a few drops of your preferred essential oil. Turn it on and let the diffuser blow scented steam into the air. That annoying vinegar smell will go away soon. Plus, the essential oils will help you relax! [6] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If you don’t have a diffuser, you can achieve a similar effect by boiling some water and adding a few drops of your favorite essential oil to the water. The steam will carry the oil’s odor throughout the air."

      "content": "Baking soda will neutralize odors on whatever surface it touches. After you finish cleaning a surface with vinegar, sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda over the area. Wait a few minutes for the baking soda to absorb the vinegar odor, then wipe it with a damp rag. Alternatively, you can simply open a box of baking soda and leave it in your room, fridge, or car. That will get rid of any annoying smells. [7] X Research source Baking soda is a deodorizing agent, just like vinegar. It will bind to any vinegar molecules and keep them from lingering in the air after you’re done cleaning. You can also mix the baking soda with vinegar to create a cleaning paste and use that instead of just spraying straight vinegar. This will create a less vinegar-smelling cleaning solution.

      "content": "According to Cleaning Expert Susan Stocker, \"the best way is to stop the smell before you use it. Do this by cutting the smell with some lemon or orange added to the vinegar.\" Throw some citrus rinds in your vinegar and let it marinate before use. The next time you’re peeling some lemons, limes, or oranges, dump the rinds in your bottle of white vinegar to make a citrus cleaning solution. Set the container out in a sunny spot for 1-2 weeks and then strain the vinegar into a spray bottle before use. The vinegar will still deodorize and clean whatever surface you spray it on, but you’ll be left with a fresh citrusy scent instead of that acrid vinegar smell! [9] X Research source You can use fresh herbs, like rosemary or thyme, instead of citrus rinds for an earthier aroma. If you prefer to use essential oils, pour a few drops of the essential oil into the vinegar instead of using herbs or citrus rinds."

      "content": "Diluting your vinegar will reduce how strong the smell is. Cut your vinegar with water going forward to protect surfaces and cut down on that vinegary odor. [10] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source For your typical cleaning purposes, mix 3-parts water with 1-part white vinegar. For tougher, smellier messes, mix 1-part water with 1-part white vinegar in a spray bottle. You don’t normally need 100% pure white vinegar to clean a surface or deodorize an area effectively. In fact, undiluted vinegar may even stain or damage certain surfaces."

      "content": "After you clean, wipe down the surface with a wet sponge. A lot of that vinegar smell is coming from the residue left behind from your cleaning. If you’re cleaning a tub or shower tile, simply rinse the vinegar residue off. Otherwise, load a sponge with water, squeeze the excess out, and gently run it over the surface you cleaned. This will neutralize any vinegary smells you’d normally be left with after you clean. [11] X Research source You can let any remaining moisture air dry, or wipe it dry with a clean rag or paper towel."

      "content": "The fact that you smell the vinegar is a sign you’re using too much! Vinegar is a great deodorizer because it binds to molecules in the air and neutralizes whatever smell they’re creating. However, if you smell that vinegar odor floating around in the air after you’re done cleaning, that means you’ve over-saturated the air with the vinegar. Try using less white vinegar in the future—you’ll still get whatever you’re cleaning back in tiptop shape with less of the stuff. [12] X Research source"
