[1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Staying hydrated gives your body the resources it needs to produce the amount of saliva needed to keep your throat moist.

Tea can be an especially good beverage choice for those suffering with dry throats. [2] X Research source Many herbal teas offer natural relief for irritated throats, and teas made from actual tea leaves contain antioxidants that boost your immune system. Avoid caffeinated teas since caffeine can cause dehydration, though."

Gargle the mixture for at least 30 seconds before spitting it out. Alternatively, you could gargle licorice water instead of salt water to achieve a similar benefit. Choose licorice powder that contains real licorice and dissolve 1 tsp (5 ml) in 8 oz (250 ml) of warm water. Treat the remedy like a salt water rinse."

Similarly, you can suck on ice chips, sugar-free popsicles, or throat lozenges to help keep your throat adequately moist. Lozenges that contain numbing ingredients, like menthol or eucalyptus, may provide more relief than standard varieties do.

Moreover, acidic beverages are more likely to further encourage tooth decay, and people who suffer from dry throat and dry mouth are already at a higher risk of developing decay."
