      "content": "Use your left hand to pinch the middle of the top of the net and lift up. While lifting up on the net, grab the corner of the net that is closest to you with your right hand. Push this corner away from you and into the corner directly adjacent it. As you pull up on the net from the top, the sides should automatically start to fold inward. Use this momentum to help you fold the net. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the two remaining sections directly on top of one another. Grab the left section of the net with your left hand and the right section with your right hand. Bring them together and line up the edges. All four sides of the net should now be neatly stacked on top of one another."

Hold the left side of the net with your left hand, and the right side with your right hand, directly on each side of the zipper line. If you don't hold the net in the right place, it may not fold properly. The zipper line is horizontal, close to the top, and runs the entire length of the net. [3] X Research source"

Bring the net to the ground and position the section you are squeezing directly in the middle of the rest of the net. You should now have three separate, rounded sections. [4] X Research source"

If the rubber band won’t stretch enough to completely fit over the net, don’t push it. You could damage your net if you force it on. [6] X Research source"
