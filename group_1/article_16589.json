      "content": "Have a qualifying disability. The SDI program defines a disability as any mental or physical condition that keeps you from working. If you’re unemployed, you may still qualify for SDI if your disability kept you from looking for work for at least a week. Nearly any medical condition can be an SDI disability. For example, you may be eligible for SDI if you are pregnant or recently gave birth. Being in treatment for alcohol or drug addiction also may qualify you for SDI benefits. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Verify your employer was covered. While most California employees can receive SDI benefits as long as they meet all the other requirements, some types of employment do not. For example, athletes, independent contractors, or students employed through work-study programs generally are not eligible. To be eligible for SDI either you or your employer must have paid into the program. [6] X Research source Some employers voluntarily opt out of SDI and offer their own comparable benefits instead. [7] X Research source If you’re not sure, you should check with your employer before you spend time and effort applying for benefits. You must have been working for covered employers in California for a total of at least 18 months to qualify for benefits. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Show sufficient base period earnings.",
      "content": "Show sufficient base period earnings. To determine whether you’re eligible for SDI benefits, and how much you’ll receive, the EDD looks at your income during the year-long period beginning between 15 and 17 months before the date of your application. [10] X Research source The EDD will divide your 12-month base period into three-month quarters. To be eligible for SDI you must have earned at least $300 during one of those quarters. The quarter in which you made the most money is the quarter the EDD will use to calculate your benefits. If you were unemployed during any of those quarters, the EDD will disregard that quarter and start your base period a quarter earlier. For each unemployed quarter, the base period continues to start earlier until it covers a period in which you were employed. [11] X Research source For example, suppose you file your application in April. Your base period would be the 12-month period ending December 31 of the previous year. [12] X Research source Last year would then be divided into three-month quarters, and the quarter in which you earned the most money would determine your benefits. Continuing the example, assume that from January through April of last year, you worked full time and made $1,100 a month. In May you were laid off, but found part time work in June making $500 a month. You continued that job until October, when you found more full-time work earning $1,500 a month. Since you made the most money in the final quarter of your base period, that would be the amount the EDD would use to calculate the amount of benefits you are eligible for each week. The total amount you earned during your base period also determines how long you’ll receive benefits and how much you’ll be paid each week."

Whether you’re applying online or through the mail, you’ll need to have basic documents proving your identity as well as information about your disability and your most recent employment. Identity information includes your name, date of birth, phone number and address. You also will need to provide your social security number and your California driver’s license or state identification card. Employment information includes the business name, telephone number and address of your most recent employer, the last day you worked your regular duties and hours, and wages you’ve received or expect to receive from vacation or other leave. If you worked for a period of time on modified duty to accommodate your disability, you should provide those dates when you submit your claim. If you are receiving workers’ compensation or have filed a workers’ compensation claim, you should also include that information on your claim form.

Health care providers such as physicians, dentists, chiropractors, surgeons, psychologists and other medical professionals must use the physician/practitioner’s certificate found in Part B of your claim form. If your doctor is registered with SDI Online, she can submit the doctor’s certificate right after you file your claim, and your claim will be processed faster than if she mails in a hard copy.

If your claim is disqualified, you will receive notification of this along with a form you can fill out if you believe the disqualification was in error. Claims frequently are denied because they were filed too late. Claims must be filed within 49 days of the onset of the disability. Because many Californians aren't aware of this deadline, they don't file for benefits in time. You can have your claim considered if you appeal showing good cause as to why you missed the deadline. For example, if you were in the hospital in a coma for two months, that would probably be considered good cause. [19] X Research source To qualify for benefits, you must have been working in California for an employer who contributed to the state program for at least 18 months. People with shorter work histories in the state also will be denied benefits, but would be unlikely to prevail on appeal. [20] X Research source Many denials also are based on a lack of medical documentation for the disability alleged. If you didn't submit much medical information when you filed your claim, consider getting additional records or more thorough medical history when you file your appeal.

The ALJ is an independent third party who will listen to both sides of the case and decide whether benefits should be awarded. All testimony is under oath. Generally, the only testimony will be from you and an SDI representative. [24] X Research source The ALJ will mail a decision to all parties. The decision of the ALJ is final."
