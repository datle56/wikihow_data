      "content": "Sell old items online . You probably have some things lying around that you don’t use anymore. Selling your old items can be a great way to make money. Sites like Craigslist, eBay, and even Facebook can help you find people willing to purchase old items. Old toys, video games, video game systems, books, DVDs, collectibles, like baseball cards and stuffed animals, can be great items to resell online. Know that you won’t get as much money as you paid for the items you are selling. Once something has been used, it loses value. So expect to make about 30 to 40% of what you originally paid for an item when you resell it. Try eBay. Make sure to accurately describe the condition of the items you are selling. eBay will allow you to sell items in an auction setting or list a \"sell now” price. Be prepared to ship the items you are selling. It is going to cost you some money to ship the items, so be aware of this when coming up with your prices. Never give out your address, home phone number, or agree to have someone come by the house to pick the item up. You don’t know who is agreeing to buy your items and you need to protect yourself. If you're under 18, you will need to have an adult create an eBay account that you can use. [1] X Research source Try Craigslist. Craigslist has a section where you can post about items you're willing to sell. If you're posting in a specific city, you may have to meet a buyer in person if they make an offer on an item. Be safe. Meet the buyer in a public place and take a friend or family member with you. There may be specific sites to sell used books, video games, collectibles, and other items. A google search may provide you with a list of possible websites where you can sell your products."

You could try taking books you have already read to the bookstore to sell them or video games you don’t play anymore into the game store to make some money. Old clothes, toys, stuffed animals, and household items can be sold at thrift stores. Again, be aware that you won’t get as much money for these items as you originally paid, but if you have a lot of stuff to sell it will add up with time."
