      "content": "Surprise him in the shower. If you really want to be bold, then you should surprise your man in the shower. This will be a delightful, spontaneous, and unexpected treat for him. Before he goes into the shower, give him a kiss, tell him how sexy he is, and say something provocative to make him want you. Say, \"Have fun getting undressed in there,\" and say it while you're wearing something provocative. When he steps into the shower, wait a few seconds and then knock on the door -- you don't want to scare him completely. Tell him that you're taking off your clothes and that you'd like to get clean, too -- but not before you both get a little dirty. Step into the shower and begin kissing his mouth and neck and caressing his body, and see how excited he gets."

      "title": "Be the boss.",
      "content": "Be the boss. Another way to be bold is to be the boss once in a while. Pick a night to take complete control of him, to drag him up the stairs and into your bedroom, and to tell him exactly what you want him to do. Don't smile or break character. Be firm about what you want and desire and see how turned on he gets . [1] X Research source Take him into the bedroom, tell him to lie down, and take control of him. If you want something, ask for it. Have fun with it. Hold him down and don't give in if he begs for mercy -- unless he really means it, of course."

      "content": "Send dirty texts. Though you may think that sending dirty texts is silly, it's a great way to remind your man of how sexy you are when you're not around, and to check in with him in a sexy way. If you have to be apart for a night, a few days, or even a month, sending a few well-timed dirty texts is the perfect way to make your man want you even more. [2] X Research source Pick a time when you know you'll both be alone and unoccupied, preferably at night. Send your man a text a few hours before you know you'll see him. Just saying, \"I want you,\" or \"I can't stop thinking about last night,\" will keep you fresh on his mind. Ask your man what he's wearing or tell him what you're wearing. Tell him, \"It's so hot in here.\" Then, let him know when you remove any clothing."

      "content": "Talk dirty. Talking dirty in person is another great way to be bold and to drive your boyfriend crazy. When you're hooking up, throwing in a dirty phrase or two can mix things up and drive your man wild. You don't have to overthink it -- just tell him how much you love what he's doing to you, tell him how much you love his body, and let him know what you want him to do. Here are some things you can say: [3] X Research source \"I love it when you kiss my neck.\" \"I've been thinking about your arms all day.\" \"You look so hot with your shirt off.\" \"I want you to take off my bra.\""

      "content": "Do a striptease. A striptease doesn't have to be reserved for the strippers. Have fun with it. Dim the lights, get your man in bed, and walk into the room like you own the place, with your head high. Wear some sexy lingerie and high heels, and cover up with a long button down shirt, or a sexy dress that you can easily remove. Then, strip down to your underwear while you use a chair as a prop so your man can see you move your body while you remove your garments. As you remove each article of clothing, throw it at your boyfriend. Put one foot up on the chair so your boyfriend can admire your legs. Turn around, gyrate your hips, and bend down to let your man see your body from behind. Have fun with it. Have a sexy smile on your face and don't take yourself too seriously."

You can sit your man down on a chair, play some upbeat and sexy music, and have fun getting on his lap, teasing him, dancing around the chair, and even bending over with your back to your man so he can see your body. You can tease your man by kissing him a little bit, but it'll drive him wild if you play a bit hard to get. Don't let your man put his hands all over you. You'll drive him wild if you make it clear that you're in control."

      "content": "Look sexy. If you want to drive your boyfriend wild, then you'll have to make an effort to look sexy. This doesn't mean that you should look sexy or dress provocatively all the time, or that you should change your looks just to turn on your man. It does mean that you should try to up the ante a bit with your clothes and make up, and dress and look in a way that makes your boyfriend notice you -- and want to get you alone. You don't have to wear a ton of makeup. Try creating smoky eyes with dark eyeshadow and mascara, and wear just a bit of lip gloss or lip balm to draw attention to your lips. You can look provocative without looking trashy. Wear flattering clothes that fit you well and show off your best assets. If you want to be really sexy, dress really provocatively from time to time -- or when you know you and your man will be alone. This will be a fun change and will drive your man wild. Get some sexy undergarments. The right thong, lacy bra, or pair of panties can make your man even more turned on."

      "content": "Tease him. If you want to drive your boyfriend crazy, then you can't just give him what he wants all the time. Instead, you should kiss him for a minute or two, and then pull back, leaving him wanting more. If you're out, touch him provocatively by putting your hand on his thigh or caressing his neck before moving away. If you're alone in the bedroom, drive him wild with your kisses and caresses before removing your clothes. [4] X Research source You can also tease him by saying the right things. Tell him that you know he wants you, but that you're not sure if you're in the mood -- this will drive him wild. Compliment his body and let him know how sexy he is. Then, look down at the floor or distance yourself from him. You can also tease him by caressing your own body. You can say, \"This shirt is so tight,\" or \"I can't believe how big my chest looks in this bra,\" to make him want your body. If you're wearing a thong, lean down so he gets a peek at it. If you're wearing a lacy bra, lean toward him a bit so he gets a look at your cleavage in the bra."

Being sexy in public doesn't mean trying to initiate a make-out session in the checkout aisle at your local grocery store or touching your man every chance you get. It does mean touching your boyfriend in a knowing way from time to time, giving him seductive smiles, and mentioning something that makes him want to get private. Don't be afraid to kiss him in public. Kiss him, linger a bit, and then pull away with a smile. You don't have to touch him all the time in public, either. Just put your hand on his thigh, squeeze his knee, or rub his shoulder occasionally. Get close when you can. Stand close to him, whether you're both looking at a menu or watching a movie. Let him remember how good it feels to be next to you."

[5] X Research source If you're comfortable with your boyfriend, try giving his neck the tiniest nibble. This is guaranteed to drive him wild -- as long as you don't do it too much. You can alternate between kissing him on the lips and kissing his neck. This will drive him wild too."

Just wait for him to sit down and be relaxed and get behind him and start caressing his shoulders, kneading his muscles harder and harder until he moans with pleasure. You can also run your fingers in circles on his head and at his temples, and work your way down to his back and sides. A sexy massage is great in almost any private circumstance, but it'll be even better if you dim the lights, turn off the TV, and indulge in the moment. You can transition from a sexy massage to sexy time. Just work your hands down your man's body and start kissing his neck as you explore him. If you want to be frisky, you can turn things around and say, \"Now it's my turn,\" and enjoy letting him touch your body."

If you're always getting it on on the couch or the bed, your moves may begin to feel stale, so you should mix things up from time to time so your boyfriend is still crazy about you and so that your relationship and love life feel fresh. Here are some places to try: [7] X Research source Try \"christening\" a new room in your house or apartment by making love there. Pull the car over to a private and scenic location and have fun kissing each other. Take it back to high school and have fun kissing your man at the movies. Go on a sexy vacation and have fun having hooking up in a completely new environment. There's nothing wrong with sneaking off to your friend's balcony in the middle of a party and stealing a few kisses."

If you're always making love or hooking up in the same position, mix things up next time. If you're always on top and your man is on the bottom, switch roles from time to time. You can make a game of hooking up only in new positions for a while, and cycling through a variety of positions before making it back to same old, same old. Trying out new moves is a great way to keep things fresh -- just make sure you're not doing anything that doesn't make you comfortable."
