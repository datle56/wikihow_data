Measure the length and width of each portion of the roof, multiply length by width for each plane, and then add the planes together for the total square footage. [1] X Research source If you have a simple gable roof, you’ll only need to measure and sum up the 2 planes of the roof. If your roof has dormers, hips, or other complex elements, don’t forget to take the area of those additional parts of the roof into account. Because of these slopes and pitches, the square footage of your roof will not be the same as the square footage of your home.

      "content": "Estimate how many roofing nails you'll need. At 4 nails per field shingle, that’s about 320 nails per square. You will also need 5 nails for each starter shingle. For high-wind areas, use 6 nails per shingle, or 480 nails per square. Inquire at the hardware store regarding the size of nail you’ll need and how many pounds or kilograms you’ll need of that size; the number of nails per pound or kg differs. The nails should be long enough to go 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) into the roof. Inquire at the hardware store regarding the amount of underlayment nails required. Always use 1 in (2.5 cm) nails. The nails should be 12 inches (30 cm) apart along the edges and 24 inches (61 cm) apart in the middle of the underlayment strip."
