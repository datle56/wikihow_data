      "content": "Cut through plastic with a fine-toothed saw. According to Pischer, when using a fine-toothed saw , clamp the plastic you’re cutting to a table or work bench with a C-clamp. Saw using the full length of the blade, and move the saw in smooth, quick back-and-forth motions through the material you’re cutting. Using a saw with fine, small teeth will allow you to cut through thick plastic precisely and without destroying the plastic itself. [1] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. While all saws will be able to cut through plastic, saws with large teeth will leave the plastic torn or shredded. [2] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. Some of these fine-toothed saws look like a knife or straight-razor and can easily be used with one hand. [3] X Research source A selection of fine-toothed saws may be available for purchase at hobby stores, since they’re commonly used to cut plastic models and die-cast figurines."

      "title": "Cut through plastic with a jigsaw.",
      "content": "Cut through plastic with a jigsaw. When cutting with a jigsaw , hold the object you’re sawing firmly, or use a C-clamp to hold it on a table. Squeeze the trigger, so the blade is moving before you touch it to the plastic. Hold the saw’s handle steady, and use firm pressure to press the blade through your plastic. A jigsaw will work best if you’re cutting heavy-duty plastic, including PVC pipe. [4] X Research source The blade of a jigsaw is about 8 inches (20 cm) long, so won’t lend itself to detailed cutting (for example, if you want to cut out a small circle of plastic). You can purchase jigsaws and other fine-toothed saws at your local hardware store. Pischer notes that a Sawzall , or reciprocating saw, is another great tool for cutting plastic.

      "title": "Use a table saw with a non-melt blade to cut through thick plastic.",
      "content": "Use a table saw with a non-melt blade to cut through thick plastic. Start the table saw running, and set the plastic you want to cut on the flat surface of the saw table. Hold the plastic by its sides, and slowly push it forward until it engages the blade . Continue to push the plastic forward in a slow, steady motion, until the blade has cut through the entire plastic object. If you’re cutting through thick plastic with a table saw, the heated saw blade may melt the plastic. Avoid this by cutting through heavy-duty plastic with a non-melt blade, which will not heat up enough to melt the plastic material. These blades will have evenly-spaced teeth which are set close together. [6] X Research source Non-melt table saw blades should be available for purchase at a nearby hardware store.

      "content": "Select a small drill bit. It’s often tough to cut directly through thick plastic, even with a saw or a sharp knife. If you drill out a series of small holes in the plastic you’re planning to remove, you’ll have an easier time cutting the plastic. To do this, you’ll need a power drill and a small drill bit . [8] X Research source Choose a drill bit that’s no larger than 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) in diameter. If you don’t have an electric power drill and drill bits of varying sizes, you can purchase them at a local hardware store."

      "title": "Drill at least 6 holes in the plastic you want to remove or cut through.",
      "content": "Drill at least 6 holes in the plastic you want to remove or cut through. Use the small drill bit to drill 6–10 holes in the section of plastic you’re trying to cut through or remove. Make these holes as close to one another as possible. This will weaken the structure of the plastic. [9] X Research source This method will be most effective if you’re doing detailed cutting—for example, on a hobby miniature. If you’d like to cut through very large sections of plastic, you can do so by drilling small holes throughout its surface. This method could even work when cutting heavy PVC pipe. The process will be painstaking and time consuming, but it will allow you to cut precisely."

      "title": "Cut from one hole to the next.",
      "content": "Cut from one hole to the next. Use a hobby knife and cut through the plastic that remains between the holes that you’ve drilled. It may still be tough to cut through the thick plastic. Since you’ll have removed a lot of the connecting material, though, the plastic you’re cutting will be weak and already partially removed. [10] X Research source Utility knives are also often called hobby knives. They can be purchased at any craft or hobby-supply store."

      "content": "Test your string’s durability. You’ll need a section of string about 2 feet (61 cm) long to cut through plastic. Jerk your hands outward with medium force while holding the string. It if flexes slightly and doesn’t snap, it’ll cut through plastic. [11] X Research source You can purchase cotton or polyester string at any quilting or hobby store."

      "title": "Clamp the plastic firmly between your knees.",
      "content": "Clamp the plastic firmly between your knees. The plastic that you’re cutting through needs to be held steady while you use the string to slice through it. Hold it tightly between your knees, since you’ll need both hands free. Depending on the size and shape of the plastic, you could also use a C-clamp to hold it to a worktable. This is risky though, since if you exert too much pressure with the clamp, the plastic could break."

      "title": "Work the thread back and forth to start a small incision.",
      "content": "Work the thread back and forth to start a small incision. It’s best if you can set the thread in a corner or along an edge of the plastic, then begin to slide it back and forth. After a few moments, the thread will have cut a tiny groove in the plastic. Set the thread in this little groove and continue to work it back and forth. The groove will lengthen and eventually cut through the plastic. [12] X Research source This is a slow, painstaking process. Cutting through thick plastic with thread —for example, when customizing an RC car or working with hobby models and miniatures—is effective, but can take hours."

      "title": "Replace the string if it gets hot or frayed.",
      "content": "Replace the string if it gets hot or frayed. Continue working the thread back and forth until you’ve cut through the plastic. If you notice that part of the thread has become hot (due to its friction with the plastic), you may need to use a new section of thread. Hot thread is likely to snap. Roll a few more inches off of the spool, and continue cutting. [13] X Research source The plastic that you’ve sliced through should have a very smooth, clean break without any rough or jagged spots."

      "title": "What is the best tool to cut plastic containers with?",
      "content": "What is the best tool to cut plastic containers with? The best tool to cut through plastic— especially thick plastic— is a saw. The three best options are a fine-toothed saw, a jigsaw, and a table saw. Jigsaws and table saws are perfect for cutting through thicker and larger pieces of plastic, while fine-toothed saws offer the cleanest cuts. [14] X Research source You will likely have to use a deburring tool to smooth out sharp edges created by a jigsaw or table saw."

      "title": "How do I cut plastic without cracking it?",
      "content": "How do I cut plastic without cracking it? The best way to cut through plastic without cracking it is to drill small holes and then use a hobby knife to slice through. This is most likely to maintain the integrity of the plastic while still allowing you to cut exactly where you want and to what extent, as safely as possible."

      "title": "Will a hot knife cut through hard plastic?",
      "content": "Will a hot knife cut through hard plastic? While a hot knife can technically cut though hard plastic, it’s not safe. Using a hot knife exposes you to the risk of burning yourself. Additionally, the plastic could also catch fire, so this method is not advisable. A hot knife is better suited to cut through thin plastic, foam, or other synthetic materials. [15] X Research source"
