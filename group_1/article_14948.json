Grab the handhold near the front of the cab with one hand and the back of the seat with your other. Put your foot on the step and lift yourself up into the seat. Once you’re sitting down, buckle your seatbelt so you’re safe. [1] X Research source Never grab the steering wheel while you’re pulling yourself into the cab. If you’re in a standing forklift, make sure to put on the safety harnesses once you’re inside."

      "content": "Lift the fork up by 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) with the control levers. Your forklift should either have 1 or 2 black levers that control the height and tilt of the fork located to the right of the steering wheel. Pull the lever to raise the fork’s 2 tines off the ground by 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) so they don’t scrape the ground while you’re driving. [3] X Research source If you want, you can also tilt the tines backward to raise them even further. Each forklift operates differently, so look at the forklift manual before operating any of the levers so you know exactly what they do."

Lightly press on the accelerator with your right foot to start moving. Maintain a slow speed at first until you’re used to handling the machine. If you’re driving in reverse, make sure to always look behind you so you know where you’re going. Some forklifts have a forward and reverse pedal. Check the machine’s manual to check what type of forklift you’re driving."

If you’re driving in a tight area with frequent traffic, use the horn so others know that you’re passing by. Honk the horn whenever you come to an intersection. That way, people who are crossing will know that you’re coming."

Lift the tine and slide it left or right to adjust the width. Set the width of the tines to about half of the load’s width. Make sure teach tine is the same distance from the center of the machine so your load stays balanced. [6] X Research source Some forklifts will have a lever inside the cab to automatically adjust the tines while other forklifts require you to manually change the width.

Then, shift back into neutral and activate the parking brake. [9] X Research source Some forklifts have an inching pedal to the left of the steering column so the machine moves slowly. Press down on the inching pedal instead of the accelerator for more control over your movements at a slow speed."
