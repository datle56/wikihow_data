Go with a retro-themed party: Embrace your inner child with a retro-themed party—decorate with toys and tech that were popular when the guest of honor was a kid, like cassette tapes, 8-bit video games, and cartoons from the 80s or early 90s. Throw a pretend funeral: If your loved one is into really dark humor and you want to go all out, rent a casket and have everyone dress in black. Share memories mourning the passing of your friend’s youth."
