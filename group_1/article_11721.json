If the rumor's not true, they can fight the rumor by shooting it down whenever they hear someone bring it up or see it online. If the rumor is true, they can still help stop its spread by sticking up for you and chastising people that spread it. Another great reason to turn to your friends is that they'll make you feel like you're not overwhelmed. When it seems like everyone you know is talking about you behind your back, you can feel absolutely surrounded—good friends will remind you that there are always people who love and respect you. Some people gossip because they want to feel like they’re part of a group. If everyone around them is gossiping, it’s likely they’ll gossip, too. By telling your friends about gossip, they can shut it down in a group setting, even when you’re not around. Remember, gossip is just an unconfirmed report about someone that’s unlikely to be totally true. Most people know that what they hear from gossip isn’t a fact."

      "content": "Confront the source of the rumor directly. If you know for sure who's responsible for spreading a nasty rumor about you, don't take it lying down. When you have a chance, walk right up to them and say that you don't appreciate the mean things they have said. Stay calm and collected while doing this to avoid causing any more drama. [1] X Research source Say something polite yet direct, like: \"Hey. I want you to know that I don't appreciate the things you've been saying about me. Please stop.\" Then, just walk away—this person doesn't deserve your time. Ignore any insults you hear as you're walking away. Sometimes, the person who started the rumor didn't do it on purpose. It may, for instance, be a friend who simply let a secret slip by accident. In cases like this, it's OK to express your disappointment, but avoid acting in a way that seems vindictive or accusatory."

[2] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2022. When you hear that there's a rumor going around about you, simply blow it off with a comment like, \"Heh. You'd have to be pretty dumb to believe that.\" Other people will take their social cues from you. If you act like the rumor isn't worth your time, there's a good chance they'll follow suit. [3] X Research source When you hear gossip about yourself, laugh it off. Act as if it's ridiculous! Share a chuckle about it! Turn the tables by making the person who started the rumor the butt of the joke—how hilarious is it that they actually thought spreading a dumb rumor about you would work? If you see gossip about you on social media, don’t comment or reply to it. That way, the gossipers won’t have anything else to gossip about, and they’ll eventually move on. Many people gossip because they’re jealous of you or have low self-esteem. You could even think of a rumor about you as a compliment—someone was so infatuated with you, they felt like they had to make up lies to damage your image."

Don't let gossip change the way you think about yourself! The worst thing you can do is to allow a piece of gossip to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Remember that just because someone's said something about you doesn't mean it's true. If someone's nasty enough to spread gossip about you, they're definitely nasty enough to lie. [4] X Research source For instance, if you happen to overhear people talking about how you speak with a slight lisp, don't become silent and withdrawn to avoid having to hear the sound of your own voice. Everyone has small quirks that make them unique. Boost your self-esteem by remembering your strengths and doing things that make you feel confident."

Try your hardest not to shy away from the activities you would normally participate in. Doing so will only make you feel more isolated. Instead, show the world how little you care about the gossip by not altering the way you live in the slightest. [5] X Research source If someone told the whole office that you got fired from your last job for stealing, for instance, you’re probably not looking forward to chatting with people in the break room. Do your best to keep up appearances and make small talk with the coworkers you know you can trust."

If nasty rumors and gossip are a frequent problem, or if someone's told a rumor that might get you in trouble for something you didn't do, talk to your boss or someone in charge. These people can help you work through the problem—they can give you advice on how to proceed, make you feel better, and even dole out discipline to people who've started the rumor. [6] X Research source Talk to an authority figure if the gossip makes you feel like you may retaliate by doing something drastic, like starting a fight or spreading rumors about the other person. In the workplace, your boss might have a plan to deal with office gossip. If so, you can work together to nip rumors in the bud."

[7] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2022. Remember: a friend who stabs you in the back by telling a nasty rumor isn't much of a friend at all. It can also help to de-identify from the situation, or remind yourself that gossip is not a reflection of you. Most of the time, people gossip about you because they’re anxious or want attention, not because they don’t like you."

Anderson Certified Image Consultant & International Branding Icon Expert Interview. 19 July 2021. Let's say your colleague comes to you with a juicy secret about your other coworker named Jason—he’s been out on PTO all week because he’s afraid he’s getting fired! In this case, just calmly say something like \"Oh, let's not spread rumors about him\" to squash the conversation."

One of the reasons gossip can hurt so badly is because it can change the way friends and acquaintances act. Never change the way you think about someone until you have reason to believe the things you've heard are true. [10] X Research source Before talking about someone else, stop and ask yourself: “Is what I’m about to say harmful or helpful?” [11] X Expert Source Sheila A.

Sometimes, however, rumors are true or half-true. Even if you're sure that a rumor you hear is true, don't spread it. It's very embarrassing to have private information spread around. Would you like it if everyone knew some true bit of embarrassing information about you? [12] X Research source Let's say that you know the rumor about Jason is true because your boss let it slip in a private meeting. Keep this information to yourself.

This may be something they know about someone else, or it may be information about themselves. If someone's trusted you with a secret, never tell anyone else without their permission. Not only is it a big breach of their trust, it's also a sure-fire way to start the spread of a rumor that can easily spiral out of control. [13] X Research source The best way to avoid telling a secret is to simply feign ignorance and pretend that you don't know anything. If someone asks you about a friend or makes a comment about a colleague, simply say, “I don’t know,” and move on. Silence is powerful. If someone tries to gossip with you, don’t say anything at all. Eventually, they’ll get bored and move on. [14] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2022."

      "content": "Keep mean thoughts to yourself. While you’d probably never start a rumor on purpose, venting about someone can start a wild rumor that takes off before you know it. Instead of talking about people behind their back, keep your thoughts to yourself, or only vent to people that you absolutely trust. [15] X Research source Try talking to friends who don’t know the person you’re talking about. If you’re venting about a coworker, for instance, talk to your friend who works in a completely separate industry. There’s very little chance that your words will spread to anyone else. Even telling trusted friends can carry risks. They may, in turn, tell other people that they trust. As this cycle repeats, more and more people will hear your gossip and the chance that it will make its way into the general population will increase."
