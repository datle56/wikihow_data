      "title": "Decide whether you want to rip, fray, or distress your shorts.",
      "content": "Decide whether you want to rip, fray, or distress your shorts. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they actually mean different things. Ripping means creating a tear or a hole in the fabric of your shorts, distressing means to make the shorts look worn-in, and fraying means to pull the loose threads out of the hems and holes. [1] X Research source Distressed usually refers to the overall look of the shorts, while frayed usually refers to the ends or the hems."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose linen, cotton, or denim shorts.",
      "content": "Choose linen, cotton, or denim shorts. Some fabrics, like polyester and nylon, won’t fray at all. For the best look, go with soft linen, cotton, or denim shorts so you can pull the threads out of the bottom of the shorts. [2] X Research source Denim is the most common material you’ll see in reference to frayed shorts."

      "title": "Pick the tool to achieve the look that you want.",
      "content": "Pick the tool to achieve the look that you want. There are multiple ways to fray shorts, and you can use a few different tools based on what you’re going for. You can also use multiple tools if you want a combination of styles on your shorts. Choose between: [3] X Research source A razor: for scrapes and frays. Sandpaper: for an overall distressed look. Tweezers: for removing thread from a raw hem. A seam ripper: for small cuts and tears."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fray the pockets and edges, distress the overall shorts.",
      "content": "Fray the pockets and edges, distress the overall shorts. When it’s time to start fraying, you don’t just have to stick to the bottom hem. You can fray the pockets, too, and create small holes or tears in them. Then, you can give your shorts an overall distressed look to match the frayed pockets and edges. [4] X Research source If you’re working on a small section, like on a pocket, use the end of a bobby pin to pick and scrape at the material."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your shorts before and after your project.",
      "content": "Wash your shorts before and after your project. Read the label on your shorts and give them a run through the washer and the dryer before you start; this is to avoid shrinkage after you’ve already frayed them. Then, once the project is over, give them another run through the wash cycle to expose more loose threads and distress them just a little bit more. [5] X Research source The heat of the dryer can really help to pull out loose threads and make the shorts look even better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread your shorts out on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Spread your shorts out on a flat surface. You don’t need to iron your shorts, but make sure they lay mostly flat so you can work on them easily. Try to work on a flat surface, like a table or a countertop, so your shorts don’t roll away. [6] X Research source If you want to mark the areas that you’d like to fray, you can do that with a permanent marker—but you don’t have to."

    {
      "title": "Put a piece of cardboard inside your shorts.",
      "content": "Put a piece of cardboard inside your shorts. Find the area that you’d like to start working on, then grab a piece of cardboard and cut it so it fits inside your shorts. Slide the cardboard inside your shorts to protect the other side of the material as you use your razor. [7] X Research source If you have a rotary mat, you can use that instead. As you move to new areas, take the cardboard out and put it back in to protect your shorts the entire time."

    {
      "title": "Use a straight razor to create holes in the shorts.",
      "content": "Use a straight razor to create holes in the shorts. For small holes, take the sharp end of your razor and carefully cut in a straight line. Press down hard enough to make a clean cut, then rub the edges of the hole with your fingers to fray the loose threads. [8] X Research source If you have a box cutter, you can use that instead of a loose razor. The placement of your cuts is up to you! Go near the bottom hem, the pockets, or just below the butt of your shorts for a cute, distressed look."

      "title": "Scrape a disposable razor across the hems and edges.",
      "content": "Scrape a disposable razor across the hems and edges. To fray the edges of your shorts, grab a disposable shaving razor and place it flat down on your shorts. Rub it quickly back and forth to scuff up the material and make some frays. [9] X Research source This is an easy way to distress your shorts all over, too. Your final look will be frayed jeans with holes all over."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread out your shorts and mark the areas where you’d like to cut.",
      "content": "Spread out your shorts and mark the areas where you’d like to cut. If you’re planning on cutting your shorts to make actual holes, use a fabric marker or chalk to draw short lines in all the areas you’d like. Remember to keep the holes near the bottom of the shorts so that they’re still wearable! [10] X Research source Marking your placement will make it much easier to remember where you want to create the holes. Plus, it can avoid disasters like cutting 2 holes too close to each other and creating one mega-hole."

      "title": "Use scissors to make small cuts in your shorts.",
      "content": "Use scissors to make small cuts in your shorts. If you would like to cut open your jeans, grab a pair of scissors and start snipping. You can cut in a straight line or create a square cutout for a larger hole. [11] X Research source If you only want to make your shorts look distressed, you don’t have to cut any actual holes."

    {
      "title": "Rub a piece of sandpaper all over your shorts for a distressed look.",
      "content": "Rub a piece of sandpaper all over your shorts for a distressed look. To make your shorts feel and look softer, grab a piece of sandpaper and rub it firmly all over your shorts. You can stop and take a look at how it’s working every few minutes to decide if you’d like to keep going or move onto a new section. [12] X Research source The coarser your sandpaper is, the more likely it is to create holes in your shorts. If you don’t want that, use a fine grain sandpaper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the sandpaper to fray the holes you cut earlier.",
      "content": "Use the sandpaper to fray the holes you cut earlier. Grab the same piece of sandpaper and rub it firmly over the holes you cut to pop out the loose threads. This does have the potential to make the holes bigger, so be careful! [13] X Research source The coarser the sandpaper is, the more likely it is to widen the existing holes you’ve already made. Again, you can decide when you’re finished here. Your final look will be soft, distressed shorts that look lived-in and worn."

      "title": "Work in small sections to avoid holes that are too big.",
      "content": "Work in small sections to avoid holes that are too big. Cutting holes in your jeans will make them fray over time, and picking the threads out with tweezers or a seam ripper speeds up that process. To avoid fraying your shorts too much, try to work in sections about 1 in (2.5 cm) large. [14] X Research source Unless you’re working on the hem of your shorts, in which case you can go all the way around."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a small cut in your shorts with scissors.",
      "content": "Create a small cut in your shorts with scissors. Since tweezers and seam rippers are mostly for pulling thread, you’ll have to open up your shorts first. Use scissors to make a small cut where you’d like the frayed hole to be. [15] X Research source If you’re fraying the hem of your shorts, cut off the bottom hem to expose the loose threads."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the tweezers or seam rippers to pick out individual threads.",
      "content": "Use the tweezers or seam rippers to pick out individual threads. Grab a pair of tweezers or seam rippers and use them to pick out loose threads as you see them in your shorts. On denim shorts, the threads are usually lighter than the outside of the jeans, so they’ll be easy to grab. On other materials, you might have to pinch and pull in small sections to fray your cuts. [16] X Research source You can pull as many or as few threads as you’d like. When you wash your shorts, the areas will become more frayed on their own. Your final look will be a slightly frayed area with individual threads sticking out. Your shorts will become more frayed the more you wash them."
