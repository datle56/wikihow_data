      "content": "Pat liquid primer or foundation onto the skin above your lip. Squirt a dot of liquid primer or foundation onto a concealer brush and spread it on the skin. Then, take the tip of your finger and gently pat it evenly across the skin so it fills in fine lines. The primer or foundation also plumps the skin so the pores and wrinkles aren't as visible. [3] X Research source Primer does a better job of filling in lines, but a medium-weight foundation will also work. Foundation includes pigments that should even out your skin tone. Ensure that the foundation you choose matches the rest of your skin tone so the area above your lips doesn't stand out."

      "content": "Tap a brush loaded with face powder onto the skin. Take a powder brush and dip it into face powder.

Then, tap the brush over your skin so the powder sets the primer or foundation and keeps it in place. [4] X Research source To help prevent wrinkles, buy loose powder that contains sunscreen. Choose a translucent face powder if you want a light, natural look. For more coverage, choose a powder with pigment that matches your skin tone."
