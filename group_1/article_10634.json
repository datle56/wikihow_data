      "content": "Select the region you want to create a fade for. Click and drag over a section of an audio clip to highlight it. This selects that region. You can select as much of the clip as you need. To create a fade-in, you'll want to highlight the beginning of an audio clip starting on the left side. You can also highlight any blank space in front of the audio clip. You can select a region that already has a clip on it. This will overwrite the fade. Alternatively, you can create a Fade-out by highlighting the end of a clip or you can highlight the beginning and end of two clips that are touching to create a crossfade. A crossfade will decrease the volume of one clip while increasing the volume of the other. This creates a smooth transition between two clips."

      "content": "Select the shade of the fade you want to use. Click the radio option next to \"Standard\" or \"S-Curve.\" The \"Standard\" setting is a general-purpose fade whereas the S-Curve setting allows for a faster fade-in.

Alternatively, you can click the radio option next to the drop-down menu at the bottom and select a line curve from the drop-down menu. A straight diagonal line will create a steady increase in volume. A curved line will create a gradual increase in volume. If you are creating a crossfade between two clips, select \"Equal Power\" if the two clips have a different sound. If the two clips have the same or similar sound (i.g. two microphones on the same sound source), select \"Equal Gain\" instead."
