      "content": "Find a comfortable place to practice. One of the many beauties of yoga is that you can do it just about anywhere! If you want to start an at-home yoga practice, first make sure you have a quiet place to flow with plenty of space to move around. Remove all distractions, like TVs, radios, phones, and other people. This is your relaxation sanctuary. [1] X Research source Test if you have enough room by holding your arms out and spinning around. If you don’t hit anything, you’re good to go! If you hit something, try moving the hit object or switching locations. Practice yoga in your living room or bedroom or try flowing outdoors on a deck or porch. Make sure the temperature of the room is comfortable as well."

      "content": "Devote a set amount of time to flow. Yoga is all about clearing your mind and focusing on you and your body, and you can’t fully commit to the practice if you don’t schedule it into your day. Make room in your schedule to practice— showing up for even the shortest practice can make a big difference.

      "content": "Set a goal for your yoga practice. Before you begin, ask yourself why you want to start doing yoga—what do you want to get out of your practice? Perhaps you want to get stronger, become more flexible, or ease anxiety. This goal will help you find the perfect practice for you. [3] X Research source Keep your goal in mind as you practice, especially if you come across a more challenging pose. If you can’t buckle down on one goal, set multiple! One of the many amazing things about yoga is that it’s an ever-evolving practice you can tailor to you."

      "content": "Choose a yoga style or practice that works best for you. There are many different styles of yoga that stem from various cultures and techniques; however, there are 8 yoga styles most commonly known today. Each style has unique benefits and levels of intensity, so pick the one that sounds the most fun and reflects your goal. [4] X Research source Ashtanga yoga (also known as power yoga) is a fast-paced practice where each pose is held for 5 breaths and finished with a sun salutation. Hatha yoga is a gentle practice that bypasses traditional flows to favor familiar stretches. Bikram yoga is a vigorous sequence of 26 poses that stretch, strengthen, and compress your organs. Vinyasa yoga focuses on a state of flow between each pose, working to gently strengthen and stretch the body and mind. Iyengar yoga uses yoga props like blocks, bolsters, and straps and focuses on proper alignment. Bikram yoga (also known as hot yoga) is designed to make you sweat by stretching and strengthening muscles in a heated room. Restorative yoga is a relaxing practice that focuses on healing the mind and body with poses held for 20 minutes. Yin yoga focuses on deep and passive stretches in the hips, pelvis, and lower spine that are held for 1 to 10 minutes."

      "content": "Practice in a way that’s enjoyable for you. Like any exercise, if you don’t enjoy yoga, you won’t stick to it. Flow with your body, not against it. You’re just starting out, and it’s okay if your pose doesn’t look the same as the instructor’s. Every body is different, so adapt your practice and flow in a way that makes you feel strong and empowered. For instance, if you’re following a video that has a pose that’s uncomfortable in your body, modify it or go back to a previous pose. If you’ve tried one style of yoga and aren’t feeling it, try another to see if a different type of flow is better for you."
