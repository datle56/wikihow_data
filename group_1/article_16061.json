      "content": "Make invented excuses sound as plausible as possible. If your only option seems to be making up a more elaborate excuse—or if you just want to be daring—do so carefully. Many common excuses, like “my dog ate my homework,” are familiar to teachers and they will not believe them. It is difficult to outsmart a teacher who has years of experience working with students and their excuses. Teachers are familiar with many excuses, and can often recognize outlandish ones as untrue.

      "content": "Mutilate your assignment so you teacher can't tell you didn't actually do the work. Turn in the illegible or destroyed assignment, so that you can show your “proof” of your excuse. Crumple and tear a paper assignment. Then you can tell the teacher that it flew out the window and got run over or trampled on. Smear dirt and water on your assignment and claim it fell in a puddle. Make sure to write a few words (bonus points if it relates to the homework assignment) so that it looks believable. Spill something dark (like juice or ink) on the assignment so that it is illegible."

      "content": "Make an excuse based on technological malfunctions. For instance, if you have to save work to a USB drive, you can claim to have a problem with the file. If you are asked to email or otherwise electronically send a homework file, you can “accidentally” send a different assignment, or the “wrong” draft (which could have just your name and the first part of the assignment, for instance). You might even be able to purchase corrupted files. Be aware that your teachers can be tech-savvy and know all of these tricks, so you might have to get creative. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fake it, when possible. For instance, with math work you can write random figures or answers to make it look like you did the work. This might take a lot of time, however, and if your teacher looks closely you might get caught."

      "title": "Avoid excuses that will backfire on you.",
      "content": "Avoid excuses that will backfire on you. For instance, if you tell your teacher that you forgot your homework in your locker, he or she can just ask you to go and get it, and you will be caught."

      "title": "Make it seem like you did the work on time, even if you didn't.",
      "content": "Make it seem like you did the work on time, even if you didn't. If the missed homework is for a class late in the day, you might be able to do the work before school, during another class, or during lunch or a break. You can hand in the wrong assignment—such as one from another class—or an old one from the same class. By the time your teacher notices the mistake, you will be able to complete the real homework, or just turn it in the next day and say you are sorry about the mix-up. Copy answers from a friend so you have something to turn in. Make sure your friend is ok with helping. This also only works for assignments where it is expected that students will have the same or similar answers. In some schools, even copying something like homework can merit a suspension. Remember to evaluate the situation and make a good decision as to whether or not you will copy homework off of a peer."

      "content": "Ask a parent to write an excuse for you. A dangerous move, you can forge a note from a parent explaining why you couldn't do your homework. If you decide to forge one, be warned that your teacher might know it’s a fake. If you are caught, you face punishment from both your parents and teacher."

    {
      "title": "Try being honest.",
      "content": "Try being honest. It’s best to simply tell the truth, and let your teacher know why you weren’t able to complete your homework. A sincere apology can go a long way. You might say something like \"I am really sorry, but I got behind on things and wasn't able to finish my homework. Could I be excused just this once? I'll turn it in tomorrow and I won't be late again.\" Keep things simple and direct, rather than annoying your teacher with long, rambling excuses."

    {
      "title": "Take responsibility for your lack of preparation.",
      "content": "Take responsibility for your lack of preparation. Admit that you did not complete the work, and accept blame rather than putting it off on someone or something else. This means saying something like: \"I know there's no excuse, and I accept full responsibility. I should have done my work. I'm sorry that I'm not prepared, and it won't happen again.\" Doing so will display maturity and your teacher might respect your honesty."

      "title": "Think of legitimate reasons why you could not do the work.",
      "content": "Think of legitimate reasons why you could not do the work. You will need something more than “I forgot” to convince your teacher. Perhaps you are overworked and stressed (this is especially persuasive at exam time). If circumstances beyond your control, like an illness or death in the family, have prevented you from doing your work, say so. You can also explain that you didn’t understand the assignment, or struggled with it, or felt rushed, and needed to give it more time."

    {
      "title": "Remember that your teacher is busy, too.",
      "content": "Remember that your teacher is busy, too. Try to say in advance that you were not able to do your homework. Your teacher is more likely to accept the excuse if you don’t spring it on him or her at the last minute. You might also be able to ask for an extension so that you can turn the homework in later. Know your teacher’s personality, and how flexible and forgiving he or she is. When you talk to your teacher, look sad, serious, agitated, etc. depending on your excuse."
