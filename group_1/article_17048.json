Are there any other students at your school or in your neighborhood that you know are lesbian, gay, bi, or trans? If so, make an effort to befriend them. For example, making friends with someone who is gay could lead you to meet their other friends. This, in turn, could lead you to a potential date that you did not know before."

Be careful and protect yourself by not giving a stranger too much personal information about yourself. Don't meet a stranger without telling someone where you'll be and try to meet them in a public place. If you are uncomfortable telling your parents where you are, at the very least tell a friend."

There are some cases where this may work out, and our crush changes her mind, but in many cases it just ends in heartache. Just be sure if you decide to pursue a straight girl that you understand that it may not end in romance but in hard feelings instead."

Bring up something about LGBTQ folks, perhaps a current news story, and see how she reacts. This won't always tell you exactly where she stands but it could open the window to a more personal conversation about sexual orientation. This may be the end of the road on your quest to date this girl. She may say that she's not interested in dating girls, or she could even say that she finds it gross. Be prepared for this to happen and be willing to walk away from a girl that's not interested. The old saying is very true, there are a lot more fish in the sea."

You will never get a date if you don't put yourself out there. Remember that the worst that will probably happen is that you will get turned down, and that's not really the end of the world. The upside is that you might get a date and eventually a girlfriend! Try this: After you let it slip that you think a famous girl is cute, then you can tell your crush that you think she is cute too. This will probably be flattering if the other girl you mentioned is also beautiful."
