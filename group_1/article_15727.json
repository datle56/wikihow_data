To enable Java content, you'll have to install an old, 32-bit version of Firefox and then manually add the Java plugin. This is possible on Windows computers, but Firefox for Mac defaults to 64-bit, making it impossible to install Java for Firefox on a Mac. [2] X Research source Closing and re-opening Firefox may result in Firefox updating, which will render Java unusable. Using an old version of Firefox increases the risk of contracting a computer virus or running into malware. You can never update your old version of Firefox, as doing so will remove your Java support."
