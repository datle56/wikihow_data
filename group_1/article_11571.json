      "content": "Understand how dating works. In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, you can date a total of 6 women. [1] X Research source Most of the women have prerequisite challenges that you must complete before you can date them. 2 of the women—Denise and Millie—are encountered during story quests, but the other 4 women must actively be sought out."

      "content": "Keep in mind the \"Progress\" meter. Once you're dating a woman, you can increase a \"Progress\" meter by going on successful dates, dancing, driving carefully, and so on. Once the progress meter reaches the 50 percent mark, you'll unlock a perk exclusive to dating the current woman; the 100 percent mark will unlock another perk. The progress meter will decrease if you go on a bad date or if you abandon or harm the woman. It will also decrease if you leave the woman's geographical area, re-enter it, and don't go on a date with her before leaving again."

Taking her to her favorite restaurant, completing various mini-games, and avoiding going over her preferred speed or driving through unacceptable neighborhoods will ensure that you have a good date. Abandoning your date will count against your progress with the woman."

Fat can be lost by not eating and/or by exercising for several days in a row. Muscle can be gained by lifting weights (1% increase per repetition) or running on a treadmill (1% increase per 14 seconds). It can be lost by failing to eat for several days in a row. Sex Appeal is mostly measured by your character's garments and how expensive they are, but muscle percentage, car appearance, and tattoos also help."
