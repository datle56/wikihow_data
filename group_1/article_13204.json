As an alternative to a purpose-built sharps container, designate a small, empty container to use as your “blade bank.” Choose a container that’s made of a non-breakable and puncture-proof material and should also come with a secure lid. Label it clearly as “old razor blades” or “sharps disposal” to alert others to its contents. [9] X Research source Try a glass jar with a screw-on lid or a plastic safety-capped pill bottle. You could also pick up an aluminum can of broth and cut a slit in the top to drain out the liquid. Rinse it out and drop single razor blades through the slit. A heavy-duty plastic piggy bank would also work. Just don’t use a ceramic bank since it could shatter. Avoid using anything made of cardboard or thin plastic, like a drinking cup or water bottle, since the blades will puncture the sides of the container."

Some manufacturers sell new blades in a sturdy plastic container featuring a built-in disposal compartment. Typically the compartment will be located on the bottom of the container, with a thin slit on the side. Simply slide an old blade into the compartment when you go to take out a new one. The old blades aren’t likely to fall out of the container, but you should still use caution when handling it. Store it upright so that neither the new blades nor the old ones can fall out. If the blade packaging contains a disposal compartment, you won’t have to worry about purchasing or making your own disposal container. Only use this method for the blades that came in the packaging; don’t try to insert other types of blades as they may not fit."
