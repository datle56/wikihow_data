      "content": "Fishing The first way players are able to get Enchant Relics is by fishing. There is a 1/350 chance of catching an Enchant Relic in most areas of the game. However, this chance increases to 1/100 when fishing in The Depths, and your chances increase to 1/33 when there is an Aurora Borealis. [1] X Research source Aurora Borealis can appear at random, but the odds are very low. To force an Aurora Borealis to spawn, you can use the Aurora Totem. Aurora Totems can be purchased for 500,000C$ in the Brine Pool. [2] X Research source Rod with higher luck stats will have a better chance of fishing up an Enchant Relic. When you hook a relic, the exclamation point over your head will be a light aqua color, and there will be a bell sound."

      "title": "Treasure chests",
      "content": "Treasure chests There is a 6.3% chance to get an Enchant Relic from a treasure chest. Treasure chests are obtained by fishing up a treasure map and following it to the treasure chest. [3] X Research source There is a 1/160 chance to fish up a treasure map, but your odds are increased if you use the Sunken Rod. [4] X Research source Once you fish up a treasure map, you must get it fixed by Jack Marrow in the Forsaken Shores before you can use it. Each fix costs 250C$. After fixing the treasure map, use the coordinates on the map to find the treasure chest. You can then open it to find your reward."

In FischFright 2024, players could get 3 Enchant Relics if they turned in 4 witch's ingredients to Beatrix. In Fischmas 2024, Enchant Relics were obtainable by opening Unique Presents and Supreme Presents."

      "title": "Enchanting",
      "content": "Enchanting The main use of Enchant Relics is to enchant your rods. There are currently 34 enchantments, and using an Enchant Relic will add one enchantment at random to your currently equipped rod. If you're looking for a specific enchantment, you will likely need to use multiple Enchant Relics to get the one you want. To enchant your rod, go to the Statue of Sovereignty and enter the Sovereignty Mines at night. Pay Cole 400C$ to use the mining elevator to gain access to the Keeper's Altar. Make sure you have the rod you want to enchant equipped. While holding an Enchant Relic, interact with the altar. The relic will be used to add a random enchantment to your rod. All of the enchantments in Fisch are beneficial, but some may not be very useful for certain rods."

      "title": "Obtaining rods",
      "content": "Obtaining rods There are 3 rods that require Enchant Relics to be obtained: the Trident Rod, the Rod of the Depths, and the Rod of the Exalted One. Trident Rod: You must use 5 Enchant Relics to open the door to the Trident's Temple, which is where the Trident Rod can be obtained. Rod of the Depths: You must use an Abyssal Enchant Relic and a Hexed Enchant Relic to open the door to the Depths maze, which is where the Rod of the Depths can be purchased. Rod of the Exalted One: You must place a Hexed, Crystallized, Greedy, Translucent, Atlantean, Fossilized, and Mosaic Enchant Relic on pedestals hidden in Mushgrove Swamp to get the Rod of the Exalted One."

      "content": "What are the best rods to fish up Enchant Relics? There isn't a specific rod that's best for catching Enchant Relics, but any rods with high luck will be beneficial. Some high luck rods include the Fortune Rod, No-Life Rod, Seraphic Rod, Sunken Rod, Rod of the Exalted One, Rod of the Depths, Rod of the Forgotten Fang, and Rod of the Eternal King. Some lower-level rods with higher luck stats include the Lucky Rod and Rapid Rod."

      "content": "What are the best enchantments to get Enchant Relics? If you manage to get a rod with the Scavenger enchantment, it will be a lot easier to catch Enchant Relics. Scavenger makes it 3x more likely that you'll fish up Enchant Relics, Nukes, Treasure Maps, and Threads. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "How do I get mutated Enchant Relics?",
      "content": "How do I get mutated Enchant Relics? Enchant Relics can be mutated the same way fish can. You can increase the odds of getting a mutated Enchant Relic by using a rod that increases mutation chances or by waiting for a server event that increases mutation chances."

      "title": "Does the Relic Rod have a better chance of fishing up Enchant Relics?",
      "content": "Does the Relic Rod have a better chance of fishing up Enchant Relics? No. Despite its name, the Relic Rod is not better at catching Enchant Relics than other rods. The \"relic\" in the name likely refers to the fact that the rod is made of bones and looks old and \"relic\"-like. The Relic Rod is also no longer obtainable in the game. [7] X Research source"
