      "title": "Choose a red hair dye that goes well with your skin's undertone.",
      "content": "Choose a red hair dye that goes well with your skin's undertone. Hair comes in warm and cool undertones, just like skin does. Choose a shade that is opposite of your skin undertone. For example, if you have warm skin with yellow undertones, choose a cool shade of red with purple undertones. If you have cool skin with pink undertones, go for a warm shade of red with copper undertones. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a shade of red that matches your skin tone.",
      "content": "Choose a shade of red that matches your skin tone. Unlike undertone, skin tone refers to how light or dark your skin is. In general, the lighter your skin is, the lighter red you should aim for; the darker your skin is, the darker red you should go for. For example: If you have fair skin, opt for a bright copper or strawberry blond. Avoid wine and burgundy shades, unless you want a pale or gothic look. If you have a medium skin tone, choose a medium shade of red, such as copper or auburn. Avoid purple tints, as they can make your skin appear sallow. If you have dark skin, try a medium shade of auburn or a brownish shade. Avoid cool reds that have too much blue in them, however, as they can make your skin appear greenish. [2] X Research source Instead, go for a warm red that has some orange in it."

      "title": "Match the red to your natural shade if you wish to avoid bleaching.",
      "content": "Match the red to your natural shade if you wish to avoid bleaching. Red hair can range from light to dark, just like brown and blonde hair. For example, if you have medium-brown hair, then look for a medium shade of red. This way, you won't have to bleach your hair. [3] X Research source If you have black or very dark brown hair, you may have to bleach your hair to some extent to achieve the true red color. If you're using a boxed dye, the color will process as long as it's mixed with the developer that is included in the kit. However, if you have black or dark brown hair, the red may not come out as vividly as you’d like."

      "title": "Determine whether you need to bleach your hair.",
      "content": "Determine whether you need to bleach your hair. Depending on how dark your hair is and how light you want the final color to be, you may have to bleach your hair first. In most cases, people with dark brown or black hair will need to bleach their hair in order for the dye to show up. [4] X Research source If your hair is lighter than the color you will be dyeing it, you do not need to bleach it first. If your hair is 1 to 2 shades darker, you can skip the bleaching, but be aware that the color will come out darker than what's on the box. If your hair is 3 or more shades darker, you should bleach it."

      "title": "Bleach your hair",
      "content": "Bleach your hair to the same lightness as your desired red. Red hair comes in light, medium, and dark shades, just like brown and blond hair. You will need to bleach your hair to the closest blond or brown shade. For example, if you have black hair and want to go auburn, you should bleach your hair to a medium-brown shade. [5] X Research source Make sure that your hair is dry and healthy. Apply the bleach to the ends first, not the roots. Use the recommended developing time as a guide. Check your hair every 10 minutes in case it processes faster. Never leave bleach in your hair longer than the recommended time."

      "content": "Do a second bleach session if your hair is not light enough. Wait at least 1 full day before attempting to bleach your hair again. If your hair feels dry, it would be better if you waited until the following week so that it can recover from the harsh bleaching process. Alternatively, you can settle for a darker shade of red instead. It will still look great and your hair won't get as damaged. [6] X Research source Apply a deep conditioning mask between bleaching sections to help your hair recover."

Purchase a bottle of purple or blue toning shampoo from a salon or beauty supply store, then use it according to the instructions on the back. [7] X Research source Just because shampoo looks purple or blue does not mean that it is a toning shampoo. It must say \"toning\" on the bottle. Examples of cool reds include: garnet, mahogany, burgundy, claret, and rosewood blonde. [8] X Research source"

If you choose to use a professional dye, you will need to get a 10 volume developer as well as a pair of plastic dyeing gloves. If you choose to go with boxed dye, you are all set; the box will have everything you need inside. [9] X Research source If you have long, thick hair, a single boxed dye kit may not be enough.

Keep stirring until the color is consistent and no streaks remain. [10] X Research source How much dye you prepare depends on how long and thick your hair is. Make enough to completely saturate your hair. You can prepare boxed dye using the bottle provided, but it would be better to prepare it in a bowl, like professional dye."

Massage the dye into your hair using your gloved fingers. Start from the roots and work your way down to the ends. [12] X Research source If you have thick hair, you may need to divide the section that you are working on into smaller sections first. Try separating the section into smaller sections that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to ensure that your hair is fully saturated in the dye. If you chose to mix the boxed dye in the provided bottle, apply it to your hair straight from the bottle. Work it into your hair with your fingers."

[17] X Research source Most shampoos and conditioners will state on the bottle if they are sulfate-free. If they don't say \"sulfate-free,\" they probably contain sulfates.

If you hair feels wiry or dry, apply a sulfate-free or color-safe deep conditioner to it. Leave the deep conditioner on for the time recommended on the bottle (typically around 5 minutes). Then, use cool water to rinse out the conditioner, as this will seal the cuticle and lock in the moisture."

Tilt your head back, and pour the vinegar-water over your hair. This will help seal the cuticle and make the dye last longer. It will also help make your hair shinier! [18] X Research source Do not get the vinegar-water in your eyes. It will sting. Don't worry about the smell. It will go away once your hair dries.
