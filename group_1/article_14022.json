      "content": "Drinking lemon water may relieve bloating and other digestive issues. Bloating is usually caused by excess intestinal gas, but drinking lemon water first thing in the morning can aid in the digestive process. Citric acid found in lemons increases the production of stomach acids that help break down food and prevent gas formation, reducing problems like bloating, indigestion, and heartburn. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While there isn’t a specific limit to how much lemon water you can drink in a day, 2 glasses is considered safe for most people. [2] X Research source To reap the health benefits of lemon water , squeeze half a lemon into a glass of cold or warm water. Excess intentional gas may occur if you eat too much fiber, swallow air when you eat or drink, have certain medical conditions (like GERD or food intolerance), or if it’s during your menstrual cycle.

      "content": "Prevents and passes kidney stones Lemons contain citrate, which prevents calcium from building up and forming stones in your body. The citric acid in lemon juice can also break down small kidney stones by creating soluble citrate salts, which then bind to the calcium and help the stones pass. [8] X Research source Surprisingly, oranges contain citrate, but they do not prevent kidney stones from forming."

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that protects your skin from free radicals and environmental damage, and it promotes collagen production, which may improve skin elasticity, volume, and hydration. Lemons also contain alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) that can be used to brighten your skin naturally and reduce the look of dark spots or hyperpigmentation. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "May help with weight loss Some people believe drinking lemon water boosts your metabolism and curbs your cravings, indirectly contributing to weight loss. Lemon water isn’t more effective than regular water in terms of losing fat, but it can be a low-calorie alternative for sodas, shakes, or any high-calorie beverage that causes weight gain. [10] X Research source Lemon water may help you eat less because lemons contain pectin—a natural substance that makes you feel fuller for longer. Instead of grabbing your usual orange juice or coffee in the morning, grab a glass of lemon water to keep your stomach satisfied and limit snacking."

      "content": "Eat foods high in fiber. Since bloating is often linked to excess intestinal gas, choose fiber-rich foods that pass through your digestive track easily. Slowly add fiber to your diet so you don’t overwhelm your system, and try to incorporate as much variety as possible. Although fiber may cause more gas at first, it will eventually break down and promote normal bowel movements, helping to relieve bloating, constipation, and excess gas.

      "content": "Reduce your salt intake. Processed foods are high in fat and sodium, which makes you retain water and feel bloated. Instead of snacking and eating out all the time, try to cook for yourself as much as possible (since restaurants tend to add excess salt to their food for flavor). Opt for low-sodium versions of sauces, broths, and other cooking staples, and eat saltier dishes in moderation.

Normal eating behavior and habits like chewing gum, drinking carbonated beverages, and eating very quickly can make you swallow more air than usual, contributing to excess gas and bloating. While some people are more sensitive to gas production than others, pay close attention when you eat so you can identify if there’s a specific behavior or food choice that always leads to bloating. In the meantime, avoid: [13] X Research source Talking while eating Drinking through a straw Consuming alcohol, carbonated beverages, or extremely hot or cold drinks Chewing gum or sucking on hard candies Wearing tight clothes while eating Eating until your stomach hurts Chewing too quickly"
