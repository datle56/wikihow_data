It runs in your web browser and allows you to play torrents (such as movies and music) while downloading. You can download it from https://www.utorrent.com/web/ . When installing, pay close attention to each installation screen. You'll be prompted to install other apps like SpyHunter or WinZip, and it may not be super obvious at first. Remove any checkmarks next to apps uTorrent asks you to install, and/or click Decline when prompted. If you get an error that says \"Operation Did Not Complete Successfully Because the File Contains a Virus\" when installing on Windows, it's because Windows thinks uTorrent is malware. As long as you downloaded the installer straight from uTorrent.com, there's not actually a virus. To install uTorrent anyway, here's how you can allow the installer to run: Press Windows key + i to open Settings. Click Update & Security (Windows 10) or Privacy and security (Windows 11). Click Virus & threat protection . On the warning about uTorrent.exe or utweb_installer.exe, click the button at the bottom and select Allow on device ."

Reddit is a great place to check for peoples' experiences with torrenting websites. Sites like The Pirate Bay , 1337x, and RARBG are all popular sites, but be careful—they all offer pirated (illegal) content for download in addition to legitimate apps, games, and movies."
