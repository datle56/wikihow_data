      "content": "Place yourself at a good vantage point. To estimate distance, you need a clear line of sight. Try to stand in a high place, like atop a hill or a few floors up in a building. If this isn’t possible, try to find a spot where no other objects are in between you and the object you are focusing on."

      "content": "Estimate the horizontal length of the object. Here are some standard lengths that may help you: Most average-sized cars are between 12 and 15 feet long. Mailboxes are usually around 1.5 feet long. Mature tree trunks are typically between 1 and 2 feet wide. The standard length of a trailer pulled by a semi-truck is 50 to 65 feet long."

      "content": "Estimate how far the left edge of your thumb jumped. Did your thumb jump 3 times the length of the object? Half the length? Keep this number in mind. For example: [3] X Research source If your thumb jumped 3 times the length of a building that you believe is 100-feet-long, then it jumped 300 feet. If your thumb jumped half the length of a 14-foot-long car, then it jumped 7 feet."

      "title": "Multiply that number (the jump) by 10.",
      "content": "Multiply that number (the jump) by 10. This will give you the approximate distance you're looking for. For example: [4] X Research source If your thumb jumped 3 times the length of a 100-foot building, or about 300 feet (91 m), then you would multiply 300 by 10 to conclude that the building is about 3,000 feet (914 m) away from you. [5] X Research source If your thumb moved half the length of a 14-foot-long car, or about 7 feet (2 m), then you would multiply 7 by 10 to conclude that the car is about 70 feet (21 m) away from you.
