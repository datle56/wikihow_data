      "content": "Determine what type of drive you need to destroy. The way you go about wiping data from a hard drive may be different depending on the type of drive it is and what its primary purpose is. The following are different types of hard drives: [1] X Research source Primary hard drive: The primary hard drive is the drive that stores your computer's operating system (i.e. Windows, macOS). While you can delete individual files from the primary drive, you generally will need to format your computer to erase the entire hard drive. While most operating systems offer built-in ways to format the computer, this may not be the most secure way to wipe the hard drive. A more secure method will be to use disk sanitization software. Secondary storage device: A secondary storage device is an additional hard drive connected to your computer that stores data, but does not contain your computer's operating system. This can be a second internal hard drive, or an external hard drive, or even a USB drive. You can usually wipe a secondary storage device without reformating your computer or booting from a disk. Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Hard disk drives are mechanical hard drives that use spinning platters to store data. These are typically found in older computers and are much less efficient than modern drives. They are typically pretty easy to erase and physically destroy. Solid State Drive (SSD): Solid state drives are newer drives that use flash memory to store data. Unlike HDDs, they have no moving parts and are typically much faster and more efficient. However, because they use a different algorithm for storing data, some methods for wiping a HDD may not be able to wipe an SSD."

      "title": "Download data sanitization software.",
      "content": "Download data sanitization software. According to Meshesha, when you delete files from a hard drive, they are not necessarily gone forever because the space those files occupy is not actually erased. Instead, the space is marked as available to be overwritten. Unless that space is overwritten by new data, the data can still be recovered using data recovery software. Data sanitization software works by overwriting the data on a hard drive multiple times and replacing it with random data. The following are some examples of data sanitization software: [2] X Research source [3] X Research source BCWipe Total Wipeout : BCWipe Total Wipeout is a disk sanitization program that works with HDDs and SSDs It uses military-grade technology and meets data wiping standards for the Department of Defense and numerous other government agencies. BCWipe Total Wipeout is a paid application, but a free trial is available. ShredOS : ShredOS is an open-source free tool you can use to wipe your hard drive. It works for both HDDs and SSDs, but it may not be as secure with SSDs. It may not be as secure as paid tools, and may not meet regulatory standards for different industries. However, it may be suitable for personal use. BitRaser : BitRaser is another professional-grade disk sanitization tool. It works for all types of hard drives (HDDs and SSDs) and all types of computers (Mac, PC, Chromebook, etc). It charges a flat rate per hard drive you want to wipe ($20 for one, $99 for 10). It is also built to comply with a variety of professional standards. SSD Secure Erase: SSDs come with a secure erase command built-in to the firmware. You can download a tool that will activate this command from the manufacturer's website of your SSD. However, using the secure erase tool may not be as secure as using more powerful data sanitization tools. Manufacturers that have secure erase include: Crucial , Samsung , SanDisk , Seagate , and Western Digital ."

      "content": "Create a bootable flash drive with your sanitization software. Most disk sanitization tools require you to create a bootable flash drive that you can boot from. To do this, you will need a USB flash drive (or perhaps a blank CD-R/DVD-R) to create a bootable disk. The software you download may come with a tool you use to create a bootable flash drive. If so, simply launch the tool and follow the prompts to create a bootable flash drive. In some cases, the disk sanitization software may come with an \".iso\" file. You can create a bootable USB drive from an ISO file using a free tool like Rufus or Balena Etcher ."

      "content": "Boot from the bootable disk drive. After creating a bootable disk drive, shut down your computer. Insert the bootable USB drive into a USB port and boot your computer. Your computer should boot from the USB drive and boot into the disk sanitization software. If your computer is not booting from the USB drive, you may need to enter the BIOS/UFEI menu . From there you can change the boot order so that your computer boots from the USB drive first before the hard drive. Your computer will usually tell you what button to press while booting to enter the BIOS/UFEI menu. It's usually F2, F8, F10, F12, Del, or something similar."

Some give you some options to choose from for added security. For example, it may ask if you want to create a blank drive or fill it with junk data. It may also ask you how many passes you want to erase the disk. Generally, the more passes will take longer, but the more securely your data will be erased. The Department of Defense military standard (DoD 5220.22M(E)) is at least 3 passes."

      "content": "Physically destroy the drive. There are a variety of methods you could use to physically destroy your drive, depending on what type of drive it is and how securely you want to destroy it. The following are some methods you could use to destroy a hard drive: Use a drill: If it's an HDD, drilling several holes through the platters can prevent a computer from reading the hard drive. However, this isn't the most secure method of destroying a hard drive as there are methods of recovering data from a partially destroyed hard drive. However, the average person will not be able to recover data from the drive. Use a hammer: If it is an SSD, you could try using a hammer to smash it. You'll want to make sure you access the inside of the SSD so you can smash all the data chips. Again, this isn't the most effective way of destroying a hard drive as it is possible to recover data from a partially destroyed hard drive. You'll also want to wear eye-protection to protect your eyes from pieces you send flying. Use a degausser: This is another method that works on HDDs, but not newer hard drives, like SSDs. Degaussing is when you use a powerful magnet to disrupt the magnetic field on the hard drive. This completely erases all data on the hard drive. [6] X Research source Use a shredder: One of the most effective ways to destroy an HDD or SSD is to use an industrial shredder. This will shred and pulverize the hard drive into many tiny little pieces. This will make is nearly impossible to recover data from the drive and the remaining pieces can be recycled. Use an incinerator: Another method for destroying a hard drive is to put it in an incinerator. A hot enough incinerator can completely destroy the hard drive. This is probably one of the more dangerous methods to attempt at home as burning eWaste can release harmful chemicals. Take it to a professional: Since most people don't have a degausser, industrial shredder, or incinerator at home, you may want to take it to a professional eWaste or eRecycling center that specializes in data destruction. They can determine the best method to destroy your hard drive in a way that complies with regulations."
