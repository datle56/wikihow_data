      "content": "Try on eyeglasses to find ones that are comfortable and fit your face. Go to an eyeglasses store and try on glasses in person. Make sure the glasses feel comfortable when they sit on your nose and that they complement, rather than overwhelm, your face. You should feel confident when you wear them. If you want to buy eyeglasses online, you will need your prescription. Use a virtual try-on tool to see how the glasses will look on your face before you order them. Some eyeglass companies will offer to send you free samples of their frames so you can find the right one for you."

      "content": "Keep your eyeglasses clean. Spray an eyeglass cleaner on the lenses and wipe them down with a smooth, dry cloth. Clean your glasses once a day, or several times a day, so your vision is not obscured by dust or dirt when you wear them. Keep your glasses in good condition by getting the screws in the arms tightened when needed. Your glasses should always sit flush against the sides of your face, with the arms on the glasses straight and even. Store your eyeglasses in a hard shell case to protect them and keep them in good repair."

Your optometrist may recommend contact lenses if you play a lot of sports or are very active and do not want to have to worry about wearing eyeglasses.

However, they may need the help of a parent to put them in. Irregular astigmatism is more likely to be treated with hard contact lenses, whereas regular astigmatism is more likely to be treated with glasses, soft contact lenses, or laser surgery.

      "content": "Do a focusing exercise. Sit in a comfortable position and focus on a book or text, holding it in 1 hand. You can also look at an eye chart on the wall, if available. Shift your gaze to a different object in your other hand, such as another book or a playing card. Then, shift back to the original text. Do this several times to get your eyes used to focusing between 2 different objects. [6] X Research source Keep your eyes relaxed during this exercise. If your eyes start to get sore, take a break. Do this exercise for 4-5 minutes a day. This exercise can help you to focus and refocus your eyes without them getting tired, which can improve your astigmatism."

      "content": "Try doing an eye exercise with a piece of paper. Take a piece of thick paper that covers both of your eyes. Tape the paper to your forehead, just above your nose. The paper should block your ability to see in front of you, but allow you to still see out of the corners of your eyes. [7] X Research source Raise your hand to 1 side of the paper. Focus on your hand without moving your head. Keep your eyes relaxed as you focus on your hand. Place your hand on the other side of the paper. Try focusing on your hand without turning your head. Repeat this exercise on either side for 1-2 minutes or until your eyes get tired. Do the exercise once a day. This exercise can help to strengthen your peripheral vision, which tends to be poor when you have astigmatism."
