It will help you avoid your hair getting itchy or tangling. [4] X Research source If it is getting too hot for you don't worry, the final cut will actually remove a lot of weight.

      "content": "Bring photos. Don't leave anything to doubt. Bring at least one photo of someone who has the Surfer Hair cut that you are looking for.

      "title": "Confirm the haircut length.",
      "content": "Confirm the haircut length. It can sometimes be difficult for a hair stylist to get length right. Surfer hair is a textured and de-structured look, so the cut will look slightly shorter than it actually is. This is especially true after you use products that add volume and body. Make sure they don't cut your hair too short, and hew closely to the picture you provided. You can always ask them to cut more if it is too long. You can't do the reverse. [7] X Research source"

Even though they've seen a picture, know the cut, and know your preferred length, this detail can help them. If you've already decided what hair products you will be using, you may want to bring this up with them as well. If you want a flowing look, ask them to remove weight as well.

      "content": "Try to make sure they use a razor. Ideally Surfer Hair isn't done with scissors, shears, or a clipper (exceptions exist when clippers are used like a razor). Cutting with a razor gives the hair the movement and separation necessary for a properly deconstructed look. If they use scissors make sure that they soften or feather the edges.
