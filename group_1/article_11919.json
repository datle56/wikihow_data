      "content": "Allow yourself to grieve without judgment. After the death of a loved one it is normal to feel sad, upset, or lost. Don't be angry at yourself for feeling sad, or tell yourself that you should \"man up\" or get over the loss. Grief is a normal, natural human emotion that helps you cope with death, not something to hide or feel ashamed of.

Some people want to cry uncontrollably, while others may fall silent. Some distract themselves with funeral preparations, while others want nothing to do with them. You'll likely hear a lot of advice on \"how to feel,\" but you should know that your grieving process will be your own. Don't let someone tell you how you should feel—acknowledge your feelings and you will find your own ways to deal with them. [4] X Expert Source William Gardner, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 25 July 2019. Tell yourself, It hurts, but i'll be okay. Resist the urge to compare your grieving process to that of others around you. For instance, just because you are not crying as much as someone else does not mean your grief is less valid than theirs. Remember, tears are sadness on the outside. You can still hurt on the inside, even when you aren't showing you're crying."

      "content": "Make time in your life to process your grief. It is natural to want to push your sadness to the side, distracting yourself with other things and ignoring your emotions. But sadness and anger will creep into your life whether you want them to or not, and the longer you ignore these feelings, the longer it will take them to fade away. Immediately after a loss, take some time off to process your feelings and deal with the myriad stresses that come with the death of a loved one. Sitting down and talking with yourself about your feelings will help a lot. [5] X Research source For example, you may need to: Take time off from work. Request time away from school. Clear your schedule to spend time with friends and family."

If family members or friends offer help, don’t turn them away. Let them know what they can do to help make your life a little easier during this difficult time. For example, you might let them know if they can help in some way with chores, cooking, or making funeral arrangements. Sometimes it can also be helpful to just have someone to talk to or spend time with when you’re feeling sad. Feel free to ask for time alone if you cannot deal with crowds. You need to unpack this event on your own time, however it feels right to you."

      "content": "Spend time with friends and family. Grieving is often a group process, where friends and family band together to help get over the pain of losing a loved one. Turning to these relationships reminds you that you are not alone in your pain and can help you express your feelings to people who understand and feel them too. For example, you might: Share stories that you have of your loved one. Let people know how you feel, even if it hurts to talk about. Share a meal, activity, or hobby that your loved one enjoyed. Work together to plan the memorial service."

For example, select a special item of sentimental value to keep close that provides a sense of connection to the one who has passed. [9] X Research source You could also try creating a keepsake box or a scrapbook with photos and other memories of your loved one in it. There is a reason why their death was painful, and it is usually because they were such a wonderful, positive presence in your life. Try not to forget this as you grieve. If you have items that belonged to your loved one and you don't want to keep them, consider having a ceremony for the person. Include their possessions in the ceremony as a way to say goodbye to them. [10] X Expert Source John A. Lundin, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 1 August 2019."

Very young children, like preschoolers, may have a hard time understanding that death is permanent, and may instead view it as a temporary separation.
