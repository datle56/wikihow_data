      "content": "Combat psychological blocking with practice and positive thinking. Psychological blocking is a common issue in gymnastics where a gymnast freezes up and is unable to carry out a skill. There is no specific explanation or solution for this, but overcoming negative thinking is important. Avoid overthinking the problem by giving yourself a fixed amount of time to attempt the move, then moving on to other skills and exercises. Try doing a back walkover at the beginning of your workout to avoid the stress of thinking about it during other exercises. Recognize that psychological blocking is not a personal flaw and avoid self-blame."
