    {
      "title": "Sanitize your brush.",
      "content": "Sanitize your brush. Before you fix your liner, you need a clean brush. Wash an eyeliner brush using your favorite brush cleaner or baby shampoo and hot water, then wring it dry. Then, swirl the bristles of your brush around in a shallow cup of isopropyl alcohol and allow it to dry. [1] X Research source Once dry, the alcohol will not hurt or sting on your skin, and it doesn’t hurt your makeup. Sanitizing the brush helps avoid introducing new germs into your eyeliner when you mix."

    {
      "title": "Add two to four eye drops to your liner.",
      "content": "Add two to four eye drops to your liner. The exact number of drops you need depends on how dry the liner is and the overall size of your gel pot. Start by adding two drops and mixing it in with your liner brush. If it is still dry or chunky, add more eye drops one drop at a time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the liner and eye drops.",
      "content": "Mix the liner and eye drops. Swirl your eyeliner brush around in your gel pot to start mixing in the eye drops. Keep working the drops in, adding more as necessary, until you achieve a thick, gel consistency. The liner will not be smooth. Rather, it will have a thick, lumpy consistency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pat down the liner.",
      "content": "Pat down the liner. Once your liner has the right consistency, use your brush to pat down the top of the eyeliner until it forms a smooth, relatively flat surface. Be sure to scrape down the sides to save as much liner as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean the edges.",
      "content": "Clean the edges. Mixing the liner can get a little messy. Clean the sides and edges of your gel pot with a cotton swab dipped in warm water or makeup remover. Then, screw the lid back on tightly and your liner should be almost as good as new."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick your oil.",
      "content": "Pick your oil. For this method, you need a bit of a mild, non-scented oil. Coconut, jojoba, and baby oil are all good choices, as they are lightweight and do not have a harsh scent that could irritate the eyes. If you choose coconut oil, microwave a teaspoon or so for about 10 seconds. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature, so you will need to heat it just enough so that it melts, but not so much that it is hot to touch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Load your eyeliner brush with oil.",
      "content": "Load your eyeliner brush with oil. Add a few drops of your chosen oil to the palm of your hand. Then, swirl your brush around in the oil. You want your brush bristles to be completely saturated with your oil. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the oil into your liner.",
      "content": "Mix the oil into your liner. Mix your oil-loaded brush into your liner by working the brush over the gel in small circles. If you are having trouble getting the oil into the liner, use a safety pin to crack the gel, and mix your oil in the crack."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal the gel and let it stand for five to ten minutes.",
      "content": "Seal the gel and let it stand for five to ten minutes. Once the oil is evenly distributed over the liner, seal the pot up tightly. Then, let it stand for five to ten minutes. The oil will permeate down into the gel, making it soft and usable all the way through. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Open the gel and apply.",
      "content": "Open the gel and apply. Once your gel is soft, it’s ready to apply. Clean your brush to get the oil off, and paint on your line in any style you like."

    {
      "title": "Put your gel pot in a sealed bag.",
      "content": "Put your gel pot in a sealed bag. Tighten the lid on your liner. Put it in a sealable bag and press as much air out as possible. Then, seal the bag tightly. You want to avoid getting any water in the pot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill a cup with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill a cup with hot water. Find a cup large enough to completely submerge your eyeliner pot and fill it with hot water. The water should be about the same temperature that you use to make tea or coffee, generally at about 150° F (65° C). [4] X Research source The temperature does not need to be precise. A rough estimate should work just fine. You can even use a kettle to help you get the water to about the right place."

    {
      "title": "Submerge the liner in the cup for about 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Submerge the liner in the cup for about 15 minutes. Place the bagged liner in the hot water and make sure it is submerged completely. Let it sit in the water for 15 to 20 minutes before stirring the line with a brush or cotton swab. Pat down the liner to make the surface smooth and allow the liner to cool before applying."

      "title": "Screw the lid on tight.",
      "content": "Screw the lid on tight. Air is the enemy of gel liner. To keep your liner fresh and creamy, seal your lid tightly. Never leave your liner out without a lid."

    {
      "title": "Store it upside down.",
      "content": "Store it upside down. Storing your liner upside down helps keep the moisture and oils in the liner at the top. The bottom may dry out a little, but this helps keep the usable part of your liner fresh."

      "title": "Use plastic wrap between the pot and the lid.",
      "content": "Use plastic wrap between the pot and the lid. Place a small piece of plastic cling wrap in between your liner pot and lid. Then, screw the lid on tight. This helps keep the oils in the eyeliner fresh in between uses."
