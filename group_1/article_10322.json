It's different for men and women: [4] X Research source For women: 655 + (4.3 x Weight in pounds) + (4.2 x Height in inches) - (4.7 x Age in years) For men: 66 + (6.3 x Weight in pounds) + (12.9 x Height in inches) - (5.8 x Age in years) You'll come up with a number.

Take your BMR, multiply it by the appropriate number below, and add that to your BMR to see how many calories you can eat during the day to stay the same weight . This is called your suggested daily calorie intake. For no activity, multiply your BMR by 20% (this means BMR x .20, not 20!) For little or light activity, multiply your BMR by 30% For moderate activity, multiply your BMR by 40% For strong activity, multiply your BMR by 50% For intense activity, multiply your BMR by 60%"

      "content": "Understand how weight loss and weight gain work. Any calories you consume above your suggested daily calorie intake will cause you to gain weight, while consuming fewer calories than your suggested daily calorie intake will cause you to lose weight . A pound is measured by 3,500 calories. So if you consume 3,500 more calories than you burn during a day, you'll gain a pound; if you burn 3,500 more calories than you consume during a day, you'll lose a pound. For example, say that your BMR is 1,790. Let's also say that you're moderately active, meaning you exercise three times a week. 1,790 x .40 = 716. Add 716 to 1,790 to get 2,506. That's what you need to stay under in order to lose weight. Any calories consumed above 2,506 means you're gaining weight."

Life is busy; it’s easy to eat whatever is in the house or to head for the nearest drive-through and order something that sounds good. Instead, resisting the urge to eat junk food, plan what you will eat each day. To keep yourself on track, buy the necessary groceries to get you through a few days or a week. In the beginning, this exercise will be harder because you won't be very good at estimating which foods have which calories. After a few weeks of being strict with yourself, you should be a pro at estimating how caloric certain foods are."

When looking for foods, generally choose: Lean, white protein (chicken breast, fish, tofu) instead of dark, fatty meat Colorful, fresh fruits and vegetables instead of dried fruits and vegetables Whole wheat grains (brown rice, whole grain bread) instead of processed grains (white rice, white bread) Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated and trans fats Omega-3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed, cod liver oil, and salmon Nuts, seeds, and grains instead of sweets and candies"

Best of all, water contains absolutely no calories. That's like stealing calories each time you drink. (Your body spends calories digesting food and water.) If you're serious about losing weight, drink water and stay away from any sweetened drinks like \"energy\" drinks, sodas, or fruit juices. Unsweetened green tea is acceptable to drink.

If you're younger, go with your parents when they go grocery shopping. It'll be a bonding experience, and you'll get to pick out healthy, nutritional foods for yourself, with dietary information that you can understand. Pay attention to serving sizes.

Not only does writing it down help you to stay motivated and on track, it is also helpful to look back and see the calories of certain foods you eat regularly.
