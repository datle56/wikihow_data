      "content": "Stand with your back flush against a wall. Align your heels at shoulder width apart, press your buttocks against the wall, and be sure your shoulder blades are touching the wall (this is more important than the tops of your shoulders touching the wall). [1] X Research source You may need to squeeze your shoulder blades together slightly to get them in a more natural position and align with the wall. This is sometimes called \"opening your chest.\" As you get into position, pay attention to your head position. Notice whether or not the back of your head touches the wall. If it does not touch the wall, you have forward head posture, and it is likely that you suffer from weak neck muscles. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get into correct head posture by touching the back of your head to the wall. Pretend that there is a string going from the base of your neck to the top of your head. Pull that string up from the top creating a longer neck. As the back of your neck gets longer, you chin should tuck in and down somewhat toward the back of your neck. This is correct neck and head posture. Make sure you are not simply moving your head backwards and increasing the curve of the neck. This is also improper posture. Focus on creating length in the back of the neck."

      "content": "Relieve your occipital muscles with a massage ball. The small muscles at the base of your skull right above where your neck meets your head are your occipital muscles. Tightness here is responsible for a lot of pain and tension, and sometimes headaches and dizziness. The best way to relieve these muscles is with ball massage. Use a tennis ball, racquetball, small foam roller, or anything with a similar shape. Lie flat on your back face up and place the ball under your neck right at the base of your skull on either side of your spine. [3] X Research source Turn your head side to side to roll over different areas. Do this for about 5 minutes, and be sure to massage both sides."

      "content": "Regularly stretch the back of your neck. Stand up straight. Tilt your chin to your chest. Interlace your fingers and place them behind your head. [4] X Research source Do NOT pull downward on your head, but allow the weight of your arms to apply gentle downward pressure on your head and stretch the back of your neck. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times or more."

      "title": "Stretch the sides of your neck.",
      "content": "Stretch the sides of your neck. Stand or sit up straight. Keeping your nose facing straight ahead, bring your right ear to your right shoulder. Rest your right hand on the side of your head and allow the weight of your arm to gently pull, stretching the left side of your neck. Again, do not actively pull on your head – just let the weight of your arm apply gentle traction. If your shoulders slump forward, bend your left elbow and place your left arm behind your back with your palm facing outward (when your head is tilting to the right). Do this for 30 seconds on each side, repeating 3 times."

      "title": "Release the SCM muscle at the front of your neck.",
      "content": "Release the SCM muscle at the front of your neck. Your sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle is that strong, thin muscle that stretches from right behind your ear down to about the middle of your throat (it connects to the end of your collarbone close to your midline), creating the little V-shaped divot at the front of your throat. You should be able to feel this strong band of muscle. Find it and gently massage it by pinching and rolling it lightly between your fingers. [5] X Research source Go up and down the length of the muscle. Don’t push too deep into your neck where you might hit other tender places. The massaging motion is like gently pulling or lifting the SCM away from other structures in your neck. It might help you find and relax the muscle by turning your head in the opposite direction, i.e., turn your head to the left with your nose staying straight ahead to feel your right SCM."

Bend your elbow so that it is in a 90° angle, with your forearm flush with the side of the door. Take a small step forward with your right foot. Keep your forearm touching the door. You should feel a stretch in your pectoral muscles at the front of your chest near your armpit. [6] X Research source Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat on the opposite side."

Measure the distance from your monitor to your eyes to ensure it is 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61.0 cm) away from your face. You may need to prop your computer up on some books, use a taller or shorter desk, or adjust the height of your chair. Use a tape measure to determine how far your face is from your computer screen, and adjust where you place your chair accordingly."

      "content": "Avoid carrying heavy bags or purses. Try to keep your shoulder bag or purse to a small size and minimal weight. If you do have a lot to carry, use a backpack rather than something with only one strap, and get a backpack that’s designed for even weight distribution. Avoid carrying bags on the same shoulder all the time, because this will lead to improper alignment. Switch shoulders regularly."

If you work at a desk or work in front of a computer, get up and move around frequently to decrease the pressure on your neck and back. A brief pause to walk around every half hour can be beneficial. Try to take 30 seconds or a minute to do neck stretches every 2 hours. The same goes for sitting on the couch and watching television.

      "content": "Do chin retractions, otherwise known as nose nods. Lie on your back face up, bend your knees, and put your feet flat on the floor so that you do not strain your lower back. Keep your nose perpendicular (pointing straight up) to the ceiling. Nod your head slowly forward without moving your neck. Envision that you are drawing a small arc with the tip of your nose. Keep the movement very slow. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Slowly return your nose to its vertical position. Repeat 10 times. In a few days, increase your repetitions to 20 times. The next week, begin doing 2 to 3 sets of nose nods per day. Once you get used to the motion, you can do them standing up against a wall or standing up away from the wall."

      "content": "Practice shoulder blade squeezes. Sit up straight in a chair. Your neck should be long, and your knees bent at a 90° angle with your feet on the floor. Squeeze your shoulder blades together, as though you are trying to get them to touch. Hold this for 3 seconds, like you’re trying to hold a tennis ball between your shoulder blades. Slowly release your hold back to a relaxed position. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Intentionally drop your shoulders if tension has caused them to creep closer to your ears. Let your arms hang to your sides. Repeat this exercise 10 times, moving in a controlled manner. Increase to holding for 10 seconds and then to doing 2 to 3 sets per day as you get stronger. Chest tightness and weak back muscles are very common in people who spend a lot of time at a desk or in front of a computer. It tends to cause your shoulder to slump forward. This exercise helps to undo that poor posture."

      "title": "Improve your range of motion with advanced chin retractions.",
      "content": "Improve your range of motion with advanced chin retractions. Sit in a chair or stand up straight. Practice your chin retractions/nose nods a few times. Do a chin retraction, letting your nose sweep downward slightly. Once it is retracted, keep your chin at the same distance to your neck, but move the top of your head backward. Stay there for a few seconds and move slowly, returning your head to an upright position. Then, move out of the chin retraction. Do this 10 times, working up to increased repetitions and sets. During this exercise, remember that you are not trying to increase the arc of your neck. You are trying to pivot your head backward in a natural and correct manner. People who have had forward head posture for an extended period of time may find this very difficult to do in the beginning."
