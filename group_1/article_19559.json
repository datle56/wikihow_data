      "content": "Look for patches of grass that appear out of place. Nutgrass generally grows taller and looks lighter than the rest of your grass. Since it is similar to other grass varieties, small patches can be difficult to notice unless you are specifically looking for them."

      "title": "Examine the blades.",
      "content": "Examine the blades. Kneel on the ground and look at the shape and thickness of the grass blades growing in out of place patches. Nutgrass has thick, stiff blades that shoot up from stems in sets of three. Most normal varieties of grass have two blades that shoot up from a single stem. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Examine the stems.",
      "content": "Examine the stems. Break a stem of potential nutgrass off and look at the broken end. Nutgrass has a triangular stem with a solid center, while most normal grasses have rounded stems. Many normal grasses are also more hollow inside than they are solid. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Carefully dig down to the root of the nutgrass. If you suspect that you have nutgrass based on the appearance of the upper half of the plant, you can either proceed to remove the grass immediately or you can dig down to the root to confirm your suspicions before taking further action. Use a garden trowel to cautiously dig beside the patch of grass and look for any nut-shaped nodules at the root. You may need to dig as deep as 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 centimeters).

Pour the sugar through a sifter as you walk, continually turning the handle of the sifter the make sure that the sugar falls on the grass in even amounts. This is no mere folk remedy. Sugar actually \"eats\" the nut grass while nourishing microbes that have a positive effect on your lawn."

      "content": "Spray the lawn once more using a hose. Do not saturate the grass, since doing so will wash the sugar away. Spray the lawn with a light mist, providing just enough water to re-moisten the blades of grass and coax the sugar down into the soil and the roots of the lawn."

      "content": "Use herbicide before the nut grass develops five true leaves. Leafy nut grass has too many obstacles, preventing herbicides from sliding down to the \"nuts\" and the root.

Wait several days after your last watering, and do not spray the herbicide if you may get rain four hours after application or if you expect heavy rains to follow in coming days.
