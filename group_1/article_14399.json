      "content": "Draw a small, rounded upright rectangle. This is the central knot of your cartoon bow. Imagine drawing a rectangle but rounding out the corners—that’s what the knot looks like. Make it taller than it is wide. [1] X Research source Consider how big your bow is going to be before you draw the knot. While it doesn’t have to be the same size as the loops of the bow, it should be about ⅓ or ¼ the height of the bow loops."

      "title": "Draw a round, widening curve to the left of the knot.",
      "content": "Draw a round, widening curve to the left of the knot. Place your drawing utensil (pen, pencil, or marker) about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) to the left of the bow knot at the same height as the center of the knot. Move your utensil to the right, touching the side of the knot and swooping downward. At the bottom of the knot, draw the left bow loop, closing it at the top left corner of the knot. [2] X Research source The first small line you make is a wrinkle in the bow, which forms naturally because of how the ribbon tightens into the knot. Your bow loop should look like a sideways piece of candy corn with a dent at the bottom."

      "title": "Draw another rounded curve to the right of the knot.",
      "content": "Draw another rounded curve to the right of the knot. Place your drawing utensil at the top right corner of the bow knot. Move it upward and outward to create the top of the right bow loop, then pull it downward to draw the side of the bow loop. Finally, bring the line back to the bottom right corner of the bow knot. Draw a bow wrinkle by drawing a small line from the knot toward the edge of the bow, about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). [3] X Research source Try your best to match the loop’s size and shape with the left-side loop you just drew."

Draw a wide, upside-down “V” from right to left. When you finish the V, draw a slanted line upward until you reach the bow loop. Trace along the loop to the knot, then draw a slanted line downward until you connect with the other side of the upside-down “V.” [4] X Research source For a more realistic cartoon bow, make the tail slightly skinnier near the knot and widest at the upside-down “V” end."

Draw a slanted line down toward the right, tracing along the right bow loop for about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Keep drawing the line until it reaches the bottom of the left tail you just drew. Draw an upside-down “V” to end the tail, moving your utensil from right to left. Finish the tail by drawing another slanted line up to the bow knot. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Color in your bow. If you drew it in pencil, trace over it with a black marker to define the edges before coloring it in. Use a marker, crayons, colored pencils, or paint to fill in the bow knot, loops, and tails with color. Get creative—color the loops, ribbons, and tails different colors for a truly unique bow, or add a pattern like stripes or polka dots. Not a fan of black borders in your art? Trace around the bow with a dark color and fill it in with a lighter shade of the same color for a more natural look."

Make the loops by swooping out toward the left to form a skinny balloon shape, then crossing over your starting point and swooping out toward the right to mirror the original shape. [6] X Research source While the bottom edges of the two loops can be relatively straight, the tops should be more curved like the top of a heart. This creates a more rounded, realistic look. If you’re painting instead of drawing, paint the top and bottom of each loop one at a time instead of making an infinity symbol in one motion."

Draw little plus signs (+) in pencil around the bow to mimic small sparkles for an extra coquette aesthetic vibe. Once you get the hang of drawing a coquette bow, cover a whole sheet of paper in colorful bows. Hang it in your room for aesthetic wall art, or slip it into the cover of a binder."

Sketch a curved line upward and toward the right—this is a fold on top of the right bow loop. At the top of the curved line, very faintly sketch another curved line toward the left and down into the midpoint of the first line, creating a closed loop.

From the left edge of the knot, flick your pencil out to create a slightly curved line that extends almost halfway across the center of the loop. Repeat with both right-side bow loops.

To draw the right bow tail, draw a wavy line down from the lower-left side of the bow knot. End it in an upside-down “V”. Draw another curved line back up to the bow knot to close off the tail. Repeat to draw the right-side tail. [15] X Research source Add wrinkle lines like you did with the bow loops. Put one or two going about 1/3 of the way down each ribbon. The tails don’t have to be identical. Try to make the waviness of the lines slightly different so they appear more realistic."

Make a series of close-together lines along the edges of the bow loops, raindrop-shaped loops, the bow knot, and the top and bottom ends of the tails. Shade darkest at the edges and gradually lighten toward the centers of each bow part. [16] X Research source"

Then, make two other loops below the left and right one so you have four total loops. The finished loops resemble a flower made out of folded ribbon. [25] X Research source To make the bow look more realistic, start the lower curved lines over their respective loops from the upper loops, not from the bow knots.

Use a ruler to sketch a cross behind the bow, drawing two vertical parallel lines and two horizontal parallel lines that ‘meet’ where the bow is.
