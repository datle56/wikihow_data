This moist air can help ease and alleviate the buildup of fluid in your ear. Humidifiers are good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is dry due to central heating.

To try it, just set a hair dryer on the lowest heat and hold the mouth of the dryer about 1 ft (0.30 m) from your ear. [4] X Research source The idea is that the warm and dry air will turn the fluid in your ear to steam and help draw it out. Take caution not to burn your ear or the side of your face. If you feel any pain or overly hot, stop using the dryer."

OTC nasal steroid sprays may help to open up the Eustachian tubes and promote ear fluid drainage. These sprays work by reducing inflammation in the nose, which in turn helps to clear out the Eustachian tube. Note that it takes a few days for the steroid to build up to its full effect; this means that you will not experience immediate relief. [6] X Research source"

Be sure to follow any instructions on the label. Avoid using nasal decongestant sprays for more than 3 days. Long-term use has been linked to \"rebound\" swelling of the nasal passages. Children may experience other side effects, such as hyperactivity, restlessness, and insomnia. Consult your doctor before using any nasal decongestant spray or oral decongestants."

However, antihistamines can have serious side effects for the sinuses, including the drying up of the mucous membranes of the nasal tissue and thickening the secretions. Consult your doctor to see if antihistamines may be helpful in your situation. Antihistamines are not recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated sinusitis or ear infections. Other side effects include drowsiness, confusion, blurred vision or, in some children, moodiness and overstimulation."

Since most ear infections clear up on their own, many physician associations support the \"wait-and-see\" approach, which essentially means administering at-home treatment and pain relief but not treating the infection with antibiotics. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Many doctors support this approach because of the limitations and overuse of antibiotics. In addition, antibiotics can't treat an infection caused by a virus. [11] X Research source The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend the \"wait-and-see\" approach for children from 6 months old to 2 years old who experience ear pain in one ear and for children over two years who have pain in one or both ears for less than two days and have a temperature of less than 102.2°F (39°C).

The physician will then examine the ear using an otoscope, a small instrument that looks like a flashlight that allows them to see into the eardrum. [13] X Research source Common symptoms of an ear infection include ear pain, decreased hearing, ear tugging (if the child can't yet verbalize pain), and fever. Some people may experience a feeling of fullness in their ear or a \"popping\" sensation. You may be referred to a specialist in ear, nose and throat (ENT) disorders (otolaryngologist) if the problem is persistent, frequent, or unresponsive to treatment.

      "content": "Take a full course of antibiotics if your doctor prescribes them. If you have a persistent infection, your doctor will likely prescribe a 10-day course of antibiotics, which can treat the infection and potentially shorten symptoms. Antibiotics are often prescribed for individuals who suffer from frequent infections or for those with severe and extremely painful infections. [15] X Research source Commonly prescribed antibiotics include Amoxicillin and Zithromax (the latter if you're allergic to penicillin). A shorter course of antibiotic treatment (5-7 days instead of 10) may be prescribed for children ages 6 and up who have a mild to moderate infection. Even when symptoms improve, make sure to finish the full prescription. A persistent high fever (of over 100°F or 37.8°C) suggests resistance to that particular antibiotic and you may need to ask for a different prescription."

Ear surgery may be an option in cases of prolonged ear fluid or frequent ear infections that don't clear up through antibiotics. The surgery involves draining the fluid from the middle ear and inserting a ventilation tube. Usually, you will need to be referred to an ENT to determine whether this surgery is appropriate. [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In this outpatient surgery, an ENT specialist will surgically place the tympanostomy tube into the eardrum through a small incision. The process helps ventilate the ear, prevents the buildup of more fluid, and allows existing fluid to drain. Some tubes are intended to stay in place for 6 months to 2 years and then fall out on their own. Other tubes are designed to stay in longer and may need to be surgically removed. The eardrum usually closes up again after the tube falls out or is removed."

      "content": "Discuss having an adenoidectomy with your doctor. This surgery is sometimes an option in cases of recurrent or persistent problems with the ears. The Eustachian tube runs from the ear to the back of the throat and is met by the adenoids. When inflamed or swollen (due to a cold or sore throat) the adenoids can press on the entrance of the Eustachian tubes. Moreover, bacteria on the adenoids can sometimes spread up into the tubes, causing infection and blockages. [20] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In this surgery, more common in children whose adenoids are larger and thus more likely to cause problems, an ENT specialist removes the adenoids through the mouth while the patient is under anesthetic. In some hospitals, the adenoidectomy is done as a day surgery, meaning that you can go home the same day. In other cases, surgeons like to keep the patient in hospital overnight for supervision."
