If your built-in webcam has a plastic privacy shutter, make sure it's fully open so the lens is visible. If the lens is obstructed by fuzz or debris, give it a quick wipe-down with a soft cloth. If you're using a USB webcam , double-check to make sure it's plugged in."

If you're not sure which app is using it, close everything that's open. After closing open apps, close and restart the app you're trying to use the camera in (e.g., Chrome, WhatsApp ) and see if it works. In addition to the apps in the taskbar, check the system tray apps (the area of taskbar with the clock and smaller icons). You may have to click a small arrow to see all of the icons. Hover the cursor over an icon to see what it is—if it might be using your camera, right-click the icon and select Quit or Close . You can also try restarting your PC to make sure some background service doesn't still mistakingly have the camera open.
