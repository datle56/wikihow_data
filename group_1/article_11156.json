      "title": "Remove your guitar strings and the screws in the body of the guitar.",
      "content": "Remove your guitar strings and the screws in the body of the guitar. Remove the guitar strings and then unscrew the neck of the guitar from the body with a Phillips-Head screwdriver. Once the body is standing alone, unscrew the screws and knobs on the front of the guitar. Remove the screws on the pickups and bridge of the guitar. [1] X Research source If there is a faceplate over your volume knobs, you'll have to remove the plastic portions of the knobs before you can lift the faceplate off."

      "title": "Remove the electrical components connecting the bridge and pickups.",
      "content": "Remove the electrical components connecting the bridge and pickups. Once all of the screws are out on the face of the guitar, you can lift up your bridge and pickups, which are connected by wires. Snip these and solder them later when you put your guitar back together. If you feel unsure about taking your guitar apart, take it to a guitar store so that they can safely do it for you. [2] X Research source Make sure all the electrical wiring is removed from the guitar before you start painting it."

      "title": "Heat the old paint with a hairdryer or heat gun.",
      "content": "Heat the old paint with a hairdryer or heat gun. Set your heat gun or hairdryer to the lowest setting and move it back and forth, across the body of your guitar. The heat from your hairdryer or heat gun will soften the finish on your guitar and make it easier to lift up the paint. Continue heating the paint for five minutes and then use a putty knife to poke at the paint. If the paint feels soft, you can go onto the next step. [3] X Research source Do not hold the heat gun in one spot for too long or you may burn the wood that's under the paint."

      "title": "Lift off the old paint with a putty knife.",
      "content": "Lift off the old paint with a putty knife. Start by scoring a small location on the softened paint. Use your putty knife to lift off the old finish and don't worry if it cracks off. Continue to scrape the paint and remove the old finish without damaging the wood under it. If the paint isn't coming off, use the heat gun again to soften it. Once you're done removing the finish, you should see the wood grain under it. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sand the body of the guitar.",
      "content": "Sand the body of the guitar. Use a 100 grit sandpaper and sand over the surface of the guitar's body in the direction of the grain. Sand down irregularities so that the body of the guitar is as smooth as possible. Follow the contours of the guitar and sand the sides and edges of the guitar as well. Once you've sanded it with the 100 grit sandpaper, you can move to a 200 grit sandpaper to sand out smaller irregularities. Use a sanding block if the sandpaper is hurting your hands."

      "title": "Fill any holes with an automotive filler.",
      "content": "Fill any holes with an automotive filler. As you sand down your guitar, you're likely to find bumps or divots in the body. Purchase an automotive filler online or an auto shop and follow the instructions to create the sticky substance. Use a plastic scraper to scoop up some of the filler and spread it over the divots in the body of the guitar. Once the divots are filled, let the filler dry for at least 20 minutes. Bondo is a popular type of automotive filler."

      "title": "Sand the automotive filler so it lies flush with the guitar's surface.",
      "content": "Sand the automotive filler so it lies flush with the guitar's surface. Once you've filled in all divots and the guitar is relatively smooth, you'll have to do one last sanding with the 100 grit sandpaper. Continue to sand until the automotive filler lies flush with the body of the guitar."

      "title": "Dust the guitar with a dry rag.",
      "content": "Dust the guitar with a dry rag. Don't saturate the wood grain on your guitar to prevent moisture from getting absorbed into the guitar. Take a microfiber cloth or a clean rag and wipe over the surface, making sure to remove any sawdust or debris that might be on the guitar. Debris or dust left on the guitar will get sealed into the paint job."

    {
      "title": "Choose a wood sealer.",
      "content": "Choose a wood sealer. You can purchase wood sealer online or at a hardware store. Purchase a water based wood sealer that has a high gloss. Use a white sealer if you're painting your guitar a lighter color. If you're painting it a dark color, apply a gray sealer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply wood sealer to the guitar.",
      "content": "Apply wood sealer to the guitar. Saturate a dry rag in the sealer. Once the rag is saturated, drag it along the grain on the surface of your guitar. Make long movements and do not scrub in a concentrated area with the sealer. Once the back of the guitar is sealed, allow it to dry for 10 minutes, then turn the guitar over and finish sealing the front and sides. Once your rag looks dirty, dispose of it and use another, clean rag. Remove the shielding in the electronics bay, Apply the sealer into all pickup and electronics cavities and neck pocket, being careful not to let it puddle in these areas. These areas are often overlooked and allow moisture to enter the wood."

      "title": "Allow the guitar to dry and apply three to five coats of sealer.",
      "content": "Allow the guitar to dry and apply three to five coats of sealer. Let the sealer dry for an hour or two and come back and apply another even coat of sealer. The sealer will help the colored coats of paint adhere to the body of the guitar much easier. Continue adding more coats of sealer until you've covered the guitar three to five times in total. Remember to let the sealer dry for an hour or two in between each new application. Once the guitar is properly sealed, the wood grain will be a much darker color."

      "title": "Sand off the shiny portions of the sealer.",
      "content": "Sand off the shiny portions of the sealer. Using a 200 grit sandpaper, carefully sand over the shiny parts of the sealer. Make sure not to sand too hard or you may expose the wood grain underneath. If you do do this, simply reapply more coats of sealer to the guitar and allow it to dry before moving on. When you're done, the guitar should have a dull white or gray color. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a paint for your guitar.",
      "content": "Choose a paint for your guitar. Typical guitar paint includes polyester, polyurethane, and nitrocellulose. Polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder, more plastic-feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner. If you're unsure of what kind of paint to get, look for spray paint that's made specifically for guitars. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sand the paint using 400-grit wet sandpaper.",
      "content": "Sand the paint using 400-grit wet sandpaper. Once the color coat is dry, run your fingers over the surface, sides, and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth. If the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy, you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper. Saturate the sandpaper in water overnight, then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it's still wet. Wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar."
