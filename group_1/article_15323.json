      "content": "Buy asparagus from a grocery store or farmers market. Fresh asparagus is a luxury vegetable, and its prices tend to reflect this. You can buy fresh, frozen, or canned asparagus. If you're buying fresh, look for bright green or violet-tinged spears. Spears should be straight, firm, and uniformly-sized, with closed (not flowering) tips. Ideally, buy fresh asparagus on the day that you plan to use it. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Asparagus spears range from thick to thin. Some people prefer one kind over another, but size does not generally signal quality or flavor. Thicker spears are more mature, and thinner spears less so. Thicker spears often have tougher, woodier ends, and most people chop these off before cooking. Asparagus goes bad quickly, so it’s important to pick bundles that are refrigerated or on ice. Do not buy asparagus that isn't being kept cool, as it may go bad even more quickly."

      "content": "Store asparagus in a refrigerator or on ice. Use asparagus within two or three days of purchase, and preferably sooner. If you do need to keep it for a day or two, the best way to preserve the spears is to place them upright in a bowl (or even a small vase) of cold water. You can wrap the ends of the spears in a damp paper towel and refrigerate them. You can refrigerate them in a plastic bag for up to three days. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider blanching asparagus before you freeze it.",
      "content": "Consider blanching asparagus before you freeze it . Blanching is an important step in preparing vegetables for freezing. Scalding the vegetables stops the enzymes that break the vegetable down. This may help preserve flavor, crispness, and color. Blanching before freezing also cleans the surface of the vegetable, slows the loss of vitamins, and makes the veggies softer and easier to pack."

      "title": "Steam your asparagus",
      "content": "Steam your asparagus . Cut off the ends of the asparagus if the spears are thick. You can snap it off where the asparagus bends naturally or you can trim off the touch end. Then, using a standard vegetable peeler, peel the bottom portion 2-3 inches to ensure a tender and flavorful asparagus. Wash the asparagus. Fill a large pot with a couple inches of water and place a vegetable steamer into the pot. The water should not seep through the holes in the steamer; if it does, pour some water out of the pot. Put the asparagus in the pot and bring to a boil. Steam until soft or until you reach the texture you want. Consider serving steamed, grilled, or roasted asparagus as the first course at dinner. It is traditionally served with fresh-melted butter or freshly-made Hollandaise sauce. Eat with forks or fingers. Asparagus gets soft and moist when you steam it, and the result can taste bland. Add salt and other seasonings to spice up the flavor. Bear in mind that even though asparagus is very healthy, adding tons of salt and other seasonings may offset the health factor."

      "content": "Grill your asparagus on an outdoor grill. Cut the ends of asparagus if the spears are thick. Wash the asparagus. Make a \"boat\" with aluminum foil for the asparagus to go in; the sides should be high enough to prevent the oil and asparagus from spilling over. Pour 1–2 tablespoon (14.8–29.6 ml). of olive oil into the aluminum foil \"boat\", and lay the asparagus in on top. Place the \"boat\" on an outdoor grill on medium heat until the spears reach the texture you want. Asparagus gets tougher when you grill it, but it still retains all of its moisture. The best part is that when it's cooked, you don't lose any nutrients! This is one of the simplest, tastiest ways to eat asparagus if you don't want to work it into a more complicated recipe."

      "content": "Oven-roast the asparagus . Asparagus develops a rich flavor when roasted, making this one of the most popular ways to eat the vegetable. Wash and trim spears, lightly peel the base of tougher stalks, and pat dry. Place on a baking sheet and mist or drizzle with olive oil, rolling each spear to coat. Sprinkle with salt and fresh-ground pepper, and bake at 425°F (220°C) for 10 to 15 minutes. You can stir your roasted asparagus into a risotto or a creamy pasta dish. You can also serve the roasted asparagus as a side-dish to meat, fish, and pasta. Consider adding a couple of fresh garlic cloves and a dash of freshly-grated lemon zest. Consider roasting with butter, salt, and parmesan or mozzarella. Consider chopping the baked asparagus and sprinkling it on top of oven-baked macaroni. If you are so inclined, you can also chop bacon into bits and sprinkle it in with the asparagus."

      "title": "Blanch the asparagus",
      "content": "Blanch the asparagus . Boil the asparagus spears in a pot of water for 3-5 minutes, depending on their thickness. When the spears are bright green and tender, place them into an \"ice bath\": a large bowl 2/3 filled with cold water and ice cubes. The ice bath will \"shock\" the asparagus to stop the cooking. Soak the asparagus for as long as it took to boil. Drain your spears using a colander or a paper towel. Serve blanched asparagus spears in salads, or eat them on their own with dressing and seasoning. For a simple and tasty dish, add a bit of coarse salt and a drizzle of olive oil to your asparagus before serving it. Blanching is a great way to prepare asparagus for storage if you plan to eat it later. If you are blanching asparagus in advance, or you plan on bringing it to a picnic or potluck, refrigerate the spears in a paper towel-lined plastic bag."
