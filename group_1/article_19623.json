      "content": "Wipe down the walls and ceilings with an ammonia based cleaner. Smoke settles on everything. You may not be able to see the smoke, but it is still there. This \"film\" is often responsible for that smoke smell, long after the smoker has left. In more drastic cases, you may have to repaint the walls and ceilings. The fresh paint will cover up the old paint, which has absorbed the smoke smell. Use a sealing primer first, behind the new paint. It will keep the bad smells in. [7] X Research source If you can't repaint the walls, use a matte, polyurethane sealer instead. It will seal the smell in without changing the color of your walls. [8] X Research source If your walls have wallpaper on them, wipe them down with vinegar first. If the smell lingers, you'll have to remove the old wallpaper, and install a new one."

[11] X Research source You can also use a regular, household glass cleaner instead. [12] X Research source It might be a good idea to get the light bulbs in your room as well, since those heat up as well. You can also just replace the light bulbs with new ones."

      "title": "Try an ozone generator.",
      "content": "Try an ozone generator. Ozone generators produce O3, which oxidizes organic molecules (a common cause of smells). Many people find this an effective way of getting rid of smoke smells. Place the generator inside the room and set the timer. Make sure that all of windows in the room are closed. Vacate the room and close the door behind you. This will allow the ozone to fill the room. After the generator shuts off, wait at least one hour before going back into the room. Ozone generators may irritate the throat. They are not recommended for those with asthma. They can actually make things worse. [15] X Research source Turn on the fan in the air conditioner in the room, if possible. This helps to circulate the air as well as clean out the air conditioner. [16] X Research source The stronger the smell, the longer you will have to set the timer. For example, if the smoker used the room for a few days, you'll need to run the generator for a few hours. If the smoker lived there for several years, you'll need to run the generator for a few days. Ozone generators can only remove the smoke smell to some extent. If the smell has sunk into the walls, floors, curtains, and furniture, you may not get the smell out all the way."
