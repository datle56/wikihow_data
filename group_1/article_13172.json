      "content": "Empty your paint can and remove the lid. If your paint can still has a small amount of paint in it, take off the lid and let the paint dry naturally in a well-ventilated area. The can needs to be empty or completely dried out, as dry paint is more stable and is less likely to contaminate groundwater. Remove the lid so trash or recycling workers can see the can is empty and safe to dispose of. Water-based paint like latex paint dries relatively quickly. Depending on how much paint is left in the can, it can dry in as little as 2-4 hours or several days. If you don’t want to wait, purchase a commercial paint hardener from a store to help dry your paint out. Or, if you have a good amount of leftover paint, mix it with an equal amount of cat litter and stir until the paint thickens. Allow it to sit for at least an hour before disposing of it. Commercial painter Jeff Baldwin says you should never pour leftover paint “down the drain, into landscaping, or anywhere else it can get into the water table.” [1] X Expert Source Jeff Baldwin Residential Painter Expert Interview. 1 March 2021."

      "content": "Recycle the can curbside. In most cases, empty water-based paint cans can be placed in your recycling bin, though some areas may ask that you bring them to a recycling center. Your city’s recycling website should tell you if they accept empty paint cans. If recycling isn’t an option, throw your empty paint can away with the rest of your trash by taking it out on trash days or dropping it at your local waste management center. Remember to remove the lid! [2] X Research source Many cities have paint recycling companies that will reuse your empty latex paint cans, free of charge. Look online to find out if this is an option. Many recycling centers do accept paint cans, grouping them with metals."

      "content": "Bring the paint can to a local Household Hazardous Waste drop-off site. Due to their hazardous nature, different areas may have different rules for how you should get rid of oil-based paint cans. Many areas have Household Hazardous Waste sites where you can bring items that aren’t safe to dispose of in your own home. Research your area’s guidelines, and if they’re deemed hazardous, drop them off at the nearest hazardous waste site. [3] X Research source Some areas might even have a Hazardous Household Waste pickup option, so check online to find out. If you need to dispose of a partially full oil-based paint can, it must be taken to a Hazardous Household Waste site, as well."

      "content": "Throw away the can if your area doesn't consider it a hazardous material. If your oil-based paint can doesn’t need to be taken to a Household Hazardous Waste drop-off site according to your city’s regulations, it’s safe to place it in your regular garbage. Make sure it’s completely empty to prevent any hazards, remove the lid, and take it out on trash day. [4] X Research source If your oil-based paint can isn’t completely empty, consider using up the rest of the paint by brushing it onto newspaper. If you’re not sure whether oil-based paint cans are considered hazardous in your area, it’s better to be cautious and assume that they are hazardous."

      "content": "Ensure the spray paint can is completely empty. In a well-ventilated area, spray the can at a piece of cardboard or other material you don’t mind staining. The can needs to be completely empty for disposal, as any leftover paint could be flammable, so spray until nothing comes out. [5] X Research source Never try to puncture the can to remove the remaining paint, as this could lead to injury. As you’re spraying, try shaking the can to ensure that it truly is empty. If you feel liquid moving around, there’s a chance the nozzle is clogged."

If your can is made of aluminum or steel, check with your local scrapyard to see if they’ll buy it from you. You likely won’t get a lot of money for just one can, so save them up if you use spray paint a lot, or sell other metal scraps while you’re there. [8] X Research source"
