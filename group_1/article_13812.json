      "content": "Put a hair tie on your dominant wrist and gather your hair at your crown. Slide a hair tie on the wrist of your dominant hand. Then, run your fingers through the top, sides, and bottom of your hair and bunch it into a ponytail. Just pull the ponytail towards the crown of your head, which is where the back and top of your head meet. For a low man bun: Gather your hair below your crown or at the nape of your neck. Run a comb through your hair before you style it to ensure there are no tangles. Don’t pull your hair back too tightly, as it can strain your hair and feel uncomfortable. Grow out your hair to at least 6 inches (15 cm) to make a man bun, or between 10 to 16 inches (25-41 cm) for the most ideal length."

Or, pull your hair about ¼ of the way through the hair tie for a smaller bun. For a more relaxed, laid-back look, position the ends of your hair so they rest above your bun."
