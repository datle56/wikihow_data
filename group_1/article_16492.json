For example, if your kitchen tends to be cozier, place your black beans in a bowl of warm water there. When fermenting beans, they need to soak at least 24 hours before cooking. [1] X Research source When fermenting beans, you need to start with dry beans rather than canned beans."

      "content": "Cook the beans slowly with plenty of liquid. After 24 hours have passed, drain the beans using a colander. Then, you can cook them over the stove. Add some water to the beans. There is no precise amount of water to add, but more liquid is generally better. Make sure the beans are at least covered. [2] X Research source To cook your beans, bring them to a boil. Let them boil for 10 minutes before reducing the heat to low. Simmer the beans for 40 minutes to an hour. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add in your chosen culture. A culture helps beans ferment. You should add about a tablespoon of culture (15 mL) per cup of beans (240 mL). Cultures can be purchased online or at a health food store. Any of the following would be a good culture to ferment black beans: [5] X Research source Whey culture Powdered starter culture Kombucha Brine from lacto-fermented vegetables"

      "title": "Break the skins.",
      "content": "Break the skins. After mixing in your culture, gently mash the beans using a spoon. This will break the skins slightly and gently bruise the beans. This allows the culture to to bet past the skins and into the starch of the beans. The culture then converts the starch into probiotics. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Store your beans in jars. Beans need to process for several days to complete the fermenting process. Find a sealed container, such as a jar. Fill the container with your beans and seal the lid tightly. Place the jars in a warm place in your home where they will not be disturbed. [7] X Research source"

Open protruding jars to release the gas and then reseal them. [8] X Research source Check on the beans a couple of times a day to see if any gas has built up."
