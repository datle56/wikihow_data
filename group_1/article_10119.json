      "content": "Be honest about the situation. It might be scary or intimidating, but put all of your thoughts and feelings on the table. If you really like this boy, tell the other person. If he’s hinted or flat out told you that he returns those feelings, tell them. [1] X Expert Source LeTisha Underwood Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 14 December 2021. While it may hurt your friend at first, it will feel worse if they feel like you’ve lied or left them in the dark. [2] X Research source This is especially important if this is a very close friend that you share everything with. If you start a relationship with this guy secretly, they will automatically be distrustful or resentful of it, and you could really hurt their feelings."

      "title": "Put yourself in their shoes.",
      "content": "Put yourself in their shoes. When you have a crush on someone and the feeling is returned, it feels pretty awesome; however, try to imagine or remember what it’s like when those feelings aren’t returned. Recognize that your friend may feel really down in the dumps, and take care not to gloat or shove your happiness in their face. When you are with them, remember that it's okay to talk about your crush, but don't let him be the only thing you talk about. If they are hurt the crush might be a sore topic."

      "title": "Tell them what you plan to do.",
      "content": "Tell them what you plan to do. You need to decide this before going into the conversation. It’s entirely up to you to decide how to proceed in this situation. You can tell them that you really like this guy, you want to date him, but you won’t go forward with it unless you have their blessing. Alternatively, you can tell them that you plan on pursuing a relationship with him, and you’d like their support. Evaluate the consequences (both good and bad) of dating your crush before you decide what to do. Think about how this might impact your relationship with your friend, and if you like this guy enough to risk straining, harming, or even ending your friendship. Is this just a casual crush or someone you can see getting serious with? Think about your friend's personality — do they have a hard time moving on from things? Are they the type who would see this as a betrayal, or be sad for a little while and then bounce back? [3] X Research source Weigh the pros and cons of pursuing this relationship so you can go into the conversation with your friend with eyes wide open. If you tell your friend that you will not date him unless they're comfortable with it, you need to stick to that. Keep in mind that if your friend disapproves of your relationship, it can cause a major strain on it. [4] X Research source At the end of the day, it is your life. If you want to date your crush with or without your friend’s approval, you can; however, you should be prepared for the consequences to your friendship. You can still be caring toward your friend even if you decide to date your crush without their approval. You could say, “I really care about you and our friendship, and I’m excited about possibly dating John. I hope that you can eventually be happy for me. I will not let my dating life get in the way of our friendship.”"

      "title": "Respect your friend’s emotions.",
      "content": "Respect your friend’s emotions. Whether they are angry, upset, or jealous, they are still your friend. You do not have to change your plans based on their emotions, and you do not have to agree with everything they say, but you should be a kind person. Remember, they are probably hurt that their crush has chosen you. Be gentle, honest, and loving while they heal from rejection. This is particularly important if they've been a long-term, loyal friend. Your crush may be really great, but your friend is too. It’s OK (and human!) to want relationships with both, but take care not to neglect your friend for this guy."

      "title": "Tell your crush your feelings.",
      "content": "Tell your crush your feelings. If you’ve told your friend how you feel, you might as well clue him in too. While sometimes a crush consists of flirting and subtle hints, it will make the situation easier on everyone if you know where your crush stands.

      "title": "Keep the situation with your friend private.",
      "content": "Keep the situation with your friend private. In other words, don’t betray your friend by blabbing to your crush about them. They may like him and they may be hurt — but that doesn’t mean he needs to know that. Talk to your crush about your own feelings, and let your friend keep theirs private if they wish. [7] X Research source Your friend will be hurt and embarrassed if they discover you’ve been airing their dirty laundry to a boy they have feelings for. A good rule of thumb is to simply speak for yourself. Talk only about your own feelings and desires, not anyone else’s."

      "title": "Take things slow.",
      "content": "Take things slow. If the feelings are mutual and you want to proceed with a relationship, take your time. Let your friend adjust to the idea of you two being together before you change your Facebook status and start bringing him as a date to everything. A slow and steady start can make for a healthy, solid relationship, too. That doesn’t mean you need to lie to your friend and pretend that things aren’t happening with your crush. It just means letting them cope with the situation at a slower pace. If your crush doesn’t respect or understand your need to take things slowly, he may not be the right guy for you after all."

      "title": "Be discreet with your actions.",
      "content": "Be discreet with your actions. Just because your friend has given their approval, that probably doesn’t mean they want to see you holding hands or kissing all the time. Respect them enough to keep your PDA and pet names to a minimum in their presence. If you want to call your boyfriend Hot Lips and sit on his lap in private, that’s your prerogative. Your friend doesn’t need to see that though. On that note, your friends who never had a crush on him probably don’t want to see that either, so keep the PDA to a minimum. [8] X Research source"

A new relationship can be exciting, and it’s easy to want to spend all your time with your crush; however, you need to show your friend that you value your friendship and aren’t going anywhere.

      "title": "Wait until they've moved on to “gush.”",
      "content": "Wait until they've moved on to “gush.” If your new boyfriend sends you a dozen roses and writes you a sonnet, it’s only natural to want to spill all the details to your friend; however, you should just wait. Until they've solidly moved on, just bite your tongue when it comes to that kind of conversation. It will only seem like you’re rubbing their face in your good fortune, and it could make them resentful. Enjoy your relationship privately, and separate it from your friendship — at least for a while."
