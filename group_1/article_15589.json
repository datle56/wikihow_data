Generally, you won't need to know your EID number unless you're installing a new eSIM . Your serial number can be provided to your manufacturer for support issues, warranty status, and other fixes. Alternatively, your IMEI number can be used to track, clone, block your phone, and more. Do not share your IMEI number with strangers."
