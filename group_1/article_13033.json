      "content": "Understand how Screen Time works. The iOS 12 Screen Time feature allows you to lock down all but a few of your iPhone's apps for a designated period of time, making it impossible to use apps like Facebook and Twitter without using a passcode that you set. This feature is optimal for controlling iPhones belonging to children or shared iPhones in situations where you want to limit a person's app use. If you haven't yet updated your iPhone to iOS 12, you won't be able to use Screen Time. Screen Time can't be used to block all of your iPhone's apps. Some apps, such as Safari, Wallet, and Phone will still be accessible."
