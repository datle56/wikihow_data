If you’re following, start marching with your right foot. If you’re leading, start marching with your left. For every count of the beat, march 1 step. [2] X Research source You don’t need to pick your feet up very high—about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) is all you need to march in place."

      "title": "Bend both knees slightly as you pick your feet up.",
      "content": "Bend both knees slightly as you pick your feet up. To give yourself a little bounce, keep your knees bent as you make each movement. Try not to lock your knees up, or you might look stiff. The merengue is all about fluid, even motion. [3] X Research source Keeping your knees bent will also help you keep your steps going in one fluid motion."

      "title": "Shift your weight to the foot you’re stepping down on.",
      "content": "Shift your weight to the foot you’re stepping down on. For each step that you take, naturally let your hip fall down in time with your feet as you shift your weight. You don't need an excessive hip shaking or gyrating—just that natural hip movement that takes place when you shift weight. [4] X Research source Your hips may move slightly up and down as you sway back and forth. This motion will come naturally to you as you practice the movements more."

      "title": "Listen to merengue music to feel the rhythm.",
      "content": "Listen to merengue music to feel the rhythm. Merengue music is all in 4/4 time, so it’s easy to apply to almost any song. Fernando Villalona, Juan Luis Guerra, Eddy Herrera, and Toño Rosario are all artists with great merengue music you can listen to and practice with. [5] X Research source You can also find merengue mixes on YouTube with hours and hours of songs playing continuously."

      "title": "Face your partner and stand about 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart.",
      "content": "Face your partner and stand about 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. The merengue is a pretty intimate dance, so you’ll want to start out with someone you know pretty well. Start by facing each other and then move in closer so there isn’t much distance between the two of you. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a one-handed turn. While doing the basic steps, grab both of your partner’s hands in your own. If you’re the leading partner, keep one hand clasped and lift the other one in the air, letting your partner turn either inside or outside of their own arm. If you’re the follower, keep one hand on your partner’s and spin underneath your own arm in one direction. [12] X Research source Keep the basic step going the entire time!

If you’re the leading partner, put your free hand on your partner’s hip. [14] X Research source If you'd like, keep that momentum and turn in a slow, 360 degree circle.
