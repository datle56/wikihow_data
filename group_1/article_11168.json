      "content": "Add custom app icons While Shortcuts aren't new to iOS 18, you can still customize your Home Screen with custom app icons using Shortcuts. [2] X Research source There are two downsides to this: it takes a while if you have a lot of apps to edit, and you won't see badge notifications on those apps anymore (like the ones that show you how many unread texts or emails you have). If this isn't an issue for you, however, you can follow these steps to add custom app icons: Download or create custom app icons. There are a ton of custom app icons for free online, or you can download apps from the App Store that have custom icons available. If you make your own app icons, send them to your iPhone before beginning (if they're not already on there). Open the Shortcuts app. If it's not on your Home Screen, you'll have to look for it in the App Library. Tap the + icon in the upper-right corner. Type \"open app\" into the actions search bar, then choose the Open App action. Tap App in \"Open App\" and choose the app you want to open. Tap the down arrow next to \"Open App\" at the top of the screen and tap Add to Home Screen. Tap the bubble under the gray picture icon. Tap Choose Photo or Choose File , depending on where your custom icon is saved. Navigate to the custom icon and select it. Tap Add in the upper-right corner. You can now move the Shortcut around your Home Screen like an app. When you tap on the Shortcut, it will open the app you designated in the Shortcuts app. If the app you created a custom icon for is still on your Home Screen, you can remove it by long-pressing the app, tapping Edit Home Screen , tapping the X in the corner of the app, and choosing Remove from Home Screen ."
