      "content": "Trim away foliage to prepare the plant for new blooms. In the fall, the peony’s leaves will turn brown and wither. Use a pair of garden shears to cut the stems off near the base of the top of the root ball. You don’t need to keep any stems—as long as the root ball has buds or eyes on it, it will regrow.

      "content": "Dig 6–12 in (15–30 cm) from the peonies to avoid damaging the roots. If you dig too close to the plant, you could cut into important roots and damage the plant. Try digging a circle around the plant that’s at least 6 in (15 cm) away from the base to make sure the roots are safe. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a shovel or spade to loosen the root ball from the ground.",
      "content": "Use a shovel or spade to loosen the root ball from the ground. Continue digging a circle around the peonies, loosening up the soil carefully. Loosen the soil until you can grasp the root ball gently and easily lift it from the ground. If you have to pull on the root ball to get it out of the soil, the roots and soil aren’t loose enough yet for it to be safely removed."

      "title": "Remove excess soil from the roots gently.",
      "content": "Remove excess soil from the roots gently. Shake the plant gently to help extra soil fall off easily. You can also use a hose or watering can to spray the plant, washing the soil off of the roots. [4] X Research source Rinsing the plant will help you see the roots and buds so you can replant it correctly."

      "title": "Use a sharp knife to cut the plant into sections with 3-5 buds each.",
      "content": "Use a sharp knife to cut the plant into sections with 3-5 buds each. Separate the plant into sections so that each section will have 3-5 buds, or eyes, as well as a healthy portion of root system. Use the knife to cut the plant into as many sections as is necessary. The buds will look like small white or pink eyes on the root ball. If your peony plant only has 3-5 buds, it doesn’t need to be divided. Use a clean knife to prevent the plant from getting infected."

      "title": "Choose a spot in full sun with well-draining soil to dig the hole.",
      "content": "Choose a spot in full sun with well-draining soil to dig the hole. Peonies need at least 6 hours of sunlight each day, and nutrient-rich soil. Pick a spot in your yard that receives a good amount of light, and start digging the hole at least 10 in (25 cm) deep. To make the soil better for the peonies, you can mix in some compost or other organic matter if desired. Mix 1 part organic matter with 2 parts regular soil for a healthy soil mix. If you’re transplanting more than one peony, space them out at least 3 ft (0.91 m) apart from each other to make sure the roots don’t intertwine."

      "title": "Place the root so that no more than 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil covers the buds.",
      "content": "Place the root so that no more than 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil covers the buds. As you’re setting the root into your fresh soil, look for the pink eyes or buds. These shouldn’t be buried deeper than 2 in (5.1 cm) into the soil, or the plant won’t be able to bloom properly. If you place the root ball in the soil and notice the buds are too deep, take the root ball out and add more soil to the bottom of the hole until the root ball is at the right height. It’s better for the root ball to be placed too high in the ground than too low."

    {
      "title": "Fill the hole in with soil and press it gently.",
      "content": "Fill the hole in with soil and press it gently. Once the root ball is placed in the hole at the right height, fill in the hole with the nutrient-rich soil. Pat down the soil gently so that the roots are covered and the soil is in an even layer on the ground. Use your shovel to fill in the hole, or use your hands to move the soil around the root ball."

      "title": "Water the plant well after it’s been transplanted.",
      "content": "Water the plant well after it’s been transplanted. After your peonies are in their new homes, water the roots thoroughly once. After that, they will be able to thrive on the water that comes from rain showers. If you aren’t getting much rain, water the peonies once a week until the ground freezes in the colder months."

      "title": "Add a layer of mulch in late November to prevent freezing and thawing.",
      "content": "Add a layer of mulch in late November to prevent freezing and thawing. Spread 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) of mulch onto the soil around the peonies to help keep the soil and roots healthy. Remove the mulch in the early spring so that the plant can begin to bloom. [5] X Research source If the soil and roots are constantly freezing and then thawing again, it’s going to damage the plant."
