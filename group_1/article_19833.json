      "title": "Use an egg.",
      "content": "Use an egg. It may sound strange, but an egg can do wonders for your hair. The yolk nourishes your hair by adding moisture so that it doesn't look dull. The white clarifies your hair by helping to remove any buildup. The egg also has protein in it, which strengthens your hair. The result is hair that looks very shiny after just one treatment. Here's how to do it: Beat one egg in a small bowl. Wet your hair. Pour the egg over your head. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb it to the tips of your hair. Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water for maximum shine."

      "content": "Try apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is quickly catching on as an all-natural hair conditioner and gloss booster. It balances your hair's pH level, clarifies your strands and leaves your hair feeling soft. Once your hair dries, it will no longer smell like vinegar. Follow these steps to make an ACV treatment: [1] X Research source Shampoo your hair as usual, but skip the conditioner. Pour a mixture of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) ACV and 1 tablespoon water over your head. Comb it through to your tips. Very long hair may require 2 or 3 tablespoons. Let it sit for five minutes, then rinse your hair with cold water at the end of your shower."

      "content": "Make an avocado mask. Avocado has natural fats that nourish your hair and add shine. Using a ripe avocado will make it easier to spread the mixture into your hair. [2] X Research source Try an avocado mask when your hair is dry and in need of a moisturizing boost. Mash an avocado until smooth. You can also use a blender to process it. Wet your hair. Spread the avocado from your roots to your tips. Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water."

      "title": "Use honey.",
      "content": "Use honey. Honey attracts moisture and has clarifying properties. This combination makes it perfect for adding shine to dull hair. Raw honey is the most nourishing, but any type of honey works fine. To make a honey mask, [3] X Research source Mix 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup warm water. Wet your hair. Comb the mixture into your hair. Let it sit for 15 minutes or more. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water."

      "title": "Deep condition your hair.",
      "content": "Deep condition your hair. If your hair isn't shiny because it's dry, dull and frizzy, a deep conditioning treatment should put things right. You can get a store-bought deep conditioner or make your own using coconut or olive oil. Once a week, follow these steps to deep condition your hair: Wet your hair. Comb 1 to 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of coconut oil or olive oil from your roots to your tips. Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap. Let it sit for up to 30 minutes. Shampoo your hair. You may need to wash it two or three times to remove the oily residue. Rinse with cold water."

    {
      "title": "Apply leave-in conditioner while it's wet.",
      "content": "Apply leave-in conditioner while it's wet. If your hair is on the dry side, it may look a little dull after it dries. Using a good leave-in conditioner can keep it from getting dried out and dull. While your hair is still wet, apply a dime or quarter-sized amount of deep conditioner to your hair. Use a comb to comb it down to your tips."

      "title": "Let it air dry.",
      "content": "Let it air dry. Sure, a Brazilian blowout will leave your hair looking shiny and sleek, at first. After awhile, blowing out and straightening your hair will damage it and leave it looking dull and rough. When you allow your hair to air dry, you don't risk causing damage. After a few weeks or months, you should start to see a noticeable difference in the texture of your hair: it will be softer with more shine. Avoid using heat styling tools as much as possible. Straightening irons, curling irons, and so on provide temporarily pretty results, but in the long run they'll leave you with dull hair. For the best result, twist your hair into a loose bun or braids to keep it from frizzing as it dries. If you have curly hair, gently squeeze and sculpt your hair into the desired shape before drying."

      "title": "Use a finishing oil.",
      "content": "Use a finishing oil. Once your hair has air-dried, smooth finishing oil through your locks. A good finishing oil will add instant shine and protect your hair from damage. Wait until your hair is fully dry for best results. A little goes a long way, so use no more than a dime-sized amount or so, depending on the length of your hair. You can buy a special hair oil, or use one of these oils as a finishing oil: [4] X Research source Olive oil Argan oil Almond oil Jojoba oil Caster oil Coconut oil"

      "title": "Try a shine serum.",
      "content": "Try a shine serum. This is a product that has been formulated specifically to add shine to your hair. Shine serums contain silicones and other ingredients that cause your hair to look instantly shiny. Most shine serums can be used on either wet or dry hair. Using a shine serum every day could end up having the opposite effect of what you're going for. The silicones that make your hair shiny build up in your hair over time, causing it to look dull. You might want to save serum for special occasions only. Look for a serum that's alcohol-free. Alcohol can cause hair to dry out."

      "title": "Keep frizz to a minimum.",
      "content": "Keep frizz to a minimum. Frizz is the enemy of shiny hair. A halo of frizz makes hair look dull and rough instead of shiny. Whether your hair is straight or curly, you can tame your frizz in the following ways: Wash your hair with cool water. The cool temperature helps your hair shaft lie flat, rather than standing up. You'll be amazed at what a difference this easy step makes. Don't towel dry your hair roughly. Pat it dry gently, then let it finish air drying. Towel drying roughly puffs up your hair and makes it frizzy. Switch from a brush to a wide-tooth comb. Brushes tend to break hair, especially when it's curly or wavy. Broken hair strands will stand up and turn into frizz. Use a wide-tooth comb. Detangle when your hair is wet, starting at the tips and working up to the roots. Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase. Curly heads know that this trick does wonders for frizzy hair. Cotton fabric absorbs moisture, leaving your hair dry and frizzy. Satin or silk will preserve your hair in its natural, non-frizzy state. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Style your hair.",
      "content": "Style your hair. Many people think that foregoing heat means not styling the hair altogether, but air-drying requires a bit of effort to come out well. Apply a light hold product and use your fingers to part your hair as desired. Then, comb it into your desired shape. As it dries, secure sections by twisting them, clipping them, or tousling to your satisfaction. When the moisture has evaporated, refine the shape with your fingertips and a dab of hair oil."

    {
      "title": "Shampoo less often.",
      "content": "Shampoo less often. Washing your hair too often strips your hair of sebum, the natural oil that protects it and keeps it healthy. Stripped hair breaks easily and looks dull and dry. To keep your hair glossy, shampoo no more than once or twice a week. It may take up to two weeks or longer for your hair to balance out and get used to being washed less frequently. Be prepared to wear your hair up during the transition time. In between washes, you can perk up your roots by using dry shampoo. This absorbs oil without stripping your hair."

      "title": "Use natural products.",
      "content": "Use natural products. Washing and styling your hair with chemical-laden products can damage your hair over time. Many shampoos, conditioners and styling products have ingredients that might be contributing to the problem. Look for all-natural products that don't contain the following ingredients: Sulfates. These are commonly found in shampoo. They are harsh cleansers that strip your hair of natural oils. Silicones. These are commonly found in conditioner and leave-in shine products. They eventually build up in your hair and make it look dull. Alcohols. These are commonly found in gel, hairspray and other styling products. They dry out your hair over time."

      "title": "Avoid harsh treatments.",
      "content": "Avoid harsh treatments. Dyeing, bleaching, and permanently straightening or curling your hair can have damaging long-term effects. Altering your hair from its natural state will eventually cause it to get dried out and prone to breakage. Avoid harsh treatments whenever possible. Henna dye can be extremely drying as can other natural dyes, such as metallic salts. A demi- or semi-permanent hair color is good low-damage option. Use honey or chamomile tea as a natural lightener."

      "title": "Have a healthy diet and lifestyle.",
      "content": "Have a healthy diet and lifestyle. No matter what you do to your hair, it won't look naturally shiny unless you're healthy from the inside out. Eating well and staying hydrated have a big effect on the way your hair looks. Try eating more of these foods for the healthiest possible hair: Fish, beef, poultry, eggs, legumes, and other foods that are full of protein. Hair is made from protein and it immediately suffers if you aren't getting enough. Eating energy-rich carbs in combination with protein can be especially effective. Avocados and nuts. These contain healthy fats that make your hair look full and shiny. Nutrient-rich plants. Leafy greens like spinach and kale are especially healthy for hair."

      "title": "Drink a lot of water.",
      "content": "Drink a lot of water. When you're dehydrated your hair loses its luster and starts looking limp. Drink plenty of water to keep your hair healthy. Make sure you get 8 glasses a day. Eating water-heavy fruits and vegetables can also help hydrate you. Choose watermelon, berries, apples, cucumbers, lettuce and cabbage. Drink herbal tea and other caffeine-free tea for additional hydration."

      "title": "Protect your hair from outside elements.",
      "content": "Protect your hair from outside elements. The sun, extreme temperatures, and environmental pollutants may be making your hair look less than optimal. Protect it from getting damaged by taking the following measures: Wear a hat when the sun is strong. The sun is a powerful force, and it can damage your hair if you don't protect it. Wear a swim cap in the pool. Chlorine dries hair out and leaves a residue. If you do go swimming without a cap, wash your hair immediately after exiting the pool. Don't go out in the cold with wet hair. Your hair may freeze, which will lead to frizz."

      "title": "Add shine to natural hair.",
      "content": "Add shine to natural hair. Untreated curly, coarse and kinky hair has bends and turns that refract light instead of reflecting it. To add shine to these hair types, try using a rinse, a leave-in conditioner and a finishing serum. These treatments will boost moisture, smooth the cuticle and reflect light. [6] X Research source Try an apple cider vinegar rinse. ACV smooths the cuticle, causing your hair to look more shiny. Add two tablespoons to a cup of water and rinse your hair after shampooing. Add a leave-in conditioner. Aloe, coconut oil, olive oil and jojoba oil can all be used as leave-in conditioners. Smooth one to two tablespoons through your hair while it is still wet from your shower. Let your hair air dry with the conditioner. Finish with a shine serum. Buy a serum formulated with mineral oils to add maximum shine to your hair. You can also finish with Moroccan oil or coconut oil to keep your hair conditioned and shiny."

      "title": "Add shine to color-treated hair.",
      "content": "Add shine to color-treated hair. Hair that has been dyed or bleached tends to get dry and frizzy over time. Instead of just adding shine, aim to repair your hair at the same time. Treating your hair well will also help it retain color. Get a hair gloss treatment instead of dyeing it. A hair gloss treatment goes above and beyond simply changing the color of your hair. It's a translucent coating that conditions your hair and protects it from drying out. As the name suggests, it also makes your hair look shiny. [7] X Research source Wash your hair with cold water. This simple trick will help your color stay in place longer (just as washing clothing with cold water helps retain dye). It will also smooth your cuticle and make your hair look shiny. Avoid harsh hair products. Harsh cleansers, heavy-duty hair spray, and other products containing sulfates and alcohol can strip your hair of moisture, color and shine. Use natural products designed to help your hair retain moisture."

      "title": "Add shine to heat-damaged hair.",
      "content": "Add shine to heat-damaged hair. In the quest for shiny hair, many people blow out and straighten their tresses every single day. Over time this will cause hair to break and become frayed. If you want your hair to look shiny and healthy again, it's time to give the heat a break. Let your hair air dry for several months. Put away your heat styling tools and vow to give your hair a chance to repair itself. Focus on conditioning your hair. Use deep conditioning treatments, hydrating masks, and a boar bristle brush to help restore your hair's health. This will reduce frizz and lead to shinier locks. Use finishing oil or serum when your hair is dry. Using an oil or serum will protect your hair more than a leave-in conditioner. It will also result in a shinier appearance. Try Moroccan oil, coconut oil or jojoba oil. Focus on the tips, which tend to dry out faster than the rest of your hair. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Add shine to thinning hair.",
      "content": "Add shine to thinning hair. When your hair is thinning, it's important to treat it very gently if you want it to look healthy and shiny. Your goal is to add shine and volume without causing further damage to your hair. Let your hair air dry on most days so you don't make thinning worse by damaging your hair with heat styling tools. As your hair dries, use clips around your head to lift the roots of your hair away from your scalp. This will add volume without using a hair dryer. Curl your hair without heat. Use cloth or rag curling methods instead of a curling iron or hot rollers. This way you can gently add volume to your hair without causing damage or hair loss. Finish with a light serum. A heavy leave-in conditioner, gel or mousse will weigh down thinning hair. To add shine and retain volume, use a very light oil or serum. Aloe vera gel is a great option. You can even make your own hair spray using aloe as your base. Keep shine products restricted to your ends with thin hair, as applying them near the scalp can make hair appear thinner."
