[1] X Research source Alternately, you could just rub each mushroom cap with a damp paper towel to remove any grime or dirt.

      "content": "Cut off the stems. The stems of shiitake mushrooms are too tough to eat, so you’ll need to remove them. [3] X Research source Turn the mushroom upside down and use a knife to slice the stem right where it meets the bottom of the cap.

They’ll add a hearty flavor to your favorite stock recipe."

      "content": "Cut the mushroom in half for longer-cooking dishes. For roasts, soups, and stews, the mushrooms will have a longer time to cook and won’t need to be cut into small pieces. Simply slice each mushroom in half across the cap. If the halves are still too large for your taste, cut them one more time into quarters.

      "title": "Slice the mushroom all the way across for sautés.",
      "content": "Slice the mushroom all the way across for sautés. For quick dishes like a stir-fry or a sauté, you’ll want the mushrooms to be cut into smaller pieces. Place the mushroom flat on the cutting board and cut it into even slices all the way across. The slices can be as thin or as thick as you like. If you prefer more mushroom taste in one bite, cut them thickly."
