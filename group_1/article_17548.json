      "title": "Apply wood glue over the entire record as it spins on your turntable.",
      "content": "Apply wood glue over the entire record as it spins on your turntable. Place the tip of your wood glue at the edge of your inner label, and squeeze the bottle with light pressure. As the record spins, continue squeezing out the glue so it creates lines around your record. Stop when you reach the outer edge. You should have thin, even lines over all of your record. [1] X Research source Your record will have stripes of glue following the circular grooves of the vinyl. If you squeeze out too much glue on the vinyl, that's okay. You will even out the amount of glue. However, if you use too much towards the outer edge, use a paper towel to wipe up the excess. If you are worried about getting glue on your turntable, you can apply the glue to the record on a table instead. The spinning of the turntable helps spread the glue across your record."

      "title": "Use a piece of cardboard or cardstock to spread the glue.",
      "content": "Use a piece of cardboard or cardstock to spread the glue. Take a piece of cardboard or cardstock about 2 inches (51 mm) wide, and touch it to the outer edge of your record. Let your record continue to spin, and the glue will spread out and cover the record as it moves. Then, lift up on your card and place it at the inside of your record to spread out all of the glue. [2] X Research source You can leave your hand stationary and let the spin of the record spread the glue for you. You will have a smooth, even surface of wood glue covering the entirety of your record."

      "title": "Stop your turntable and let your the glue dry for around 24 hours.",
      "content": "Stop your turntable and let your the glue dry for around 24 hours. You can leave your record on your turntable overnight. To see if the wood glue is dry, you can gently touch the outer edge of the glue with your finger. If it still feels sticky, let it sit for 1-2 more hours and try again. [3] X Research source You can also leave your record on a piece of newspaper to dry if you do not use a turntable."

      "title": "Peel away the dried wood glue starting at the outer edge of your record.",
      "content": "Peel away the dried wood glue starting at the outer edge of your record. Using your index finger and your thumb, pull up on the outer edge of the wood glue. Then, lift up with steady, consistent force to peel away all of the glue. Remove the glue slowly and gradually to try to pull it up in 1 piece. [4] X Research source If your wood glue does not peel in 1 solid layer, that’s okay! Lift up at another edge and peel away the glue until it is completely removed. Avoid touching the surface of your record as you peel away the glue."

      "content": "Play your record to test the sound. Put the arm of your turntable onto your record and power it on. Listen to your record, and the part of the song that used to skip may play clearly now. Wood glue can help your vinyl by capturing even the toughest dirt and dust. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that using wood glue does not guarantee your record will be fixed. The wood glue provides a thorough clean of the entire record by removing any dirt and debris and smoothing over uneven vinyl surfaces. If your record still skips, try another coat of wood glue or another vinyl cleaning method. You could also search online for a professional vinyl restorer near you."

      "title": "Use a dry vinyl brush to remove surface dirt and dust.",
      "content": "Use a dry vinyl brush to remove surface dirt and dust. Place your record on your turntable and turn it on. While the record spins, lightly hold the brush on the surface of your record to sweep away any impurities and static build-up. Keep your brush on your record for 1-3 spins, then angle your brush at the edge of your record and slowly remove it. [6] X Research source Most record brushes have 2 rows of bristles, 1 to sweep of the dust, and 1 to remove static. Be sure to clean your brush after each use. That way, you do not spread debris to and from your cleaning brush. While this will not erase scratches, it will help your turntable pick up as many grooves in your record as possible, helpful to avoid skipping parts of the song."

      "content": "Purchase a record cleaning kit to use professional cleaning products. Visit a music store or search online to find a kit. Most come with a liquid cleaning solution, directional brush, and smaller brush used to clean the directional brush. Then, follow the specific directions outlined in your kit’s instructions to clean away surface debris. [7] X Research source Your directions will likely have you apply the cleaning solution, then use the brush to sweep away extra dirt."

      "content": "Make your own cleaning solution to deep clean on a budget. Combine ¼ cup of 90-99% isopropyl alcohol, ¾ cup of distilled water, and 1 or 2 drops of dishwasher fluid in a spray bottle. Place your record on a microfiber cloth, and spray the solution on your record. Wait 30 seconds to let the liquid fill the grooves, and wipe away the liquid with another microfiber cloth. Then, soak another microfiber cloth in distilled water, and wipe off both sides of your record. [8] X Research source This will remove fingerprints and grime that a record cleaning brush cannot pick up. Avoid spraying the label of your record. You can repeat the process for both sides of your record to thoroughly clean away dirt and dust."

      "content": "Rub a toothpick back and forth over the scratches with soft pressure. Locate the scratches of your record, and angle 1 wooden toothpick at the scratch. Apply a little pressure, and rub back and forth on the scratch. Do this for any and all scratches on your vinyl. Rubbing the scratch with a toothpick helps get into the small cracks and lift up stubborn debris. [9] X Research source Take your time when cleaning with a toothpick and be careful not to scratch other areas of your record. This may not fix the scratch, but it can help remove any surface debris from your vinyl."

      "content": "Place your record in its inner sleeve after you finish listening to it. Inner sleeves come in either paper or plastic material. When you finish listening to a record, carefully slide your record in between both sides of material as a first line of defense. [10] X Research source Your vinyl will come with an inner sleeve when you purchase it. You can also purchase replacement sleeves online or in music stores."

After you place your record into its inner sleeve, slide it into its outer sleeve. The outer sleeve adds another layer of defense. [11] X Research source If your outer sleeve is worn and you can see the ring of your record, consider purchasing a replacement plastic outer sleeve."
