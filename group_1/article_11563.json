      "content": "Be up front about who you are. Whether you share her beliefs or not, it's crucial to be honest with her and stay true to yourself. Try to get to know each other outside of a spiritual context, and understand how her faith influences her character. You should connect as people, first and foremost. [1] X Research source The more honest you are about your own beliefs, the better. Even if you're not Christian, she will respond to your sincerity, and you may discover that a religious difference isn't a deal-breaker. Approach the subject of your respective beliefs directly by saying \"I understand why you believe what you do, but I have to say that I...\" or \"that's interesting. I feel that...\""

It may be that her beliefs don't permit her to do certain things, like going out for drinks, or that her involvement in the church gives her a chance to take part in certain activities. Ask her about her interests and hobbies and see what the two of you have in common. [2] X Research source Do things that make her feel enriched. If she's a lover of nature, invite her on a hike or picnic; if she's an art aficionado, visit a museum together and have her explain the exhibits to you. Find ways to indulge the passions that complement her faith. Be prepared for her idea of a good time to differ from your own. She may not drink alcohol or find an inappropriate sense of humor funny. Be mindful of the ways that her beliefs guide her relationships and act accordingly."

If not, explore other similarities in your interests and personal beliefs that help you relate to one another. You may be alike in many other ways that count. [3] X Research source You may, for instance, find yourself agreeing on philosophical issues outside of any religious framework. These are compelling values that will allow the two of you to relate. Learn what her stance is on a particular topic or issue. Ask her \"what do you believe about...?\" or \"how do you feel about...?\" and then propose a topic that you want to find out more about. Be careful not to offend, however. Religious and moral issues can be challenging to discuss with someone you don't yet know very well.

A casual setting will make it easier to talk about intimate topics, and give you a trial run to see if you're a good fit for each other. [5] X Research source Just because she's Christian doesn't mean she's not capable of having fun. Get creative. Think of activities you can do together that challenge and exhilarate you.

[6] X Research source Reinforce her willingness to be open with you. When disagreements arise, reassure her with statements like: \"even though we don't believe the same things, I support and care about you, and want to know more about what you think.\" Knowing that you're receptive to her views will make her much more comfortable sharing them with you. Talk to her about your own beliefs as well. It's probably just as important for her to know what your moral values are. This is an element of dating that people downplay or postpone all too often, and it should be given special consideration in a relationship with a religious foundation. Even if you share the same faith, differences in denomination or church liturgy may exist. Get these differences out in the open and do your best to be accepting of them."

Her faith is likely the central priority in her life, the way work or a passion or project might be for someone else. Keep an open mind and see what it's all about. If you're not the religious type, this step may prove difficult. If it makes you uncomfortable to continue accompanying her to church, let her know and explain your reasons to her."

Knowing what is expected when you're together can make communication easier and prevent either person from feeling unfairly judged. [9] X Research source Always be respectful. Religion can be a touchy subject, even between people who are close. Be aware of what is and isn't an acceptable way (as well as time and setting) to discuss your views. If you know a certain line of conversation might cause offense, you're probably better off avoiding it. Tactful communication is vital when it comes to talking about your closely-held convictions."
