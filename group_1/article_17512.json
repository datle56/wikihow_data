      "content": "Scapular retractions Start by standing up tall with your back straight and your arms at your side. Then, flex your muscles to move your shoulder blades closer together, as if you were trying to hold a pencil between them. Hold your position for about 10 seconds before you relax. Do 5 reps about 2–3 times throughout the day to help your rounded shoulders. Scapular retractions help strengthen your back, neck, and shoulder muscles so you’re less likely to slouch forward."

      "content": "Wall slides Rest your back against a wall and place your heels about 1 foot (30 cm) away from it. Keep the palms of your hands on the wall, and tuck your chin back so your neck is straight. Engage your core muscles and slowly slide your back down the wall until you’re in a sitting position. Then, straighten your legs to get back to your starting position. Do 10 reps once or twice a day. [1] X Research source Wall slides make you straighten your back so your shoulders stay in the proper posture. Try raising your arms above your head or bending your elbows at a 90-degree angle to hit different parts of your shoulder muscle."

      "content": "Wall push-ups Face a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart and stretch your arms straight out in front of you so your palms are flat on the surface. Slowly bend your elbows to move your torso closer to the wall. When your elbows make 90-degree angles, push yourself back into your starting position. Complete 2–3 sets that are each 10 reps when you do wall push-ups . Wall push-ups build up your chest muscles so your shoulders aren’t rounded or drooping forward. As wall push-ups get easier, try doing 20 reps per set or standing further out from the wall to increase the difficulty."

      "content": "Floor angels Lay out a yoga mat and lie flat on your stomach with your arms straight out in front of your head. Activate your core to lift your arms, shoulders, and feet off the ground. Keep your head and neck in line with your spine and look straight down at the floor. Then, pull your arms down so your elbows bend to 90-degree angles. At the end of your motion, try to pinch your shoulder blades together. After that, straighten your arms back to your starting position. [2] X Research source Aim to do about 2–3 sets that are each 10 reps. Floor angels work your lats and your traps to help you maintain a better posture. If doing floor angels is too difficult, try doing them against the wall instead. Stand with your back against the wall and your arms straight above your head. Keep the backs of your hands against the wall, and slowly lower your arms until your elbows make a W-shape."

      "content": "Band pull apart Keep your elbows at your side and bent at 90-degree angles so your forearms stretch out in front of you. Hold one end of a resistance band in each hand so your palms are face-down. When you’re ready to start, move your hands away from each other to stretch the band. Keep your elbows at your sides and pull the band as far as you comfortably can. Hold the position for 1 count before relaxing again. Do 3 sets that are each 15 reps. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The resistance band strengthens your chest muscles to help fix any imbalances causing bad posture and rounded shoulders. Use a resistance band that has a lower resistance if you’re just starting off. Otherwise, it might be too difficult to complete all of your reps."

Stand so your left shoulder faces the door frame and you’re holding the other end of the resistance band in your right hand. Keep your elbow against the side of your body, and pull the band further away from the door. Slowly go back to your starting position. Complete 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps for each shoulder. If you can’t secure a resistance band between your door and the frame, then you can tie it to a railing or banister instead. Band rotations help you build your shoulder and chest muscles so you’re less likely to slouch forward."

When you’re ready to stretch, take a step forward to stretch your chest and shoulders. Hold the position for about 20 seconds and then relax for a few seconds. A doorway stretch opens up your chest muscles so you’re less likely to slouch forward. If you want a deeper stretch, then take a bigger step forward. Just be sure to ease up if you start feeling any severe pain or discomfort. If you don’t have an open doorway available, you can do the same stretch in a corner. Just put your arms against the walls and lean into the corner to feel the stretch."

      "title": "Poor posture",
      "content": "Poor posture When you slouch forward while you’re standing or sitting, the muscles in the front of your body tighten up and make your shoulders roll forward. If you’re always bending your neck down, pointing your chin, or slouching your back, then you’re more likely to develop rounded shoulders. You can test your posture by standing with your back against a wall and your feet 6 inches (15 cm) away. If you have correct posture, the back of your head and your shoulder blades will touch the wall."
