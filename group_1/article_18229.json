      "content": "Let the cupcakes cool. If you try to freeze them while they're hot, the cupcakes will give off a steam that turns into condensation and may even cause the paper liners to peel off while they are freezing. The best way to cool cupcakes fully is to leave them on a wire rack for about an hour, until they're cool enough to touch and handle. Wire racks are recommended over a plate or chopping board because the air can circulate more easily around the cupcakes. [1] X Research source This prevents the cupcakes from getting soggy on the bottom while they are cooling."

      "content": "Store the cupcakes in a container. After the cupcakes have cooled thoroughly, consider placing them in an airtight container to freeze. The container should be large enough to hold all the cupcakes you have and tall enough to prevent the cupcakes from squishing into each other. [2] X Research source Ensure the container gives the cupcakes enough room to avoid the tops from getting sticky or touching the lid. The lid should also be able to snap tightly on top of the container."

      "content": "Store the cupcakes in airtight freezer bags. If you don't have a container on hand or would like another method of freezing cupcakes, you can use freezer bags. When placing the cupcakes in the airtight bag, create layers and stack the cupcakes with parchment paper to keep them from sticking to each other."

The best way to cool cupcakes fully is to leave them on a wire rack for about an hour, until they are cool enough to touch and handle. Wire racks are highly more recommended so that the air can circulate more easily around the cupcakes.

      "content": "Frost the cupcakes. In order to freeze frosted cupcakes, they must be frosted correctly. Consider using a frosting pipe to pipe the frosting neatly on top of the cupcakes. Add a good amount of frosting for each cupcake, as once you freeze the cupcakes, you cannot frost them again. There are a variety of frosting flavors to choose from: buttercream frosting , chocolate frosting, strawberry frosting, and cream cheese frosting."

The container should be large enough to carry all the cupcakes you have and tall enough to prevent the cupcakes from squishing into each other. [4] X Research source Place the cupcakes to freeze in an open container so that the frosting can freeze thoroughly, usually taking about 3-4 hours. Ensure the frosting is solid before removing it from the freezer."

      "content": "Store and cover the cupcakes with aluminum foil. Instead of a container, you can also freeze the cupcakes in foil. Freeze the frosted cupcakes without covering them for about 3-4 hours so the frosting can become solid. Cover each cupcake with aluminum foil carefully, taking care not to touch the frosting. Lay each covered cupcake on a cookie sheet or place them in a large Ziploc bag. [5] X Research source"

Too much moisture can cause the paper liners to peel off, so it's important to let out some air for the cupcakes. [7] X Research source"
