The exact amount of water you may need to use depends on the size and age of your toilet—newer toilets should flush with 1 or 2 gallons (3.8 or 7.5 L), but older toilets might need 3 to 5 gallons (11.3 to 18.9 L) of water in order to flush.

If your toilet still isn’t flushing, continue on to the next method or call a professional to diagnose and fix the issue."

The amount of water you need to add varies depending on the model of your toilet. Most toilets will have a mark inside of the tank where the water level should be. If yours doesn’t, the water level should be 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5 cm) below the open overflow pipe inside the tank. [3] X Research source"

After putting the toilet tank lid back on, flush the toilet by pressing the lever on the side or the button on the top of the lid. You can also flush by pouring at least 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water into the toilet bowl. [4] X Research source If your toilet is automatic or uses both electricity and water, adding water to the tank may cause the toilet to overflow.

If you’re still having trouble flushing the toilet, check the lift chain that connects the handle and the flapper. Sometimes the chain can get disconnected, which prevents the toilet from flushing. [7] X Research source If the chain is disconnected, grab the loose end and slide a link onto the hook at the end of the handle arm. [8] X Research source If the lift chain is broken, order a new one for your specific toilet model and hook the new one to the flapper and the handle. When you flush the toilet, the handle arm pulls the flush chain and lifts the flapper, which allows water to flow into the bowl from the tank. Optional: Turn off the water supply by turning the valve behind the toilet clockwise. [9] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. With the water supply turned off, drain the water by pulling up on the rubber flapper at the bottom of the toilet tank. [10] X Research source If lifting the flapper doesn’t drain all of the water from the tank, remove as much as you can with a cup, then absorb the rest with towels."

If you feel any buildup, scrub the rim with a mineral deposit cleaner and nylon scrubbing pad. [11] X Research source Try not to use steel wool or any other abrasive material. Mineral deposits or other buildup could prevent the flapper from sealing. If the flapper isn’t worn, turn the water back on, flush the toilet, and see if cleaning the rim solved your problem."

If the rubber flapper isn’t properly sitting over the top of the opening in the base of the tank, reseat it, and water should start flowing back into the tank. [12] X Research source If the chain came loose, it might have gotten stuck under the flapper and prevented it from sealing properly. If the flapper is worn and won’t sit properly you may need to replace it . If your toilet still won’t flush or flushes weakly after replacing the rubber flapper, you might need to adjust the water level or call a professional plumber."

Find the supply valve behind the toilet and turn it clockwise to shut off the water. After about 10 minutes, some of the water in the bowl should drain and you’ll be able to plunge without worrying about toilet water spilling out.

The plunger’s bell is filled with air, and a hard first plunge might splash toilet water out of the bowl, especially if it’s overfilled. Position the plunger over the drain at the bottom of the toilet and push down gently to release the air from the bell and form a tight seal around the drain. [14] X Research source For best results, use a plunger with a flange extension, or an extra ring of rubber that extends from the bell. Flange plungers make a better seal and are more effective than bell plungers."

The plunger will only work if it’s submerged, so you might need to fill a bucket with hot water and add it to the bowl. [15] X Research source Hot water will also help loosen up the clog, but make sure it’s not boiling—if the water is too hot, it could melt the wax ring at the base of your toilet and create a leak.

Usually, 15 to 20 vigorous thrusts with a flange plunger is enough to clear a toilet clog—listen for a gurgle and watch to see if the water begins to drain. If plunging doesn’t do the trick, get a household plumbing snake at the hardware store, and use it to clear the clog. [19] X Research source To use a snake, insert the hooked end into the toilet drain and turn it clockwise down the drain pipe until you encounter resistance. Keep turning it clockwise to hook the obstruction, then pull the snake out of the drain. Have a trash bin handy so you can easily dispose of any waste you pull out of the drain."

Most toilets have a line inside the tank where the water level should be. If yours doesn’t, the water level should be 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5 cm) below the open plastic overflow pipe inside the tank. [21] X Research source When the tank is full and stops running, the water level should be around the line. If the level is too low, the toilet might not flush or the flush will be weak. If it’s too high, water can spill into the overflow pipe and the toilet will keep running."

If you see one, carefully bend the rod up or down so that the rubber ball is at the same height as the water fill line. [22] X Research source For instance, if the water level is around 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the line, carefully bend the rod up so that the rubber ball is the same height as the line. Lifting the ball should engage the fill valve and cause water to run into the tank."

[25] X Research source After adjusting the float cup, see if the toilet will flush. If it doesn’t, try repairing or replacing the flush and fill valves. While they conserve energy, dual flush toilets may be more complicated than standard toilets. If you’re not sure about attempting repairs on your own, call a plumber."

Before attempting to repair a dual-flush toilet, you’ll need to find the valve behind the toilet and turn off the water supply. After turning off the supply, pressing one of the flush buttons might drain water from the tank. If it doesn’t, use a cup and towels to remove water from the tank. [26] X Research source It’ll be easier to work without water in the tank. The water also needs to be off when you remove the flush and fill valves."

The tube with 2 flush buttons at the top is the flush valve, and the other is the fill valve. Rotate the top of the fill valve counterclockwise, then gently pull up to remove it. [27] X Research source For some models, you may have to unhook a flexible refill tube or arm that connects the flush and fill valves. Once the cap is removed, rinse it in the sink under warm water. Then place your hand over the fill valve (inside the tank), and slowly turn on the toilet water supply. Turn on the supply just enough that water flows through the valve without spraying all over the place. Buildup in the fill valve could be causing the issue. If you see any deposits after flushing the fill cap and valve, scrub them away with a toothbrush designated for cleaning."

Carefully pry the washer out with a flat-head screwdriver, then slide the new washer into place. If you know your toilet’s manufacturer and model, you might be able to order the right washer from them. Otherwise, you may be better off replacing the fill valve ."

You should be able to remove the flush valve by rotating it counterclockwise (usually just a quarter turn) as you lightly apply downward pressure. Lift the valve upward when you hear a click or feel it disengage from the base. [29] X Research source Look under the flush valve and find the silicone seal. The silicone seal does the same job as a standard toilet’s rubber flapper. Ensure it’s seated tightly in the underside of the flush valve, and check it for damage. Replace the flush valve if it’s worn or broken."
