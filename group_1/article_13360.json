      "content": "Start small and work your way up the dumbbell scale as you progress. If you are new to doing curls, or simply looking to maintain existing muscle tone, even 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.36 kg) weights may be sufficient. [2] X Research source Taking on too much weight causes a breakdown in technique and can easily lead to injuries of the elbow, wrist, or muscle tissue. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you are going to do 2-handed curls with a bar, the same principle holds. Start at a lower weight and work your way up slowly. Everyone is different, so start with lighter weights and find the maximum amount that permits you to do your desired number of repetitions (reps) while retaining the proper form."

      "content": "Adjust your regime to suit your goal. Generally speaking, if you are seeking to maintain existing muscle tone and arm strength, it is better to do more reps per set with a lower dumbbell weight. If you are looking to build muscle, do fewer reps at a higher weight (but again, don’t sacrifice technique). [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For muscle maintenance, do 1 to 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps each, for each arm. For strength building, sets of 6 to 8 reps may be preferable. [5] X Research source Let your body be your guide. If you can’t do the number of reps you seek, reduce the dumbbell weight. If necessary, start with 1 set per arm and build up to 3. Reader Poll: We asked 590 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy most for arm workouts, and 72% of them said weightlifting.

      "content": "Isolate your body movement so that only the arm doing the curl is moving. Traditional biceps curls are done while standing, but can also be done easily and properly while seated. Creating a solid base with your body positioning is critical to achieving this goal. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stand with your feet at hip width and your knees slightly bent. Keep your back straight and your abdomen pulled in (but not uncomfortably so). Let your arms rest at your sides and look forward—into a mirror, if possible, to monitor your technique. Sit with your feet firmly on the ground, your back straight and abdomen in, your arms to the side, and your head looking forward. Make sure the chair or bench will not impede your arm motion (or the dumbbell’s) during the curls."

      "content": "Keep it smooth and simple. In spite of the form displayed by the aspiring Mr. Universe you might run into at the gym, a bicep curl shouldn’t be a quick, jerking motion that involves the entire body. It is meant to be a slow, steady, consistent motion that isolates a single muscle group. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can do dumbbell curls with both arms at the same time (or alternating arms), but for simplicity’s sake (especially as a beginner), you should probably start with 1 arm at a time. Or, you can do curls with both arms at the same time by using a bar. If so, you will use the same arm motions as described below for a dumbbell. [8] X Expert Source Monica Morris Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. With the dumbbell securely in your hand, palm facing forward and arm loose to your side, exhale and slowly bend your elbow and contract your biceps to draw the weight upward. While lifting, try to keep every other part of your body still. Keep raising the weight until it is at shoulder height, or even touching your shoulder. Pause for a beat without stopping to let the weight rest on your shoulder. Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Don’t let it just drop back down — control the movement in each direction."

      "title": "Don’t cheat yourself.",
      "content": "Don’t cheat yourself. Sacrificing form to lift bigger dumbbells not only risks injury, it also minimizes the benefits of the curls. “Maxing out” on a curl should mean getting the most out of each one, not hurting yourself by flailing around with a giant dumbbell. Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout the entire curl. It is easy to cause injury by using your wrist as a lever or letting it swing loosely. Use wrist wraps if they help. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t lean forward to start the curl, and/or rock backward during the lift. Your body should not be acting as a pendulum during the curl — this takes the focus away from your biceps, and can cause a loss of balance and possible injury. [10] X Research source Don’t let the weight rest on your shoulder at the top of the motion. If you need a break during a set, you are using too much weight or doing too many reps. Likewise, don’t rest your elbows on your hips or the sides of your abdomen during the motion. You want the full weight of the dumbbells to be isolated on your biceps."

      "title": "Return and repeat.",
      "content": "Return and repeat. When you finish a curl, make sure you extend your arm fully — leaving your elbow slightly bent is another cheat that will reduce the impact of each curl. Once you’ve returned the dumbbell to the proper starting position, pause just long enough to refocus and exhale as you begin the next lift. [11] X Expert Source Monica Morris Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds between sets, if you are doing more than 1. If you're curling 1 arm at a time, keep alternating arms while allowing 1 to rest between its sets. [12] X Research source Again, it is better to reduce the weight, or your reps or sets, than to let your form break down."

      "content": "Try incline dumbbell curls. Use the same arm motions as in a standard dumbbell curl but while lying back on a bench set at a 45-degree angle. Keeping your back against the bench will inhibit your ability to gain power or momentum from anything other than your arm. As with a normal curl, keep your arm close to your body. Flaring your arm outward while lifting up can strain or damage your shoulder."

      "content": "Keep your palm inward for a hammer curl. Instead of starting with your palm facing forward while holding the dumbbell, have it facing inward (toward your upper leg). As you lift, rotate your lower arm and the weight so that you reach the top of the motion in the same position as with a regular curl. Reverse the process on the downward motion. For another variation, start in the standard curl position (palms facing forward), but curl the dumbbell across your chest to the opposite shoulder. Cross it back over while lowering to the starting position."

Lean forward so that you can place your upper arm against your same-side inner thigh (thus the dumbbell in your hand is between your ankles. Place your other hand on the same-side knee for stability. Do the curl as normal, keeping your arm pinned against your inner thigh."

As you lift, rotate your forearm and the weight so that when it reaches your shoulder, your palm is again facing forward (instead of toward your shoulder). Reverse the motion to the standard starting position. Keep your arm close to your side throughout the process."
