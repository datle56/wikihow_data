      "title": "Shut off the power supply to your basement before you start.",
      "content": "Shut off the power supply to your basement before you start. Turn the power off yourself if you can safely reach your breaker box or electrical panel to do so. Call an electrician to come shut off the power supply if you aren’t sure how to do it yourself. [1] X Research source Never turn on any electrical appliances that may have been damaged by the flooding because you might get shocked or cause an electrical fire. Use battery-powered flashlights or floodlights to help you see what you’re doing while you dry out your basement."

      "title": "Wait until the outside water level is lower than the water level in your basement.",
      "content": "Wait until the outside water level is lower than the water level in your basement. This only applies if there are flood waters outside of your home. Try to remove water from your basement at the same rate as any outside flood waters recede. [2] X Research source Use a tape measure or another measuring tool to measure the height of the flood waters inside and outside if you aren’t sure which level is higher. If you pump out the water in your basement too fast before the water level outside your home lowers, the weight of the water outside pressing against your basement’s walls can damage them."

      "content": "Use towels to soak up the water if it is less than 2 in (5.1 cm) deep. Mop up the water with towels and wring them out into buckets, then empty the buckets outside or down a working drain when they’re full. Wash and dry the towels as soon as you're done to prevent mold from growing on them. [3] X Research source Mops and buckets also work to remove small amounts of flood water."

      "content": "Pump out water with a wet vac or a sump pump if it’s deeper than 2 in (5.1 cm). Suck up the water with a wet vac and empty the canister out as it fills up if there are just a few inches of water in your basement. [4] X Expert Source Ryan Owsiany Drywall & Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021. Pump the water out continuously using a sump pump if there is more serious flooding. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If there are just a few inches of water in your basement, a wet vac is probably sufficient to pump it out. Sump pumps are much more heavy-duty than wet vacs and best suited for pumping out more than several inches of standing water. Use a wet vac after using a sump pump to suck up the last few inches of water. Buy or rent a wet vac or sump pump from a home improvement center or a power tool supply company. Use a generator to power your wet vac or sump pump or use a battery-powered or gas-powered variety since the power to your basement is off."

      "content": "Move any water-damaged items to a well-ventilated area to dry them out. Carry things like furniture and other waterlogged possessions to another area of your home or property where they will receive plenty of airflow and stay dry. Let them dry out for 48 hours. [6] X Research source If any of your items are still wet after 48 hours, throw them out and replace them to avoid mold and mildew accumulation. If you have any important documents that got soaked, try putting them in your freezer right away to stop mold and mildew growth until you can deal with them and dry them out properly."

      "title": "Open doors and windows to ventilate your basement.",
      "content": "Open doors and windows to ventilate your basement. Open any exterior doors and windows to allow outside air in and the humid air from the basement out. Keep the doors and windows in your basement open as much as possible for at least 48 hours. [7] X Research source If there are any closets or cabinets in your basement, open the doors to those as well to ventilate them and help dry them out."

      "content": "Set up fans to circulate the air in your basement. Use as many fans as you can get your hands on.

      "content": "Use a dehumidifier to speed up the removal of leftover moisture. Set up a dehumidifier at least 6–8 in (15–20 cm) away from your basement’s walls. Run it constantly for 48 hours to suck out moisture from the walls and floors. [9] X Research source It’s crucial to try and dry your basement out within 48 hours because mold and mildew start to form after 48 hours if there is still excessive moisture in the walls and floors."

      "title": "Run your central air conditioning system constantly if it isn’t flooded.",
      "content": "Run your central air conditioning system constantly if it isn’t flooded. Cool air helps to dry out the air inside your home. Keep the air conditioning running constantly for 48 hours to aid the drying process. [10] X Research source Don’t use your air conditioning if your home’s HVAC system is flooded with water. There is a risk of spreading mold spores throughout your home if the air ducts are contaminated. You might be tempted to turn the heat on to help dry out your basement, but warm air actually holds more humidity than cold air. Stick to using the air conditioning only until your basement is finished drying."

[13] X Research source If you want to reinstall the carpet, dry it out completely before you do so by laying it out in a well-ventilated area and using fans or a dehumidifier to help dry it out. Dispose of any old padding and lay down new padding before you put the carpet back in. Carpet cleaning companies and flood remediation companies often provide carpet drying and flood restoration services if you want to have your carpet professionally dried before reinstallation."
