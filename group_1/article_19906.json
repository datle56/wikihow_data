If your inventory is full, walking over resources will not pick them up. For example, to gather wood, you would walk up to a tree, tap and hold part of its trunk until the block breaks, and then walk over the wood block on the ground. Other harder resources such as rock, coal, and so on will require a pickaxe to obtain. Some tools, such as the shovel or axe, make collecting things like dirt and wood (respectively) quicker."

During the daytime, you're free to roam Minecraft's surface as you please; however, during the night, monsters such as Zombies, Skeletons, and Spiders will try to attack you if they happen upon you. For this reason, it's important to find shelter before nightfall. More advanced monsters include the highly feared Creeper—a green, armless, exploding enemy—and the tall, black Endermen, which will not attack you unless you look at them for a couple of seconds. Things which cause artificial light, such as torches, can keep some monsters at bay. It's wise to pepper your house's interior and exterior with torches."

If you must travel into a cave, bring plenty of torches and be ready to make a hasty retreat. All monsters make specific sounds (e.g., Zombies growl, Skeletons rattle, Spiders and Creepers hiss, and so on), so keep an ear out for unnatural sounds if you're underground."

Tapping an occupied space will replace the item in the equip bar and send the old item to the inventory. You can craft any item which requires a two-by-two crafting interface (or less) from within your inventory. An example of this is wood planks, which only require one crafting square."

While fairly basic, dirt makes for a cheap, easy way to build a temporary shelter wall, and gathering 40 blocks will give you enough dirt to create a spacious 6-by-6 wall that's two blocks high. Having a wall on the first night is crucial for keeping out monsters. You don't need to create a roof on your shelter; in fact, sealing yourself in may eventually cause your character to suffocate."

You can usually find coal in the sides of stone walls (e.g., mountain sides); once you find a coal block, tap and hold it with your wooden pickaxe equipped to mine it. You'll want at least four coal. Mining coal without a pickaxe will result in the block breaking without dropping anything. This is also a good chance to mine cobblestone (the regular grey rock) since you can use cobblestone to craft superior weapons and tools (e.g., a stone pickaxe and sword)."

This means that if you die, you'll respawn at the bed rather than at the world's initial spawn point. Be sure to cover the hole in your shelter's wall before going to sleep. If your bed is destroyed, your spawn point will reset to the world's initial spawn point. You can't go to sleep if there are monsters within a few blocks of you. [1] X Research source"
