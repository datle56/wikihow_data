Donate, sell, and a top tip you could host your own boot sale, with anything that you haven't worn in a year, doesn't fit or isn't your style. If you haven't worn it in a year, you won't miss it. Thinking, \"I could need this one day!\" will leave you thinking you have nothing to wear for most. Clean it out. Someone else could second-love your things. If you have loads of items that don't fit anymore, don't keep them all to be hopeful. Keep a few of your favorites, but pitch the rest. A closet full of clothes that don't fit can be very de-motivating."

The most fashionable items in the world right now won't look good on you if you don't have the right body type for it. It does not mean you're too fat, too thin, too tall, or too short. You just don't have the optimal shape for that cut. Dispose of everything that doesn't fit you right. And you'll know. If your silhouette isn't quite what it could be, odds are you don't wear it. When you go shopping, keep your body type in mind. [2] X Expert Source Candace Hanna Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 12 April 2019. For most women, it's ideal to draw in at the waist and elongate the leg. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask a sales professional; it's their job to help you look good."

      "content": "Take a good look in the mirror. Try to look at yourself as objectively as possible. Pick things about your physical appearance that you like and dislike. What do you want to disguise? What do you want to emphasize? What is your coloring? It's important to figure out the answers to these questions before you go shopping so you know what to buy! If you haven't a clue, shopping for a new wardrobe can be very intimidating."

      "content": "Know your style. What do you like? Do you want to incorporate trendy items into your wardrobe, or do you prefer a classic look? Do you have hipster tendencies? Want to be a professional? Being fashionable does not mean adhering to a specific look. It means finding what you're comfortable in and running with it. Spend time flipping through catalogs or surfing websites that feature and sell clothes. There are tons of different pieces that will look phenomenal on you--it's just a matter of finding them. Find out what other people are wearing. You don't a have to necessarily be a fashion clone to be pretty. Maybe you could see what 'she's' wearing and transform it into your style. Ultimately, clothes that you love and feel good in will be worn more confidently by you. It has less to do with today's fashion and more to do with how you present yourself, though both are intertwined. Keep in mind that style is all about expressing your individuality. Focus on your preferences and only wear things that you really like. [3] X Expert Source Candace Hanna Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 12 April 2019. Don't let current fashion trends dictate what you wear! If you don't like something, you shouldn't wear it. [4] X Expert Source Candace Hanna Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 12 April 2019."

      "content": "Consider context. Where you live, where you go and what you do are major factors in dressing fashionably. If you wear a ballgown to the office, that is not fashionable; if you wear a business suit to the prom, likewise. Think about what kind of clothing is appropriate for the things you're going to be doing. Fashion varies area to area. What's popular on a runway in Milan may not have made it to the streets of Chicago. Whatever fashion you're aiming for, tap into its sources. Finding what you love and what looks good on you is imperative, regardless of where it's from or who originated it."

Don't fill your wardrobe with things that won't be appropriate the same time next year; you'll just regret buying it. Every women needs half a dozen items that are staples in her wardrobe. Find yours. In the context of what flatters your body, find a handful of your favorite, variable pieces. A classic white button-down, a favorite pair of flatteringly-cut jeans, boots, cinched-waist skirt and a sweater, for starters. You can mix and match these items all you want for dozens of different looks. Make a plan and figure out what you need before you start shopping. It can also help to make a physical list of what you need, and decide where you're going to shop ahead of time. [5] X Expert Source Candace Hanna Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 12 April 2019.

A handbag in the same style will be fantastic. After all, the devil's in the details. Accessories and hairstyles are the parts that show your sassy side the easiest. So cut out that celeb 'do from that magazine and head on over to the salon. Might as well get your nails done while you're at it. Note the ol' adage, \"Put on your accessories, then take off one before leaving.\" And it rings true: accessories are great--but a necklace, bracelet, earrings, rings, watch, sunglasses, and hat are a bit much. Pair a couple of accessories with each outfit; don't go overboard."

Bring along someone who can give you well-formulated critiques regarding your clothes. The image we see in the mirror isn't always how we really look! Take everyone's perspective with a grain of salt. Her style is her style, not yours. But if she absolutely adores something on you and you don't see it, take a moment to look. Wait a minute to see if you can find what she sees. Your mind may open up to a brand new style."
