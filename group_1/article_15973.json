Before you decide to risk changing your friendship for a crush, pay attention to whether your friend is really a good fit for you. Sometimes, you might find yourself crushing on someone because you're around them a lot. That's totally normal, but it doesn't always mean you're a good match. Try asking yourself questions like: [1] X Research source Do we share the same values? Is this the type of person I would normally have feelings for? Are they in a good place to start a serious relationship? Do I think they would be a good partner for the right person? Are there any issues that might make the relationship difficult down the road?

      "content": "Accept that your friendship will change in unpredictable ways. Telling your friend that you have a crush on them is guaranteed to impact your relationship somehow. If they return your feelings, you'll likely begin a romantic relationship, and there's no way to know ahead of time how that will turn out. If they don't return your feelings, the relationship could become a little awkward, at least for a while. Be sure you understand and accept that before you decide to bring up your feelings. [2] X Research source If your crush is so strong that it's hard for you to be \"just friends,\" it's probably worth telling the other person how you feel. Those feelings will probably come out eventually anyway. If you're just starting to feel a spark of attraction towards your friend, you might consider waiting a while to see if those feelings develop more or if it's a temporary thing."

      "content": "Don't obsess over every little sign your crush likes you. It can be tempting to try to find clues in everything your crush does, from the way they stand to how often they look in your eyes. However, no two people are alike. Some people are naturally flirtatious, even with their friends, while other people are very reserved, and won't give you many signs even if they like you a lot. It's fine to use the person's behavior to try to get a read on whether they're open to the idea of dating you, but don't spend too much time thinking about it. This doesn't mean you have to ignore obvious signs. For instance, if your friend regularly describes you as being like their sibling, it could be a clue they're not interested. If they're very affectionate or flirtatious around you, but not other people, it could mean they like you. Consider asking your mutual friends what your crush thinks of you. They might be able to help you decide whether you should tell your crush you like them."

      "content": "Sit back for a while if you're on the fence. Don't be in too much of a rush to change your friendship. While you don't want to drag your feet forever, it's also a bad idea to charge ahead if you're not sure the timing is right or if you're still working out exactly how you feel. Focus on your friendship—if those feelings are real, they probably won't go away just because you spent a little extra time reflecting. [3] X Research source If your feelings are really strong but you're still not sure about telling your crush, consider spending a little less time around them for a while. That can help you clarify your feelings, and if your friend has a chance to miss you, it might make them realize they have romantic feelings for you. If your friend is in a relationship or there are other reasons you don't think you could be together right now, consider dating other people for a while. However, don’t pretend to like someone else just to make your friend jealous. Don't try to bury your feelings for too long—that can lead to built-up frustration or even resentment, and it will be tempting to only see the best in your crush instead of seeing them as a whole person. Just take your time figuring out how you feel before you move forward, since the stakes are higher with an existing friendship. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Be honest with yourself about the kind of relationship you want. Ask yourself whether you're really looking for a long-term relationship, or if you're just more interested in having a good time with someone for a while. If you're not really sure you're ready to settle down, your friend might not be the best person to turn to for company. A quick fling can be fun, but you could lose a lifelong friend in return. [5] X Research source Similarly, if you think you're ready to settle down but you know your friend isn't ready to think long-term, it might not be the best timing to move things to the next level. Hooking up does not necessarily mean leaving the friend zone. If anything, it could just make things more confusing for both of you."

Relationships are choices, not transactions where a certain amount of favors entitles you to a specific return. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source They come from feelings and decisions. Don't bend over backwards for your friend and then get mad when you don't get a kiss. Your friend doesn't owe you anything. If they say no, the only polite thing to do is accept it and move on. Don't assume that your dating history defines your worth. Don't depend on other people for validation. [8] X Research source Your primary self-worth should come from within—and if it doesn't, you aren't ready for romance. Self-care comes before people-pleasing. Don't drop everything every single time your crush has the slightest problem. Pause and check in with yourself. If helping them would cause big problems for you (e.g. not studying for an important test because you spent the whole day with them), don't jump in anyway. [9] X Research source See if there's something reasonable you can do for them without sacrificing your own needs."

It doesn't necessarily have to be a formal date, at first, but spending time alone together can help build your relationship. In addition, the more time you spend one-on-one, the more of your true feelings you’ll be able to show them. [10] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Matchmaker & Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. For instance, you might invite your friend to do things you know they enjoy, like attending a concert, going on a hike, or playing a sport together. You could also casually invite them to go with you when you're running errands, getting a bite to eat, or going shopping."

      "content": "Let your eye contact linger a little more than usual. It can feel a little awkward to start flirting with someone who's been a platonic friend. One simple way to ease into it is with eye contact. When you and your crush share a glance, smile a little, then hold their gaze about 2 or 3 longer than you normally would—any longer, and it might look like creepy staring. Then, look away, still smiling. [11] X Research source This can make your friend feel like the two of you share a secret, so they might feel closer to you."

Start small, like touching their hand when you're talking, hugging them when you see them, or leaning against their shoulder when you're standing next to each other. If they seem relaxed or return the affection, you can slowly build up from there. [12] X Research source Increase physical contact with your friend slowly, and be respectful. If they tense up, frown, or move away from you when you touch them, stop what you're doing and consider apologizing for making them uncomfortable."

[13] X Research source For instance, instead of saying, \"You have gorgeous eyes,\" you might say, \"I love how you light up every time you see a cute animal!\" or \"I love the way you always make me laugh when I'm around you!\""

If that's the case, feel free to keep flirting with them and just see how things go. [14] X Research source If they seem tense, uncomfortable, or upset, they might not see you in a romantic way, and it's probably better to back way off. Other signs they're not interested might be if they frequently talk about liking other people, or if they try to avoid any romantic talk altogether. [15] X Research source If they seem a little unsure about how to act, they may just need some time to adjust to the idea, or they may be too polite to let you down.

Practice good posture. An attractive person respects both themself and others. You don't need expensive clothes, perfume/cologne, or makeup. You just need basic skin care, hair care, soap, deodorant, and clothes that help you feel good about yourself and your life. Focus less on any quirks or \"flaws\" in your looks and more on the things you can do. Maybe you have a wonky nose, but you can take good care of your hair and dress sharply.

Go on a few casual non-dates at first, then ask for a more formal date when the time is right. Let your gestures gradually become more flirty and playful, and move up to more obvious affection later on if it feels right. If you push too much right away, you might just end up scaring them off. [16] X Research source Learn to read your friend’s behavior. If they respond well to lighthearted flirting, it could be a good sign. If they tend to shut down or change the subject when you show affection, then they probably aren’t interested in you in that way, and it's time to find a new crush. However, don't be too subtle—part of the reason a lot of people end up in the friend zone is that they don't make it clear enough that they're interested in the other person. [17] X Research source"

However, if you do that too often, it can make you seem insecure—not necessarily the best foundation for creating a romantic relationship. Instead, try to talk about yourself in a positive light, and your crush may be more likely to see you that way, too. [18] X Research source For instance, don't say things like, \"Nobody ever wants to date me\" or, \"I'll be alone forever.\" Instead, try saying things like, \"I know there's someone out there who's going to love me for exactly who I am!\" It's fine to laugh with your crush! In fact, it's ideal. Just try to remember not to make yourself the butt of the joke too often. If you're having trouble seeing what's good about yourself, it might be time to step back from the idea of dating someone for right now. Instead, spend some time figuring out what it means for you to live your best life. It's hard to have a healthy relationship if you don't understand your own worth."

[19] X Research source You might feel like you can impress your crush by constantly doing favors for them, but a real relationship is a two-way street.
