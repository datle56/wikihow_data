      "content": "Locate the dividend. The dividend is the number that's being divided. For example, if your decimals are written like 22.5 ÷ 15.2, then 22.5 is the dividend. [2] X Research source If the numbers are separated by a dividing line, then the dividend is the number to the right of the bracket."

      "content": "Calculate the problem to get the quotient. When you divide the dividend by the divisor, the answer you get is called the quotient. This can be written above the dividing line. [3] X Research source For example, the quotient of 22.5 ÷ 15.2 is 1.48."

      "title": "Move the decimal if the divisor is a decimal.",
      "content": "Move the decimal if the divisor is a decimal. If your divisor has a decimal, move the decimal to the right until it's a whole number. For example, if the divisor is 0.05 move the decimal two places to the right to get 5. [4] X Research source If you have more than 1 number after the decimal, keep moving the decimal until the number is whole. For example, with 43.52 the decimal will move 2 places so you get 4352. If your divisor is a whole number, you don't need to move the decimal."

    {
      "title": "Move the decimal for the dividend if necessary.",
      "content": "Move the decimal for the dividend if necessary. If you moved the decimal for the divisor, you also need to move the decimal for the dividend. Move it the same number of places. This may mean that you'll need to add zeroes if necessary. [5] X Research source For example, if you have 4.5 ÷ 0.05 and you move the decimal by 2 places, you'll get 450 ÷ 5. Consider rewriting the problem so you don't make simple errors."

      "title": "Move the decimal point directly up above the division bar.",
      "content": "Move the decimal point directly up above the division bar. Place the decimal point right above the decimal point that's in the dividend. [6] X Research source So if you moved the decimal 2 places to the right, it would be above the bar and right after the 0 below it."

      "title": "Divide the problem as usual.",
      "content": "Divide the problem as usual. Work from left to right and see how many times the divisor can go into the dividend. Place the quotient above the line and don't move the decimal point. [7] X Research source For example, since 5 doesn't go into 4, see how many times it goes into 45. Because 5 goes into 45 nine times, place a 9 above the line followed by a zero."

      "content": "Check your work with a calculator or by multiplying. If you need to show your work, multiply the quotient you got by the original divisor. You should get the original dividend if you've divided the problem correctly. For example, to check 4.5 ÷ 0.05 = 90, check to see that 90 x 0.05 = 4.5."
