Separate the two with a space or a tab, and keep each entry on its own line. [1] X Research source If you're editing the host file to block a website , the IP address you'll enter is 127.0.0.1 . For example, to block Facebook, you'd enter 127.0.0.1 facebook.com . Don't add \"https://\" or any other protocol before the domain name. Create a new line for each IP address and domain mapping you need to add to your hosts file. Lines that begin with a hash symbol # are considered comments, meaning they are inactive. If you want to remove a line in the hosts file, you can either delete it, or just type a # before it to comment it out. This way, you can easily reactivate the mapping if you change your mind later."

If your goal is to block a website, block an ad domain, or similar, the hosts file won't always be effective–not all applications prioritize the hosts file over DNS, and sometimes IP addresses and domain names change. It's better to use a website-blocking or ad-blocking tool to get the job done."
