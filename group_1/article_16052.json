If Tandemaus is the Pokémon that won the battle that leveled it up, you will see the typical evolution screen. If Tandemaus was in your party, there will be no evolution message, but Tandemaus will have silently evolved into Maushold while in your party. Maushold has two evolutionary forms: Family of Four and Family of Three. Family of Four is the most common form, but there is a 1/100 chance that your Maushold will be the Family of Three Form. [2] X Research source Maushold found in Tera Raid Battles have fixed forms. If you catch a Maushold in a 4-star Tera Raid Battle it will be a Family of Three, and if you catch one in a 6-star Tera Raid Battle it will be a Family of Four. [3] X Research source"
