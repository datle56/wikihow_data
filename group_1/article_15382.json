      "title": "Allow the kiwi berries to ripen out of the fridge until the skins turn deep green.",
      "content": "Allow the kiwi berries to ripen out of the fridge until the skins turn deep green. Kiwi berries can be hard to the touch at first, so let them ripen at room temperature. You will know when the berries have ripened when they are soft to the touch and their skin has turned a deep, dark green color. [1] X Research source Store the kiwi berries in a paper bag to ripen them quicker. The natural gases given off by the berries will concentrate in the bag and make them ripen much faster than being left out in the open."

      "title": "Wash the kiwi berries under cold water before you try them.",
      "content": "Wash the kiwi berries under cold water before you try them. Most fruits and vegetables have a small amount of pesticide or dirt on them if bought fresh. Wash the kiwi berries under cold tap water while they are in the container you bought them in to get rid of this film and anything that could potentially harm you."

      "title": "Pop a whole berry into your mouth for a satisfying burst of flavor.",
      "content": "Pop a whole berry into your mouth for a satisfying burst of flavor. Kiwi berries have no fuzz and can be easily eaten all in one go, as long as they aren't too large. Pop one in your mouth, and munch it right in half for a satisfying sensation of juices and fruit bursting over your taste buds. [2] X Research source The skin of the kiwi berry is completely fine to eat, so don't worry about removing it before you bite into one."

      "title": "Cut a few berries into slices for easy snacking on the go.",
      "content": "Cut a few berries into slices for easy snacking on the go. Kiwi berries are small enough to be eaten whole, but some find them tastier and easier to enjoy as a snack when sliced. Cut off the ends of a handful of kiwi berries, then cut each berry into slices as thin as you like until the whole berry is sliced. Store these in a sealed plastic container to bring to the office, enjoy as an after-workout snack, or simply make the snack last a bit longer throughout the day. Keep in mind that the larger you cut the chunks, the more powerful the taste will be in any recipe you add them to."

      "title": "Slice a whole banana and dice half a seedless papaya.",
      "content": "Slice a whole banana and dice half a seedless papaya. Cut a banana into thin slices and add it to a large bowl. Cut a papaya in half and remove the seeds with a spoon, or buy a seedless papaya to make this process easier. Then, dice the entire papaya into .5 inches (1.3 cm) chunks and add them to the bowl as well. [3] X Research source Don't worry about mixing them together just yet, as you will add some more ingredients to get an even mix of flavors later on."

      "title": "Cut 16 kiwi berries in half and add them to the bowl.",
      "content": "Cut 16 kiwi berries in half and add them to the bowl. Fruit salads are best when its fruits are chopped into large chunks, so chop your kiwi berries in half to make them the main element of this fruit salad. If you would like smaller chunks, cut each half in half again, but any smaller and the flavor won't jump out as it should with each bite. Kiwi berries are extremely juicy, so be sure to wash the juice off of your cutting board when you're done or chop the kiwi berries over the sink. [4] X Research source Be careful if you do not use a cutting board and always cut away from yourself."

      "content": "Mix together 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of lime juice and 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of honey. In a squeeze bottle or small bowl, combine 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of lime juice and 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of honey together into a sour and sweet topping for the fruit salad. A squeeze bottle is easier to combine the ingredients in, as it can then be used to drizzle the sauce over the top of the salad, but be sure to keep it upside-down to get every drop out when serving. If you do not like the thickness of honey, consider using agave nectar instead, as it has the same taste as honey but is much less gooey. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Combine the ingredients in a bowl, hand mix them, and serve! Add the kiwi berries to the bowl then mix the kiwi berries, banana, and papaya together with your hands until the ingredients are equally spread throughout the bowl. Then, drizzle some lime-honey dressing on top, and serve! This fruit salad is especially good with whipped cream as its mild and lush texture counteracts the tart fruit salad. [6] X Research source Store the salad in the fridge separate from the salad dressing to maintain the crispiness and freshness of the ingredients."

      "content": "Halve 10 kiwi berries and 10 cherry tomatoes, then blend the mix for a few seconds. Cut the berries and tomatoes directly in half, then mix them in a blender or a food processor for a few seconds. Do not reduce the mix to a puree — instead, blend it for a few seconds at most to finely chop the berries and tomatoes and mix the flavors together. Pour the mix into a bowl. A food processor is more suited for this task, but a blender can do the job if you have the right blades. [7] X Research source If you prefer your salsa to be less chunky and more liquefied, blend it for a few extra seconds but no more. Tomatoes and kiwi berries are soft, juicy fruits, so be careful not to blend it too much or you will end up with juice rather than salsa."

      "content": "Add 1/4 cup (12.5 g) of chopped coriander to the bowl. Chop up some fresh coriander to add to the salsa — dried coriander will get the flavor across, but it will not taste as fresh or as bright as fresh coriander. Finely cut the coriander, including the stalks, and drizzle it all over the bowl. [8] X Research source The coriander will add a slight spice to the salsa and goes perfectly with cherry tomatoes."

      "title": "Sprinkle chili powder and sugar into the mix.",
      "content": "Sprinkle chili powder and sugar into the mix. Use about 1 tsp (2.67 g) of chili powder and 1 tsp (4 g) of sugar — the sugar will give the salsa a sweet touch while the chili powder gives it a slight kick. Give it a taste test, and add more chili powder if you think it could be a little spicier. Fresh chili paste is a good alternative for chili powder but can be a little more expensive. If you choose to add chili paste instead of dried chili powder, use 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of it and blend it with the tomatoes and kiwi berries instead of adding it to the bowl afterward.

      "title": "Drizzle 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of lime juice over the bowl and serve.",
      "content": "Drizzle 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of lime juice over the bowl and serve. Lime juice is an essential part of any salsa, even a salsa based on kiwi berries. The tart and sour elements of the lime juice sharply counteract the sweet and savory elements of the berries and tomatoes, creating a burst of flavors in your mouth with each bite. Plus, it will last in the fridge in a sealed container for at least a week or two! In terms of chips, corn chips are the traditional salsa pairing, but pita chips are a bit more bready and go well with the thick, sweet salsa. This can also be served alongside sauteed fish and chicken. [10] X Research source"

The squares should be about 12 cm (4.7 in) by 12 cm (4.7 in), about 1/4 of the original pastry sheet if it came in a standard size (usually around 10 in (25 cm) by 15 in (38 cm)). Place these squares onto a non-stick baking sheet and set them to the side.

[13] X Research source These will be propped up on each side of the pastry squares to create a shallow center, in which other ingredients will be added once the pastry has finished baking. Don't cut the strips any wider than 2 cm (0.79 in) or they will not keep their structure in the oven."

      "content": "Put the pastry strips upright on each side of the squares, then bake for 15 minutes. Place the pastry strips on their long sides on each side of the squares you cut earlier, so they surround and encapsulate a smaller area in the middle. They should rise 2 cm (0.79 in) above the squares you cut earlier, creating a pocket in the middle of the pastry. Press the pastry squares and the strips together at the base to make them stick together and hold up in the oven. [15] X Research source Then, bake the pastries for 15 minutes at 200 °C (392 °F). Keep an eye out for the pastry to rise and poke any bubbles with a fork to let out steam and allow it to cook properly. Remove the baked pastries after 15 minutes or as soon as they become golden-brown. [16] X Research source"

Prepare 1 c (240 ml) of the custard mix according to the instructions on the box, then add it to a bowl and pour 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of orange liqueur over it. This adds a slight citrus flavor to the mix, and feel free to add a little more if it is too subtle for your taste. Most custard requires 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 ml) of milk and a pot to heat up the mixture in. Check the instructions for your mix to find out the exact requirements. Use orange zest to taste or 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of orange juice instead if you do not want to consume alcohol.
