      "content": "Recognize that overweight dogs are more likely to become diabetic. Canine diabetes can start when a dog is heavier than average. The best way to see if this could be an issue for your dog is by checking your dog's rib cage. Run your hand along your dog's rib cage. You should be able to feel the ribs easily. If not, your dog may be overweight. Some dogs have incredibly long and thick coats which may make it more difficult to feel their ribs. Another good test is to feel for their back hip bones. If you can feel them by pressing down lightly, then your dog is probably not overweight. If your pet is overweight, talk to your veterinarian about safely decreasing calories and increasing exercise. There are special diets that may be appropriate or you may achieve success with your dog by cutting down on treats and snacks and adding in a few more walks per week."

      "content": "Take note if your dog is older than seven. Diabetes usually develops in dogs between the ages of seven and nine. As your dog gets older, decreased exercise can lead to weight gain. This usually indicates increased levels of glucose and an insufficient level of insulin, which leads to diabetes. [1] X Research source L. Guptill, L. Glickman, N.

Although any dog can develop the disease, some breeds of dogs are more commonly affected by diabetes, including Australian Terrier, Standard Schnauzer, Samoyed, Miniature Poodles, Miniature Schnauzers, Dachshunds, Bichon Frise, Beagles, and Cairn Terriers.

A dog at high risk of developing diabetes is an overweight, intact female from a predisposed breed such as a Dachshund or Beagle. Mixed breed dogs are not immune to developing diabetes."

      "content": "See if your dog is constantly thirsty. One of the most obvious signs of diabetes is excessive drinking. As high glucose levels lead to dehydration, your dog will need to drink more and more water. A dog with diabetes will drink a lot more water than usual. [3] X Research source //www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&amp;S=0&amp;C=0&amp;A=631 As a result, your dog will start urinating more. Oftentimes, pet owners will notice that their dog starts urinating in the house or in its own bed. Do not limit the dog's water intake. Your dog needs the amount of water it is drinking to keep itself hydrated."

      "content": "Notice if your dog sleeps more than usual. A key sign of diabetes is increased lethargy. The dog is tired because the sugar doesn't get taken up into the cells, so the dog runs low on fuel. The resulting sleepiness is known as \"diabetes fatigue.\""

      "content": "Visit your vet immediately if you notice these symptoms. Diabetes that isn't treated can lead to further health complications. The vet will want to perform blood tests to see how high the levels of glucose are in your dog's bloodstream and to make sure no other organs have been affected by diabetes."

      "title": "Run tests.",
      "content": "Run tests. There are multiple tests (blood and urine) that your veterinarian will perform to diagnose your dog. Taken alone, any one of these tests could indicate a wide range of conditions and illnesses, but taken together, they'll let your vet know if your dog suffers from diabetes mellitus. A urinalysis is a chemical examination of your dog's urine. In the first instance, the vet will ask for a urine sample for a dipstick test. If there's no sugar in the urine then diabetes isn't likely. If sugar is present then blood tests are necessary. [5] X Research source A blood glucose test will be performed next. This can be done on a single pin prick of blood. Again, if levels are normal then diabetes is ruled out. If the levels are high then a full blood panel is warranted. A CBC evaluates the level of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your dog's bloodstream. If the vet finds higher levels of white blood cells, this could indicate a urinary tract infection — common in diabetic dogs. Low red blood count could indicate dehydration. It could also mean that your dog is suffering from ruptured red blood cells. A serum biochemistry profile is taken from a separate blood sample. This test focuses on monitoring sugar levels and other materials in your dog's blood like enzymes, lipids (fats), proteins, and cellular waste. While abnormalities of any kind may indicate diabetes, vets primarily look at the serum glucose (sugar). Normally taken after the dog has fasted, any elevated glucose level likely indicates diabetes. In addition, the vet may order a blood fructosamine test. This gives an overview of blood sugar levels for the preceding two to three weeks. This is significant because a single high blood glucose result is not conclusive for diabetes, as stress can cause temporary elevations. Thus either a blood glucose curve (tracking the sugar levels over the course of 24 hours) or a fructosamine, is advisable in order to confirm the diagnosis."
