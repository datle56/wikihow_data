Although the safest bet is to use Breville’s descaling solution (for warranty purposes), most commercial alternatives are more affordable and just as effective! They come in an array of options (liquid, powder, and tablet form) so choose one that fits your budget and preference. It’s helpful to look for similar ingredients found in Breville’s solution or purchase an alternative from the same manufacturer, like Cafetto . Caffeto ’s self-branded descaler is approximately half the price of one from Breville."

      "content": "Check your machine’s instructions before using vinegar . There’s a lot of controversy on whether you should clean your espresso machine with vinegar. In general, vinegar is a safe descaling solution, but it’s always best to read the instruction and/or safety manual of your machine. For the solution, mix equal parts distilled white vinegar and water. [14] X Research source The best way to prevent your coffee maker from building up calcium deposits is to use only distilled water . If you do not have distilled water and your coffee machine already has some build-up, you can use vinegar. You can wash all its parts and dry them. Then put all its parts together and fill the water tank with half water and half vinegar. Run as many cycles as possible until the tank is empty. You can use vinegar to descale, remove coffee residue, and disinfect your coffee machine. Avoid using vinegar if your machine has an aluminum heating block—the acetic acid in white vinegar can cause potential damage by eroding the interior components!
