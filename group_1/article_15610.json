      "content": "Neutralize odors completely with an enzymatic cleaner . Cat behavior expert Joey Lusvardi explains that enzymatic cleaners “actually destroy the cat urine itself and [does] not just…cover up the smell.” Follow the directions on the enzymatic cleaner you purchase because they may have different instructions between brands. Lusvardi explains that cats are attracted to the chemicals in the urine and may pee in that spot again unless the odor is completely eliminated. Enzymatic cleaners work great for old, lingering cat odors that may be left over from previous owners or tenants. Avoid using enzymatic cleaners with other cleaning products. The ingredients in cleaning products could weaken the potency of the enzymatic cleaner."

Try to figure out what’s making your cat go on the floor so you can make a plan to stop it from happening . Contact your veterinarian and let them know what’s happening to determine if there’s an underlying medical condition. Make sure you have one more litter box than the number of cats in your home, and that they are at least 1.5 times longer than your cat.

Scoop and remove any feces and urine clumps from the litter box as soon as possible so the smell doesn’t linger around. Doing this will encourage your cat to use the box in the future and prevent your cat from going to the bathroom in other areas of your home as well. Use unscented litter because some cats are turned off by strong-scented litter and may not use the box. To minimize odors, sprinkle a little baking soda at the bottom of the box and then pour the litter on top. Get into the habit of emptying the litter box first thing in the morning or at night before bed. This way, any feces or urine in the litter box will not sit in the litter for long. Change the litter in the litter box completely at least twice a month to keep it fresh. Wash the box with dish detergent or baking soda each time you change out the litter so it stays clean and odor-free."

If you have a multi-level home, try to have at least one litter box on each floor.
