      "content": "Make your caller laugh—and maybe blush—with a dirty line. Only use dirty openers with close friends who share your sense of humor (these types of jokes are never appropriate for work).

      "content": "Understand your audience and their sense of humor. Pay attention to what other people find funny. [9] X Research source Because you’re answering your phone, you probably have a good idea of who is calling you. If a friend calls you, try to think of the type of humor they usually enjoy. Some people like ridiculous exaggerations. Others prefer clever wordplay. A few can’t resist a fart joke. Consider whether a funny comment is appropriate for the call. For example, calls with work colleagues might not be the right time to make every joke. Racist, sexist, and crude humor can be extremely offensive to some people. Similarly, jokes about religion, political beliefs, and other belief systems are also touchy."
