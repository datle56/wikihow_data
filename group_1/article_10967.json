      "content": "Choose your yarn. You will need at least one ball of yarn to work the moss stitch. You can choose any yarn texture or color. You can work the moss stitch in a single color or you can alternate colors as you start new rows to create a colorful pattern. Consider your desired results for your project to determine if you want to use one yarn color or multiple colors. For example, you could work a project using only red yarn, or you could alternate red, yellow, and blue yarns for a colorful result."

      "content": "Select a crochet hook that is appropriate for your yarn type. You may use any type or size of yarn to work the moss stitch, but you will need to ensure that the crochet hook you choose is appropriate for the yarn. Check the label on your yarn for hook size recommendations. For example, if you are working with a medium worsted weight yarn, then a hook within the range of an I-9 (6.5 mm) through a K-10 (9 mm) will yield the best results. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Chain",
      "content": "Chain an even number of stitches. Start with an even number of chained stitches. To make a chain, loop your yarn around your finger twice, and then pull the first loop through the second loop. Transfer this loop to your hook and tighten it by pulling on the tail. Then, loop your working yarn over your hook and pull this yarn through the loop. This will create your first chain. To make another chain, yarn over the hook again, and pull through again. [2] X Research source Keep making chains until you have the desired number. You may chain as many stitches as you like, as long as you chain an even number. For example, you might only chain 10 stitches if you just want to practice the moss stitch, or you might chain 120 stitches if you want to make a moss stitch blanket."
