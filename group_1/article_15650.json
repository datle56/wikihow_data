      "content": "Reconnect with your childhood. One way to rekindle the relationship with your inner child is to \"time travel\" back to your childhood. Do this by making a list of things that brought you joy when you were young. Explore these lovely memories and try to recall that childhood wonder. [1] X Research source Revisiting these activities is also a good idea. Some ideas: Sports, whether that's soccer, football, basketball, baseball, or something else. Exploring the woods. A yummy picnic is a great idea. Playing pretend. This can be dressing up and having a tea party or even fighting off a band of mean, sneaky pirates. Color, whether in a child's or adult coloring book. Indulge in a favorite childhood treat, whether it is a favorite cereal, something your mom would make you, or a specific kind of candy. YA and/or fantasy novels, some of which are still read by adults. Examples include the Narnia series and the Time Quintet ."

      "content": "Identify your specific inner child. Although everyone has different childhoods, there are patterns common to most people. If the relationship with your inner child has dwindled over the years, try to identify what stage of development your childhood is in now. This will help you create a roadmap for bringing your inner child back into your life. Note that there are some common themes one's \"inner child\" can have. These examples tend to be what your inner child is \"mostly\". [2] X Research source Some examples are: The abandoned child. This inner child often comes about as a result of parents divorcing or being too busy to spare attention. Or it can be severe, in the cases of abuse or neglect. Some of the clues are fears of being abandoned and feeling lonely or insecure. The playful child. This child is a healthy, often neglected aspect of adulthood. The playful child wants to have spontaneous fun and live life free from guilt or anxiety. The fearful child. This child probably received a lot of criticism as a child and experiences anxiety whenever it fails to get enough affirmation."

      "title": "Write a letter to your inner child.",
      "content": "Write a letter to your inner child. This can be an apology if you feel like you've neglected your inner child and want to repair that connection. It can also be a simple letter expressing your desire to strengthen the friendship. Tailor your letter to the type of inner child you have. If she is fearful, try to reassure her and soften those fears. If she's worried about being abandoned, let her know that you will do your best always to be there for her. If she is playful, tell her you want to honor that lighthearted freedom."

      "title": "Cultivate an open space.",
      "content": "Cultivate an open space. Your inner child is a vulnerable person. She may need a safe space before she shows herself. Many people hide or deny the existence of the inner child because they think it makes them look weak. To let your inner child shine through, be gentle and affirming. Approach her softly, like a small animal whose trust you want to gain. Sit quietly and tell your inner child that you want to know more about her, that you're available to talk, and that you want her to feel safe. This may sound silly, but what you're doing is accessing another part of yourself and your unconscious mind."

      "title": "Listen to your feelings.",
      "content": "Listen to your feelings. One important way to get in touch with your inner child is to pay close attention to feelings that pop up in your daily life. These can be traced back to many of the wonderful and painful experiences of childhood when you were young and impressionable. The inner child's fears and insecurities, as well as her joys and feelings of wonder, often unfold into the emotional patterns of our adult lives. Throughout the day, check in with yourself. Ask, \"what am I feeling right now?\" Try to put words to these feelings."

      "title": "Be mindful of your inner critic.",
      "content": "Be mindful of your inner critic. One of the biggest obstacles to giving your inner child the attention and care she needs is a critical voice. This voice can tell you that you're too old to have childlike insecurities or embrace the silliness of childhood. The inner critic begins to develop in childhood; it's a reaction to the inner child being stifled. [3] X Research source Respect your inner critic, as part of your inner child who has been let down or hurt, but avoid buying into negative self-talk. Respond to your inner critic by saying: \"I understand where you're coming from. I understand that you're hurt. I'm here for you.\" Another helpful phrase: \"Yes, this is a little silly. But this is what I'm supposed to be doing right now. Can you please take a break and let me do this?\""

      "content": "Accept your inner child’s feelings. You may experience frustration if feelings of anger or insecurity well up inside you.

      "title": "Use re-parenting to heal.",
      "content": "Use re-parenting to heal. Re-parenting is based on the idea that as an adult you now possess the knowledge and resources to give your inner child what she needs. [5] X Research source If you feel like your inner child needs some healing before she can show up in your life at her best, this can be a good approach to try. You know better than anyone what she needs, based on hurtful experiences in her past, and how to help. For example, if your parents never gave you a birthday party, throw one for yourself . Invite your friends and tell them you're making up for this part of your childhood. For another example, affirm yourself when you know you've done something you can be proud of. Say \"I'm proud of myself and my achievements.\""

      "title": "Protect your inner child.",
      "content": "Protect your inner child. Although you want to avoid being held back by childhood fears, it's a good idea to be sensitive to your inner child's needs as well. If you have particular insecurities that you haven't fully overcome, respect them. You may have a fear of heights that first showed up in childhood. Be kind to the part of you that's still unsure about high diving boards or climbing. Also, stay out of toxic situations. If being around specific people reinforces childhood anxieties, limit contact with those individuals. For example, if you have a brother who picks on you and makes you feel bad about yourself, avoid spending more time with him than necessary."
