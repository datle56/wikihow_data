      "content": "Simplify the equation of the line. If you are given the equation of a line and one common point and asked to find a line that runs perpendicular to it, it is important that you first convert the equation into the y = m x + b {\\displaystyle y=mx+b} format. To do this, you want to get the y {\\displaystyle y} by itself. [3] X Research source For example, say your given equation is 5 y − x = 10 {\\displaystyle 5y-x=10} . To isolate y {\\displaystyle y} , first move − x {\\displaystyle {-x}} to the opposite side of the equation by adding it to both sides to get 5 y = x + 10 {\\displaystyle 5y=x+10} Get rid of the 5 {\\displaystyle 5} on the 5 y {\\displaystyle 5y} by dividing both sides of the equation by 5 {\\displaystyle 5} . The new equation will be y = 1 5 x + 2 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {1}{5}}x+2} ."

      "content": "Calculate the opposite reciprocal of the slope. When a line is perpendicular to another line, the slope will be the negative opposite of the original line. This is called the opposite reciprocal. The lines cross each other at a right angle, so the slopes must be opposite. Two perpendicular slopes multiplied together will always equal − 1 {\\displaystyle -1} . [4] X Research source Remember that m {\\displaystyle m} represents the slope of the line. The opposite reciprocal of the equation y = 1 5 x + 2 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {1}{5}}x+2} would be − 5 1 x {\\displaystyle {-}{\\frac {5}{1}}x} or − 5 {\\displaystyle -5} ."

Now that you have the slope of the perpendicular line, you can plug the value of the slope and the point you were given into a slope equation. This will give you the value of the y-intercept. Using the y-intercept, you can move on to complete the slope equation. [5] X Research source Remember that b {\\displaystyle b} represents the y-intercept of the line. For example, say your given point is ( 8 , 2 ) {\\displaystyle (8,2)} where 8 {\\displaystyle 8} represents the x {\\displaystyle x} coordinate and 2 {\\displaystyle 2} is the y {\\displaystyle y} coordinate. Replace the letters in the y = m x + b {\\displaystyle y=mx+b} equation with your known values of slope and xy coordinates: 2 = − 5 ( 8 ) + b {\\displaystyle 2={-5}(8)+b}"
