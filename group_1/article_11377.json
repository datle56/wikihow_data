The deck should be face-down in your hand and stay face-down through the whole cut. [1] X Research source Grab the deck with the dealer's grip, which means the length of your thumb is on one long side. Place 3 fingers on the other long side and your index finger on top. [2] X Research source At this point, the deck should be flat against your palm."

[3] X Research source Move the deck up so that it's not on your palm anymore. Balance it between your fingers; the cards should be against your finger pads, not gripped in the very tips. Keep the thumb on one long side, 2 fingers across from that, and 1 finger on each end. [4] X Research source"

Slide your finger down the edge of the cards until you get to a spot where you want to cut them, and then use the tip of your finger to pull those cards down into your palm. [5] X Research source If this move is giving you difficulty, try just releasing a little pressure from your pinkie and index finger and then allowing some of the cards to drop down into your palm.

Push on that edge from the bottom of the card to lever the cards out from below the top set of cards. [7] X Research source As you push the cards up, the long edge of the cards underneath will go across the face side of the cards above. Brace the other edge of those cards against the dip between your index finger and your thumb as you wait to catch the cards with your upper thumb."

As the long edge of the lower cards reaches the other long edge of the top cards, you've cleared space for the top cards to fall gently into your fingers below. Use your thumb to guide the bottom cards in place on top of the cards that just fell below. [8] X Research source If you can, keep hold of the top set of cards with the tip of your thumb until the bottom cards are ready to go up and over. If your hands are too small, move your thumb off the cards partway through and balance the upper cards on the lower cards as you do. [9] X Research source If you find your hands are still too small, try buying bridge cards, which are slightly smaller than poker cards. [10] X Research source"

Place all 4 fingers on one long side while your thumb is on the other side. [12] X Research source The cards should be touching your finger pads not the very tips of your fingers. Some people stay in a claw grip for this trick, where you have an index finger on one end and your pinkie on the other."

With just your index finger and thumb holding the top stack, you should be able to swivel it out away from your hand a little bit. Slide your ring finger under this stack along the face of the card. As you do, the bottom stack of cards will come up a little and you can slide your ring finger between the 2 stacks. [14] X Research source Both stacks should still be face down in your hand.
