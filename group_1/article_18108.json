List each activity, starting with the earliest one, and working your way through the hours of the day. Make sure that you work around any appointments or meetings you have. [2] X Research source Of course, everyone’s days are different, so each person’s plan will be different. A basic plan could look something like this: 9:00 to 10:00am: Get to the office, check email, send out responses 10:00 to 11:30am: Meeting with George and Sue 11:30 to 12:30pm: Project #1 12:30 to 1:15pm: Lunch (eat healthy!) 1:15 to 2:30pm: Review project #1, meet with Sam and discuss Project #1 2:30 to 4:00pm: Project #2 4:00 to 5:00pm: Start Project #3, set things up for tomorrow 5:00 to 6:30pm: Leave the office, head to the gym 6:30 to 7:00pm: Pick up groceries head home 7:00 to 8:30pm: Make dinner, relax 8:30pm: Go to the movies with Cody"

      "title": "Refocus yourself every hour or so.",
      "content": "Refocus yourself every hour or so. It is important to take a moment after each allotted amount of time to review how productive you were during that time. Did you do everything you needed to get done? Then, give yourself a minute to reset--close your eyes and relax. This way you will be able to effectively transition into the next activity you have to do. [3] X Research source Sometimes you will need to leave a project and come back to it later. Make sure to make a note of where you left off. This will make it easier to return to the project later on."

      "title": "Review your day.",
      "content": "Review your day. When you have finished the majority of your day, take a moment to review how successful you were at sticking to your plan. Were you able to finish everything that you wanted to? Where did you slip up? What worked and what didn’t? What distracted you and how can you keep it from distracting you in the future? Keep in mind that some projects will take multiple days or weeks to complete, and that is okay. Try to think about what you accomplished in terms of increments rather than as a whole. If necessary, learn to plan your week in addition to your day to get your project done on time."

      "content": "Determine what roles you play in the present. Every day we perform different roles (from student to son, from artist to biker). What you want to do is think about the roles that you are currently playing in your daily life. These roles could include (among many, many others): Traveler, student, daughter, writer, drawer, employee, glass-blower, hiker, grandchild, thinker, etc."

These roles are the nouns you would want to use to describe yourself at the end of your life. Consider the roles you are playing right now. Are any of them unnecessarily stressing you out? If so, that role might not be one that needs to continue through your life. Prioritize these roles from most important to least important. This exercise will help you to determine what you really value in life and what is most important to you. Keep in mind, however, that this list is completely changeable--just as you are constantly changing.

      "content": "Determine the reason behind the roles you want to play. A role is a great way to define yourself, but the reason behind why you want to play the role is what gives it meaning. Maybe you want to be a volunteer because you see the trouble in the world and want to do your part to fix it. Or maybe you want to be a father because you want to give your children the perfect childhood. [5] X Research source One way to help you define the purpose of your role is to imagine your own funeral (yes this is rather morbid, but it really works). Who would be in attendance? What would you want them to say about you? How would you want to be remembered?"

Think of this as your bucket list--the things you want to do before die... These goals should be the ones you really want to achieve--not the ones you think you should have. Sometimes it helps to create categories for your goals so that you can more easily visualize them. Some categories you could use include (but are certainly not limited to): [6] X Research source Career/vocation; Travel; Social (family/friends); Health; Finances; Knowledge/Intellect; Spirituality Some example goals (in order of the categories listed above) include: Publish a book; travel to every continent; get married and raise a family; lose 20 pounds; make enough money to afford to send my children to college; get my master's degree in Creative Writing; learn more about Buddhism."

Send book manuscript to 30 publishers by June 2018. Travel to South America in 2019 and Asia in 2020. Weigh 120 lbs by January 2019."

Re-read the first half of your book. B. Finish writing your book. C. Rework aspects of the book you don’t like. D. Edit for grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. E. Get several critical friends to read your book and give you feedback. F. Research publishers that you think would consider your book for publication. G. Send your manuscript out.

Often, the problem we are facing is actually causing more problems for us. What you need to do is get down to the root of the matter--the true problem that you need to solve. [9] X Research source Your mom isn’t letting you go to your friend’s mountain cabin in four weeks. This is definitely a problem, but what you need to do is determine the root of this problem. The fact is, you are getting a C- in your algebra class, which is why your mom doesn’t want you spending the weekend skiing. Therefore, the problem is that you are not doing well in your math class.

A barrier to your success, however, might be that you truly don’t understand the concepts being taught in the class--not just because you are talking in class, but because you have never really ‘gotten’ algebra.

Whichever way you choose, you should consider solutions to both the way you personally are affecting the problem, and the barriers that you might be facing that are not of your own making. Solutions for talking to your friend in the class: A. Force yourself to sit on the opposite side of the class from your friend. B. Tell your friend that you are getting a really bad grade in the class and you need to focus. C. If you have a seating assignment, ask your teacher to move you so that you can focus more. Solutions for not doing your homework because of soccer: A. Do some homework at lunch or during your free period so that you don’t have as much to do at night. B. Keep yourself to a strict schedule--after practice you will eat dinner and then do homework. Reward yourself by watching an hour of TV after your homework is done. Solutions for not understanding algebra. A. Enlist the help of a classmate that can explain the concepts to you (but only if you both won’t get distracted while going over the problems). B. Ask your teacher for help--approach your teacher after class and ask if you could set up a meeting with her because you have questions about the homework. C. Get a tutor or join a study group."

Now that you have figured out what the problem is and have brainstormed some solutions, pick the solutions you think will work best and write down a plan for yourself.
