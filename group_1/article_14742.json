      "content": "Choose a white T-shirt made of light material. This will form the base of the top half of your basic outfit. There are several cricket-specific brands which make white T-shirts that are specifically designed for cricket, but any brand of shirt will do. [1] X Research source This shirt is often a collared white polo but it doesn’t have to be. The material of the shirt needs to be a cotton blend or some sort of breathable material. You'll be standing out in the sun and running around, so the material needs to keep you cool. If you sunburn easily, buying a long-sleeve shirt might be a good idea as this provides the most effective protection against the sun."

      "title": "Select long white pants designed for cricket.",
      "content": "Select long white pants designed for cricket. Cricket is always played in long pants, never shorts. There are a variety of reasons for this, the main of which is that cricket is generally played in the summer and white clothes reflect the heat most effectively. [2] X Research source You will most likely have to buy cricket-specific pants rather than just any white pants as they need to be reasonably elastic for running and also breathable. If there aren’t any stores around you that sell cricket clothes then look online as many retailers ship all over the world."

      "title": "Wear a white hat that keeps your head and neck shaded.",
      "content": "Wear a white hat that keeps your head and neck shaded. Many cricket players wear wide-brimmed bucket hats when playing cricket but it’s also perfectly acceptable to wear a basic white cap. Wearing a hat when you are out in the field is incredibly important as it can help keep your body temperature down and also prevent you from getting sunburnt. Most cricket leagues require the logo on a hat to be small and, sometimes, completely absent altogether. You can find a basic white sports cap at your local sports store and although not mandatory, wearing one is a very smart idea while fielding to prevent sunstroke. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a cricket vest or jumper to wear while fielding. These are a very traditional part of cricket and have been worn by players since the very beginning of the sport. Most players wear a white or cream vest while fielding and then take this off when bowling. The main function of the jumper is to simply keep you warm in the field as you can often be stagnant for long periods of time. You are permitted to hand your jumper and other accessories to the umpire while you are bowling. There are also long sleeve jumpers available to be worn although these are saved for particularly cold days. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Get yourself a pair of athletic sunglasses. If you watch a game of professional cricket, you will notice that almost all of the players are wearing sunglasses. It’s incredibly uncommon to be fielding and not wearing sunglasses. You can find sunglasses optimized for cricket by looking online at various sporting websites. [5] X Research source Wearing sunglasses has multiple benefits including protecting your eyes from the sun when you are forced to look upward at the ball, and also protecting your eyes and the surrounding area from sunburn."

      "title": "Get fitted for leg pads.",
      "content": "Get fitted for leg pads. This is the most basic piece of padding equipment that there is in cricket. All players wear leg pads when batting and they extend from the bottom of your shin up to the middle of your thigh. There are a variety of different styles of pads you can buy; some are extremely lightweight, while others are built for comfort. Lightweight ones are great for running but sometimes offer less protection. Heavier ones offer very sturdy protection but aren't as flexible. Because pads can be quite tricky to get fitted, trying these on in-person is really important. Try and get to your local sports store or arrange for some demo pads to be shipped to you.

      "title": "Shop around for cricket batting gloves.",
      "content": "Shop around for cricket batting gloves. All batsmen are required to wear gloves given the potential damage that can occur to your hands if they are hit by a cricket ball at full speed. The gloves are heavily padded on top and protect the outside of your hands and knuckles. There is a difference between left-handed and right-handed gloves so make sure that you buy the right ones! You get what you pay for with gloves, so if you know you will be facing very fast bowlers it might be worth investing in high-quality gloves. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure you have access to a batting helmet.",
      "content": "Make sure you have access to a batting helmet. Protecting your head during cricket is of the absolute utmost importance. There have been several recorded fatalities from players being struck in the head by a cricket ball so wearing a helmet is now strongly encouraged by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Batting helmets cover your head and have a metal grill that protects your face. If you are playing for a club team, the club may provide a few helmets for you to use, so you don’t necessarily need to buy one. Make sure this is sorted out before your first game. You are not actually required to wear a helmet but since the technology has been developed, it has become the standard across almost all international players."

      "title": "Purchase some cricket shoes/running shoes.",
      "content": "Purchase some cricket shoes/running shoes. Cricket players mostly wear cricket shoes when they are playing. These shoes are very similar to running shoes but they have little plastic spikes on the bottom of them to help with traction. They are almost exactly the same as golf shoes. [8] X Research source You definitely don’t need cricket shoes to be able to play cricket, but if you anticipate playing at a high level, then it’s probably a good idea. If you do decide to stick with running shoes, make sure they have good traction on the bottom."

      "title": "Get thigh guards and other protective gear if desired.",
      "content": "Get thigh guards and other protective gear if desired. Thigh guards are inserted under your white pants to protect your thighs. Not every cricket player wears them, but they are a good idea for extra protection. Feel free to purchase other less common protective items, such as arm guards or a mouthguard as well. [9] X Research source Wearing a thigh guard does tend to slow you down when running, so there is a trade-off."
