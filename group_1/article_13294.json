      "content": "Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction it’s next to. Before we can divide mixed fractions, we need to make it so that they’re just fractions. To do this, we make them improper fractions. First, multiply the denominator, or bottom number, of each mixed number’s fraction by that mixed number’s whole number. [1] X Research source Do this for both mixed numbers, and make note of the answers. We’ll keep using them. For example, if you wanted to show 6 1 2 ÷ 2 1 4 {\\displaystyle 6{\\frac {1}{2}}\\div 2{\\frac {1}{4}}} as improper fractions, you first multiply 6 × 2 = 12 {\\displaystyle 6\\times 2=12} and 2 × 4 = 8 {\\displaystyle 2\\times 4=8} . If the whole number is alone without a fraction, then it’s not a mixed number. In this case, all we need to do is make it a fraction by putting it over 1. For example: 3 = 3 1 {\\displaystyle 3={\\frac {3}{1}}} ."

      "title": "Add the numerator to the product.",
      "content": "Add the numerator to the product. Now, take the product you just found and add it to the numerator, or top number, of that fraction. [2] X Research source Do this for both mixed numbers. This sum will be the numerator of your improper fraction. For example, 12 + 1 = 13 {\\displaystyle 12+1=13} and 8 + 1 = 9 {\\displaystyle 8+1=9} ."

      "title": "Place the sum over the original denominator.",
      "content": "Place the sum over the original denominator. Complete this step for both fractions, making sure you use the correct denominators. These are the improper fractions that you will use to complete the division. [3] X Research source For example, 6 1 2 {\\displaystyle 6{\\frac {1}{2}}} becomes 13 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {13}{2}}} and 2 1 4 {\\displaystyle 2{\\frac {1}{4}}} becomes 9 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {9}{4}}} . Explanation: What we’re actually doing here is making each whole number a fraction, then adding it to the existing fraction to combine the mixed numbers into a single fraction. For example, 2 1 4 {\\displaystyle 2{\\frac {1}{4}}} is the same as 4 4 + 4 4 + 1 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{4}}+{\\frac {4}{4}}+{\\frac {1}{4}}} , we’re just using a shortcut to do the same thing."

      "title": "Flip the second fraction and make it a multiplication equation.",
      "content": "Flip the second fraction and make it a multiplication equation. The simplest way to divide two fractions is to find the reciprocal of the second fraction, then multiply instead of divide. To find a reciprocal of a fraction, you simply “flip” it so that the numerator becomes the denominator, and the denominator becomes the numerator. [4] X Research source Then, change the problem to a multiplication problem, Jia tells us. [5] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. For example, if you take the reciprocal of 9 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {9}{4}}} , it becomes 4 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{9}}} . So 13 2 ÷ 9 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {13}{2}}\\div {\\frac {9}{4}}} becomes 13 2 × 4 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {13}{2}}\\times {\\frac {4}{9}}}"

For example, if calculating 13 2 × 4 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {13}{2}}\\times {\\frac {4}{9}}} , you would multiply the numerators: 13 × 4 = 52 {\\displaystyle 13\\times 4=52} ."

      "content": "Simplify your answer, if possible. To simplify , or reduce, a fraction, you need to find the greatest factor (besides 1) that is common to the numerator and the denominator. Then, divide the numerator and denominator by that factor. [8] X Research source For example, 52 {\\displaystyle 52} and 18 {\\displaystyle 18} are both divisible by 2 {\\displaystyle 2} . 52 ÷ 2 = 26 {\\displaystyle 52\\div 2=26} 18 ÷ 2 = 9 {\\displaystyle 18\\div 2=9} So, 52 18 = 26 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {52}{18}}={\\frac {26}{9}}}"

      "title": "Divide the numerator by the denominator.",

Usually, though, you will have a remainder. Set this aside for now. The quotient you found when dividing the numerator by the denominator will be the whole number of your mixed number. [9] X Research source For example, 26 ÷ 9 = 2 {\\displaystyle 26\\div 9=2} with a remainder of 8 {\\displaystyle 8} . Thus, the whole number of your mixed number will be 2 {\\displaystyle 2} ."
