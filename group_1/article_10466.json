      "content": "Craft a campfire. Campfires are used to make the bees non-aggressive so you won't be attacked for harvesting honeycomb. To make a campfire, you'll need 3 sticks, a piece of coal or charcoal, 3 logs, and a crafting table. Open a crafting table and place the 3 logs in each slot in the bottom row, then put the coal or charcoal in the middle of the middle row. Place a stick on either side of the coal/charcoal and put the final stick above the coal/charcoal."

      "content": "Use candles as a lightsource. Unlike torches or other light sources, candles aren't lit up when placed, you'll need to use a flint and steel or fire charge to light them. A flint and steel can be crafted using flint, which is obtained by mining gravel, and an iron ingot, which is obtained by smelting iron ore or raw iron. Once you have a flint and steel, place up to 4 similar colored candles on a solid block and use the flint and steel on them. A single lit candle emits a light level of 3, and each candle placed and lit on the same block increases the light level by 3, leading to a maximum light level of 12. [5] X Research source Candles can be extinguished using water or by interacting with them again. You can also throw water bottles on candles to extinguish them."
