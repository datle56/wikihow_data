      "content": "Navigate to the site to which you want your QR code to link. This way, the QR code can link to your LinkedIn profile page, a YouTube video, or anything that you can get to in a Chrome web browser. This is the easiest solution if you're linking to just the content on a website instead of including contact information or text. The QR codes generated this way are static, so you can't track how well the QR codes are doing, nor can you customize how they look. All QR codes generated with Chrome have a tiny T-Rex in the middle. You can create QR codes in Chrome using the desktop web browser on Mac and Windows as well as by using the mobile app for iPhone, iPad, and Android."
