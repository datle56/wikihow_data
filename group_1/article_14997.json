      "title": "Wash your apples.",
      "content": "Wash your apples. You do not necessarily need to peel them. The peel adds extra flavor to the apples and also contains a good deal of the fiber apples are famous for. But if you prefer not to eat the peel, you can search for zero-waste methods to further use the apple peels. Other people like to peel their apples because they do not like the texture of the dried skins. It is really just a matter of what you like. Any variety of apple can be dried, though Gala, Fuji, and Golden Delicious work particularly well."

      "title": "Cut away the cores.",
      "content": "Cut away the cores. You will also want to cut out any worm-eaten parts. Kitchen stores sell apple corers that will easily and efficiently remove your apple cores. However, if you do not have one of these devices you can also core your apples by hand. [1] X Research source If you are using these apples for decorations, or you really like your food to look as beautiful as possible, skip the coring. Apples that are not cored and are cut so that they keep their circular shape have a pretty star pattern in the center created by the core."

      "title": "Cut the apples into thin slices.",
      "content": "Cut the apples into thin slices. You can either cut your apples so that they retain their circular shape, or you can cut them into thin wedges. Again, this is simply based on your own preference, though some say that the thinner the slices, the easier it is to dry the apples."

      "title": "Dip your slices into a solution that will keep them from browning.",
      "content": "Dip your slices into a solution that will keep them from browning. An excellent solution for this is lemon juice, pineapple juice and water mixed together. The pineapple juice isn’t necessary but it adds sweetness to the mixture that counteracts the sour flavor of the lemon juice. [2] X Research source Pre-treating the apples will also help them retain more of their vitamin A and vitamin C properties as well as provide a better texture in the final product. Here are some methods you can use to pretreat the apples: Soak the apple slices in lemon juice. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) lemon juice into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit. Soak the apple slices in sodium bisulfite. Mix 2 teaspoons (9.85 mL) of sodium bisulfite into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit. Soak the apple slices in ascorbic acid for a result 6 times more effective than lemon juice. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.78 mL) of crystalline ascorbic acid into 1 quart (2 pints) of cold water. Soak the fruit for 3 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit. You can also add orange juice and lemon juice mixed with water."

When the hour has passed, remove the sheets and flip all of the apple slices over. Bake the apples for one more hour is you prefer your apples to be a little less crispy. If you like crispy dried apples, bake them for two more hours. Just make sure to bake them evenly on each side. You should keep an eye on your apples and check them periodically. All ovens are different and your oven might take a longer or shorter amount of time to dry the apples."

      "title": "Turn the oven off but do not take the apples out for another one to two hours.",
      "content": "Turn the oven off but do not take the apples out for another one to two hours. Inside, crack the oven door open a small amount and let the apples cool inside the oven. You should not take the apples out until the oven has cooled completely (this should take one or two hours). There's another school of thought that you should keep your oven open during the entire cooking process, with a fan blowing on it to help circulate the air. If you decide to prop the oven open in advance, just cook the apples for 6-10 hours."

      "content": "Spread the apple slices on some shallow cooking trays. Cover the bottom of the trays with parchment paper or some other cooking paper before placing the apples on the trays. Cooking trays that have lips are better than cookie trays because the drying apples may leak a little juice which could make a sticky mess."

In the evening, before the dew falls, bring the apple slices indoors so that they do not get moldy. Place the tray in a dry spot in your house. [4] X Research source"
