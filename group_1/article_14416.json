You can make the pupils any color, but you can also make no pupil at all. If you decide to make it without any pupil, your dragon will get a more scarier, fierce look."

      "content": "Draw the nose of the dragon by drawing a sort of four-leaf clover then draw the snout - making it like a trunk of a palm tree. If you are already in the mouth part, erase a bit of the snout and make a line that leads onto the mouth. If you want to, you can make the mouth of your dragon open and also add a tongue like in the picture. Don't forget to add the sharp teeth! The dragon is nothing with out sharp and menacing teeth."
