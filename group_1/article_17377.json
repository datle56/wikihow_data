      "title": "Roll out self-stick underlayment over the verge area.",
      "content": "Roll out self-stick underlayment over the verge area. Underlayment is a weather-resistant material that will protect your roof from wind and rain damage. Apply a layer of underlayment over the outer edge of the gable, also known as the verge area, by peeling off the backing to expose the adhesive and then rolling it out over the surface. The underlayment needs to cover the area completely and the material will stick to itself to form a seal. [1] X Research source You can find self-stick underlayment at home improvement stores, hardware stores, and online. If there are already shingles on the verge where you plan to install your dry verge, pull them off so you can apply the underlayment and install your verge."

      "title": "Cut away any excess underlayment with a utility knife.",
      "content": "Cut away any excess underlayment with a utility knife. Trim the edges of the underlayment after you roll it out so they’re flush and even with the outer edge of the roof. Take a utility knife and cut along the edges to cut away the excess and form an even line. [2] X Research source Press down on the edges as you cut away the excess to seal them to the roof."

      "title": "Install roof battens over the underlayment with roofing nails.",
      "content": "Install roof battens over the underlayment with roofing nails. Roof battens are thin strips of wood used to fasten the dry verges to the roof. Lie down a roof batten, take a hammer, and install roofing nails into the corners of the batten to connect it to the roof. Then, place another batten next to it so the edges are flush and even, and secure it with roofing nails. [3] X Research source Cover the underlayment with the battens."

    {
      "title": "Measure the outer edge of the batten to make the tiles are even.",
      "content": "Measure the outer edge of the batten to make the tiles are even. The edge of the tiling battens must be even and consistent in order for the dry verge to form a straight line when you install it. Take a ruler and measure the edges of the battening to make sure they’re even. A good rule of thumb is to have all of the battens extend 45mm past the bargeboard or edge of the roof."

      "title": "Slide the starter insert into the channel of a dry verge.",
      "content": "Slide the starter insert into the channel of a dry verge. The starter insert is a solid block that seals the first verge tile to the roof so moisture, insects, animals, or anything else can’t access the verge. Take the insert, align the rails with the slots on the dry verge, and slide it into place. [4] X Research source The insert may click or snap into place. Make sure you slide the insert as far as it will go into the verge piece."

    {
      "title": "Place the starter verge over the last shingle or tile on the roof.",
      "content": "Place the starter verge over the last shingle or tile on the roof. Position starter verge where the roof tiling or shingles end and the underlayment on the verge section begins. The verge piece will hang over the lip of the roof. Line it up so it’s flush against the fascia, or the outer edge of the roof. Hold the verge tile in place with your hands. [5] X Research source The starter insert rests flat against the fascia which is the board attached to the underside of the outer edge of the roof."

      "title": "Screw the starter verge into the roof fascia with a drill.",
      "content": "Screw the starter verge into the roof fascia with a drill. Connect a screw to the drill bit and place the tip of it in the center of one of the screw holes, against the outer fascia of the roof. Pull the trigger on the drill to drive the screw into the wood. Continue drilling until the screw is all of the way into the outer fascia. Locate the other screw hole and drive a screw through it into the fascia so the starter verge is held securely. [6] X Research source Be careful not to drill so far that you crack or split the wood. The dry verge pieces should include screws for you to install them."

      "title": "Nail the starter verge to the tiling batten where the verge begins.",
      "content": "Nail the starter verge to the tiling batten where the verge begins. Locate a hole on top of the verge where you can install a nail through it. Center a roofing nail into the hole and use a hammer to drive it into the batten. Carefully strike the head of the nail until it’s fully inserted. Add additional nails to the remaining holes so the verge is held tight against the batten. [7] X Research source You can purchase roofing nails at hardware stores, home improvements stores, and online."

Fit the verge piece onto the starter verge so flush against it and there isn’t any space between the 2 pieces. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Slide the verge upwards to interlock it with the starter verge. With the verge piece positioned against the starter verge, slide it upwards. The verge piece will interlock with the starter verge to connect the 2 pieces without any gaps between them to form a seal.

Take a roofing nail and center it inside the hole. Use a hammer to carefully strike the head of the nail and drive it into the batten to secure the verge piece to it.

Then, hammer a nail into the hole that’s flat against the batten. Continue adding verge pieces in this fashion until you reach the apex or the top of the roof. [11] X Research source Each verge piece will fit into the piece below it. Do not fit a verge piece that overlaps the apex or the top of the roof."

Install the starter verge and interlock the verge pieces until you reach the apex of the roof. [12] X Research source Be sure to fit the starter insert into the starter verge piece. The 2 starter verges must be even in order for the dry verge to line up properly."

The point of the top of the roof will run between them to form a ridge. Take a ridge end cap and set it on top of the ridge to fill in the space between the last 2 verge pieces.
