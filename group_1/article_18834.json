Find people that are posting pictures that interest you, and follow their accounts. This will let you see their latest photos on your feed. [1] X Research source Do a quick search for relevant hashtags on Instagram to find a list of photos and accounts that are similar to what you post. For example, if you post lots of travel pictures, then search for something like #instatravel. Don't just follow everyone you see, or your feed will become too overloaded to process. Limit yourself to following only those accounts that you find most interesting. It's more likely people will follow you if you have the exact same amount (or less) of followers and following. If you're following too many people, people might mistake you as a new Instagrammer or a bot and be less likely to follow you. Instagram limits you to following about 120 people per hour. Follow Shoutout accounts on Instagram to gain more followers, they usually give a shoutout to your account if you follow them or like one of their photos. You can also look into other ways to get shoutouts."

You can use hashtags to hop on popular trends, join conversations, and show your support (or disdain) for trending topics. When you use the right hashtags for your niche, people searching for those tags will be able to see your content in the search results. [2] X Research source Try to limit the number of hashtags to 3 to 5 at the most. If you have too many hashtags, your followers will feel like your images are too spammy. Hide the hashtags by using them within the caption sentence e.g. \"I really #love this #girl\" or place them right at the bottom of the caption. You can find relevant tags using websites such as All Hashtag , Hashtagify , or HashtagStack ."

Everything you type in your bio is searchable on Instagram, so be sure to use any keywords you think potential followers might be searching for. Your bio is another good section to place a call to action. Mention your 'Following Guidelines' in your Instagram bio. Here's an example: \"I am a mega-fan of Katy Perry!\". There will always be a lot of people with the same interests as you and then you'll probably get a whole heap of Katy Perry lovers following you. You might even be lucky enough to get the real Katy following you. Make sure your username is something close to what you represent.
