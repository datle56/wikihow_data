      "content": "Remove as much of the spilled ketchup as possible. Use a napkin or absorbent paper towel to blot up the ketchup. You can also scrape the ketchup off with a spoon or the back of a butter knife if you have one handy. The easiest way to get rid of a ketchup stain is to treat it immediately. As soon as you notice the spill, wipe up all the excess ketchup that you can without spreading it over unstained areas of your clothes. [1] X Research source Don't rub the spill because this can push the ketchup farther into the fibers of the clothes."

      "content": "Saturate the stained area with water. As soon as possible, turn the article of clothing inside out and flush it out with cold water. You want the water to run over the stain from back to front so that you don't push the ketchup deeper into the fabric. If you aren’t in a place where you can take off the article of clothing, saturate the stained area as much as possible while you’re still wearing the clothes. If you can’t get to a bathroom and running water, dip a napkin into a glass of water and blot it onto the stained area."

      "content": "Apply an on-the-go stain remover instead of water. If you’re carrying a stain remover pen in your pocket or purse, you can use it in place of water once you’ve wiped the excess ketchup off your clothes. Remove the cap and press the tip of the pen onto the stain to release the stain remover. Test the stain remover on a small, hidden part of your clothes first to make sure it won’t discolor your fabric. It doesn’t contain bleach, so it is safe to use on most colorfast, machine washable fabrics and dry-cleanable fabrics."

Repeat the process of pressing and rubbing the fabric with the pen as needed until the stain lightens or disappears.

Lemon juice can bleach colored clothing. Do a small spot test on an inconspicuous piece of fabric before using a bleaching agent. [7] X Research source"
