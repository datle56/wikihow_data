      "content": "Dreaming about crying often indicates suppressed emotions. According to Sigmund Freud, dreams are a symbolic representation of our unconscious thoughts and desires, so crying dreams may directly relate to your emotional state in waking life. [1] X Research source Crying in a dream can be an outlet to release pent-up emotions, such as stress, anger, guilt, or anything else you’ve kept locked inside. [2] X Research source For instance, someone who has been struggling with loneliness or sadness might have a dream where they are crying uncontrollably. In this scenario, crying allows them to let go of these bottled-up emotions. Or, someone who feels stressed at work may have a crying dream to release any fears, worries, and anxieties in their professional life."

      "content": "Crying in a dream may indicate that you have unresolved trauma. Dreams tell you things your conscious mind doesn’t want to pick up on, so crying dreams can be a way to work through emotions that are too difficult to address in waking life.

[3] X Research source For example, someone who has recently lost a loved one might have difficulty expressing their grief in real life, but they could find themselves crying in their dream to cope with their loss and eventually come to terms with it. If you’re struggling with a traumatic event, remember that you don’t have to heal alone! Get support from a trusted friend, family member, or therapist, and talk to them about your emotions and experiences.

      "content": "Dreams of crying might be a sign to heal your inner child. Your inner child is often described as the direct representation of yourself in your younger years. If you have unresolved emotional issues from childhood, you might dream of crying as an adult because you never healed from certain situations or got closure. In this case, crying dreams are a reminder to address past wounds so you can achieve emotional stability. [5] X Research source First, identify and accept the things that caused you pain in childhood, and try to connect your feelings to specific experiences. For instance, you might have issues with feeling abandoned or insecure as an adult because your parents often canceled plans because of their work. [6] X Research source Once you address these past wounds, nurture your inner child by validating your feelings and allowing yourself to be playful. Give yourself things that you missed out on as a child, such as throwing yourself the birthday party of your dreams or buying yourself a toy you always wanted."
