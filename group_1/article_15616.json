To prevent this from happening, don’t let your pet inside after being sprayed, or get your pet outside as quickly as possible. In inclement weather, keep your pet in a garage if possible, or confined to a single room in the house. A bathroom is a good choice, because that way you can bathe your pet in the shower."

In a medium bucket, combine the hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and liquid dish detergent. Mix the ingredients gently to combine everything, but not so vigorously that you agitate the solution. You can use white vinegar in place of the hydrogen peroxide if necessary, but it’s not as effective at eliminating the odor. Despite its popularity, tomato juice isn't very effective at removing skunk smell. Similarly, air fresheners and other products will likely only cover the smell temporarily, but won’t actually get rid of it.
