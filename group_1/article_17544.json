If you can’t quite tell, use your finger to follow the short lace through each eyelet until you get down to the bottom of the shoe.

Loosen your shoelace further up if you can’t pull it out at all. Create enough slack to match the discrepancy between the laces at the top. [4] X Research source In other words, if your laces are off by 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) at the top, create 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of slack in the bottom eyelets."

Then, keep pulling the short half of the lace up towards the top of the shoe to make it longer. Once you get to the top, your laces will now be even! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Re-lace your shoes by working up the eyelets one at a time. Now it’s time to finish lacing your shoes. You can do a traditional lace by running each lace to the next eyelet on the opposite side, or use some other pattern to lace your shoes. However you’re doing it, be sure to alternate between each side as you lace your shoe. This way, you’ll ensure that each side stays even and equal as you work your way up. [9] X Research source You can go for the straight lace by running the shoelace through the eyelets on the same side and pulling them straight across. Skip one eyelet on either side to set the laces on different eyelets and alternate between skipping on each side until the laces are at the top. You can make a triple X lace by skipping a row of eyelets. Then, pull each side of the shoelace through the eyelet under it before repeating the process. Keep doing this until you have three X shapes in the middle of your shoe. To add lattice laces, pull the shoelace through the bottom eyelet. Then, pull each side through the eyelets directly above it on the same side. Skip 3 holes and pull the shoelaces across the center of the shoe. Then, pull each side through the hole above it and pull it diagonally down to the other side. Repeat this process until you fill the 3 holes you skipped and end with the straight laces at the top."
