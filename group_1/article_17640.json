Go into the keyboard settings on your computer and increase the repeat delay by 1 notch to see if it fixes your problem. If your keyboard still detects multiple keystrokes, continue to increase the repeat delay. [1] X Research source On a Windows computer, you can access the keyboard settings in the Control Panel.
