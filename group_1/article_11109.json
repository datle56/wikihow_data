Let a fever run as long as possible without too much discomfort. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Fever is most often a symptom of an infection but can also be caused by inflammatory conditions, thyroid disease, cancer, vaccines and some drugs. Temperature is regulated by a small gland located in the center of the brain, the hypothalamus. The thyroid gland also plays a role in body temperature. Body temperature can vary throughout the day, but a normal temperature is considered 98.6 degrees F or 37 degrees C. During an infection, the infecting agent (bacteria, virus) produce temperature-increasing substances called pyrogens. Some pyrogens are also induced by the immune system. These pyrogens tell the hypothalamus to increase body temperature. This in turn, stimulates the immune system to be more effective at fighting off an infection. Higher body temperature is believed to kill off infectious agents as well. [5] X Research source Thomas A.

      "content": "Wear wet socks. This treatment is a traditional naturopathic approach. The theory is that cold feet stimulate an increase in circulation and an increased response from the immune system. The result is that the body expends heat and ends up drying the socks and cooling the body. This treatment can relieve chest congestion as well. The wool socks, by the way, serve as insulation. This method works best overnight. Use a pair of cotton socks long enough to cover the ankles. They should be pure cotton because cotton absorbs a lot of water. Thoroughly wet the socks in cold running tap water. Wring out all excess water and put the socks on. Cover these cotton socks with wool socks. The wool socks should be pure wool because this supplies excellent insulation. The person wearing the socks should be covered with a blanket and rest in bed for the rest of the night. Most kids will be pretty cooperative because they should begin to feel cooler within a few short minutes."

That is, use the towel around your head and your ankles OR around your neck and your wrists. Otherwise, you may cool down TOO much. The cool or cold towels draw heat out of the body and can lower the body temperature. Repeat when the towel is dry or not cool enough anymore to give relief. This can be repeated as often as needed."

In a baby, look for dry lips or crustiness around the lips/eyes. Also look for “lip-smacking” behavior. More sleepiness, fussiness or tiredness than usual. Thirst: This is hard to tell in a small infant, but the “lip smacking” behavior or pursing her lips as if she is feeding may be a clue. Decreased urine output: Check an infant’s diapers. They should need to be changed at least every three hours. If the diaper is dry after 3 hours, this may indicate some dehydration. Keep pushing fluids and check after another hour. If the diaper is still dry, call your physician. Check the color of urine. The darker the urine, the more dehydrated the baby or child may be. Constipation: Check for bowel movements as well, especially when you’re checking the diaper for urine. Few or no tears when crying Dry skin: Gently pinch the back of the baby’s hand, just pinching the loose skin. Well-hydrated babies have skin that bounces right back. Dizziness or lightheadedness"

Reduce the vitamin D3 dose slowly over the next few days to 5000 IU daily.

The main ingredient in coconut oil is lauric acid, a medium chain saturated fatty acid. It inserts itself into the viral outer membrane and causes a rupture and death of the influenza virus without harming the human host of the virus. Take one to two tablespoons of coconut oil three times per day. Mix it in warm orange juice or take it with a meal. Usually within one to two days, the virus will be eliminated. Symptoms often disappear within one day, when normally it would have taken five to seven days to recover from a flu, [16] X Research source Bruce Fife, C.N., N.D: “The Coconut Oil Miracle”, 5th edition, Penguin Group, 2013, New York, New York 10014; page 70-77."
