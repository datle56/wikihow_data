      "content": "Choose an irrigation device. There are many different kinds of nasal irrigation devices on the market today. These devices are available at most pharmacies, naturopathic stores, and online. They range in size, shape, and longevity (some are disposable), but each essentially serves the same purpose: to flush out your sinuses. Common irrigation devices include: [3] X Research source Neti pots Bulb syringe Squeeze bottle"

      "title": "Use safe water.",
      "content": "Use safe water. Most homes with indoor plumbing have tap water that is safe to drink. However, some sources of tap water contain low levels of microorganisms like bacteria, amoeba, and other protozoa. While these organisms are typically safe to drink, as stomach acid kills them on contact, they should not be used on thin membranes like the inside of the sinus. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Unsafe tap water used for nasal irrigation can lead to bacterial infections and amoebic meningitis, a severe condition that is usually fatal. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Distilled or sterile water is ideal. These can be purchased in most stores, and should specifically say \"distilled\" or \"sterile\" on the label. [6] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source You can create sterile water at home. Boil tap water for three to five minutes, then cool until it is lukewarm. Do not use hot water, as this can cause serious and painful burns. Water that has passed through a filter with an absolute pore size of less than or equal to one micron is safe to use. These filters are small enough that they can trap microorganisms, rendering the tap water safe to use. You can buy these tap filters at many hardware stores or online.Find out more about these filters at the Center for Disease Control website ."

      "title": "Buy or make a saline solution.",
      "content": "Buy or make a saline solution. You can purchase over-the-counter saline solutions designed for nasal irrigation at most drug stores and pharmacies. However, you can just as easily make your own saline solution at home. Measure three teaspoons of salt. You should only use kosher, canning, or pickling salt. Do not use salt with iodine, anti-caking agents, or preservatives, as these can irritate the nasal and sinus cavities. In a clean bowl or container, mix the salt with one teaspoon of baking soda. [7] X Research source Add 8 ounces (1 cup) of lukewarm water that is either distilled, sterile, boiled and cooled, or properly filtered. Stir until the salt and baking soda are dissolved in the water. Use this mixture to fill your irrigation device. [8] X Research source Make sure you are using a sterile instrument to stir the mixture."

This will help prevent bacteria and other germs from contaminating your irrigation device and potentially entering your sinus cavity. [9] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Wash your hands with soap and warm water before handling or using your irrigation device. Dry your hands with a clean, disposable paper towel. [10] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Wash the irrigation device using distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled tap water to ensure that the device does not become contaminated while washing.

      "content": "Get into position. Once you've drawn water into your irrigation device, you'll need to get in place. Lean over a sink to avoid spilling water everywhere (especially water that has been through your sinus). Tilt your head sideways over the sink. [12] X Research source Some experts recommend tilting your head at a 45-degree angle to facilitate the best flow of water without any getting into your mouth. [13] X Research source When you're ready, press the spout of your irrigation device gently into the nostril that is closer to the ceiling (the \"upper\" nostril, when your head is tilted). Do not shove the spout deep inside the nose or against the septum, as this may cause discomfort or injury. [14] X Research source"

Proceed slowly and carefully, especially if this is your first time irrigating your sinuses. Breathe through your mouth. Do not under any circumstances attempt to breathe through your nose, as this may cause water to go into your lungs and could present a choking hazard. [15] X Research source Slowly raise the handle of your irrigation device. If you are using a syringe bulb, you may now begin to gently squeeze the saline solution out. If you are using a neti pot, simply let the water pour slowly into the nostril."
