      "title": "Clean your chanterelle mushrooms before cooking them.",
      "content": "Clean your chanterelle mushrooms before cooking them. In general, mushrooms don’t like water and you should try to not use water when cleaning them. Instead, you can use a dry cloth or a soft brush to scrub away the dirt. If this doesn’t work, place them into a colander under a running faucet. Shake the colander to help remove the stuck-on dirt. Once clean, place the mushrooms on a towel or mesh rack and leave them to dry for 24 hours. [1] X Research source You can also use a paper towel to wipe off any dust or crumbs. If you need to rinse your mushrooms in water, use whatever temperature is comfortable. Use your hands to help wash the dirt off the mushrooms while they’re under the faucet."

      "content": "Freeze fresh mushrooms in a block of ice. Chop your fresh chanterelle mushrooms into smaller, bite-sized pieces, then put the chopped mushrooms into a plastic freezer bag. Fill the bag with water in order to completely cover all the mushrooms inside. Close the bag and remove as much air as possible. Put the bag of mushrooms in the freezer and allow the water to freeze into a block of ice. [2] X Research source When you want to use the mushrooms, you will need to completely thaw the block of ice. If you don’t plan to use all the mushrooms at the same time, freeze them in small batches."

      "title": "Sauté your mushrooms in oil or butter before freezing to make them easy to use later.",
      "content": "Sauté your mushrooms in oil or butter before freezing to make them easy to use later. Chop your chanterelle mushrooms into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Put 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of cooking oil or butter into a frying pan on medium-high heat. Add the chopped mushrooms to the frying pan once the oil or butter has heated up. Fry the mushrooms until all the water they release has been completely evaporated. Reduce the heat and stir a sprinkle of salt into the mushrooms. [3] X Research source Feel free to use any type of cooking oil you want with your mushrooms. Also, feel free to add herbs and spices or onions to season the mushrooms before freezing them. Sautéing your mushrooms in butter or oil before storing them in the freezer makes it super easy to thaw those flavoured mushrooms when you’re ready to use them and put them directly into the dish you’re making."

      "title": "Fry your mushrooms in a dry pan before freezing them to remove the moisture.",
      "content": "Fry your mushrooms in a dry pan before freezing them to remove the moisture. Chop your chanterelle mushrooms into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Place a frying pan on the stove on medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, put the mushrooms in the frying pan and stir in a sprinkle of salt. Allow the mushrooms to cook until all the water is evaporated. [4] X Research source The water produced comes from the mushrooms themselves. You want all the water removed from the mushrooms before freezing them, or that moisture will damage the mushrooms and change their flavour. Frying mushrooms in a dry frying pan ensures they have all moisture removed before freezing, so the cold won’t damage them. It also keeps the mushrooms unflavoured so they can be added to any recipe you want to make when you thaw them out."

      "title": "Allow the mushrooms to cool before putting them in freezer bags.",
      "content": "Allow the mushrooms to cool before putting them in freezer bags. Remove the mushrooms from the frying pan and place them on a towel or a mesh cooling rack. Leave the mushrooms to completely cool (use your fingers to test if they’re still warm). Move the mushrooms into 1 or more freezer bags. Seal the bag closed and remove as much air as possible. Put the bag of mushrooms in the freezer. Alternatively, you can also freeze the mushrooms inside a freezer-safe storage container. Divide the mushrooms into smaller batches and put into separate freezer bags if you prefer. Your chanterelle mushrooms will last up to 6 months in the freezer."

      "title": "Wash your chanterelle mushrooms before blanching or steaming them.",
      "content": "Wash your chanterelle mushrooms before blanching or steaming them. To wash your mushrooms, first, try to simply wipe the dirt off with a dry cloth or soft brush. If this method doesn’t remove enough of the first, rinse them in water while also rubbing off the dirt. There’s no need to wait until your mushrooms are dry before blanching or steaming them. [5] X Research source If you need to rinse your mushrooms in water, use whatever temperature is comfortable. If you’re blanching your mushrooms, don’t worry if not all the dirt has been removed. The blanching process will also help to remove any leftover dirt."

      "title": "Blanch your mushrooms before freezing them to preserve the flavor.",
      "content": "Blanch your mushrooms before freezing them to preserve the flavor. Boil a large pot of water on the stove. Chop your chanterelle mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Place the chopped mushrooms into the water and wait for the water to start boiling again. Leave the mushrooms in boiling water for 1-2 minutes. [6] X Research source In general, use 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of mushrooms. Blanch your mushrooms in multiple batches if you don’t have a pot large enough for all of them at once. Putting your mushrooms in boiling water for a short time stops enzymes from within the mushroom from causing a loss of flavour, colour, and texture while the mushroom is frozen."

      "title": "Steam your mushrooms before putting them in the freezer to preserve their texture.",
      "content": "Steam your mushrooms before putting them in the freezer to preserve their texture. Chop your chanterelle mushrooms into smaller pieces or divide the mushrooms into batches by size. Place the mushrooms in a bowl that contains 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of lemon juice for every 1 US pint (470 mL) of water for 5 minutes. Take the mushrooms out of the bowl and put them into a steamer basket. Place the basket over top of boiling water in a large pot on the stove. Put the lid on the pot and allow the mushrooms to steam for 3-5 minutes. [7] X Research source The amount of time required will depend upon the size of the mushroom pieces. The larger the pieces, the longer they’ll need to stay in the pot to steam. Steaming your mushrooms has a similar effect to blanching, except that your mushrooms never come into contact with water. It does, however, take longer to steam a veggie than it does to blanch one."

This will immediately stop the mushrooms from cooking. Remove the mushrooms from the ice-cold water once they’re cool and put them on a mesh drying rack or towel to completely dry. [8] X Research source Test the coolness of the mushrooms with your hands. Once you don’t feel any heat coming from the mushrooms, you can take them out of the water to dry."

Divide them into smaller batches so you only have to thaw enough mushrooms for one recipe at a time. Seal the bags or containers and remove as much air as possible, then store them in the freezer.
