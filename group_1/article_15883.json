      "title": "Don't eat it plain.",
      "content": "Don't eat it plain. Although it may be common practice when trying a condiment to taste just a bit on your finger or on a spoon, doing so with Vegemite will likely result in you never wanting to eat it again. Vegemite is meant to be used as a condiment or a seasoning, not as a stand-alone food. This is part of why it has such a strong taste, because it's meant to add flavor to other foods."

    {
      "title": "Use it sparingly.",
      "content": "Use it sparingly. This is the most important thing to remember. Vegemite has a strong taste and it can be pretty unpalatable at first. To enjoy your first taste or to acquire the taste over time, be sure to start off with a toasted bread that has a nice serve of butter and very small amount of vegemite (about the size of a pea to begin with). Because it is so strong, a little bit will go a long way in adding taste. If you overdo it when first trying it out, you may cause yourself to not want to try it again. [1] X Research source Vegemite is like any other seasoning or condiment, too much of it will overpower the food you're putting it on and probably ruin it. Go with just a little at first and then add slowly if you feel your food needs more."

      "title": "Experiment with it.",
      "content": "Experiment with it. If you begin to enjoy the taste or you want to enjoy it more, don't be afraid to try adding it to dishes that you already like. Think of it as any other seasoning and experiment with using it. The worst that can happen is you find out it isn't good on certain things, but if you are lucky you might stumble upon a great combination that you wouldn't have thought of before. Still remember the rule of using it sparingly. Don't add a big spoonful to the pot of stew you cooked for the family dinner because if it is too much or doesn't add the right flavor, you'll be out of luck."

      "title": "Pair Vegemite with salty foods.",
      "content": "Pair Vegemite with salty foods. Vegemite is salty and savory, so it pairs best with other salty foods. Don't mix it with something sweet. It mixes well with beef and chicken dishes."

      "title": "Spread lightly on buttered toast.",
      "content": "Spread lightly on buttered toast. If you often eat toast for breakfast but you get tired of the blandness of butter alone, or you want a salty alternative to jam, Vegemite is a great alternative. It complements the blandness of butter very well while adding a rich, salty taste."

      "content": "Make cheese and Vegemite sandwiches. This is another Australian favorite that is great for packing in lunch or adding as a side to your dinner. Spread a thin layer of Vegemite on your bread and lay a slice of your favorite cheese on top of that. Cheddar cheese pairs well. Cream cheese and Parmesan are both good options too. You can also make a grilled cheese in this same way. Be sure to butter the outside of the bread before grilling. Add variation to the sandwich by adding slices of tomato and avocado."
