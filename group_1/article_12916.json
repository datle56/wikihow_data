      "content": "Methodists baptize infants and Baptists don’t. Methodists allow the baptism of adults, youths, and infants. Baptists, however, reject infant baptism because they believe that baptism is only for individuals who can truly understand their faith and personally declare Jesus as Lord. [1] X Research source This is also one of the biggest differences between Baptism and other Christian denominations."

      "title": "Baptists only do immersion and Methodists use other baptism methods.",
      "content": "Baptists only do immersion and Methodists use other baptism methods. This means the Baptist minister lies the person back in the water so they’re totally immersed, then brings them back up again. [2] X Research source Methodists, however, accept sprinkling, pouring, and immersion as a sign of regeneration or new birth. [3] X Research source Baptists believe that total immersion aligns with New Testament baptism as carried out by John the Baptist. Methodists believe that the method of baptism doesn’t matter—what matters is that you were baptized in water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by an authorized person."

      "content": "Methodists let all join communion and Baptists only allow Baptists. The Methodist church believes in “open communion,” which means that all baptized Christians of any age or denomination are welcome to join the Lord’s table. [4] X Research source Meanwhile, Baptists typically restrict communion to only baptized Baptist church members. [5] X Research source Baptists practice “closed communion” because they believe that only people who are saved, properly baptized (immersed in water), and members of the local Baptist church can sit at the Lord’s table.

      "title": "Methodists have a hierarchy while Baptists have independent churches.",
      "content": "Methodists have a hierarchy while Baptists have independent churches. Each local Methodist church has a Church Council that works with the minister, but the entire denomination has groups of leaders who act and make decisions for all the churches. [7] X Research source Meanwhile, every baptist congregation is self-governing and doesn’t have a hierarchy of bishops or priests. [8] X Research source The umbrella organization for all Methodist churches is the World Methodist Council, which meets every 5 years in different locations around the world. In the U.K., most Baptist churches belong to the Baptist Union. This isn’t an authoritative organization, but instead, it’s a central resource that assists churches."

      "content": "Methodist bishops assign pastors while Baptists choose pastors. Unlike Methodist churches, Baptist churches have no hierarchy of bishops or priests that exercise authority over members. [9] X Research source Instead, church members meet to appoint ministers, elders, deacons, pastors, and other leaders. [10] X Research source Methodists don’t have a central headquarters or a leader of the entire faith. Instead, leadership is divided between three powers that work together: the General Conference, the Council of Bishops, and the Judicial Council. [11] X Research source This means that each bishop is elected by the other clergy leaders. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Baptists believe salvation is only through faith and Methodists don’t. Baptists believe that you can be saved through faith in God’s grace and the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. [13] X Research source Methodists, on the other hand, believe that salvation is a lifelong process. Baptism, good works, church membership, and communion are all part of that process. [14] X Research source Methodists don’t believe that God predestines some people to salvation and others to condemnation. [15] X Research source Baptists tend to not take a stance on predestination. Baptists believe that baptism, church membership, communion, and good works are important, but are not necessary for salvation."

Like Baptists, Methodists believe there is one true God who reveals Himself as the Holy Trinity: the Father (God), the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. [16] X Research source As Christian denominations, both also affirm belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. However, Baptists might disagree on whether the physical body of Jesus Christ or the spiritual body was resurrected (this divide is called the fundamentalist-modernist controversy).

The Protestant Reformation was a religious revolution that happened in the 16th century, when the Church of England broke away from the Catholic church, creating other Christian branches in the process. [23] X Research source The Baptist church was strongly inspired by Calvinism, which was created by John Calvin, a leading Protestant reformer. [24] X Research source The founders of Methodism shared the spirit of Protestant reformers, and some of the Methodist movement came out of Calvinistic ideals. [25] X Research source"

Most historians think that the first Baptist congregation appeared in 1609 in Holland, where the Church of England minister, John Smyth, scandalously baptized himself and other church members. [26] X Research source Church of England minister John Wesley created Methodist clubs starting in 1839.

Baptism founder John Smyth and reformer Thomas Helwys joined a group of separatists in England in 1606 and came up with the 3 core beliefs that later shaped the Baptist church. [30] X Research source The Bible, not church tradition, was the guide for faith and practice. The church should only be made up of believers, not everyone who was born in the local parish. The church should be governed by believers, not by hierarchical figures like bishops."

These 4 core beliefs are sometimes known as the “4 alls.” [31] X Research source All need to be saved (doctrine of original sin). All can be saved (Universal Salvation). All can know they are saved (Assurance). All can be saved completely (Christian perfection)."
