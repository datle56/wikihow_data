      "content": "Use a cool compress. Applying a cool compress to your face may help to relieve itching and help to soothe your rash. To use a cool compress, hold a clean cotton washcloth under cold running water until it is saturated. Then, wring out the washcloth and place the cloth over your face. If the rash is in one area, you can fold the washcloth and apply it to that area. Repeat this process as needed throughout the day. Do not allow anyone else to use the washcloth just in case your rash is contagious. Heat can make a rash worse and increase irritation â€” stick to cool water, decreasing inflammation."
