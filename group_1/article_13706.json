      "content": "Sit on the floor and press your feet together. Find a comfortable place where you can sit and work out, like a yoga mat or padded gym floor. Press the soles of your feet together, keeping your knees bent to the sides, like butterfly wings. [2] X Research source With traditional sit-ups or crunches, your feet are usually planted on the ground to start. With butterfly sit-ups, your feet are pressed together at the soles. Your heels will be at least 1 ft (12 in) or so in front of your hips. If you're not able to press your feet together quite yet, practice stretching and opening up your hips every day so you become more flexible. The more flexible you are, the easier the exercise will be. [3] X Expert Source Souad Gharib Exercise & Wellness Specialist Expert Interview. 8 July 2021."

Roll up a gym towel and set it directly behind you, so your lower back stays supported during the exercise. [4] X Research source Any type of pad works for this, as long as it cushions your back in the process."

Then, lie back down with your arms extended above your head. [10] X Research source The exercise is a little more challenging when you keep your arms straight. [11] X Research source"
