      "content": "Abdominal Bracing Lay on your back and rest your calves on a raised surface (like a chair or coffee table). Cross your arms over your chest. Attempt to lift your shoulders off the floor, but don't perform a crunch. When your abdominals engage, maintain this engagement and breathe. Relax after a few breaths, then repeat. [1] X Research source Variation: For a variation that’s easier on your back and stomach, hold your arms in front of you instead of crossing them over your chest. How does this exercise help? Abdominal braces target and strengthen your rectus abdominis, which is one of the largest muscles in your core."

Engage your deep core and abdominal muscles and lift your butt off the floor to reach the bridge position. As you lift into a bridge , be sure to maintain the natural curve of your lower spine rather than arching your back in order to force your belly up. Once you’re in bridge, lift your left foot and extend your left leg to create a straight line through your left heel. Return your foot to its original position and repeat with the right leg.
