      "content": "Cage traps catch the rodent alive. When the mouse or rat steps on the baited pan located inside the trap, the mechanism is tripped and the door closes. This traps the rodent without killing it. Place cage traps parallel to walls, so the rodent runs into them. [1] X Research source Look for places with droppings and gnaw marks, or place traps in dark corners and behind furniture. For fast results, set a dozen or more traps. If no rodents are caught within three days, remove the traps for a couple days, then set them again in a new position a short distance away. When an animal is caught, handle the trap with rubber or disposable gloves and disinfect it afterward to prevent disease. If releasing outdoors, be aware that rodents can travel more than half a mile (0.8km) to return home. [2] X Research source Indoor mice will likely not survive outdoors.

[4] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source When the rodent attempts to take the bait, the mechanism snaps onto the neck to kill it. Traps with a larger trigger area are more effective. If you are using a classic mousetrap with only a small metal plate for the bait, attach a 2\" (5cm) square of cardboard over the plate before setting the trap. [5] X Research source Place snap traps at a right angle to the wall, with the trigger end against the wall. [6] X Research source Dark corners and areas behind furniture work well. Glue traps are not recommended as they are inhumane options, killing mice slowly and cruelly. They are not effective against rats. [7] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source To reduce risk of disease, spray disinfectant on used traps and dead animals before handling. Wear rubber or disposable gloves while disposing of the animal in a plastic bag. Wooden traps are not safe to reuse."

      "content": "Poison is mostly useful for farms, not homes. A poisoned rodent often ends up dying within your walls or in other inconvenient locations where they are difficult to clean up. Poison is also not safe for areas with children, pets, or livestock. Consider poisons only for grain storage areas and other places that require constant protection: Some rodenticides take several days or even a couple weeks of feeding to kill the animal. Newer anticoagulants like brodifacoum or difethalone can work in a single dose and are somewhat less dangerous to humans and pets. [10] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Packets of poison can be left intact for the rodents to gnaw through. Liquid baits containing a little sugar work especially well in dry weather and for rats. [11] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Place the poison and the bait in a covered box big enough for several rodents, but not accessible to other animals or children. These work best with a hole on opposite ends, about 2½\" wide (~6cm) for rats or 1½\" (~3.5cm) for mice.

      "content": "Make the area less rodent-friendly. Minimizing sources of food, water, and shelter can be extremely effective for rodent control. Clean your kitchen frequently and keep food stored in sealed containers when possible. Food storage high above the ground is less accessible to rodents. [13] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Rodent Control Specialist Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. Cover all trash cans with tight-fitting lids. Clear up any piles of junk, brush, or other materials in your yard that offer shelter to rodents. Empty or cover sources of water in your yard (especially for rats, which drink more water than mice)."

      "content": "Repellent materials discourage rodents, but rarely solve the problem. There are quite a few home remedies for keeping mice and rats out of your home. Unfortunately, once a rodent is inside, it's not likely to move out into the cold or stop taking your food just because of a bad smell. But if you make cleaning and food storage your top priority, these secondary approaches might help convince your whiskered enemies to move on: Essential oils of eucalyptus, peppermint, lemongrass, basil, and thyme have all been used as rodent repellent. [14] X Research source Try putting drops of the oil onto cotton balls and placing them strategically at openings where rodents are coming in. Steel wool is great for blocking rodent holes, as mice and rats will rarely chew through it. Try to wedge it in enough that it can't be pushed out of the way. Aluminum foil often shows up on blogs as an anti-rodent \"life hack,\" but this is at best a mild deterrent; rats will sometimes even take the foil to insulate their nests. [15] X Research source Covering your fruit bowl might not be a bad idea, but papering every kitchen surface in foil might annoy you more than the rats. Some people lay out scented dryer sheets hoping the fragrance will deter rodents, but there is no real evidence showing that this works. Try it if convenient, but don't bother buying any just for this purpose."

Dryer vents should not be covered this way, as the mesh will reduce air flow and increase fire risk. Instead, install a cover with a \"floating ball check valve\" that blocks the hole while the dryer is off. Seal all cracks where pipes, vents, and electrical conduits enter your walls with caulk. You can stop rodents climbing the outside of drain pipes with a 12\" (30 cm) tall piece of metal flashing over the pipe, or a cone-shaped guard of the same height.
