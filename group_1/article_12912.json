Factoring in a few minutes for breakfast, though, can kickstart your metabolism and keep you from getting hungry throughout the day, especially if you get some protein and fiber in it. Set your alarm clock five minutes earlier and try these tasty breakfast options: [1] X Expert Source Pouya Shafipour, MD, MS Board Certified Family Medicine Specialist Expert Interview. 24 April 2020.
