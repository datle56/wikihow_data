Giving a client, colleague, or potential employer an unusual answer makes you stand out. Ask yourself these questions to come up with a great professional fun fact to give others insight into what makes you you . What professional accomplishment are you proudest of? What job did you want when you were 10 years old? What was the first job you ever had? What’s your favorite app to use at work? What’s the most embarrassing thing you’ve ever done at work? What’s your favorite corporate buzzword? What is your latest passion project? Is there anything non-traditional about your career path? What’s your #1 professional goal for the year?

      "content": "Go with unique answers that highlight your professional experience. When answering this question for a job interview or professional networking event, try to think of answers that give others an idea of your career. Focus on your professional background, goals, accomplishments, and experience. For example, say something like: I opened my first business when I was 10. It was a neighborhood dog-walking service. Now, I’m launching a tech startup that connects pet owners with verified pet sitters. About 5 years ago, I quit my corporate job to spend a year as an apprentice to a traditional Japanese woodworker. It completely transformed how I think about product design and craftsmanship. After college, I drove a food truck specializing in fusion tacos. That experience managing inventory and predicting daily sales sparked my interest in optimizing supply chains, which is now my specialty. I’m working toward my goal of opening a chain of cafes that double as community learning spaces. The idea was inspired by my experience teaching English to adult learners at a coffee shop in Columbia. I used to manage outdoor music festivals, which gave me a strong desire to understand weather patterns, which led me to earn a degree in meteorology, which is something I’m most proud of."

      "content": "Reveal a fun fact about your personal life or background. Think about your family and background. Are there any funny moments you can share without revealing uncomfortable details? Or maybe you love to volunteer at your local soup kitchen. If all else fails, talk about your pets, recommends dating coach and matchmaker Laura Bilotta. “Most people have a pet, and if they don’t, they usually like pets.” Then, you can reply by asking if they’re a cat or dog person. Or, ask if they have any pets of their own.” Use these questions to come up with an interesting fun fact. Do you have an irrational fear? Do you collect anything unusual? What TV show do you binge when you just want to relax? Have you ever run into a celebrity? Have you ever had an unusual pet? Have you ever won any contests? Do you have any poems, songs, or scenes from a movie memorized? If you could be any animal, what would it be? What was the first concert you ever went to? What song is your go-to for karaoke? How many houseplants do you own? What weird smell do you kind of like? Do you own any unusual clothing that you can’t seem to get rid of? Is there anything you do every week, no matter what happens? How many books do you own? What did your parents almost name you? Are you a “cat person” or a “dog person”?"

      "content": "Share “fun facts” that reveal something fun and memorable about you. Focus on abilities and experiences that are not only light-hearted and fun but also meaningful to you. Make sure you back up your “fun fact” with an explanation of why you chose it. Here are a few examples of personal “fun facts” to get you started. I have an irrational fear of automatic car washes. Being trapped in the dark while giant brushes swing over and around my car reminds me of “The Pit and the Pendulum,” and I break out into a cold sweat. I rewatch the Great British Bake Off when I need to decompress. There’s something so soothing about watching people stress out about making the perfect pavlova while being relentlessly kind and polite. I don’t even know what a pavlova is. My go-to karaoke song is “Mr. Roboto.” I choreographed a dance routine for the entire song when I was 11. I used to make my brothers perform it every time the song played. I still use that choreography. I once ran into Morgan Freeman in a bookstore in Chicago. I was blocking an aisle, and he said, “Excuse me,” in his Morgan Freeman voice. I was so surprised I dropped my coffee all over his shoes. I was horrified and started apologizing. He just laughed. When I walked to the front of the store, the barista had another coffee waiting for me, courtesy of Morgan Freeman. I can recite the “What a piece of work is man” monologue from Hamlet . Not because I’m a Shakespeare scholar, but because I was a musical theater nerd who listened to the Original Cast Recording of Hair constantly."

Whether you’ve traveled to the wilds of Tanzania or taken a road trip to Branson, Missouri, a fun fact about your journey is always appreciated. Or, maybe you’ve been on an adventure you can’t wait to talk about. Try asking yourself a few of these questions to come up with an engaging travel-related fun fact. What is a place you’ve always wanted to go but haven’t yet? What’s the longest travel delay you’ve ever experienced? Is there a place you can’t believe people actually travel to? What destination has left a lasting impression on you? Can you speak more than one language? What’s the longest road trip you’ve ever taken? Have you ever visited one of the world’s wonders?

The best “fun facts” about travel often include a surprising twist, like getting lost and finding something truly wonderful or making a new friend in an unlikely place. Try to focus on memorable moments that changed your perspective in some way. I accidentally crashed a wedding in Morocco looking for a restaurant I saw on Instagram. I ended up being the unofficial wedding photographer and learning a few traditional Berber dance moves. I once got lost hiking in New Zealand and ended up being adopted by a family of sheep farmers. I was with them for three days. They taught me how to shear sheep, and now I can't wear wool without thinking about Bessie, my favorite ewe. My most prized possession is a key I found while snorkeling in Greece. The local dive master swore it matched the lock on a century-old shipwreck nearby. I think he was just pulling my leg, but it’s a good excuse to go back to Greece someday to check it out. While camping in Iceland, I got to see the Northern Lights for the first time. I was in so much awe that I fell backward into a hot spring. Thankfully, it was a shallow one, but my backpack still smells like sulfur. During a train ride in Japan, I helped a man translate his grandfather’s love letters into English. We still exchange New Year's cards, and he sends me some of his homemade umeboshi pickles every year."

When sharing a “fun fact” about your hobbies, try to combine your genuine enthusiasm with an unexpected or amusing reason you chose that hobby. Share how your interest has led to unique skills that most people don’t have or wouldn’t expect. I got so invested in birdwatching that I learned to perfectly imitate a barred owl's call. It sounds impressive, but it backfired spectacularly when I accidentally summoned twelve owls during a romantic moonlit walk on my first date with my now-spouse. When I first got into knitting, my obsession was so intense that I once turned my entire living room into a giant yarn maze while trying to untangle my stash. My cat still hasn't forgiven me for dismantling her personal amusement park. My passion for origami led me to fold 1,000 paper cranes for good luck, but I ran out of regular paper halfway through and had to use old receipts, candy wrappers, and even a parking ticket. I can now make a paper crane out of any piece of paper. I've gotten so into indoor gardening that I've developed a complex pulley system to rotate my 127 houseplants so they get the most sunlight. My house looks like a botanical Rube Goldberg machine. My love for stargazing got slightly out of hand when I converted my car's trunk into a mobile observatory. I'm now the person who turns every rural gas station stop into an impromptu astronomy lesson."

Share something about yourself that your friends or family would describe as “typically you.” Consider sharing odd talents, strange coincidences, or peculiar habits you didn’t even think were unusual until someone pointed them out. Here are a few examples to help you think of one of your own. I’ve kept a log of every day of my life for the past 15 years. It’s in a database, so I know that I get sick at roughly the same time every winter. I've developed such a specific preference for the perfect shower temperature that I can tell when it's off by half a degree. My roommates call me ‘The Water Whisperer’ and make me deal with our ancient water heater every time it acts up. When I’m nervous, I unconsciously alphabetize everything. My friends know I'm stressed when they find me reorganizing the condiments at restaurants or sorting the magazines in waiting rooms. I have an uncanny ability to find four-leaf clovers. It’s gotten to the point where I'm no longer allowed to participate in St. Patrick's Day clover hunts because it ‘ruins the fun for everyone else.’ I have a collection of rocks that look like famous people. My pride and joy is a pebble that looks exactly like Danny DeVito. People have offered me money for it, but I’ll never sell."

Focus on specific incidents or habits that give people a glimpse into your life while sparking their curiosity. I once got so obsessed with perfecting my sourdough starter that I named it Friedrich von Yeastoven and took it on vacation with me. It now has its own Instagram account with more followers than I do. I once tried to master eating with chopsticks by using them at every meal for a solid month. I even used them for soup, sandwiches, and pizza. I still reach for chopsticks every time I eat popcorn. My spice cabinet is organized like a color wheel, and I've developed such a precise sense of smell that my friends use me as a human expiration date detector for their questionable leftovers. I learned to cook by making every recipe in my great-grandmother's recipe box, but since half the instructions just say ‘add some’ or ‘cook until done,’ I had to make 17 versions of her apple cake before figuring out what ‘a reasonable amount of cinnamon’ means. I've maintained the same batch of kimchi for six years. It's outlasted three relationships and two jobs. My friends call it as ‘The Eternal Fermentation.’"

Here are a few answers to the “fun facts” for kids to help you know what types of answers to shoot for. Elephants are my favorite animal. I like to pretend to be an elephant so much that I figured out I can wiggle my ears without touching them. My favorite movie is Mary Poppins . I watched it 7 times when I had chicken pox and had to stay home. I can say ‘supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’ backwards. If I had a million dollars, I'd build a giant trampoline park in my backyard and make it free for everyone in my class. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero because he has a bedtime just like me, and his aunt packs his lunch. Plus, I've been practicing shooting webs with my silly string. I really want to meet Mary from 'Mary Has a Little Lamb' because I need to know if she got in trouble for bringing a sheep to school. My teacher won't even let me bring my hamster for show and tell."
