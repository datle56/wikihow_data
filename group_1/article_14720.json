      "content": "Embrace skinny jeans. Skinny jeans and cigarette pants were basically made for tall women. Not only are they often cut longer, they look fabulous on girls with long legs. Even if the skinnies are a little short, you can cuff them and make it look intentional. [1] X Research source Plus, it's an opportunity to show off your shoes. Avoid capri pants. They'll hit your calf at an odd spot and it will look like your pants shrunk in the dryer. Tall women can pull off flares or wide-legged styles, too. Just make sure your pants are the right length. Remember that you can always buy pants that are too long and then take them to a tailor for adjustments."

      "content": "Don't shy away from heels. The truth is, wearing flats isn't going to hide the fact that you're tall. If you want to wear heels, do it! A heel can elongate your legs, lift your butt, and actually make your feet look smaller. Don’t pay attention to anyone who says you should not wear heels because of your height. [2] X Research source Start out with a shorter kitten heel if you don't feel comfortable with full-on high heels. A tall woman in heels appears confident, proud, and sexy."

      "title": "Try maxi-waisted styles or a waist-cinching belt.",
      "content": "Try maxi-waisted styles or a waist-cinching belt. Create an hourglass figure and break up your length. This will help your body look proportional and shapely. [3] X Research source Tucking in your shirt can also give the same effect."

      "title": "Go for large, statement accessories.",
      "content": "Go for large, statement accessories. Large purses and totes can look overwhelming on smaller women, making it look like they're playing dress up. A tall girl can really work bigger accessories, so go for that oversize tote or that big, statement necklace. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Have fun with color and patterns.",
      "content": "Have fun with color and patterns. A tall frame is long enough to pull off patterns without being overwhelmed. Mix things up on your top and bottom half--so a patterned shirt with black pants, or different colored tops and bottoms--to break up your height. Be aware that dressing all in one color (monochromatic) can make you look longer."

      "title": "Pay attention to sleeve and hem length when shopping for shirts.",
      "content": "Pay attention to sleeve and hem length when shopping for shirts. Sleeves and hems that are too short can give your shirt that \"shrunken\" appearance. Unless it's a crop-top, look for shirts that at least hit you at the hip. Look for 3/4 length sleeves or create them by rolling up sleeves that are just a little too short. You might also try checking the men’s department. You may find shirts that fit you better and you can also go for a “boyfriend” shirt look."

      "title": "Wear almost any length dress or skirt, just beware the too-short hemline.",
      "content": "Wear almost any length dress or skirt, just beware the too-short hemline. A tall girl can rock a maxi dress like no other, or she can show off her killer legs something shorter. You probably don't want to be flashing your booty or underwear, however, so pay attention to skirts and dresses that are so short they don't cover the essentials. Remember a dress that is a flirty length on a shorter girl may look straight-up indecent on a taller girl [5] X Research source . A pencil skirt can make your legs look even longer, which is great if you have a long torso and shorter legs. Otherwise, pair a pencil skirt with a top in a contrasting color to keep your proportions balanced. The most flattering skirt length on many people is usually just above, even with, or just below the knee."

      "title": "Determine your proportions.",
      "content": "Determine your proportions. Your legs and upper-half may be equal in length, or you may have short legs with a long torso, or a shorter upper body with super long legs. This may affect how you shop and dress. Try taking your measurements or ask a friend to help you do so. Measure your waist, hips, bust, and the inseam of your pants from crotch to ankle."

    {
      "title": "Stand tall.",
      "content": "Stand tall. Some tall women tend to slouch or hunch their shoulders in an attempt to appear smaller. However, slouching may make you look insecure. Throw your shoulders back and stand up straight--imagine there is a string attached to the top of your head and it is gently pulling you up toward the ceiling."

      "title": "Know where to shop.",
      "content": "Know where to shop. Certain brands are known for catering to taller women. And with online shopping, you have even more options. Search for companies that focus exclusively on tall girls, and you'll have a much easier time finding clothes in your size."

    {
      "title": "Find a good tailor.",
      "content": "Find a good tailor. Since some of the clothes you find may not fit well off the rack, finding a good tailor is a great way to ensure that all your clothes fit you perfectly. Ask friends and family if they know a good tailor, or look for recommendations online. Take any ill-fitting items you have to your tailor for alterations. For example, if you have dress that is a bit too loose around the waist, take it to your tailor for a fitting. If you have a pair of pants that bunch up around your ankles, see if your tailor can shorten them for you."
