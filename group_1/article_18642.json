      "content": "Focus on building consistency instead of speed. The key to getting better at running is to train frequently and consistently. Constant practice gives you time to perfect your form and commit it to muscle memory—this limits your chance of injury, builds your stamina, and helps you train for longer runs in the future. [1] X Research source If you’re new to running, try going on 1-mile or 2-mile runs every other day. When you don’t feel sore the day after anymore, run 4 days per week. If you’re a more experienced runner, aim to run at least 5 days a week, with a day built-in to do some cross-training. If you run too hard in a short amount of time, it can put you at risk of injury, which means you may have to start training all over again."

If you run too fast, your heart rate increases, you’ll feel out of breath, and you might not want to finish your run. Instead, run slower than you need to—this can help you warm up and figure out how much energy to put in without burning out. [2] X Research source You can tell if you’re at a good pace if you can talk in full sentences easily. If you run by yourself, you should be able to sing along to your music without losing your breath. A comfortable running pace depends on your fitness level, age, and experience, but it’s typically a 12:00 to 8:00 minute mile (7:30 to 5:00 minute kilometer). [3] X Research source"
