      "content": "Choose a skirt that allows for movement. If you decide to wear a skirt and blouse for swing dancing, this can be an acceptable look. However, make sure the skirt you choose is not constricting. Remember, movement is key for successful swing dancing. Skirts should usually be knee length or longer and loose-fitting. Skirts that cling to the body will be constrictive for swing dancing. If you want to wear a more fitted skirt, watch the fabric. If you wear something like a pencil skirt, make sure the fabric has a good stretch so you can move around."
