      "content": "Try a mix of rubbing alcohol and water. A residential cleaning specialist from Cleanzen says “prepare a mixture that is 50 percent tap water and 50 percent isopropyl rubbing alcohol. Dip a clean cloth in this mixture, and start scrubbing the surface. The phantom remnants of the dry erase marker should disappear.” After cleaning your board, a cleaning expert from Cleanzen says to “use cold water and another clean cloth to rinse the area after the stain is removed.” You can put rubbing alcohol directly on a paper towel or tissue and rub that on the old marks. Many hand sanitizers contain rubbing alcohol. Rub them directly on the old marks and wipe off of the board. For tough stains, rub a few drops of isopropyl alcohol around with your finger on the old marks. Use enough alcohol to leave a thin layer. Allow it to sit for a few seconds and then wipe dry."
