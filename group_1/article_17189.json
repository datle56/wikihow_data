There are two formulas that can be used to calculate the circumference of a circle: C = 2πr or C = πd , where π is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14, [4] X Research source r is equal to the radius, and d is equal to the diameter. [5] X Research source Because the radius of a circle is equal to twice its diameter, these equations are essentially the same. The units for circumference can be any unit for the measure of length: feet, miles, meters, centimeters, etc."
