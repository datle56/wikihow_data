      "content": "Wash your face with a gentle cleanser. After using the warm towel, the next step is to wash your face using a mild cleanser (such as Cetaphil) — the same as the one you likely already use on a daily basis as part of good skin care. Cleaning your skin can further help to open the pores and better prepare the skin on your face for effective exfoliation. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source After washing, gently pat your skin with a dry towel. Be gentle and do not rub too vigorously, to avoid causing any damage to your skin. You may try standing in front of a fan to dry your body, especially hard to reach areas."

      "title": "Try physical exfoliation.",
      "content": "Try physical exfoliation. There are two types of exfoliation: physical, and chemical. Physical exfoliation is when you physically use a product that scrapes away dead skin cells by the pressure exerted upon them. Examples of tools for physical exfoliation include exfoliating pads and microdermabrasion kits. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Skin-care professionals do not recommend microdermabrasion without the consultation of a doctor or dermatologist first, as you could damage or irritate your skin.

      "title": "Try chemical exfoliation.",
      "content": "Try chemical exfoliation. There is a variety of chemical exfoliating products available. Your best bet is to consult a professional in aesthetics or a dermatologist for advice in choosing the right product for you. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source According to dermatologist Mohiba Tareen, you can also get a chemical peel done by a dermatologist. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you are unable to afford a professional consultation, carefully read the labels of the products and choose one that is suited to your skin type . After washing your face and gently drying it, carefully apply the chemical exfoliating product. Spread it all over your face, being sure to cover the full surface area. Gently massage the chemical exfoliating agent into your skin. Try delicate circular motions with your fingers. Do not rub too hard, as you do not want to damage your skin inadvertently. Many people exfoliate their neck as well. Some examples of chemical exfoliating agents include a glycolic acid peel or a lactic acid peel. The acidic nature of these peels is part of what makes them so effective. Chemical exfoliation tends to work better than physical exfoliation (in particular for long-term results) because it is able to access deeper layers of the skin. Chemical exfoliation works by breaking chemical bonds, which in turn releases dead skin cells and allows them to shed much more easily. Tareen advises against over-exfoliating, since it can cause irritation and skin problems.

Basically, all areas of your body are okay to follow this same process of exfoliation (other than sensitive areas and mucous membranes); however, the most common area people use it for is the face and/or the neck. This is because these areas are most visible to the public, and often the highest cosmetic concern for people.

In fact, it's easy to make your own exfoliating creams, peels, and rubs at home, if you prefer a more natural approach. [11] X Research source Below are two easy-to-use recipes: Sugar and Oil Scrub: Combine equal parts brown sugar and any cooking oil (like olive oil, grapeseed oil, etc.) for a highly economical, highly effective skin scrub.

      "content": "Begin by soaking your feet. Get a bowl of warm to hot water and place both of your feet in it. Let them soak for five to 10 minutes before exfoliating. This will loosen calluses or corns and prepare your skin for the best results. You can add some extra virgin olive oil to the water to increase the softening of your calluses. After soaking them, pat your feet dry with a towel."

      "content": "Use moisturizer liberally. Usually, your skin secretes natural oils to keep it soft, healthy, and moisturized; however, if something removes these oils or interferes with their production, your skin can get dry, flaky, and cracked. To soothe your skin once it dries out, apply a moisturizing lotion, cream, or balm often. These moisturizing solutions work by holding moisture close to the skin with a layer of oil or fat. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Consider make lotion application part of your daily routine — for instance, you might try keeping a bottle of hand lotion at each of your kitchen and bathroom sinks so you can apply after each wash."

      "content": "Cover up in cold weather. In many parts of the world, winter means cold, dry air outside and hot, dry air (from a heating system) inside. Together, these conditions can be very tough on your skin, causing dryness, cracking, and irritation. One of the best ways to keep your skin safe in the winter is to keep it covered up with long sleeves and other skin- covering accessories. The less of your skin that's exposed to the dry, biting air, the less you'll have to deal with its dehydrating effects. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid overuse of harsh abrasives.",
      "content": "Avoid overuse of harsh abrasives. Stronger abrasives (like pumice stones and stiff brushes) can sometimes be great for eliminating tough, built-up dead skin deposits; however, if used too often (or if used on sensitive skin), these abrasives can leave the skin red and raw, making it vulnerable to dryness and irritation in the long run. If you're noticing pain or redness after exfoliating, dermatologist Mohiba Tareen advises \"taking a week off from your exfoliating daily routine.\" For instance, if your stiff-bristled shower brush has been irritating your skin, try switching to a gentle washcloth, which should allow you to exfoliate at a much more manageable pace."

      "title": "Avoid long, hot showers.",
      "content": "Avoid long, hot showers. Hot water, though relaxing, strips away essential oils from your skin and leaves it vulnerable to drying out. To avoid this, simply keep your water temperature warm, not hot, and limit your showers to a reasonable length — about 10 minutes or less. The cooler (and shorter) your shower, the less likely you are to dry out your skin. [21] X Research source The same principle applies to baths — shorter and cooler is best. You'll also want to avoid bubble baths and other soap-based soaks (except those known to be \"moisturizing\"), as these can also strip your skin's natural oils. Pat (rather than scrub) yourself dry after bathing. The back-and-forth action of a towel can remove natural oils loosened by the warm water and irritate delicate skin."
