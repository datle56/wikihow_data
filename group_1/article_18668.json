      "title": "Get a second device that can run Fortnite.",
      "content": "Get a second device that can run Fortnite. The most reliable way to get into a bot lobby is by partying up with a brand-new, low-level account to spawn you into one. New Fortnite players are introduced to the game slowly, and the matchmaking system will automatically place new accounts into bot lobbies for practice. You can do this yourself if you have a second device running Fortnite, or you can ask a friend for help. You can use any combination of platforms to accomplish this. For example, if you play Fortnite on a Windows desktop, your second device could be a console (i.e., Playstation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch), iPhone, Android, a Mac, a Windows laptop, or even a second Windows desktop if you have one."

If your second device is a Windows or Mac computer, you'll need to download the Epic Games Store before you can download Fortnite. On PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Android, and iPhone, you can just install Fortnite from your device's game or app store."

      "content": "Add your alt account to a party with your main account. At this point, you should have two separate devices, each with their own account in a party together. If you plan on using this account to get into a lot of bot lobbies, you might want to consider adding the other account as a friend so you can find it easier."

      "title": "Back the alt account out of the lobby during the match start countdown.",
      "content": "Back the alt account out of the lobby during the match start countdown. At the very latest, make sure the alt account backs out right as they spawn on the island. This is to prevent the account from getting levels and experience. Anecdotally, players have noticed that around level 5 is when accounts start getting placed into lobbies with real players. The exact criteria for transitioning a player from bot lobbies to real lobbies is unknown, though, so you may notice your alt account finding real player lobbies sooner or later than level 5."

      "title": "Get a VPN service if you don't have one.",
      "content": "Get a VPN service if you don't have one. You can sometimes get into bot lobbies with a VPN if you select certain VPN locations. However, you must have a VPN that can mask your location by connecting you to servers across the world. Some popular VPN services are ExpressVPN, NordVPN, SurfShark, ProtonVPN, CyberGhost, IPVanish, and more. Select the VPN that works best for you and your budget, and get it set up on your machine before continuing. Read this wikiHow article to learn how to set up a VPN."

      "content": "Connect to a server in a different country. There are a few options you can choose from when looking for an ideal VPN server location for finding Fortnite bot lobbies: Pick a location with fewer Fortnite players. Countries in the Middle East, South America, and Oceania regions may have a smaller Fortnite player base, making them more likely to get bot lobbies to facilitate matchmaking. Pick a location where it's currently very late. When it's very late at night, you might be able to find Fortnite bot lobbies for the handful of players staying up late to game. You can use this to your advantage by picking a VPN server location in an area that's currently very late (around 3 to 5 a.m. would be a good starting point)."
