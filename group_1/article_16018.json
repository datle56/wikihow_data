Then, give it a specific nickname; once you've done this, tap the Evolve button to evolve the Eevee. Keep in mind, though, that each nickname only works once. List of nicknames: Flareon: Pyro Vaporeon: Rainer Jolteon: Sparky Espeon: Sakura Umbreon: Tamao Leafeon: Linnea Glaceon: Rea Sylveon: Kira [1] X Research source Beyond the nickname hack, there’s no way to guarantee that your Eevee will evolve into a Flareon, Jolteon, or Vaporeon. For future evolutions, you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting one of these Pokémon. [2] X Research source Feel free to rename your Eevee to whatever you’d like once the evolution is complete. Warning: Always capitalize the first letter in each new Eevee nickname. The hack is case-sensitive, and won’t work if the first letter is lowercase. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source While you’re still in range of the Pokéstop, tap the Evolve button to evolve your Eevee (it doesn’t have to be renamed).
