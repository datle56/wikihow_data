The lightest is white tea, often made from unopened plant buds. Green tea is produced from the green leaves, while oolong and black teas are made from leaves that have been exposed to air. While many studies focus on green tea, you can gain benefits from any variety. Even a nice cup of chamomile tea has a world of benefits, including promoting healthy digestion [3] X Expert Source Pouya Shafipour, MD, MS Board Certified Family Medicine Specialist Expert Interview. 8 May 2020.

      "content": "Be careful with diet teas. While diet tea tastes similar to many black or herbal teas, diet teas may contain a laxative element, so you should drink these teas in moderation . Experts warn against drinking too many cups of diet tea because you could develop vomiting, nausea, persistent diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and even fainting and dehydration. The concept of \"diet\" tea is sort of false advertising -- any unsweetened, natural tea can promote weight loss. Certain teas may act as a laxative or fat-blocker and that's why they're marketed as such. However, laxatives just clean out your colon (you've already consumed the calories). You may lose a little bit of water weight initially, but the second you drink something, it'll come back. One cup is enough. Seriously. You'll regret drinking more."

A good place to start is by reading the ingredient list on the back label. If it has added sugar or sweeteners, put it back on the shelf. This doesn't mean you have to avoid flavored green teas. True, some have added sugar, but others don't. And if you can stick to all-natural ingredients, all the better for you and your waistline."

      "content": "Make tea brewing (and drinking) easy. One hurdle some people face is that brewing tea, while not an incredibly arduous process, may not be as easy as they’d like it to be. While you can brew a quick cup of tea in the microwave (pour water into a ceramic cup and heat for two minutes until boiling, then add your teabag), you can make the process even easier: Purchase an electric teakettle. Electric teakettles are readily available at many bath and kitchen stores, ranging in price and are extremely easy to use. All you have to do is fill it with water and push a button or lever to bring it to a boil. You can brew tea by the cup or add several tea bags to the entire pot once the water has boiled. Keep a thermos as well for the additional boiled water. Fill with water, add the green tea and keep by the kettle or your desk for ease of pouring a tea when needed. Buy an iced tea maker. During warmer months, drinking hot tea may not sound like fun; however, you can still consume just as much tea by using an iced tea maker. Like the electric teakettle, simply fill the machine with water; add ice (according to the manufacturer’s directions) and teabags. Turn it on and begin drinking fresh iced tea in a matter of minutes. Brew iced tea the night before for quick access during the day. If you don’t have a few minutes to brew your iced tea that day, make it at night and keep a pitcher of tea in your refrigerator. Instead of bringing a few sodas to work, consider filling a large thermos with iced tea and keep it on hand throughout the day."

      "content": "Create good tea drinking habits. In order to reap the benefits of tea, you'll have to start drinking it every day, as often as possible, and plain. If it's not easy, tasty, and convenient, you won't stick to it. How can you enable yourself to drink it more? Having \"tea supplies\" is the easiest way to get started. If you spend 8 hours a day at the office, it's a good idea to stock up there, too -- along with having your favorite mug (or thermos) and microwave or kettle access. Ask any Brit -- tea is a drink made for company. If brewing an entire pot seems worthless to you, get others in on your action. At the workplace, brew a pot for your coworkers, too. Get the family/roommates in on the routine of a late night cup. When it's a social activity, you'll be more likely to engage in it."

Some coffee house drinks contain hundreds of calories whereas with tea, what you see is what you get. Like mentioned above, it's important that you drink your tea straight. The addition of milk neutralizes the fat-stomping ability of tea (the flavonoids). What's more, research says skim milk is the worst! [5] X Research source Crazy, huh? This research is on cow's milk. If you'd like to try soy or almond, do so -- but keep in mind that the same effect may or may not be had."

The sodium in diet soda can make you retain water, so opt for the smart alternative –– sugar-free iced tea. Iced tea is also ideal because if you're looking for a little caffeinated pick-me-up during the afternoon, iced (or hot) tea will give you the same effect without the sugar in regular soda or the sodium in diet. Much of the \"power\" behind drinking tea to lose weight is because you won't be consuming anything else instead. Tea is low in calories (if you do it right), and will keep you from downing other, higher-calorie things. It's the same concept as losing weight by drinking water ."

If you go for the tea, the EGCG properties found in green tea actually have a glucose-lowering effect, which influences cravings and may help control hunger. Moreover, the ritual involved in making tea (as opposed to shoving coins into a vending machine) gives you a welcome break from your chores or work -- and you can reflect on good thoughts, as well as making conscious choices to put good things into your body instead of empty calories from candy bars. Take a moment to chat to someone else who is in the tearoom with you. And it's a great way to unwind, stretch and socialize in the space of five minutes!"

Because a good night’s sleep contributes to shedding weight, set yourself up for a successful sleep with tea. However, don't drink tea too close to bedtime; otherwise you’ll end up having to make trips to the bathroom and disrupt your sleep, especially if you're pregnant or suffering from incontinence issues."

While drinking tea at all is good, consider drinking different kinds throughout the day to see what works for you. White tea may block fat absorption, so drink it before lunch. A tea like bilberry can balance your glucose levels, so it's most useful around dinnertime. Pu-erh, green, and oolong teas can get your metabolism going, so drink them in the morning (and throughout the day!)."

In order to stick to your routine, mix it up and try different teas, flavors and enhancements. It can be a lot of fun making a tea selection in your home or office cupboard, allowing you to choose a tea flavor according to the mood you're in. Add honey or rock candy sticks to your tea. Keep in mind though that doing this will go against your initiative to lose weight –– but a little honey or sweetness may make the tea taste better. Perhaps as an occasional treat, this one won't hurt. Try a splash of fat free flavored cream or a squirt of lemon for a zestier tea. A slice of lemon can help improve the flavor. Plus, one study found that those who drink black tea with lemon peel have 70 percent reduced likelihood of developing skin cancer. [7] X Research source"

According to a study by Abdul Dulloo, from the Institute of Physiology at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, the plant compound EGCG found in green tea, plus caffeine, increases thermogenesis by 84 percent. Thermogenesis is the generation of body heat that occurs as a result of normal digestion, absorption, and metabolization of food. Green tea also increases your levels of norepinephrine, which prepares your body to burn fat for the \"fight or flight\" response. Knowledge is power, people! It's also motivation! [8] X Research source While not every researcher believes that green (or other) tea drinking is a “magic bullet” for weight loss, every weight loss expert would agree that flooding your system with water or drinking tea versus eating a candy bar or drinking soda can help move the digestion process along quickly and perhaps distract you from munching snacks that aren't healthy.
