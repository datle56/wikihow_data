      "title": "Have a team of Pokémon leveled up to around level 60 (preferably higher).",
      "content": "Have a team of Pokémon leveled up to around level 60 (preferably higher). A good team is 1 each of Water, Fire, Electric, Ghost or Bug, and Ice types (each will be explained when they are useful in the individual Elite Four members' details section). [1] X Research source Aim for at least level 65 just to be safe. You can use one of your extra party slots (you will have 1–3, depending on whether you use a Water/Ice dual Pokémon and include the Bug/Ghost Pokémon) to take a lower-leveled Pokémon up and give it the Exp Share. It will be easier if you have a full team consisting of all of the above plus a strong defender (a Dratini evolved into Dragonite works best since their only weaknesses are Ice and Dragon-type moves, while they resist Fire, Water, Electric, and Grass)."

      "content": "Get the supplies that you need. You will need enough supplies to make it through five consecutive battles. It is suggested that you stock up on Full Heals, Revives, Full Restores, Max Repels, Max Potions, Great Balls, and Ultra Balls before going into battle. You can purchase each of these items at a Poké Mart:"

      "title": "Beat Lorelei.",
      "content": "Beat Lorelei. Lorelei is the first of the Elite Four and uses mainly Ice-types. She has a Dewgong that is a Water/Ice dual-type Pokémon, Cloyster, a Water/Ice dual-type Pokémon, Slowbro, a Water/Psychic dual-type Pokémon, Jynx, an Ice/Psychic dual-type Pokémon and a Lapras, a Water/Ice dual-type Pokémon. [3] X Research source You could use Zapdos and Moltres with Thunderbolt , Shockwave , and Flamethrower for this fight. If you have a Dark Pokémon on your team, it will do well against Jynx. [4] X Research source When you've defeated Lorelei, a door opens that you can go through to find Bruno. You'll want to save your game before continuing."

      "title": "Beat Bruno.",
      "content": "Beat Bruno. Bruno is the second of the Elite Four and utilizes Fighting types. He has a Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, and Machamp that are weak to Psychic-type Pokémon and two Onix that can be defeated with Surf from a Water Pokémon. [5] X Research source Avoid using Flying-type Pokémon as Hitmonchan and Machamp can use Rock Tomb . Slowbro is really strong here. Not only does it have higher-than-average defense stats (compared to other Psychic types), but it's also a Water-type, which gives it an edge against Bruno's 2 Onyx. You'll want to save your game before continuing."

      "title": "Beat Agatha.",
      "content": "Beat Agatha. When you've defeated Bruno, a door will open. Go through this door to find Agatha, who is the third of the Elite Four. Agatha uses Poison types (with most of them being Ghost-type as well), so your Psychic Pokémon will destroy all of these with a single Psychic attack. Well-leveled teams shouldn't have any trouble here. [6] X Research source Normal and Fighting-type Pokémon are useless in this fight as most of Agatha's Pokémon will be immune. Save your game before continuing."

      "content": "Defeat Lance. When you've defeated Agatha, a door opens that you can go through to find Lance, the last of the Elite Four. Lance is the master of Dragon-types. Make sure to lead off with your Electric-type to use Thunderbolt once or twice to knock out his Gyarados (he is a dual Water/Flying-type, which means Electric-type moves will be 4x effective). [7] X Research source Once Gyarados is down, switch to your Ice-type Pokémon to take out his two Dragonair and Dragonite with Ice Beam or Blizzard. He then has Aerodactyl, which is a dual Rock/Flying Pokémon. You can use Surf to weaken Aerodactyl. Zapdos and Articuno are the best Pokémon for this fight. [8] X Research source Save your game before continuing."

      "content": "Beat the Champion. When you've defeated Lance, a door opens that you can go through to find the Champion.This will be a tough battle since he doesn't stick to one type of Pokémon. The best thing to do is just switch out to whatever kills his next Pokémon. Ice moves will take out Venusaur, Exeggutor, Pidgeot, and Rhydon; Electric is good against Charizard, Gyarados, Blastoise, and Pidgeot; Water is useful against Arcanine, Rhydon, and Charizard; Fire will take out Exeggcutor, and Venusaur. [9] X Research source He will use an Alakazam third, which is a Psychic-type Pokémon and is best handled with Earthquake . [10] X Research source After you defeat the Champion, Professor Oak will come to congratulate you, then take you to the Hall of Fame, where you will get the title, \"League Champion.\""
