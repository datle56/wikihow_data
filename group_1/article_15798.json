Continue to repeat the process of knitting 1 stitch and lifting a stitch up and over the new stitch all the way to the end of the row. You will notice that your finished scarf edge will continue to get longer as you bind off the stitches. [5] X Research source It can help to use a larger needle to bind off with to make sure you don't do it too tightly. Otherwise, the end of your knitting could pucker up.

      "title": "Tie off the last stitch.",
      "content": "Tie off the last stitch. When you get to your last stitch, so you only have one single loop left, cut the yarn with a few inches left. Then, pull the yarn through the loop that anchors it, then sew a few inches of that yarn through the stitches of the scarf to anchor it. Then, cut off the excess. [7] X Expert Source Jen Webber Knitting Specialist Expert Interview. 4 August 2020. Make sure to leave the strand about 8 inches (20 cm) or longer to ensure that you will be able to weave it into the edges."

Take the loose strand of yarn that you want to weave into the edge of your scarf, and then thread it through the eye of your yarn needle. Hold the strand near the eye of the needle with your thumb and index finger to ensure that it stays put while you sew."

Then, insert the needle into the next stitch from the opposite side of the scarf. Keep weaving the yarn in and out of the stitches along the edge of your scarf until the strand is too short to weave any further."

      "content": "Choose the yarn for fringe. Adding fringe is a decorative way to end knitting a scarf. You can add fringe in the same color you used to knit your project, or you can use different colors of yarn. Opt for a texture that is similar to the texture of your yarn. For example, if your scarf is made from a medium worsted weight wool yarn, then choose the same type of yarn for your fringe."

      "content": "Cut a piece of cardboard that is the same length as the fringe you want to make. Wrapping the yarn around cardboard will help to ensure that all of your fringe is the same length. Get a piece of cardboard and cut it so that it is 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wider than the length you would like your fringe to be. For example, if you want your fringe to be 4 inches (10 cm) long, then the cardboard will need to be 4.5 inches (11 cm) wide. Make sure the cardboard piece is long enough to wrap a significant amount of yarn around it as well. The piece should be at least 10 inches (25 cm) long."

Keep wrapping the yarn around the cardboard until you have somewhat covered it from one end to the other. Donâ€™t wrap the yarn around just 1 area of the cardboard piece. Make sure to wrap the yarn around the cardboard width-wise, which is the part of the cardboard that you have measured for your fringe."

Insert the scissors under the yarn at the bottom of the cardboard and then cut across the yarn in a straight line. Do not cut along the top edge of the cardboard as well! Keep in mind that the yarn strands will be twice as long as you want them to be, but this is because you will be doubling them up along the edge of your scarf."

Then, insert your crochet hook through the first stitch on the end of your scarf. Hook the yarn bundle in the center and pull 1/3 of the folded bundle through the stitch. [8] X Research source Do not pull the yarn all the way through the stitch. Use a crochet hook that is small enough to easily fit through the stitches on the end of your scarf."
