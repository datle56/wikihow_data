      "title": "Look for a romper or an adult onesie.",
      "content": "Look for a romper or an adult onesie. Babies are often dressed in onesies. If you can find an adult sized onesie at a department store, especially if it has footies, this is a great option for a baby costume. If you can't find an adult onesie, consider wearing a patterned romper. This can make you look baby-like as well. Look for rompers or pajamas with childlike patterns. Cartoon animals, stars, checkered patterns, and bright colors are all great options. Some stores sell animal costumes for adults that look a lot like footie pajamas or onesies. These tend to look like something a baby might wear. You could get, for example, a monkey costume and dress yourself up like a baby."

      "title": "Try a baby doll dress.",
      "content": "Try a baby doll dress. If you're female, look into a baby doll dress. These are loose dresses that look something like loose fitted t-shirts. If you already have a baby doll dress, wear that as your costume. You can also find one fairly easily at a local department store. Go for childish patterns. Striped dresses, polka-dot dresses, or dresses decorated with cartoonish patterns can all contribute to the baby-like appearance. If you can fit into items from the juniors department, you may find some dresses have cartoon animal designs. This can really help you look like a baby."

      "title": "Get costume diaper.",
      "content": "Get costume diaper. If you're willing to spend money on a costume, consider seeing if there are diaper costumes available at a local costume store. An oversized diaper, worn with a childish t-shirt, can solidify the baby look. Some stores may actually sell baby costumes, which can do a lot of the work of making a baby costume for you. You can try to make your own fake diaper if you do not have the money for a store bought variety. You can wrap toilet paper around a pair of shorts, for example, to make it look as if you're wearing a diaper. If toilet paper feels too much like a mummy, try taking a white pillow case or white towel. Wrap it over your bottom like a diaper. You can try having a friend wrap a towel around you as if they were putting a diaper on a large baby. This can help your fake diaper look more realistic. A diaper pin can also help with the baby look. Try to purchase an oversized diaper pin at a costume store. You can bend gray pipe cleaners into the shape of a diaper in and glue this on your fake diaper."

      "title": "Consider footwear.",
      "content": "Consider footwear. Do not forget about footwear. Babies often wear booties, so consider going to a party in thick socks if possible. You can also make a trip to your local department store and browse for shoes in your size that look somewhat childlike. Jelly shoes, which are made from a rubbery material, often look sparkly in appearance. They could work well for a baby costume. You can try to knit yourself a pair of adult-sized booties, if you have time. You can knit using a pattern for a baby bootie, but increase the length to fit an adult. Department stores often sell colorful, fuzzy socks. Consider purchasing a brightly colored pair of fuzzy socks and sewing on buttons or buckles. This can give the socks the appearance of a baby bootie."

      "title": "Try overalls.",
      "content": "Try overalls. Oftentimes, babies are dressed in overalls. If you can't find a onesie, romper, or dress, put on a pair of overalls and style them in a childlike manner. You can find overalls at most department stores if you don't already have a pair of your own. Wear a colorful, baby-like t-shirt underneath your overalls. See if you can find overalls with any patterns or embroideries stitched on. This can increase the childlike appearance. Make sure you do not just wear overalls. This may make you look like you're going for a hillbilly or farmer costume. Colorful overalls, such as purple overalls, can lessen the farmer appearance. You should also make sure to incorporate baby footwear, as well as some baby-like accessories, to make it clear you're going as a baby."
