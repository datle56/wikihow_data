      "content": "Appeal to a secretive Scorpio by being selectively available. Hold back some information when you text him to let him figure you out gradually. Tell him you’re already busy the day he tries to make plans and suggest an alternative date. Scorpio will respect and admire your desire for privacy, as he feels the same way. [2] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. When he asks you out, text, “That sounds fun! 😊 I’m gonna be SUPER busy that day, though. How about next Thursday?” Share some personal details when he asks, but hint that there’s more to know. “I actually studied a few different subjects in college! What about you?” Be selectively available but don’t act like you have other dates. A loyal Scorpio won’t enjoy playing hard-to-get if he thinks you’re flirting with multiple people."

[3] X Research source “You seem like a guy of many talents! 😜 What’s your absolute favorite hobby?” “I think I’m gonna rent a movie tonight.

You always have really cool insights. 😁” Anything with an element of mystery is sure to engage Scorpio’s intuitive mind: dreams, aliens, the supernatural, and magic.

Scorpio appreciates the crass and dark jokes that other signs might find distasteful, so take your best shot! [4] X Research source “Don’t worry about what other people think!

      "content": "Scorpio is extremely sensual, so he’ll love an eye-catching pic. Be careful and make sure your Scorpio is trustworthy. Once you feel comfortable, try sending him a photo of yourself in your most attractive and form-fitting outfit or undergarments if you feel daring. Scorpios like it when you leave something to the imagination, so a sexy outfit will entice him even more than a nude pic might. Black and red are often associated with the Scorpio sign. Wear a classic little black dress in your selfie, or tight black pants and a dark red shirt. Let your flirting build for a little while before you send anything revealing. If he asks for a sexy photo right away, he’s probably not looking for anything more."

On the other hand, 1-word texts aren’t exciting, and Scorpios don’t like boring conversations, so make sure you’ve got a purpose for each text! “Hey” probably won’t interest him, but “You’ll never guess what happened today!” will, since it’s short, sweet, and you’re texting him with the intent of sharing news. If he starts sending longer texts as your relationship deepens, feel free to do the same. Until that time, stick to short and easy-to-read messages."
