You may feel really upset, frustrated or angry with your mother, but now is not the time to express these feelings. Save that discussion for when you are both calm and can talk about your feelings honestly and openly. If you start to preach, punish or threaten your mother, ask yourself what’s motivating these actions. You’re likely angry, and taking it out in this way won’t help you or your mother. Find healthy outlets for your anger, like journaling, playing basketball, or going for a walk."

It can be hard to see your mother let go of her responsibilities as drugs take over her life. Remember it’s not your job to pick up the pieces.

If you've tried your best to help, but always end up being hurt or ignored, it's not your fault. Nothing you did made her start doing drugs and you must never blame yourself.
