Take whatever physical activity you already do, and increase that so you’re getting in more movement every day.

In addition to increasing your baseline movement from everyday activities, start including planned and structured physical activity. Remember, some activity is better than nothing, and even a brisk walk a few times a week can have great health benefits. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Try to get 150 minutes of exercise every week. You could break that up into 5 30-minute sessions or even 10 15-minute sessions. Find an activity you love to do to make it more enjoyable. Walking, jogging, running, swimming, dancing, aerobics classes, playing tennis, horseback riding—figure out what works for you so you stick with it. Try to also include 2-3 strength-training sessions each week. The more muscle mass you have, the better your body will be able to burn calories. You could try lifting hand weights while you watch TV or do lunges across your office when you take a break.

[4] X Expert Source Adam Shuty Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 26 August 2020. Getting too little sleep could make it harder for you to lose weight and keep it off, plus you may be too tired to get in any physical exercise. Try turning off your phone and removing distractions, like the TV, about an hour before bed each night. Studies show that your hunger hormone, ghrelin, increases when you don’t get enough sleep. This makes it harder to stick to smaller portion sizes or refrain from excessive snacking."

The next time you’re at the grocery store, choose wheat bread instead of white bread or get whole-wheat pasta or brown rice instead of the refined options. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Whole grains take longer to digest, meaning that the release of carbs and energy will take longer than it would with refined grains. This can help prevent that mid-afternoon slump while also keeping you fuller for longer. Refined grains are more processed and contain fewer nutrients compared to whole grains. These are okay to have on occasion, and sometimes they’re the only thing available. Try to make the whole-grain choice when you can, but don’t stress if you eat refined grains from time to time. Try to get between 3-8 servings of grains each day, depending on your age and activity level. A slice of bread, 1/2 cup (125 grams) of rice or pasta, or 5 whole wheat crackers would each count as one serving.

The calories in these types of foods are sometimes called “empty calories” because they don’t provide your body with much in the way of vitamins, minerals, protein, or fiber. It can be really hard to give up these foods because they’re often very tasty! When you do eat processed foods, just try to balance out your other meals with whole or fresh foods. Try to avoid foods like pastries, cookies, cakes, processed meats, frozen meals, chips, crackers, and canned foods and juices with added sugar. Sometimes you may only have processed foods available to eat, and that is okay! It doesn’t mean you can’t lose weight or that you’re doomed to failure.

Sometimes eating isn’t just about fueling your body—it can also be a way to distract you from your emotions or something to do when you’re bored. It can also be because you just love a certain food! When you find yourself heading toward the snack cupboard, pause and ask yourself if you’re really hungry. If not, go do something else to distract yourself and break the cycle of distracted snacking. [12] X Research source Reading, journaling, doing a puzzle, crafting, playing a video game, calling a friend—there are lots of different hobbies you could do. Pick something that appeals to you so that you’re more likely to go to it when you’re tempted to snack. If there is a food you really love, like chocolate, try saving it for a specific time of the day or week. Instead of eating it whenever you want, make yourself wait so that it’s even more enjoyable when you do have it and so that you don’t overdo it on a special treat. For example, maybe you only allow yourself to enjoy having a baked pastry on Saturday mornings instead of every morning."
