      "content": "Beer has an expiration date, but it’s a quality notifier, not a food safety measure. Beer doesn’t expire the same way food does. While beer does have an expiration date, it doesn’t mean that it’ll be unsafe to consume by that listed date. As beer ages, the flavor continues to worsen, no matter the type of container. So, even though you won’t get sick when you drink beer that’s 2-3 years past the expiration date, your taste buds may get upset. [1] X Research source Drinking beer that’s been left out in the sun or in a hot car won’t get you sick, but it won’t taste the best, either. Unopened, unrefrigerated beer will typically see a decrease in quality 4-6 months past its expiration date, depending on the type of beer. Open beer that’s left at room temperature will see a quick decrease in quality, with carbonation and taste lessening over the course of hours."

      "content": "It has a skunky smell. While some beers may be brewed to be on the stinkier side, a skunky smell usually isn’t a good sign. When your beer is exposed to enough UV light, it can cause a skunky smell, especially in glass bottles that don’t block out the rays. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as some people prefer skunky-tasting beers, but it is a sign that your beer’s been exposed to too much UV light. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "It’s flat.",
      "content": "It’s flat. Most beers are carbonated, unless they’re intentionally made to be flat and smooth. But, over time, that carbonation lessens and leaves you with a flat, poor-quality beer, even if it was made to be extremely carbonated, like Bud Light, Coors Light, or Sam Adams Light. If you take a sip of your beer and you notice that it’s flat and doesn’t have sharp carbonation, it’s likely gone bad. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "It tastes like cardboard. If your beer is exposed to oxygen early, it will oxidize and create a stale, cardboard-like taste. This can happen in a number of ways, whether it be a keg that’s tapped for too long or a bottle that wasn’t resealed properly. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "It tastes like popcorn.",
      "content": "It tastes like popcorn. A buttery taste in your beer is usually the result of diacetyl, a compound that’s produced in most beer fermentations. While it’s normal for diacetyl to form in beer, too much of it can cause that buttery taste, which can be a sign that it’s going bad. [5] X Research source Exposure to too much diacetyl is dangerous for your lungs. The amount of diacetyl in beer isn’t lethal, but you still don’t want to be exposed to too much."

      "title": "The shelf life of beer varies based on the type of beer.",
      "content": "The shelf life of beer varies based on the type of beer. If beer remains unopened and refrigerated, some can last for up to two years past the expiration date. But, this depends on the type of beer it is. For example, pilsners, lagers, and wheat beers tend to drop off in quality after 3 months, while IPAs tend to vary depending on how many adjuncts (unmalted grains like barley or wheat) they have. A 12% ABV stout tends to taste better than a blueberry pie milkshake IPA after a year in a cellar, so when it comes to adjuncts, they’re better fresh. Other average shelf lives include: [7] X Research source Stouts and Porters: These maintain flavors for about 2 years, but lose their foam stability over time. Barleywines and Tripels: These tend to produce new flavors as they age, and are good for about 1-6 years. Lambics, Gueuzes, and Saisons: These aged beers can be good for decades, with some still maintaining a strong flavor after 20 years. Kegged Beer: Typically has a shelf life of two months if kept cold."

      "content": "Light Beer is sensitive to UV radiation from the sun, so it’s best to keep it out of the light. Even less than an hour of sun exposure can cause a chemical reaction called “light strike” that produces 3-methyl crotyl mercaptan, which exudes a skunky flavor. Many beer manufacturers combat this issue by tinting their bottles in colors that better absorb UV light, like brown. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Oxygen",
      "content": "Oxygen No matter how well beer is sealed, there’s always a little bit of oxygen in the container. Over time, this causes the beer to oxidize and become stale, which impacts the flavor profile and quality. Light styles, like pilsners, are more prone to quick oxidation, which can take a malty flavor and turn it acidic with a cardboard-like aftertaste. [9] X Research source"

You can thank the heat for that. This is why beers are best stored at refrigerated temperatures, as they help maintain the beer’s flavor profile. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Time",
      "content": "Time As time goes on, beer begins to naturally age and lose some of its flavor. Depending on the beer, the time differs. For example, hoppy beers tend to lose their flavor after 3-6 months, while bottle-conditioned (basically re-fermentation) beers with an ABV of 9% or higher are typically fine for over a year. Some of the compounds that break down over time can provide a flavor that some beer enthusiasts are quite fond of, making some aged beers extremely popular. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Beer typically lasts longer in cans than bottles.",
      "content": "Beer typically lasts longer in cans than bottles. Beer contains plenty of compounds that break down during storage, reducing the content of tasty flavors and replacing them with unappetizing ones. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Chemical Society Scientific society for those involved with chemistry and publisher of several leading peer-reviewed scientific journals Go to source Because of this, beer generally lasts longer in modern cans than it does in glass bottles, as the glass bottles contain more oxygen in the neck, leading to a quicker break down of compounds. Older beer cans tend to store worse than glass bottles, as they corrode over time and can leave bits of rust behind in the beer."

      "content": "The package date is when the beer was packaged; the best-before date is when it’s at peak freshness. A case of beer typically contains one date, either the packaged-on date or the best-before date. The packaged-on date (also known as “closed dating”) tells you when the beer was put into the can or bottle and packaged to sell. The best before date (also known as “open dating”) is a date that helps determine how long an item is at its best quality before it starts to decline.

      "content": "Store it in a cold, dark place. Because heat and light play a big factor in the shelf life of beer, it’s best to keep your beer in a cold, dark place away from light. The type of beer determines the right storage temperature. Strong beers, like barleywines, dark ales, and triples, do best at 55-60℉ (12.7-15.5℃), standard ales, like IPAs, bitters, and stouts, are best at 50-55℉ (10-12.7℃), and lighter beers, like wheat beers, pilsners, and lagers, do best at 45-50℉ (7.2-10℃). [14] X Research source The higher the alcohol content, the higher the storage temperature will typically be. The lower the alcohol content, the lower the storage temperature. 50-55℉ (10-12.7℃) is ideal for most beers. The higher the temperature, the more you risk shortening your beer’s lifespan. Bartender Bryan Sullivan says that beer tastes different depending on the temperature that it’s served at. The darker and stronger the beer is, the warmer you’d want it served. Sullivan says a stout should be served at 50-60℉ (10-15.5℃). Most lagers are best served at 35-45℉ (1.6-7.2℃)."

But, you can still keep it fairly fresh by resealing it with a wine cork or vacuum pump . If you use a cork, insert it into the top of the container and make sure it seals. If you use a vacuum pump, wet the stopper, insert it into the bottle, connect the pump to the valve, then pump until you feel a vacuum forming.
