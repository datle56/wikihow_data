[2] X Research source Before you file your application to garnish the defendant's wages, send him or her a letter explaining that you are willing to take steps to collect the judgment unless the defendant pays in full or makes arrangements with you to pay installments. Give the defendant a deadline by which he or she must respond to your letter. If you get no response, go forward with the wage garnishment."

In some jurisdictions you can begin taking action to collect your judgment as soon as it is entered, while in others you must wait until the deadline to appeal has passed. Typically the defendant has between two weeks and a month to file an appeal of the judgment. [3] X Research source [4] X Trustworthy Source Civil Law Help Center Nonprofit law firm dedicated to civil legal services to all people Go to source [5] X Research source Wage garnishment is available if the defendant receives regular wages that are above the poverty line, and he or she doesn't already have other garnishments in effect. [6] X Research source You only have a certain period of time to collect on your judgment. For example, Nevada judgments are only good for six years from the date they are entered. After that period runs out, you must file a motion to renew the judgment before you can take action to collect. [7] X Trustworthy Source Civil Law Help Center Nonprofit law firm dedicated to civil legal services to all people Go to source This time period varies depending on the state and the court. For example, a judgment from a Colorado County Court is good for six years, while a judgment from a Colorado District Court is good for 20 years. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Prepare your interrogatories.",
      "content": "Prepare your interrogatories. Interrogatories are written questions that must be answered under oath to provide you reliable information about the defendant's employment for purposes of garnishment. To complete your application for a writ of garnishment, you must have the name and address of the defendant's employer. [12] X Trustworthy Source Civil Law Help Center Nonprofit law firm dedicated to civil legal services to all people Go to source [13] X Research source The defendant must answer these questions completely and honestly, and is considered to be under oath when writing his or her responses. [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Keep in mind that some states such as Missouri do not allow you to file post-judgment interrogatories. Without this tool, you may have difficulty determining where the defendant works and how much money he or she makes. In some states, the interrogatories are sent to the defendant, while in others, you must send interrogatories to the defendant's employer. The types of questions you ask will differ depending on whether the defendant or the defendant's employer is expected to respond. Each state typically has a packet of documents available that includes sample interrogatories that are pre-approved by the court for use in wage garnishment. [16] X Research source hhttps://www.courts.state.co.us/Forms/renderForm1.cfm?Form=29 Research your state's law to find out what exemptions your state recognizes. Then ask the appropriate questions to determine whether the defendant's wages are protected by an exemption. For example, many states provide a \"head of household\" exemption for the wages of anyone who provides more than 50 percent of the support for a dependent such as a child. [17] X Research source [18] X Research source You also should find out if the defendant's wages already are subject to another garnishment. Generally you can garnish no more than 25 percent of the defendant's wages, so if he or she has another garnishment in effect, that would lessen if not eliminate your ability to garnish those wages. For example, if the defendant already has a garnishment in effect for 10 percent of her wages, you could only garnish 15 percent to cover your judgment. [19] X Research source The only garnishments not subject to this 25 percent cap are to collect alimony or child support. [20] X Research source"

The court may allow you to automatically issue certain interrogatories related to collection with the judgment order without requiring any additional steps or filing.
