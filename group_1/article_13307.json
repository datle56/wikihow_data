      "content": "Give the whole number the denominator “1” to make it a fraction. To turn the whole number into a fraction, use the number as the numerator (the number on top of the fraction). Then, use the number 1 as the denominator (the number on the bottom of the fraction). [1] X Research source For example, if you are calculating 7 ÷ 3 4 {\\displaystyle 7\\div {\\frac {3}{4}}} , you would first change 7 {\\displaystyle 7} to 7 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {7}{1}}} ."

Reverse the numerator and denominator to find the fraction’s inverse, also known as the reciprocal. [2] X Research source For example, the inverse of 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} is 4 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{3}}} ."

      "content": "Multiply the numerators together, then multiply the denominators together. To multiply fractions , first multiply the numerators together. Then, multiply the denominators together. The product of the two fractions equals the quotient of your original division problem. In other words, the result you get from this multiplication step is the answer to your division problem. [3] X Research source For example, 7 1 × 4 3 = 28 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {7}{1}}\\times {\\frac {4}{3}}={\\frac {28}{3}}}"

      "content": "Simplify the fraction, if necessary. Usually, your teacher will require you to reduce proper fractions to their lowest terms. If you have an improper fraction (a fraction with a larger numerator than denominator), your teacher may require you to change it to a mixed number . [4] X Research source To reduce a proper fraction, find the greatest common factor between the numerator and the denominator—aka the highest number that divides evenly into both numbers. Then, divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF to get the new numerator and the new denominator, respectively, says academic tutor David Jia. For example, 28 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {28}{3}}} simplifies to the mixed number 9 1 3 {\\displaystyle 9{\\frac {1}{3}}} ."

      "content": "Draw enough large shapes to match the count of the whole number. If your whole number is 5, for instance, draw 5 large-ish shapes. Each shape should be capable of being divided into equal groups, such as a square or circle. Draw the shapes large enough that you can divide them into smaller pieces. [5] X Research source For example, if you are calculating 5 ÷ 3 4 {\\displaystyle 5\\div {\\frac {3}{4}}} , you would draw 5 circles."

Divide each whole shape into its fractional parts. [6] X Research source For example, if you are dividing by 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} , the 4 in the denominator tells you to divide each whole shape into fourths, giving you 20 small sections overall."

      "content": "Shade in the same number of sections per shape as the numerator. Since you are dividing the whole number by the fraction, you are looking to see how many groups of the fraction are in the whole number. [7] X Research source So, first, you need to create your groups. It might be helpful to shade each group a different color, since some groups will have pieces in two different wholes. Leave any leftover pieces unshaded. For example, if you are dividing 5 by 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} , you would color 3 quarters a different color for each group. Note that many groups will contain 2 quarters in one whole, and 1 quarter in another whole."

      "content": "Compare the number of pieces you have leftover to a complete group. The fraction of a group that you have left over will indicate the fraction of your answer. Make sure you do not compare the number of pieces you have to a whole shape, as this will give you the wrong fraction. [9] X Research source For example, after dividing the 5 shapes into groups of 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} , you have 2 quarters, or 2 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}} left. Since a whole group is 3 pieces, and you have 2 pieces, your fraction is 2 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{3}}} ."

      "title": "Sample Problem #1",

Solution: Since the problem is asking how many groups of 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}} are in 8, the problem is one of division. Turn 8 into a fraction by placing it over 1: 8 = 8 1 {\\displaystyle 8={\\frac {8}{1}}} . Find the reciprocal of the fraction by reversing the numerator and denominator: 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}} becomes 2 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{1}}} . Multiply the two fractions together: 8 1 × 2 1 = 16 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {8}{1}}\\times {\\frac {2}{1}}={\\frac {16}{1}}} .

Take the fraction’s reciprocal by reversing the numerator and denominator: 5 8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}} becomes 8 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {8}{5}}} . Multiply the two fractions together: 16 1 × 8 5 = 128 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {16}{1}}\\times {\\frac {8}{5}}={\\frac {128}{5}}} .

Solution: Draw 9 circles representing the 9 cans. Since she eats 2 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{3}}} at a time, divide each circle into thirds. Color groups of 2 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{3}}} . Count the number of complete groups. There should be 13. Interpret the leftover pieces. There is 1 piece leftover, which is 1 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{3}}} . Since a whole group is 2 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{3}}} , you have half a group left over. So, your fraction is 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}} . Combine the number of whole groups and fractional groups to find your final answer: 9 ÷ 2 3 = 13 1 2 {\\displaystyle 9\\div {\\frac {2}{3}}=13{\\frac {1}{2}}} ."
