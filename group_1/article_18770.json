      "content": "Rinse the stain with cold water until the water runs clear. While some dry-erase markers are washable and come out with water, others require more treatment to get the marks out. If the stain comes out immediately with cold water, you’re good to go! If it doesn’t, continue reading. If you have access to the marker that made the stain, see if the label says “Washable.” If it does, you can throw the clothing in the washing machine and wash as normal. This method also works well for leather shoes and clothing items."

      "content": "Place the stained layer on top of a towel. Put the clothing item down on a flat surface. Place a clean absorbent towel directly underneath the layer of clothing with the stain to make sure the marker doesn’t bleed onto other parts of the item. For example, if you have a t-shirt with a stain on the collar, place the towel inside the collar underneath the layer with the stain. Try to use an old towel you don’t mind getting stained with ink. Alternatively, place the stain facedown on 4 to 5 paper towels and apply the rubbing alcohol to the back of the stain. [1] X Research source"

Laundry and cleaning specialist Kamel Almani says to apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol (or nail polish remover) on a clean sponge or cloth and gently blot the stain, then “dab [the area] with an absorbent towel” to soak up the ink.

Laundry and cleaning specialist Kamel Almani says that once the stain is treated, you can wash the garment in a separate load of laundry as usual. [4] X Expert Source Kamel Almani Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 9 April 2021. Check the item’s label for any specific cleaning instructions you may have to follow. Washing the item separately ensures that the rubbing alcohol and any leftover ink don’t stain other clothing. After the item comes out of the washer, check to make sure the stain is completely gone before drying. A hot dryer can set the stain, making it harder to remove.

If the stain still stays, you may have to take the clothing item to a professional dry cleaner."

Place the clothing item on a flat surface and put an old absorbent towel underneath the layer of fabric with the stain. The towel prevents the rest of the clothing item from staining as you remove the ink. Scrub the stain gently as you rinse the stain to see if the marker is washable—if it is, the ink should come out with water. Make sure the towel is thick enough to absorb excess moisture.

Murphy’s Oil is a soap for cleaning wooden floors that’s named that way because pine oil is used as the raw material.
