      "content": "The constant of proportionality is the rate at which the x and y variables change. In other words, this is a constant slope. When two variables are proportional, that means they both change at the same rate. If you plot them on a graph, you can draw a straight line between all of the points that goes through the origin of the graph. The constant of proportionality is the slope of that line. [1] X Research source Graphed coordinates ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,y)} can also be written as a ratio y : x {\\displaystyle y:x} or a fraction y x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {y}{x}}} . You can also think of x {\\displaystyle x} as the independent variable and y {\\displaystyle y} as the dependent variable, since y {\\displaystyle y} changes in relation to the change in x {\\displaystyle x} . The constant of proportionality can never be 0 {\\displaystyle 0} ."

Direct proportionality is represented by the equation y = k x {\\displaystyle y=kx} where k {\\displaystyle k} is the constant of proportionality. The same equation can also be written k = y x {\\displaystyle k={\\frac {y}{x}}} . Use this version if you're trying to find the constant of proportionality and already have the values for the two variables. The formula d = r t {\\displaystyle d=rt} (distance = rate x time), which you might recognize from science class, is another version of the equation for the constant of proportionality."

If they all increase, they're directly proportional. On the other hand, if one set of values increases and the other set of values decreases, you've got inverse proportionality. For example, look at the set 20 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {20}{4}}} , 40 8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {40}{8}}} , and 60 12 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {60}{12}}} . In each ratio, the values of the numerator and the denominator both increase, so you're looking at direct proportionality.

Start this problem by finding the constant of proportionality. You know you're going to be working with directly proportionate ratios because the more minutes pass, the further Flash will go, so you use the equation k = y x {\\displaystyle k={\\frac {y}{x}}} . The distance Flash goes depends on how long he's moving, so distance is the y {\\displaystyle y} variable and time is the x {\\displaystyle x} variable. You've been told that Flash goes 6 {\\displaystyle 6} feet in 1 {\\displaystyle 1} minute, so that makes his constant of proportionality 6 {\\displaystyle 6} ( k = 6 1 = 6 {\\displaystyle k={\\frac {6}{1}}=6} ).
