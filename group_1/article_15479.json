      "content": "Find jicama. You may or may not find jicama at your local grocery store or farmer’s market -- it depends upon your location. General grocery stores are more likely to carry jicama in areas with sizable Hispanic or South Asian populations. If your local grocery store doesn't carry jicama, your best bet is specialty produce shops or Mexican, Asian, and Latin American grocery stores. You are most likely to find jicama in the spring and summer, as they are often imported from Central American countries at that time. Avoid tubers that are soft, shriveled, or have dark spots."

      "content": "Peel the jicama’s skin. You need to peel the skin of the jicama before you eat it. It might be hard to peel with a regular vegetable peeler. Do not eat the peel. Instead, try using a chef’s knife. First, cut a thin slice from both the top and the bottom to create a flat top and flat bottom on each end. Before you peel the jicama, though, wash it in cool running water and then dry it off like you would a potato. Set the jicama down on its broadest cut end. Work from top to bottom, and slide your knife beneath the jicama’s skin. Peel it while following the jicama’s natural lines."

Thus, you don’t need to store it in anything special if you plan it eat it the same day. However, if you have, say, half of the root left, you should store it in the refrigerator in a plastic bag or resealable plastic container. It should be fine to eat even several days later. It might be a bit dry on its cut end, so you might have to cut that part away before you prepare it to eat. Before it's cut, you can store jicama for two to four weeks if you keep it in a cool, dry, dark place. Don’t store it in temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius, as this will cause changes in color and texture."
