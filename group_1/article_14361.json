      "content": "Draw the upper and lower lash lines. First, draw a downward curving line for the upper lash line. Add a curved tail at one end (draw it on the end that's going to be the outer corner of the eye), going down and back toward the other end of the line, so the upper lash line is C-shaped. Make the line about 1/3rd the length of the first curved line you drew. Then, make the upper lash line thick and bold with your pencil. For the lower lash line, draw a short, upward curving line centered under the first lash line you drew. [1] X Research source Female anime eyes are usually bigger and rounder than male anime eyes. Make the eyes about 1/6th the height of the head and 1/4th the width of the head, if you’re drawing one. That way, they’ll look big and exaggerated."

Make the width at the widest part of the oval the same as the length of the lower lash line. This will be the iris of the eye. [2] X Research source"

If you drew the first circle near the top-left side of the oval, draw the smaller circle near the bottom-right side, and vice versa. Make this circle about half the size of the first one you drew. [4] X Research source When you’re done with your drawing, this circle will look like light reflecting off of the eye too."

The eyelashes should span about 1/4th of the upper lash line. Make each line about 1/15th the length of the upper lash line itself. Then, thicken the lines with your pencil so they’re bold like the rest of the upper lash line. [6] X Research source Adding thick, distinct eyelashes will make the eye look more feminine. Add a few eyelashes to the lower lash line if you’d like. If you do, they should curve down, not up."

Make sure the line doesn’t overlap with either of the white circles. Then, shade in the white space above the line so it’s filled in but still lighter than the pupil. Shade in below the line so it’s lighter than the shading above the line. [7] X Research source Experiment using colored pencil if you’d like! Find a dark and light shade of the same color, then shade above the line with the darker shade and below the line with the lighter shade. Remember not to shade in the white circles."

Then, draw a line with a slight upward curve coming down off one end of the first line (the end that will be the outer corner of the eye) at a 45-degree angle. Make this line about 1/3 the length of the first line you drew. At this point, the upper lash line will have a C-shape, and you’ll be able to see the outer corner of the eye. To draw the lower lash line, draw a short, horizontal line with a slight curve centered under the upper lash line. [8] X Research source Male anime eyes are usually smaller and narrower than female anime eyes. The curves on the upper and lower lash lines should be slight so the eye doesn’t look too round. Draw the eyes about 1/8th the height of the head and 1/4th the width of the head, if you’re drawing one."

For example, if you drew the first circle on the top-right side of the oval, draw the smaller circle on the bottom-left side. Draw the circle so it’s about 1/2 the size of the first circle. This circle will also look like reflected light when you shade in your drawing. [11] X Research source"

Shade it in with your pencil so it’s dark and completely filled in. [12] X Research source If the oval overlaps with the small circles you drew, make sure the circles are in front of the oval. Whether or not the oval overlaps will depend on how big you made the circles."

Then, shade everything above the line in so it’s the same color as the pupil. Shade everything below the line in a few shades lighter. [13] X Research source Leave the small circles you drew white. You can look for a good teacher in your area if you want to enhance your drawing skill . You should practice sketching and read about drawing. [14] X Research source Try to develop an artist's eye."
