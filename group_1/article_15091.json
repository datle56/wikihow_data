Set it to measure grams, place your wood onto it, and take note of your wood's weight. If you'd like to keep your scale clean, place a container onto the scale, hit \"Tare,\" and then place the wood in. [1] X Research source Use a scale that has an accuracy within 0.1% for the best results. Otherwise, accuracy should be at least within 0.035 ounces (0.99 g)."

For pinless meters, press the base of its scanning plate against the wood and turn the meter on. Record the moisture content, which will be a percentage between 0 and 100.

      "content": "Microwave 15% to 25% MC wood at the lowest setting for 45 to 60 seconds. Place 3 to 5 paper towels onto the microwave oven's plate and place your wood on top. Most ovens come with a \"Low\" setting and a \"Defrost\" setting that is slightly higher. Set it to \"Low\" and look out for smoke—this is a sign that you have burnt away some of the wood weight and volume and any moisture measurements will be inaccurate. [3] X Research source Never let wood pieces touch if you're heating multiple samples or they can light on fire."

For most microwaves, the next heat level above \"Low\" is \"Defrost.\" Layer 5 paper towels onto the microwave oven's plate, place your wood on top, and set your microwave to \"Defrost.\" If you don't mind waiting, you can set it to the lowest setting, and wait about 4 minutes instead. [4] X Research source If you smell smoke or burning on \"Defrost,\" switch to the \"Low\" heat setting."

      "content": "Weigh your samples after the first round of heating. Following the first round of heating, weigh your samples on the scale and record the weights. When drying wood, you will notice each piece loses weight, which is a sign that moisture is leaving. The goal is to continue heating your wood pieces until there is no weight change and each of their moisture contents is stable. [5] X Research source Remember that different types of wood dry at different rates. Don't be surprised if some pieces lose moisture slower or faster than others."

      "title": "Continue heating your wood and weighing it until there are no weight changes.",
      "content": "Continue heating your wood and weighing it until there are no weight changes. Heat the wood in intervals of 45 to 60 seconds with a 1-minute rest in between each. For highly accurate scales, you shouldn't be able to detect variation more than 0.1 gram once the drying process is done. For gram scales, stop when you get about 5 or 6 readings that are the same. Moisture meters can also detect moisture content, but the weight method is the most accurate. Calculate the moisture content following the final heating by using the following formula: (Wet Weight – Oven Dry Weight / Over Dry Weight) x 100."

Now, place a large baking pan on the bottom rack and put an oven thermometer onto the center rack in one of its far corners. [6] X Research source If your oven doesn’t let you set the temperature to 217 °F (103 °C), set it to the closest increment, such as 215 °F (102 °C)."

Always adjust the temperature by the smallest increments for optimal accuracy. [7] X Research source Turn on your kitchen fan if it has one—this will ensure optimal airflow."

For smaller pieces, lay them perpendicular to each rung of the oven rack to prevent them from falling through.

After 1 hour has passed, remove 2 to 3 wood pieces of varying sizes from the oven. Measure their moisture content using a moisture meter. Continue heating the pieces for 15-minute intervals until the desired MC or until the moisture levels do not decrease anymore.

      "title": "Store your wood in a shaded location with ample airflow.",
      "content": "Store your wood in a shaded location with ample airflow. Try and find an indoor location like a hayloft or shed or an outdoor location that is in the shade. Avoid locations like garages which likely don't have enough airflow. Never store wood in the basement or inside boxes as they dry, they definitely won't have enough airflow. [11] X Research source Remember that your wood needs to dry in an area with a similar moisture content that the finished product will be exposed to. For example, if you plan to use the wood to make a chair that will be placed in a dry area of your home, store it in an area with similarly low moisture content Point an electric household fan toward your wood between your cutting sessions to improve airflow. This circulation will help your wood dry in at least half the time that it normally would."

      "title": "Seal off the ends of each piece of lumber immediately after cutting to prevent moisture decay.",
      "content": "Seal off the ends of each piece of lumber immediately after cutting to prevent moisture decay. Exposed ends can lead to drying that is too fast, which paves the way for end-grain cracking and splits. And since moisture escapes wood 10 to 12 times quicker from the ends, leaving them exposed is damaging to the wood. Apply paraffin wax, shellac, polyurethane, or latex paint to the ends in a uniform manner so that both are completely covered. Try to do so as soon as possible—within minutes—for the best results. [12] X Research source Purchase specially formulated end grain sealers from woodworking or home hardware stores if you don't mind paying a bit more money."

      "content": "Stack your lumber uniformly to expose all sides to airflow. When you're cutting your lumber, cut the pieces to the same lengths and thicknesses. Afterward, these equal dimensions will make it easier to stack them in a manner that exposes each side to air. Use small pieces of 3 ⁄ 4 by 11 ⁄ 2 inch (1.9 cm × 14.0 cm) wood, also known as stickers, to create space between each side and increase ventilation. [13] X Research source Use spacers every 12 inches (30 cm) for thinner pieces and 16 inch (41 cm) or 24 inch (61 cm) spacing for thicker pieces."

      "content": "Cover the top of your wood with a tarp or plastic sheeting. Don't cover the entire pile of wood to the ground—this will hold in moisture. By just covering the top, you can ensure that each piece is adequately shaded without trapping moisture.
