      "content": "Measure the opening to determine the size of your baby gate. First, measure the width of the opening from wall to wall along both the top and bottom of the area. Make sure your gate is 2 inches (5.1 cm) less than the width measurement you take. This allows enough space for the latch and hinges to function properly. Then, measure the gate’s height, double-checking that the flooring surface is even. Measure in a few places to ensure a correct measurement. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the wood boards for the gate according to your measurements. The following numbers are meant for a 37.5 inches (95 cm) wide, 30 inches (76 cm) tall gate; adjust your measurements according to your opening size. Cut 6 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) boards to 30 in (76 cm) long for a gate with a 35.5 in (90 cm) opening. You should end up with 15 30 in (76 cm) long 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) boards. [2] X Research source Adjust the number and lengths of your boards to fit your doorway or stairwell opening as needed. The opening should be 1.5 in (3.8 cm) wider than the gate itself to allow room for the hinges and for the gate to swing open. [3] X Research source If you're attaching wall mounts to either side of the gate, measure the opening after installing them. [4] X Research source"

Repeat the process on another 1 in × 4 in (2.5 cm × 10.2 cm) board for the 2 vertical frame board pieces so they fit flush with the horizontal boards at a 90-degree angle to frame the gate without overlapping. [5] X Research source Lay out your boards during the cutting process, so you get a better idea of the final fit. Arrange the frame onto a flat surface and line the boards up next to each other."

Leave one arm of the “x” intact and cut the other arm into two pieces to fit.

[10] X Research source If you want to be able to see through the gate, leave space between each of the wood boards. Space the pieces of wood under 2 3 ⁄ 8 in (6.0 cm) inches for children under 2 and under 3 1 ⁄ 2 in (8.9 cm) inches for children older than 2 years old. [11] X Research source Gaps that are too large or small can lead to babies getting an arm, head, or leg caught between the wood boards."

[17] X Research source The number of hinges you use depends on the height of your baby gate; a taller gate may require 3 hinges, whereas a medium-sized gate may only need 2. Use a spacer for the area beneath the gate so it remains straight or use a level to ensure a straight edge during installation. [18] X Research source"
