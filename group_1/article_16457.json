      "content": "Find out the shoe width. Many fashion shoes come in a standard medium width, but you may have feet that require a wider or more narrow fit. When you find a pair of shoes you love, see if they come in different widths. A shoemaker can usually stretch the shoes to widen the toe box, enhancing the comfort of the shoe. If you have narrow feet, buy foot inserts that help your foot grip the shoe and fill up any extra space on the sides."

[4] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO速 Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Two different pairs of shoes in the same size can fit you very differently. Shoes can run big or run small, so it is important that you always try them on in the store before you buy them. Also, the shape of the shoe can play a major factor in how they fit your feet. If the shoes pinch you even a little when you are trying them on, do not buy them. It will only get worse."

This will be enough time for you to feel if they are causing you any discomfort. If they fail the two-minute test, you should probably find a pair of heels that is more comfortable."

To help soothe your blisters, cover them with moleskin bandages. These types of bandages are softer and will allow your skin to more easily breathe. Your blisters will surely prevent you from walking normally if you leave them untreated. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Plan your shoes for the occasion. You should wear specific types of heels depending on whether you will be inside or outside. If you plan to spend time outside in the grass, or walking long distances on surfaces you are not familiar with, choose shoes that have a wider \"contact point\" on the bottom so you don't trip. [7] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO速 Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. If you are going to be inside, make sure there is friction, or texture, on the bottoms of your shoes so you do not slip. High heels that have spiked heels can easily pierce soft ground. If you wear them outside you will be sinking into dirt all day. Preferably, you want the heel to have a wide \"contact point,\" the point at which the bottom of the heel touches the ground, for outside use. The wider the contact point, the less likely you are to fall sideways and twist your ankle, fall, or both."

      "content": "Learn how to walk properly in heels. When you wear heels, your body has to take a different approach to walking because of the new angle at which it places your legs and feet. Try following a simple approach to help you more easily walk in high heels. First, take a step forward, starting with your heel, and rock all the way forward to the tip of the toe. Repeat these two words with every step as a reminder, \"heel - toe; heel - toe; heel - toe...\", and before you know it, you will feel sturdy, stable, confident, and comfortable walking in heels. Eventually, you will develop muscle memory to walk comfortably and easily in heels. After you can walk at a good pace, watch yourself in a mirror to smooth out your new strut. Your stride should be natural, and your body should remain perpendicular to the floor. If you catch yourself wobbling unsteadily, slow it down again until you feel good."

      "content": "Practice good posture. You should walk as if you are being pulled up by a string. As you walk, use your hips to shift and lift your legs to the center with each step you take. Condition your body to deal with the changes in posture, which will engage different muscles than when you are walking barefoot or in flats. Your feet, ankles, knees, and back will thank you! [10] X Research source Keep your back straight, don't slouch. Don't block your arms when walking, swing them normally. Take small steps and walk in a straight line."

Similarly, you can't go from ballet flats to four-inch stilettos in one day. If you are planning to wear heels for a special occasion, begin by wearing them for increasing intervals of time every day prior to your event. First, wear them for thirty minutes, then an hour the next day, and then two hours. This will help prepare you for an extended time in your heels."

You probably look great wearing them, so don't let uncertainty trip you up. Trust your shoes. If you are afraid, you will block and contact your body, so you won't be able to walk normally. If you are confident, you will forget you are wearing them and walk normally."
