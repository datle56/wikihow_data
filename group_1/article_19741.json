If your boyfriend asks questions about your decision, firmly restate that you simply don't feel the relationship is working for you anymore. Use \"I\" statements about how you're feeling rather than blaming them with \"you\" statements. For example, you could say \"I don't feel like my decisions are respected\" rather than saying \"You don't respect what I do.\" [4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020."

You may also end up going back to your ex to avoid the pain. Even when the pain is very hard to live with, remind yourself how much healthier it is to embrace the pain. Take the time to process your emotions. Before you distract yourself with a movie or video game, ask yourself what it is you are feeling and what it means. Feel the sensations in your body and how they are connected to your emotions. Identify the emotions you are having â€” are you sad? Angry? Relieved?
