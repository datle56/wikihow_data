      "content": "Select a broth. Look at the hot pot menu and decide if you're doing a full pot or a divided pot. If you're getting a divided hot pot, you can choose multiple broths—most people pick a mild one and a spicy one. Popular hot pot broths include: [1] X Research source Chicken broth: a basic broth that's great for beginners. Savory mushroom: a good vegetarian broth that's rich in umami. Tom yum: a slightly sweet and spicy broth that goes well with meat. Mala: a Szechuan broth that's very spicy and has curry-like flavors. Hainan broth: fresh coconut water is boiled by itself or with chicken broth for the base. [2] X Research source Chongqing: a rich butter or pure beef lard broth, with Sichuan peppers and dried chillies. Chrysanthemum: a broth made from boiling chrysanthemum flowers and chicken or beef. Beijing: a plain and water-based broth with spring onion, ginger, and sometimes mushrooms. Chengdu: a broth made of water and rapeseed oil that has fresh red chilies and Sichuan pepper. Milk: made by simmering milk with some butter, garlic, onion, vegetables, and sometimes stock. [3] X Research source Shabu: a clear broth made from bonito and kombu, and sometimes made with chicken bones, pork bones, or dried bod."

      "content": "Choose several types of meat or alternative proteins. Thinly sliced beef is one of the most popular hot pot choices since it cooks within 10 to 30 seconds. Chicken is also available, but not as popular since it takes much longer to cook. In addition to meat, you can add dumplings or balls made of meat, fish, or pork. [4] X Research source There are a lot of meat and protein options, such as beef, pork belly, chicken, lamb shoulder, tofu, and offal. Most restaurants offer unlimited broth but charge you for each ingredient you put in the hot pot."

      "title": "Select a few different kinds of seafood.",
      "content": "Select a few different kinds of seafood. Head-on shrimp is a good choice for hot pot since they cook in their shells, and the shells flavor the broth. If you prefer seafood that’s easier to eat, choose haddock, seabass, squid, or eel. Shellfish, such as mussels, oysters , crab, and lobster, are also delicious options. [5] X Research source If you get head-on shrimp, be careful when you eat it since the hot broth can get trapped in the shell."

      "content": "Pick several types of noodles. Noodles are a great way to round out a hot pot meal since they're filling and cook quickly. You'll probably see udon, vermicelli, and Shandong noodles on most hot pot menus. However, if you're trying to cut carbs, check the menu for yam (or shirataki) noodles. [7] X Research source Udon: a thick and chewy Japanese noodle made from wheat flour, water, and salt. Vermicelli: a thin, white noodle that’s typically made from rice flour and water. Shandong: a thick and short wheat flour noodle that comes from Shandong, China. Yam/Shirataki: a translucent and gelatinous Japanese noodle that’s made from the starchy tuber of the konjac plant (also called konjac yam or elephant yam)."

Once the broth is boiling, use a strainer (or chopsticks) to add thicker cuts of meat, fish balls, seafood, and starchy root vegetables into the hot pot. [9] X Research source These can take several minutes to cook, so give them a head start before adding other ingredients. Stir the ingredients so they cook evenly. You’ll know the meat is cooked once it floats on top and changes color. [10] X Research source Here are the cooking times for popular hot pot ingredients: Potato: 4 to 8 minutes Shrimp: 2 to 3 minutes Pumpkin: 4 to 8 minutes Fish balls: 3 to 5 minutes Lotus root: 5 to 10 minutes Napa cabbage: 10 minutes Taro root chunks: 10 minutes Kabocha squash: 10 minutes Sirloin chunks: 2 to 6 minutes Tripe and intestines: at least 5 minutes Cubed beef short ribs: up to 30 minutes Chrysanthemum greens: 3 to 4 minutes Pork belly: up to 10 minutes for thicker cuts Clams: 5 to 10 minutes (or until the shells open) Shiitake mushrooms: at least 10 minutes to cook through King oyster mushrooms: 6 minutes for chunks, 2 to 3 minutes for slices"

      "content": "Add in your delicate meats and leafy greens. Once you've given longer-cooking foods a head start in the hot pot, add ingredients that cook quickly. Quick-cooking ingredients include thinly sliced meats and delicate leafy vegetables, like spinach, bok choy, and watercress. These only take 30 seconds to 3 minutes to cook. [11] X Research source Thinly sliced meats, such as beef, will turn brown once they've finished cooking. Only put in a few of these at a time, since they usually cook in less than a minute. This gives you a chance to remove and eat them before adding more to the hot pot."

Lower the food into your dish of sauce and then eat it. If you're eating tofu or a ball, let it cool off a little and use caution since it will have absorbed a lot of hot broth. [13] X Research source Always ask the people you're eating with whether the food you want to remove from the hot pot is theirs or not. Avoid pouring your sauce into the hot pot. Everyone will have different flavor preferences and doing so could ruin the broth for others."

      "content": "Keep the hot pot set to medium so it constantly bubbles. The broth should always be bubbling gently, so it will cook the food you continue to add. Don't worry about the broth evaporating, since someone from the restaurant will occasionally swing by and pour more broth in your hot pot. [14] X Research source Remember to lower new food into the hot pot slowly. This will prevent hot broth from splashing out of the hot pot. After everyone has finished cooking and eating their food from the hot pot, ladle some broth into your bowl. The broth will have absorbed extra flavor from all the food you cooked in it.
