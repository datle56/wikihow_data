These marks may appear reddish or brown and gradually develop into large patches of purple or red blotches and/or blood blisters. [3] X Research source Unlike most rashes, a rash caused by meningococcal septicemia will not fade or blanch when pressure is applied to it. The glass test makes use of this characteristic to help prove or disprove the source of such a rash.

      "title": "Select a clear glass.",
      "content": "Select a clear glass. Use an ordinary clear glass or heavy plastic tumbler style cup for this test. If using plastic, the glass should be strong enough that sufficient pressure may be applied without the risk of cracking or breaking. [5] X Research source The glass must be clear. Solid or translucent tints can make it harder to examine the rash during the test. A tumbler or similar cup is usually the easiest tool to use, but another clear glass or plastic object, like a clear glass bowl, would also work if necessary."

      "content": "Choose a suitable test site. To perform the test, you will need to find a patch of skin that is relatively pale and marked with pin pricks/rash spots. [6] X Research source Meningitis rashes may be difficult to see on dark skin tones. To check for rashes, try looking at lighter patches of skin, such as the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the glass into the rash.",
      "content": "Press the glass into the rash. Gently press the side of the glass onto the skin, directly over the rash. Make sure that you can see the rash through the side of the glass, and experiment with pressing directly and rolling the glass slowly over the rash to get a comprehensive viewing of the blotches and pin pricks. [8] X Research source Apply enough pressure to cause the skin around the rash to become pale. The pressure must push blood away from the tiny blood vessels at the surface of the skin. If the skin around the rash isn't pale, you aren't applying enough pressure to judge the test accurately. The rash may appear to diminish at first. This may be an illusion, as the skin itself around the rash is fading in color while while you press the glass against the skin. Do not end the test here, regardless of how the results appear. If the rash fades, continue to press the glass over the rash and try pressing it on other parts of the rash to ensure that the rash does, in fact, consistently diminish under the glass.

      "content": "Watch for fading. As you roll the glass over the rash, watch the color of the rash itself. Pay close attention to whether or not the rash fades, and look for consistency in your results. [10] X Research source If the rash consistently fades, it probably isn't caused by meningitis or septicemia. If the rash does not fade, however, this is a dangerous sign and is indicative of meningococcal septicemia."

      "title": "Contact a doctor immediately.",
      "content": "Contact a doctor immediately. A rash that does not fade under pressure could be caused by meningococcal septicemia and is cause for concern. This condition can be fatal, and it requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor, or go straight to an emergency room to seek treatment. [11] X Research source If the rash does fade but other signs of meningitis are present, or if there are other major medical concerns, you should still seek immediate medical care. The rash itself is not the definitive test for meningitis, and may fade or be absent altogether, even in confirmed cases of meningitis. You should not wait for a rash to appear before seeking medical treatment. As soon as you suspect that you or someone you know has meningitis, go to the emergency room at your nearest hospital."

Note that cases of viral meningitis are not accompanied by a rash. When rashes do appear, they're the result of bacterial meningitis. [19] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source As meningitis bacteria multiply and build up in the bloodstream, they release endotoxins from their outer coatings. The body is typically unable to fight these toxins, and the poison causes damage to the blood vessels. This process is known as septicemia. As septicemia worsens, it can damage the body's organs. Its characteristic rash occurs when the poisoned blood leaks into the tissues beneath the skin."

[21] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In order to acquire cerebrospinal fluid, your doctor will need to puncture the space between two lumbar bones in your spinal cord with a syringe equipped with a special spinal needle. They will then draw out a small vial of fluid, which will then be tested to confirm meningitis. [22] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Complete blood counts, blood cultures, urine tests, and chest x-rays may also be used to check for signs of infection. If bacterial meningitis is confirmed, your blood or cerebrospinal fluid may be used to grow a culture of the bacteria in the lab so that doctors can identify the specific strain of bacteria present. The strain of bacteria will determine the course of treatment and the type of antibiotics used.
