      "content": "Take a stroll to help the digestion process along. Moving around can stimulate the digestive tract and help you process your meal more efficiently. As soon as you feel able to do so, take a slow, leisurely walk to get things moving. [1] X Research source Don’t jog or speed-walk, however.

      "content": "Loosen your waistband to create extra room. If you’ve just eaten a huge meal and are feeling uncomfortably full, wearing constricting clothing can make you feel worse. Try loosening your belt (if you’re wearing one) or unbuttoning the top of your pants or skirt. If possible, you might also change into something with a stretchy or loose-fitting waistband. [2] X Research source For example, a comfortable pair of leggings or sweatpants might be a good bet."

Eating too fast can confuse your brain and body and make it harder to tell when you’re actually full.

      "content": "Pay attention to your body’s hunger cues. The advice to eat only when you’re hungry seems obvious enough. However, it can be surprisingly hard to tell whether you’re actually hungry or not. [10] X Research source Next time you feel the urge to grab a snack or eat just one more bite of the big meal in front of you, stop and pay attention to the signals your body is sending you.

      "content": "Avoid eating too much sugar or salt. Excess sugar and salt aren’t great for your health, but those tempting flavors make it easy to overindulge. Try to avoid eating processed foods that are loaded with salt, sugar, and refined carbohydrates. If you’re really craving a sugary or salty snack, try eating just 1 or 2 bites and savoring them very slowly. [12] X Research source For example, steer clear of candies and baked goods, sugary drinks, processed lunch meats, and salty snacks like chips and salted nuts. When you’re cooking, try replacing salt with other flavorful herbs and spices. Try satisfying your sweet tooth with a small piece of fruit."

      "content": "Watch out for excess fiber and fat. Dietary fiber and some types of fat are good for you in moderation. However, eating too much of either can upset your stomach and leave you feeling bloated. If you find yourself feeling uncomfortably bloated after your meals, try cutting back on fats and fiber. [13] X Research source Fiber-rich foods that can trigger bloating in some people include legumes (such as beans, peas, and lentils), whole grains, fruit (such as apples and oranges), brussels sprouts, and broccoli. Fatty foods—especially solids—take a long time to digest, so they might cause problems if your stomach tends to empty slowly.

While many people reach for a ginger ale if their stomach is upset, the bubbles in this drink might make the problem worse. Opt for a ginger tea instead, or stick to ginger ale that’s gone flat."
