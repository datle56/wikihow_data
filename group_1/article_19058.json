    {
      "title": "Upgrade your DE storages and drills.",
      "content": "Upgrade your DE storages and drills. This will cost elixir, but will make your storages have more hitpoints and improve the mining rate of your drills. A level one drill will hold 360 DE in one hour. A max drill will hold 1,800 DE in an hour. This is a very significant change in your DE farming and you should prioritize upgrading these before your elixir/gold collectors and mines. Make sure you can get on often enough. Otherwise, full drills will look very attractive to attackers, especially if they're maxed."

      "title": "Collect the dark elixir from its resources (dark elixir drills).",
      "content": "Collect the dark elixir from its resources (dark elixir drills). Dark Elixir drills are the one source to collect dark elixir without attacking. They fill up every hour with 360 DE at the lowest level. If you collect it 6 times, you will get 2160 dark elixir. At max level, they hold 1,800 DE and that's 10,800 DE if you collect it 6 times. This will make a large difference over time. You can boost your drills to make them produce faster."

      "title": "Make a good base layout to protect your dark elixir.",
      "content": "Make a good base layout to protect your dark elixir. Put your dark elixir storage in the center along with the clan castle and your hero altars. Have a layer of walls around this. In the next layer, put your air defenses, mortars, wizard towers, and bomb tower(s). This will protect your DE against most attackers. You can have your town hall in the second layer of walls to lure attackers who want trophies, or you can put it in the center as well. Putting your town hall in the center will protect your trophies, but make your DE more vulnerable. You can put your DE drills near the center if you wish, although you may not have space. To make your base stronger against any attacker, make compartments and use your traps wisely. Make a tesla farm by your DE storage by putting all of them close together. This packs a huge punch and will help protect your dark elixir."

      "title": "Request clan castle troops from your clan.",
      "content": "Request clan castle troops from your clan. These will help defend your base against attackers. Go to your clan castle and click request. You can ask for specific troops if you would like. It is recommended to request an Electro Dragon if you have enough space, and fill the remaining space with Valkyries and Wizards. Make sure you don't get wall-breakers, hog riders, giants, or goblins. You can also go to the clan chat tab to request troops."

      "title": "Use tricks to save your dark elixir.",
      "content": "Use tricks to save your dark elixir. During special events, DE troops may be discounted for 10% of their original price. Take advantage of this by training a regular army and then loading up on the DE troop right before the event ends. Then, untrain the DE elixir troops to get refunded for the original price. You can also bank up dark elixir before bed to hide it from attackers. Have an army in your army camps and then load up with golems or witches. This will preserve the DE in your barracks hiding it from any attackers. For example, if you train golems for 450 dark elixir each during the special event and then untrain them for 4500 dark elixir each, you'll make 4050 dark elixir per golem. You can train up to 6-8 golems depending on your army camp levels which leads to a lot of extra DE. Make sure you have an army trained before both the DE armies. Otherwise, it'll all end up in your army camps and be wasted. Don't forget to untrain the armies when you log on again! With the DE bank strategy, use golems and witches because they have the most DE value per housing space. You can also train earthquake spells in your dark barracks."

      "title": "Use your treasury to store extra dark elixir.",
      "content": "Use your treasury to store extra dark elixir. An attacker can only take 3% of what is in your treasury, but 10-18% of your DE storage. Keep your loot in here until you can use it for the optimal protection. This doesn't make much of an impact in one day, but adds up to 1,000 extra DE over time. You can gain loot in your treasury from clan wars, clan games, and star bonuses."

    {
      "title": "Go up in trophies.",
      "content": "Go up in trophies. You will begin to find large amounts of dark elixir in the Gold Leagues and Crystal is the best spot, where you can get 2,000 or more per raid. You can go even higher if you are a TH10 to Masters League and get a 500 dark elixir league bonus every base you star."

    {
      "title": "Select a good army",
      "content": "Select a good army for collecting DE. You will need a strong army that will probably cost a lot of elixir to get to the dark elixir storage in most bases. If you just want to farm from exposed drills, you will have a cheaper army that will be ready much faster. However, many people do semi-protect their DE drills and you may not get a 1 star with these attacks. For strong attacks, use a trophy pushing army suitable for your TH level to get the dark elixir. For TH7-8, use mass dragons. For TH8-9, use giants or goblin knife. For TH9-11, you can use LavaLoon or baby loon. For a light army, use barch (barbarians and archers) or giant-barch. These will train quickly and help you get to the DE drills. With giant-barch, you may be able to get to some DE storages. Don't use BAM (barbarians, archers, and minions), hog riders, or golems, as they cost dark elixir and will make your DE farming less efficient. Have an attack that uses minimal dark elixir if any at all."

    {
      "title": "Choose the right base.",
      "content": "Choose the right base. If you have a strong attack, look for a nearly full DE storage on a base that isn't too difficult for you to attack. For the light attack, find a base with full DE drills that you can get too. Check out the black box on top of the drill. If it is full, then it will hold from 360- to over 1000 DE each. Get some practice so you know how strong your attacks are and whether you can handle a base. You can also lightning drills to get quite a large amount from them if you don't mind wasting the elixir. Make sure you have a plan to get through all the wall layers, or at least to the DE storage. If you have jump or quake spells, these are typically used on inside wall compartments, while wall-breakers are used on the first layer."

    {
      "title": "Participate in clan wars.",
      "content": "Participate in clan wars . If your clan does farming wars, this is an especially good tactic, but you will get plenty of loot from competitive warring clans too. Pick a base that you can 3 star, preferably at your TH level or one lower. Use a strong attack or practice a powerful farming one. You will get a large amount of loot that will be stored in your treasury. Try to win the war so you don't have penalties on your loot. Help your clan fill up clan castle to protect your bases."

    {
      "title": "Know when to use your spells.",
      "content": "Know when to use your spells. Sometimes, a spell at the right time can win you the match and some juicy DE. But when should you use them? Lightning and poison spells are best spent on the clan castle troops. Rage when your troops start going into the core or approach a large group of buildings. Heal when the health of your units starts to go down and around splash defenses. Use the Earthquake spells before the match and jump to open up the inside wall compartments. Deploy the spells so that your troops are on the very edge of the radius. This will maximize the spell's effectiveness, especially since they last for quite a long time. Try to predict where your units will go and place your spells in that direction. Be careful not to accidentally drop your spells; something that is easily done. Know that clan castle troops will now run from a poison spell, unless engaged with your troops."
