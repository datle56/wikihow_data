      "title": "Invest in a push-up bra.",
      "content": "Invest in a push-up bra. Push-up bras are an easy and affordable way to instantly gain a cup size or two. Push up bras make cleavage appear younger, firmer and larger and can be purchased at any specialty bra store or most stores where bras are sold. [1] X Research source Look for a push-up bra that pushes breasts up and together. Opt for a bra with a wide backband – this will also help to support your breasts."

      "title": "Try a padded bra.",
      "content": "Try a padded bra. Padded bras work to boost your breasts at the bottom, lifting the breast upwards to sit on top of the padding. Look for a bra that sits snugly around your body and doesn’t cause your breasts to spill out of the cups. [2] X Research source If you’re wearing a deep cut top, look for a padded plunge bra. These bras position the padding on the sides to centralize your cleavage. Padded bras fit tighter than regular bras, so try a size larger than you might normally wear."

      "title": "Get sized for a bra every year.",
      "content": "Get sized for a bra every year. If you have a favorite bra, you probably wear it regularly and that will cause it to stretch out. Additionally, your breast size may fluctuate due to weight loss or gain. Visit a department store once a year for a fitting and to replace any old bras that may not be working anymore. [3] X Research source Continuing to wear old bras may cause your breasts to sag. If your breasts are on the larger side, always wear a bra with underwire for maximum support."

      "title": "Utilize silicone chicken cutlets.",
      "content": "Utilize silicone chicken cutlets. If your want full, gravity-defying cleavage like Kim Kardashian, wear a push-up bra and insert a silicone chicken cutlet into the bottom of each bra cup. The cutlets will help boost your bust and make your breasts look fuller. [4] X Research source For deeper cleavage, apply the cutlet to the outside of each breast. [5] X Research source Place the cutlet high on the nipple, instead of centered on top of it, for a perkier breast. Buy your pushup bra in your correct size, but look for one with a tight band. Cutlets can be purchased online, or in many stores that sell clothing and lingerie."

      "title": "Tape your breasts.",
      "content": "Tape your breasts. While nothing can support your breasts like a bra, tape is ideal for instances where you can’t wear one (for example, if you’re wearing a dress with a plunging neckline or an open back). [6] X Research source Make sure your skin is free from lotions and oils before applying. To apply, start with a piece of tape between 12 – 16” long. Place the tape over your nipple, then pull it up to attach it to your side, near your underarm. [7] X Research source Trim any excess tape and smooth the tape flat against your chest. Duct tape and gaffer’s tape yield the best results. Avoid using this trick if you have sensitive skin."

    {
      "title": "Apply breast lift tape.",
      "content": "Apply breast lift tape. Breast lift tape works similarly to using duct tape, but is only applied to the portion of the breast, just above the nipples. To apply breast lift tape, place the adhesive directly over the nipple. Remove the paper from the upper half of the adhesive and attach the sticky upper portion to the upper portion of your chest. [8] X Research source Smooth the tape gently to remove any air-pockets. Breast lift tape does not provide a great deal of support and tends to work better for women with smaller cup sizes. Breast lift tape can be purchased online or in stores like Target."

[9] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020. Try wearing a dress or top in a bandeau cut - this will offer support and also push your breasts up so they look bigger and perkier. Try wearing a bodysuit. Look for one with built-in foam cups to provide the support you would normally get from your bra. [10] X Research source If you can’t find a bodysuit with cups, buy cups at a fabric store and take them to a seamstress to have them sewn in. Try engineered shapewear for results that are designed to mimic the effects of plastic surgery. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a corset. Corsets aren’t just for period pieces anymore – modern women use corsets to narrow the middle portion of their bodies and make their breasts appear larger and more pronounced. [12] X Research source Look for a corset that has boning; this will serve as a makeshift bra. Do not immediately tighten your corset after putting it on. Give your body a few minutes to adjust before lacing yourself in. [13] X Research source"

[15] X Research source If your breasts spill over the tops and sides of your bra, it’s time to get remeasured. Breasts should be lifted and separated when wearing a V-neck top. If they are too squished together, opt for a different bra."

[16] X Research source Sweep dark bronzer from where your bra strap meets your cup down to the inner edge of your cleavage. Repeat on the other side of your chest. Brush the light bronzer in a straight line down the middle of your cleavage and across your collarbone. For best results, wear a push up bra when making up your chest."
