The derivative describes how the slope of a curve changes as x, the horizontal value, changes. Drawing a tangent line allows you to estimate the derivative (the tangent slope) at a given point. [1] X Research source A tangent line is a straight line that touches a curve at a single point. The tangent slope is the slope of the tangent line. Make sure your curve and tangent line are drawn on a graph with grid lines. This will make it easier to calculate the tangent slope. Since this is a hand-drawn method, this calculation will only be an estimate, not the exact derivative at a point."
