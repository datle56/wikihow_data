      "content": "Write the double-digit numbers on top of each other. Place 1 of the double-digit numbers on top and the other double-digit number directly below it. While there's no right or wrong way to place the numbers, if you have a double-digit that ends with a zero such as 40, place it on the bottom, and put any number with more (nonzero) digits on top. This will let you skip a calculation. [1] X Research source For example, if you're multiplying 22 by 43, you can put either number on the top or bottom."

Just use the bottom one's number and multiply it by the one's number directly above it. Write the result directly below the line. [2] X Research source So for 22 x 43, you'll multiply 3 by 2 to get 6."

      "content": "Multiply the bottom one's number by the number of the top ten. Use the same bottom number and multiply it by the number of the top ten. Then write the result under the line so it's directly below the tens space. [3] X Research source For example, with 22 x 43, you'll now need to multiply 3 by the other 2 to get 6. The number under your line should be 66."

      "title": "Place a zero under your result.",
      "content": "Place a zero under your result. Before you begin multiplying the next part, place a zero under the one's place. This will hold the space so you can begin multiplying the bottom tens number. [4] X Research source So if you've got 66 as your first result, put a 0 right under the 6 in the ones place."

Write the result next to the zero you wrote. [5] X Research source For example, 4 x 2 = 8, so write an 8 next to the 0."

Remember to write the extra value over the tens place. [7] X Research source For example, if you're multiplying 96 by 8, when you multiply the 6 by 8, you'll get 48. Instead of writing 48 below your line, write an 8 and carry the 4."
