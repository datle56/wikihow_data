      "content": "Wear open-toe shoes to the beach. Although any open toe shoe is a fine option, gravitate toward flip-flops. Flip-flops prevent sand from becoming trapped in your shoes because it falls freely out of your sandals as you walk."

      "content": "Wash yourself off underneath the beach shower head. Beaches provide showers outside of their restrooms on the way to the parking lot to help patrons clean themselves off before hitting the road again. Rinse yourself and your bathing suit as thoroughly as possible, pay special attention to your shoes and feet. For a more intense rinse session, use the ocean waves at the beach to help you with a pre-rinse wash. Use the shower head to wash off any toys, buckets, or accessories that might have gotten a little sandy while at the beach."

      "title": "Pour water into the basin.",
      "content": "Pour water into the basin. Make sure there is enough water in the basin that feet are completely submerged underneath the water. Use your hands to douse sandy areas of the skin with water. In the place of your hands, a clean sponge can be used to help with sand removal. Be gentle with your skin as you get the sand off. It’s easy to get abrasions if you rub too hard."
