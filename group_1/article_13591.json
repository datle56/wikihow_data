Because a chemical reaction can never create or destroy new matter, a given equation is unbalanced if the number (and types) of atoms on each side of the equation don't perfectly match. [2] X Research source Don’t forget to multiply through by a coefficient or subscript if one is present. For example, H 2 SO 4 + Fe ---> Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 + H 2 On the reactant (left) side of the equation there are 2 H atoms (H 2 ), 1 S atom, 4 O atoms (O 4 ), and 1 Fe atom. On the product (right) side of the equation there are 2H atoms (H 2 ), 3 S atoms (S 3 ), 12 O atoms (O 12 ), and 2 Fe atoms (Fe 2 )."

Identify the lowest common factor between all elements that aren’t oxygen and hydrogen (you will balance these next) to get equal numbers of atoms on both sides. [3] X Research source For example, the lowest common factor between 2 and 1 is 2 for Fe. Add a 2 in front of the Fe on the left side to balance it. The lowest common factor between 3 and 1 is 3 for S. Add a 3 in front of H 2 SO 4 to balance the left and right sides. At this stage, our equation looks like this: 3 H 2 SO 4 + 2 Fe ---> Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 + H 2"

At this stage in balancing the equation, don’t forget to recount the atoms if you’ve added coefficients to molecules. [4] X Research source In our example, we added a 3 in front of H 2 SO 4 and now have 6 hydrogens on the left and only 2 on the right side of the equation. We also have 12 oxygen on the left and 12 oxygen on the right, so it is balanced. We can balance hydrogens by adding a 3 in front of H 2 . Our final balanced equation is 3 H 2 SO 4 + 2 Fe ---> Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 + 3 H 2 ."

This can be done by again adding up all of the atoms on either side of the equation to make sure they are equal on both sides. [5] X Research source Let's check our equation, 3 H 2 SO 4 + 2 Fe ---> Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 + 3 H 2 , for balance. On the left side of the arrow, there are 6 H, 3 S, 12 O, and 2 Fe. On the right side of the arrow, there are 2 Fe, 3 S, 12 O, and 6 H. The left and the right sides of the equation match, therefore, it is now balanced."

      "content": "Calculate the molar mass of the compound given in grams. The molar mass is the amount in grams (g) of one mole of a compound. [6] X Research source It allows you to easily convert between grams and moles of a substance. [7] X Research source To calculate the molar mass, you need to identify how many molecules of an element are in the compound and the atomic mass of each element in the compound. Define the number of atoms of each element in a compound. For example, glucose is C 6 H 12 O 6 , there are 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Identify the atomic mass in grams per mol (g/mol) of each atom. The atomic masses of each element are usually found underneath the element's symbol on a periodic table, usually as a decimal. The atomic masses of the elements in glucose are: carbon, 12.0107 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 g/mol. Multiply each element's atomic mass by the number of atoms present in the compound. Carbon: 12.0107 x 6 = 72.0642 g/mol; Hydrogen: 1.007 x 12 = 12.084 g/mol; Oxygen: 15.9994 x 6 = 95.9964 g/mol. Adding these products together yields the molar mass of the compound. 72.0642 + 12.084 + 95.9964 = 180.1446 g/mol. 180.14 grams is the mass of one mole of glucose."

Divide the known amount of grams (g) by the molar mass (g/mol).

For example: How many moles are in 8.2 grams of hydrogen chloride (HCl)? The atomic mass of H is 1.007 and Cl is 35.453 making the molar mass of the compound 1.007 + 35.453 = 36.46 g/mol.

The molar ratio tells you the ratio in which substances react with each other and is given by the coefficient of the species in the balanced reaction. [10] X Research source For example, what is the molar ratio of KClO 3 to O 2 in the reaction 2 KClO 3 ---> 2 KCl + 3 O 2 . First, check to see the equation is balanced. Never forget this step or your ratios will be wrong. In this case there are equal amounts of each element on both sides of the reaction so it is balanced. The ratio of KClO 3 to O 2 is 2/3. It doesn’t matter which number goes on top or on bottom as long as you keep the same compounds on the top and bottom throughout the rest of the problem. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Cross-multiply by the molar ratio to find moles of other reactant. To calculate the number of moles of a species produced or required for a reaction, you will use the molar ratio. [12] X Research source Problems will usually ask you to determine the number of moles required or the number of moles produced in a reaction given a certain number of grams of reactant. For example, given the reaction N 2 + 3 H 2 ---> 2 NH 3 how many moles of NH 3 will be produced given 3.00 grams of N 2 reacting with sufficient H 2 ? In this example, sufficient H 2 means that there is enough available and you don’t have to take it into account to solve the problem. First, convert grams of N 2 to moles. The atomic mass of nitrogen is 14.0067 g/mol so the molar mass of N 2 is 28.0134 g/mol. Dividing mass by molar mass gives you 3.00 g/28.0134 g/mol = 0.107 mol. Set up the ratios given by the question: NH 3 : N 2 = x/0.107 mol. Cross multiply this ratio by the molar ratio of NH 3 to N 2 : 2:1. x/0.107 mol = 2/1 = (2 x 0.107) = 1x = 0.214 mol."

If you are given a reaction that does not occur at STP, you will have to use the ideal gas law PV = nRT to determine the number of moles in the reaction. P is pressure in atmospheres, V is volume in liters, n is the number of moles, R is the gas law constant 0.0821 L-atm/mol-degree, and T is the temperature in kelvins. [15] X Research source The equation can be rearranged to solve for moles: n = RT/PV. The units of the gas constant are designed to cancel out the units of the other variables. For example, determine the number of moles in 2.4 liters of O 2 at 300 K and 1.5 atm. Plugging in the variables yields: n = (0.0821 x 300)/(1.5 x 2) = 24.63/3.6 = 6.842 moles of O 2"
