      "title": "Choose dye created for your specific fabric.",
      "content": "Choose dye created for your specific fabric. Dye adheres differently to different fabrics, so read the garment tag to figure out what your dress is made from. Some companies, like Rit, make one dye for both natural and synthetic fibers, while other companies, like iDye, have one dye for natural fabrics and one for synthetic fabrics. Make sure you have enough dye to color the fabric to the desired shade. Keep in mind that natural fabrics, like cotton, wool, silk, and linen, are more easily dyed than synthetic fabrics, like nylon, polyester, and acrylic. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak your dress in warm water. It’s important to completely wet your dress before attempting to dye it so that the dye will be absorbed evenly. Fill a bucket or bathtub with warm water and submerge your dress until the fabric is completely soaked. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill a bucket or stainless steel sink with very hot water.",
      "content": "Fill a bucket or stainless steel sink with very hot water. Don’t attempt to dye fabrics in a porcelain sink or tub, as they may become stained. Ensure the bucket or sink is large enough for the garment to fit in loosely. Fill a bucket or stainless steel sink with the hottest water possible from the faucet. The amount of water you need will depend on how much dye you are using, so refer to the package instructions. [5] X Research source If your dress is made of wool, use warm rather than hot water to keep the fabric from felting. [6] X Research source"

Pour the dye into the water and use a stainless steel spoon to thoroughly mix the dye and water together.

Constant stirring ensures that the fabric is evenly dyed. The color you are trying to achieve will dictate how long you let the dress soak in the dye. [11] X Research source Check the color of the fabric every 5 minutes or so. Some of the dye will rinse out, so let the fabric soak until it is a shade or two darker than desired."

Ensure the washing machine is empty before adding your dyed dress. [12] X Research source Don’t rinse your dress in the shower or tub if it is made of porcelain because the dye may stain it."

The first few times you wash your dress, you should wash it alone or with dark colors that won’t be affected if the dye leaches out of the fabric. Use a mild detergent and set your washing machine to the cold cycle to help set the dye, as warm water may cause the color to fade. [16] X Research source"
