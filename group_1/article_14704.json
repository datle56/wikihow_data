      "content": "Shape your outfit. The 80s were defined by a unique blend of different styles that emphasized extravagance and materialism. Over-the-top clothing in bold (often neon) colors was the norm. [1] X Research source Women’s fashion leaned toward oversized tops paired with leggings, tight pants, or a miniskirt. Pull out any and all leggings you might have, in any color. These could be worked in to almost any 80s style outfit you can come up with. Get an oversized T-shirt, preferably in a neon color. Roll the sleeves up and cut the neck out so that it hangs off your shoulder. Wear a brightly-colored tank top under it."

      "content": "Mix and match styles and colors. Mixing bold, bright (usually neon) colors was very stylish in the 80s. Incorporating lace, designer logos and shoulder pads on top of the bright colors was even trendier. Everything in the 80s had to be big and loud, so start putting together outfit ideas that include bright colors, extravagant designs and anything with shoulder pads. Pair bright leggings with an oversized t-shirt in a contrasting color. Add one or two more colorful accessories, such as a belts or a pair of leg warmers. Add some lace! Wear lacy black tights under a brightly-colored miniskirt, or a loose, black lace top over a bright miniskirt and neon tights. Raid your parents' closet for anything with shoulder pads. If you can't find anything, create your own shoulder pads by stuffing socks into the shoulders of your top."

      "content": "Wear acid-washed denim. Acid-washed jeans were huge in the 80s and women opted for a slim-fitting, high-waisted fit. Acid-washed jean jackets were also staples in the 80s, worn by both men and women. Buy a denim jacket from a thrift shop, then cut the sleeves off and wash it so that the shoulders fray a little. Acid-wash an old pair of jeans to give them an authentic 80s feel. All you need is bleach, rubber bands, and your chosen jeans."

      "content": "Accessorize excessively with bright colors. Neon colored sunglasses in large sizes, lots of colored bangles on both arms and huge hoop earrings are great jewelry choices. [2] X Research source Look for anything with lace, especially gloves and headbands, to add to your ensemble as additional accessories. Costume jewelry was also very popular. The chunkier, gaudier, and brighter, the better. The 80s celebrated excess!"

For instance, try to track down a brightly colored fanny pack to wear with your outfit. \"Members Only\" jackets were very popular at the time, as well, and are relatively easy to find at thrift stores.

      "title": "Experiment with 80s hair styles.",
      "content": "Experiment with 80s hair styles. There are several ways to approach 80s hair, but one thing all of the styles have in common is that they are big and hairsprayed. Perms were extremely common and curly hairstyles were very fashionable. Crimped hair was also popular – some stores still carry hair crimpers, if you want to try to look for one. Style your hair with a curling iron or a hair crimper, then tease it to your desired size and shape. Hairspray your hair and then tease it a little more. Flip your head upside down and tease the underside of your hair to get even more volume. Finish it off with a healthy blast of hairspray. Try a side ponytail. Curl, tease and hairspray your ponytail and secure it with several scrunchies in different colors. If you have bangs, tease them as high as you can get them and secure with hairspray."

      "content": "Create the 80s makeup look. Loud, heavy makeup and neon colors were popular makeup styles in the 80s. Lips were usually pale and eye makeup was bright and emphasized dark, thick eyelashes with lots of eyeliner. [3] X Research source Apply eyeshadow with a heavy hand. Bright, neon colors work just as well as dark, gothic colors. Line your top and bottom eyelids with thick black eyeliner, along with your water line. Finish it off with several coats of mascara and a light, frosty shade of lipstick or lip gloss. For real life makeup and hairstyle references, look up pictures of icons like Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Molly Ringwald and Siouxsie Sioux."

The 1970s had several style movements, with the most remembered being a continuation of the 1960s bohemian look, the glittery androgyny of glam rock and the decadent disco fashion. The most popular silhouette of the decade was that of a tight-fitting top and loose-fitting bottom. For something more subtle, try a tight-fitting concert t-shirt and hip hugger jeans with canvas sneakers or tennis shoes. For a boho look, pair a flowing, gauzy top with a long maxi skirt. Mix-and-match earthy tones with ethnic prints. [4] X Research source Add a headband and delicate scarf for an instant 70s hippie look."

      "content": "Wear jeans with flared, bell bottom, or wide legs. Hip huggers and high-waisted jeans were also popular in the 70s. These styles sometimes come back into current fashion, so it’s entirely possible that you can find a new pair. You can also look for more authentic versions at thrift shops, probably with much cheaper price tags. Jeans in the 70s often came decorated with embroidery, embellishments, and studs, so keep an eye out for those details."

      "content": "Accessorize with simple pieces made of natural materials. Thrift shops will be gold mines for these items. Look for jewelry made of wood, shells, stones, feathers, Indian beads and leather. Mix and match the pieces. Add a big, floppy hat and large sunglasses as final touches. Moccasin boots and Birkenstocks were the most popular shoes for the bohemian look. You could also try leather sandals or clogs. Fringe adorned everything – incorporate it in any way that you can."

      "content": "Try out the glam rock look. Glam rock clothing was flamboyant, brightly colored and made of fabrics like satin, velvet and spandex. Androgynous looks for both sexes were embraced and shiny fabrics in bright colors defined the era. Go for anything sequined, bedazzled, gemmed, tight-fitting and outrageously accentuated. Glittery items and otherworldly costumes are also ways to look glam. Accessorize with feather boas, giant sunglasses, and anything with leather and studs. Leather jackets, ascots, velvet coats and silk scarves all work great here. [5] X Research source Wear shiny, glittery, sequined or neon-colored tights with your ensemble."

      "content": "Go disco. Disco fashion was defined by glamour, eccentricity and decadence. Sequins and tight-fitting clothing could be found in every discotheque. Disco fashions were created with ease of movement in mind and included wrap-around skirts, leotards, tube tops, and dancewear-inspired dresses made of form-fitting fabrics like spandex. Wear a sequined tube top with tight pants or short shorts. Spandex pieces in neon colors and anything that would glitter under dance floor lights work perfectly. Pair a colorful leotard with a wrap-around skirt from a dancewear shop. Add anything else that is eye-catching and sparkly. Accessorize with huge, glittery costume jewelry pieces and knee high boots or very high heeled shoes (platforms if you can find them). It's a good idea to pair the boots with a skirt just above the knee, so you don't have to do much skin showing, but not so that you're like you're drowning in it either."

      "content": "Experiment with 1970s hairstyles . The main hairstyles of the 70s were feathered, shaggy or long with a center part. Try creating the wispy feathered hairstyle and spraying it with golden spray-on hair color (like the ones you see around Halloween) to get the frosted look so popular in the 70s. If you have layers in your hair, spray it with dry shampoo to get volume and texture, then add a texturizing pomade to define your layers. Keep it a little messy. For those with long hair, simply part it down the middle and let it hang loose and free. Add a little product to make it shine."

For glam or disco looks you can’t go wrong with brightly colored, highly glossed lips and “cat” eyeliner. [6] X Research source Apply eyeshadow that is heavy, frosted, shimmery or glittery. Use plenty of black eyeliner and black mascara. If you want to go all-out, wear long false lashes. For the bohemian look, wear pale peach or pink lipstick, as they preferred a natural look.

Jeans came in all colors of the rainbow and often featured embroidery or appliqued designs. Keep an eye out for those details or add them yourself. Look for blouses with long and flowy \"bubble\" sleeves. Gauzy fabrics work great, too. Wear a simple chiffon baby-doll dress with spaghetti-straps for a feminine look."

Paint images of daisies, rainbows, and peace signs on your cheeks or forehead. Add some face glitter for a little sparkle. For those that did wear makeup, it was variable. However a pale mouth, large false eye lashes and exaggerated eye makeup will be instantly recognizable. For real life references of 60s makeup and hairstyles, look up pictures of icons like Twiggy, Brigitte Bardot, Janis Joplin, Edie Sedgewick, Jane Birkin and Marianne Faithfull."

Polka dots, gingham, florals, stripes, plaids and novelty themes (like science and western themes) are all great choices for the printed fabric. Halter sundresses, full skirts, and Peter Pan collars (flat collars that feature rounded ends that meet in the middle) are variations on the simple dress theme. Poodle skirts were a fleeting fad at the time, but now are iconic for many people when thinking of 50s fashion. Check your local costume shop for a big fluffy one. The pencil skirt was a fitted skirt that fell just below the knee. Pair one with a collared, button down dress shirt or a fitted sweater for another iconic 50s look."
