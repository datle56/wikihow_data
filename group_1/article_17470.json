      "content": "Purchase an adhesive sealant from a hardware store or online. Popular brands of adhesives that can be used in shoe repair include Shoe Goo, Liquid Nails, and Gorilla Glue. Read reviews of each product and purchase the one that fits your needs and budget. [1] X Research source Using most adhesives will leave a clear or milky film wherever it dries. Adhesives can be used to fix holes in leather shoes, sneakers, and skate shoes. Shoe Goo comes in clear and black."

      "title": "Remove the insole if you are repairing the sole of the shoe.",
      "content": "Remove the insole if you are repairing the sole of the shoe. Peel the insole out of the bottom of the shoe from the heel. If the insole is glued to the bottom of the shoe, leave it in the shoe while you repair it. [2] X Research source Set the insole aside so that you can replace it later."

    {
      "title": "Apply duct tape over the hole on the inside of the shoe.",
      "content": "Apply duct tape over the hole on the inside of the shoe. Lay the sticky side of the duct tape down inside of the shoe and cover up the hole. The tape will give the adhesive filler something to stick to. Make sure the entire hole is covered. [3] X Research source If you don’t have duct tape, you can use electrical tape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze the adhesive on top of the holes.",
      "content": "Squeeze the adhesive on top of the holes. Tilt the tube or bottle of glue over the hole and squeeze it so that the glue completely covers the hole. Ensure the hole is covered with the adhesive on the outside of the shoe or it won’t create a watertight seal. [4] X Research source It’s normal for the glue to clump over the hole. Don’t worry about getting the adhesive to look clean on the shoe during this application."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread the shoe glue over the holes in an even layer.",
      "content": "Spread the shoe glue over the holes in an even layer. The adhesive will be too sticky at first, so give it 1-2 minutes to dry so that it can partially harden. Once it hardens, use a wooden stick or your finger to spread the glue in an even layer on the outside of the shoe. [5] X Research source Don’t leave the stick or your finger in one spot for too long or it will get stuck to the glue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the adhesive dry overnight.",
      "content": "Let the adhesive dry overnight. Give the adhesive enough time to fully dry and form a seal. The hole in your shoe should now be plugged up and waterproof. Press down on the adhesive to ensure that it is firmly attached to your shoe. [6] X Research source If you don't give the adhesive enough time to dry, it will smear off the shoe."

    {
      "title": "Remove the duct tape and replace the insole.",
      "content": "Remove the duct tape and replace the insole. When you remove the tape, the adhesive should be flat on the inside of your shoe. If you were fixing a hole in the sole of the shoe, reinsert the insole before wearing them. If everything was done properly, the hole in your shoe should now be fixed. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Stuff the shoe with newspaper.",
      "content": "Stuff the shoe with newspaper. Filling up the shoe will fill out the shoe and make it easier to apply the patch. This method is best used on softer-material shoes, like suede or sheepskin boots or shoes. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase the fabric to patch your shoes.",
      "content": "Purchase the fabric to patch your shoes. The fabric patch that you use on the shoe will be visible on the outside, so get a fabric that matches your shoes existing style. You can buy fabric online or at a craft store. Buy enough fabric so that you can fully cover the size of the hole. [9] X Research source You can purchase fabric that almost matches the color of your shoes if you don't want the patch to be as noticeable. Good fabrics to use include tartan, leather, and suede. You can also purchase fabric that contrasts with the current color of your shoes for a unique fashion statement."

    {
      "title": "Cut out a piece of fabric large enough to cover the hole.",
      "content": "Cut out a piece of fabric large enough to cover the hole. Cut a rectangular or square piece of fabric to cover the hole. Depending on the location of the hole, you may want to adjust the size of the patch so that it doesn’t look awkward on the shoe. [10] X Research source For example, if the hole is on the toe of the shoe, use a patch that covers the entire toe rather than a small patch that just covers the hole. If you want your shoes to match, cut out 2 pieces of fabric so that you can apply a patch to your other shoe, even if it doesn’t have a hole."

    {
      "title": "Pin the fabric to the shoe.",
      "content": "Pin the fabric to the shoe. Adjust the placement of the patch and make sure that it looks straight before you sew it in place. You may also want to recut the piece of fabric if you don't like the way it looks on your shoe. [11] X Research source If you are placing a patch on both shoes, make sure that their placement is identical."

      "title": "Steam iron the patch to the shoe.",
      "content": "Steam iron the patch to the shoe. Put a damp cloth over the patch on the shoe, then hold a steam iron over the patch for 5-10 seconds. Repeat this 3-4 times to flatten out the edges of the patch and make it adhere to the form of your shoe or boot. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Sew",
      "content": "Sew the patch onto the shoe. Pierce a needle and thread through the patch and into the shoe. Then thread the needle up out of the shoe and through the patch. Continue going around the edge of the patch using this method until it is secured to the fabric on the shoe. Tie off the ends of the thread with a knot to hold the patch in place. [13] X Research source Use the same color thread as the shoe and sew around the patch. Try to make your stitches as uniform as possible. You can also use more complex stitches like a catch-stitch or slip-stitch to create a unique look."
