      "content": "Choose your layout. There are a number of ways that you can lay out your board. The design is not as important as having all of the necessary symbols. You need to include at least the letters of the alphabet, numbers 0–9, and the words \"Yes\",\"No\", and \"Farewell\". Use the traditional layout if you want to. This is where the letters are written out in two slightly arced lines at the center, with \"Yes\" and \"No\" above and the numbers and \"Farewell\" below. You could also use a diamond layout. In this design, the letters are written in a diamond shape, with each of the four points lining up with the center of that side of the board. The numbers are written inside this diamond and the corners are allocated for the words (allowing for an additional phrase, like \"not now\"). You could also try a circular layout. This design is similar to the diamond, but uses an oval shape instead."

Beliefs vary, but common symbols include: the moon, sun, and stars; the symbols for the elements; the symbols for the planets; and symbols or images in neurologically significant quantities (For example 12, 13, 7, 3). You can also embellish your board with physical objects, such as set spots for candles, attached stones (quartz is good for this purpose), or places to put the elements (a bowl of water, a branch, and other such items)."

      "content": "Pick your colors. Choose a color scheme for your board. Darker, earth tones tend to be better at calling forth the spirits. If you are looking to contact particularly cheerful spirits, there is nothing wrong with using colors you think they would prefer. If you are trying to contact someone in particular, try their favorite color. Try to use colors that contrast well. You want to be able to read your text easily."

You can rescue one from a random set you find at a dollar store, or you can make your own . You can stay safe while using an Ouija board by switching off your energy. It means all information comes to your higher self. You can make some affirmation or say something, like, only things that are to your highest good come to you. If you ask your higher self to be the guide, the spirit you want to talk to or reach does not have to get in your body. It can communicate with you remaining outside your body or energy field."
