[1] X Research source Without a judgment by the court, there is no divorce. Avoiding divorce myths can help you find the information that you need. There is no such thing as a \"secret divorce\" or \"emergency divorce.\" Divorce proceedings are public records governed by state law. Some details, especially concerning children, may be sealed by the court, but the existence of the divorce, the parties, and the case number are public records and those records can be found. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Divorce must be granted by a court. There is no \"common law divorce,\" meaning that if you are separated for a certain amount of time, you are automatically divorced. A divorce action does not begin until a petition is filed with the court. On the other side, there is no requirement for you to consent to the divorce. A common myth is that you can only be divorced if you agree. Your spouse can file for a divorce in any court where she can establish jurisdiction. No divorce can proceed without giving you notice. However, depending on the circumstances, that notice may be in a newspaper in your, or your spouse's, hometown. Don't assume that because you haven't been served that there isn't a divorce proceeding pending."
