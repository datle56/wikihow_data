If you want to get Eevee without resorting to cheating, you'll need to start a game of either and get at least as far as Celadon City. [1] X Research source It's important to keep in mind you'll need to have collected at least 60 Pokémon and completed the Sevii Islands sidequest to open up trading."

It's highly unlikely that one game would erase it without copying on the other, so try again and you should be able to get it down right."
