Leaning on this sense of mutual adaptability can be a potentially strong foundation for a future partnership. Tip: Look for activities that you both enjoy. ENTP and ISFP both thrive in environments that demand flexibility—so why not use that as a starting point?

A little compromise and intentional communication can go a long way in helping this pair hit their stride. Tip: Focus on what you have in common, whether that’s cooking, going for bike rides, or watching ghost documentaries.

This may, however, be frustrating for an ENTP’s partner to deal with, especially if simple and ordinary conversations are constantly being turned into debates.

Sometimes, though, ENTP can be a bit too candid with their thoughts, and may not always consider the other person’s feelings before they speak.

While they’re getting to know someone, ENTP is more than happy to get a discussion going to see how their potential friend responds. [16] X Research source Tip: Don’t use debates and discussions as the sole means of determining your future friendships. There are plenty of lovely individuals out there who might not be all that invested in friendly debates."

A true thinker and analyst at heart, ENTP often views their friends’ trouble as problems to be solved, rather than as an opportunity to provide solace and comfort. [17] X Research source Tip: Practicing empathy can go a long way, even if it’s not the default move in your playbook. Try to put yourself in a friend’s position and validate how they’re feeling rather than immediately looking for a solution to their problem."
