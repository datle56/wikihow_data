      "content": "Grab a newspaper and discard pages with lots of dark or colorful ink. Try to use pages with the most “white space” on them, like ones without photos or large titles that concentrate lots of ink in one spot. Pages with pictures, for example, could leak ink onto white or light colored shoes (especially since they’re wet). If you notice small ink spots on leather shoes once they’re dry, buff them out with a cotton pad dipped in isopropyl alcohol (just don’t use it on the soles). [1] X Research source Newspaper is safe to use on any shoe type or material. It will also prevent an odor from forming by absorbing bacteria. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the insoles and laces from the shoes and set them out to dry. Once the shoes are clean, unlace them and pull out the insoles (if possible), then place them in a well-ventilated spot away from direct sunlight to dry. Consider hanging your shoelaces on a drying rack or shower curtain rod like you would with wet clothes. [3] X Research source Direct sunlight will dry your shoes quickly, but may cause the color and material to fade faster than with normal wear and tear. If you want to clean your shoes while they’re already wet, wipe away dirt or mud with a damp cloth or an old toothbrush with a bit of dish soap. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Ball up newspaper pages and stuff them into the toes of the shoes. Push the crumpled paper as far into the toe as you can, and keep adding paper until the insole is covered and the shoe is full. Depending on your shoe size, 2 large pieces of newspaper may be enough to fill one shoe."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the shoes in newspaper pages or a dry cloth or towel.",
      "content": "Wrap the shoes in newspaper pages or a dry cloth or towel. If you’re using newspaper, make a sheet that’s 2-3 layers of paper thick. Then, wrap your papers or towels around each shoe individually as tightly as possible to absorb even more moisture. Secure the newspapers or towels with rubber bands."

      "title": "Place the wrapped shoes in a well-ventilated area to dry out.",
      "content": "Place the wrapped shoes in a well-ventilated area to dry out. Try a table top or countertop in a room with a fan going or with the windows open, or even outside in the shade if it’s a breezy day. Stay away from areas that may be cold or damp like basements or bathrooms. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Check and replace wet pages every 2-3 hours until the shoes dry.",
      "content": "Check and replace wet pages every 2-3 hours until the shoes dry. Remove pages that are wet to the touch and replace them with fresh, dry ones to speed up drying time (letting damp pages sit in your shoes will slow things down). The total drying time could last 30 minutes, several hours, or even overnight. The wetter your shoes, the longer they’ll take to dry. The drying time is also affected by the material, humidity, and how much paper you stuff in them. Try adding a few drops of your favorite essential oil to one of your last rounds of newspaper to give your shoes a fresh, clean scent. [6] X Research source Once the shoes are dry, you’re ready to replace the insoles and laces so you can hit the pavement!"

      "content": "Check the care instructions on the shoe label to see if they’re dryer-safe. Look inside the tongue or heel for the instructions. If you see a square symbol with a circle inside, you can dry the shoes in the dryer . A square with a dot means they can go in with low heat only, and a square with an “X” means they should not go in the dryer. [7] X Research source If there is no label or it’s faded away, assume the shoes are not dryer-safe and use a different method to dry them. [8] X Research source Any fabric shoe (like cotton, canvas, polyester, or nylon) are safe for the dryer unless they have hard or gel heels, soles, or decorations. Suede, foam, gel, leather, lace, or shoes with glued-on decorations (like appliques, gemstones, rhinestones, or glitter) should never be machine dried. Do not put high-quality running shoes in the dryer. The heat can damage the gels, foams, and adhesives in the shoes. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Partially untie the shoelaces and remove the insoles.",
      "content": "Partially untie the shoelaces and remove the insoles. Leave the shoes partially laced so you have long stretches of shoe laces to work with (just a few rows of eyelets should be laced up near the toe of the shoe). If your insoles are removable, take them out and set them aside to air dry. [10] X Research source Remove any gel or foam inserts, as these materials can’t go in the dryer. Optionally, use a damp cloth or a small cleaning brush with dish soap to clean any mud or dirt off your shoes since they’re already wet."

      "title": "Fill your shoes with rags, t-shirts, or socks to absorb moisture faster.",
      "content": "Fill your shoes with rags, t-shirts, or socks to absorb moisture faster. These materials will cut down your drying time, plus they’ll help prevent fabric shoes from shrinking or changing shape in the dryer. Throw some towels and t-shirts into the dryer, too. These will absorb some moisture and dull the noise in case your shoes come loose and start tumbling around. [11] X Research source To cut the drying time even more, empty your dryer’s lint trap before you put the shoes inside."

      "content": "Hang your shoes inside the dryer by closing the door over the laces. First, tie a double knot with the 4 ends of the shoelaces. Then, open the dryer door and hold your shoes by the laces so that the soles are pressed against the inside of the dryer door. [12] X Research source Close the door over the laces so the double knot hangs outside the dryer. The laces will suspend the shoes and stop them from banging around . If your dryer has a stationary drying rack, simply put the rack in the dryer and place your shoes on top. Select the appropriate setting for stationary drying. If you don’t have a dryer rack and your shoes don’t have laces, put them in a mesh laundry bag and place them in the dryer like regular clothes."

If not, choose the lowest temperature to minimize possible shrinkage, heat damage, or wear and tear. To check the shoes, stop the machine and then grab the part of the laces hanging outside the door before opening the door. [13] X Research source If the shoes are still damp, run them for another 20 minutes and check them again."

Lay the shoelaces next to the insoles, or hang them up somewhere they won’t get tangled, like a clothes drying rack or over a shower curtain rod. [14] X Research source Use the fan on any type of shoe or material, especially leather, suede, or other materials that can’t go in the dryer.

[15] X Research source Set up the fan in a space where the noise and breeze won’t bother you and lay a towel underneath it to catch water that drips from your shoes. [16] X Research source If you don’t have a fan, lay your shoes in front of the vent on your refrigerator (usually found beneath the fridge door). During cooling cycles, the vent blows warm, dry air.

Alternatively, if there’s enough room in your box, lay the insoles and laces in the rice alongside your shoes. [23] X Research source Use rice safely on any type of shoe or material, especially large boots, suede, leather, or anything that’s unsafe to go in the dryer.
