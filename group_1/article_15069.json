      "content": "Air dry rose petals for an effective, natural method. Remove any debris from your rose petals and place them on a flat surface, like a baking sheet or mesh screen, in a single layer. Leave a small gap between each petal so they dry evenly and place them in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight. Allow the petals to dry over several days, turning them daily so they dry on both sides. When they feel crisp, they’re ready to use or store. [1] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source An old window screen or a flat metal strainer from your kitchen will work well for drying. Floral designer and plant specialist Rachel Cho recommends that you “spread [the petals] out on top of paper towels or sand on a tray or large dish.” Placing petals directly in the sun will cause them to fade, and storing them in a moist area could cause them to rot. If the petals overlap while they are drying, they will stick together and you will have to break them apart later. Only remove the petals after they have become crispy, almost like the texture of cornflakes. If they aren’t fully dry when you store them, they'll begin to get moldy. To air dry roses with the stems attached, tie the stems together with twine, then hang them upside down in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight for 2-3 weeks. Untie them when they’re completely dry to the touch."

      "content": "Dry the petals in a microwave for a quick option. Select a microwave-safe plate and cover it with paper towels. Place a layer of evenly-spaced rose petals on top, then cover with another layer of paper towels. Alternatively, use silica gel in place of the paper towels. [2] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Add another plate on top to cover everything and microwave for 30-40 seconds. Check if the petals are dry, and repeat the process as necessary until they are. Microwave ovens tend to vary, so you may have to experiment to find the correct length of time for drying the rose petals. To make the petals crispier after you’ve microwaved them, spread them onto paper towels and let them air-dry for a day or two. Choose a drying location away from breezes, moisture, light and dust. When microwaving whole roses rather than individual petals, it’s best to place them in a bowl of desiccant like silica gel or cat litter. This will help prevent them from withering."

      "content": "Dry your petals in the oven if you have a lot of them. Like the microwave, drying your rose petals in the oven is another quick option, and the additional space allows you to dry more petals at once. Spread the petals in an even layer across a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 180° F (82° C) and bake the roses for 10-30 minutes. Check on them every 10 minutes and rotate them if they need more time. Remove them when they look and feel crisp. [3] X Research source Some ovens’ temperatures are more reliable than others, so monitor your rose petals regularly to make sure they don’t overheat. Use multiple baking sheets if you have a lot of rose petals."

      "title": "Dehydrate the roses in a dehydrator.",
      "content": "Dehydrate the roses in a dehydrator. Spread the petals evenly across the dehydrator rack with a bit of space between each one. Set the dehydrator to the lowest possible setting and keep an eye on the petals as they dry, checking them regularly. Depending on your dehydrator, the process could take anywhere from a few hours to a whole day. [4] X Research source When the petals are done, they should have a texture similar to corn flakes or very thin potato chips. Be sure to use the lowest setting and check the petals regularly to make sure they don’t burn. Another option is to use an air fryer if it has a dehydration setting. Simply turn the dehydration setting on and let your petals dry for 10-15 minutes, checking them every few minutes."

      "content": "Press your petals in a book if you have time to spare. If you’re not in a hurry, pressing your roses is a simple, low-effort drying method. Find a large, heavy book and line your petals across its pages in a single layer without overlapping. Slowly and carefully close the book so the petals don’t move, and place a few other books on top of it to apply pressure. Leave the petals to dry for 1-3 weeks. Remove them when they’re fully dried and pressed. [5] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source If you’re worried about ruining the pages of your book, place the petals between two sheets of absorbent paper or tissue. Books with coarse paper tend to work better than those with glossy, as the coarse material is more absorbent. Bookmark the page where you’re drying the petals so you can find them easily."

      "title": "Use silica gel to soak up moisture.",
      "content": "Use silica gel to soak up moisture. Silica gel is a desiccant, which means it absorbs moisture from the air—and in this case, rose petals. Place a layer of silica gel crystals in the bottom of an airtight container. Lay the roses in a single layer on top, then cover them completely with more silica gel. Seal the container and let the roses dry for 2-3 days or until they’re completely dry.

Use them the same way you would the silica gel."

Gather your rose petals and other dried materials (like other dried flowers, orange peels, pine cones, etc.) and add them to an airtight container to make your own potpourri .

Look for roses with the biggest and brightest blooms, and avoid flowers that appear wilted, damaged, or diseased in any way. Flowers that already have browning petals will become fully brown when they dry.

If you’re only drying the petals, pluck them individually by gently pulling each one from the rose head’s base. Discard any petals that appear brown or damaged. If you want to dry the entire rose head, just remove the stem. [14] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source If you want to dry the whole rose, clip off the thorns and leave the stem intact. The methods used for drying rose petals can also be used for drying rose heads or roses with stems.

It’s also possible to dry the rose with the stem intact, then remove the petals later."

Dried rose petals can last up to a few years if they’re dried and stored properly, but hairspray can sometimes help them last longer than they would naturally. When you finish drying the petals, spray them with an even coating of hairspray on both sides. Proceed to touch them up about once a week, especially if they start to brown or wilt. [16] X Research source If you dried whole roses, add two more coats the first time you spray them to make sure they’re fully saturated.
