[1] X Research source Make sure you have access to clean water, food, shelter, and medical supplies you need (inhalers, prescriptions, etc.). If you have to evacuate your home, you can pack a change of clothes, toiletry items, and anything else you may need for a few days if you’re unable to return home immediately. Here are some initial emergency resources you can access: FEMA : Provides initial assistance and has a helpline at (800) 621-3362. You can also apply for assistance at DisasterAssistance.gov. American Red Cross : Provides emergency shelter options by zip code. You can also text SHELTER and your zip code to 4FEMA (43362). Salvation Army : Provides emergency shelter options by zip code. National Response Center : Call (800) 424-8802 for emergencies, or (202) 267-2675 if you can't access 800. HUD : Provides additional support for recovery through programs and partnerships.

[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You could also try mindfulness activities like meditating , yoga, breathing exercises, or self-affirmations. These can help calm your body and mind in a peaceful, nonjudgmental way. Socializing, volunteering, being outdoors (if it’s safe to do so), or spending time with pets are also great ways to reduce stress. Do your best to avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, or using recreational drugs. These may feel like they provide relief but actually increase stress on your body.

Check in with local friends and family who may have been impacted. See how you can help or what they may be able to offer you if you’re in need. Once immediate needs like food, shelter, water, or medical care are taken care of, try to do something enjoyable as a group. This can alleviate stress and add some optimism to the situation. [7] X Research source Assess everyone’s needs. Prioritize those who are most vulnerable like the older adults or children. For example, you could check in on a neighbor who is an older adult without power. Make friends with new people you encounter, too. The larger your community and support system, the better!

Making too many big or new decisions might make it harder to feel grounded or “back to normal.” For example, getting a new pet while you’re still repairing your home (or looking for a new one) could contribute to you feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities.

Being transparent and honest about what’s going on will help them trust you. [18] X Research source Remember that kids tend to personalize emergencies. They may be overly worried about their safety or the safety of their friends and family. Use words and ideas children can understand to help them grasp the situation.

[23] X Research source Every child responds to disaster differently. Younger children may turn to you for support. Older kids and teens may turn to friends and social media for comfort. No matter their age or response, let them know you’re there for them. Look for physical symptoms of anxiety or stress like headaches, stomachaches, or fatigue.
