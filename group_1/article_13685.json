Don't let them separate."

      "content": "Push with your hands and shoulders. As you roll backwards, keep your knees tucked to your chest. Roll quickly enough so that you get some momentum. Your weight needs to shift from your lower back to your upper back then to your hands. As the knees and legs start to go over your head, push with your arms and shoulders. [7] X Research source Drive the backward roll by moving your toes over your head, not by throwing your neck and head backwards. You should engage your hands and arms when your body rolls towards your neck. You always want to protect the neck and head. [8] X Research source If you've kept your hands in the flat position, they should easily make contact with the floor so you can push yourself over. Your hands will be flat against the floor while your elbows will be pointing towards the ceiling."
