      "title": "Avoid touching anything so you don’t spread the oil.",
      "content": "Avoid touching anything so you don’t spread the oil. Poison oak is not contagious unless you still have urushiol on your skin, so you can touch people or objects until you wash your skin off thoroughly. Until then, keep the skin exposed and do not scratch or itch the area. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your skin may begin itching pretty quickly. Do everything in your power to avoid itching your skin. This is the main way that poison oak rashes tend to spread."

      "title": "Rinse off your skin with soap and water to remove the plant oil.",
      "content": "Rinse off your skin with soap and water to remove the plant oil. Do this within 30 minutes of your first exposure to prevent a rash from developing or spreading. Clean the skin with a sponge or cloth to keep it from spreading to your hands. Thoroughly scrub the skin with a liberal amount of soap to rinse the urushiol off. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you are still in the woods away from a bathroom, look for a nearby stream and rinse your skin. This will get rid of the residue left of your skin, which will help reduce irritation quickly. If you have a water bottle, pour it directly on to the skin. The only exception is for soaps that are oil-based. Specialty skincare products with coconut oil or olive oil in them may actually spread the urushiol around. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Change your clothes because they may be contaminated.",
      "content": "Change your clothes because they may be contaminated. Urushiol can spread from your skin to your clothes, which can distribute the rash over other parts of your body. To prevent this, remove any clothes you’re wearing as soon as you reasonably can. Wash your clothes immediately in a washing machine using a standard laundry detergent to remove the urushiol. [6] X Research source In addition to your clothes, be sure to wash off any tools or objects that might have come into contact with the plant or your skin after you were exposed. Use a liberal amount of oil-free dish soap and a sponge or cloth to thoroughly clean any items that touched the poison oak. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you don’t have soap around, even rinsing the clothing or other objects off in water may help remove some of the oily residue."

      "title": "Feel free to touch the affected area once you wash your skin.",
      "content": "Feel free to touch the affected area once you wash your skin. You can transfer the rash across your body if you scratch or touch the rash on your skin without washing. Once the urushiol is washed off though, you are no longer in jeopardy of spreading the rash any further. You can begin treating the skin directly and touching the area without putting yourself at risk. Don’t overdo the scratching though, since this can damage your skin. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Although you cannot make the rash spread after you get the urushiol off your skin, you can irritate the rash and cause skin damage by scratching or itching."

      "title": "Keep the skin uncovered for the next few days and wait for the rash.",
      "content": "Keep the skin uncovered for the next few days and wait for the rash. How a poison oak rash develops depends on how much you got on your skin and how allergic you are to urushiol. The rash typically develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure, but keeping the skin uncovered may reduce your symptoms by keeping your skin free from irritation. Once the rash appears, you can begin caring for it.

Roughly 1 in 4 people have no reaction to urushiol. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Use calamine or hydrocortisone cream to relieve the itching . Calamine lotion is a great over the counter anti-itch cream that will help soothe your skin. Hydrocortisone cream will work as well. Apply the lotion directly to your rash, using enough to cover the whole area. The rash will typically go away on its own, but a soothing cream will relieve your symptoms while you wait. [12] X Expert Source Alan O. Khadavi, MD, FACAAI Board Certified Allergist Expert Interview. 29 July 2020. There are specialty poison oak and poison ivy soaps and creams, but there’s no evidence that they’re more effective than standard calamine or hydrocortisone cream. Excessive itching may make your rash worse and keep your skin from healing. If you can handle the itching, your skin should heal just fine on its own."

Pour 1-2 cups (90-180 g) of the oats into running warm water as you’re filling the tub. Once the tub fills, soak your whole body for a replenishing bath or submerge the affected area to relieve your symptoms. Leave the rash under the water for at least 30 minutes before drying off.

You can use a regular cold compress, or soak a clean, soft washcloth or towel in cool water. Place the cold item on your skin for 20 minutes before taking a 15-20 minute break.

Squirt a dollop of aloe vera directly into your hand and rub it gently into your skin. The aloe vera will cool the rash and may speed up the healing process a little for your skin.

While this is a popular solution for poison oak, there’s no scientific evidence that it’s safe or effective to do this. You’re better off sticking with less aggressive treatment options.
