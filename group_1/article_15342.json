      "content": "Soak and wash the foot in a bath of tap water. If your feet are store-bought and packaged, you only need to wash each foot under tap water for a few seconds. Then, set them to the side one by one. [1] X Research source If your feet are fresh, soak them in a pot of tap water for about an hour to get rid of any excess dirt and other contaminants."

      "content": "Bring a full pot of water to a simmer, then cook the feet for about 30 seconds. Don't boil the water; instead, bring it to a near-boil and let it stay hot without bubbling over. Using tongs, drop each foot into the pot of water and then remove them after about half a minute to make the peeling process easier. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the nails with scissors at the first joint, or with tweezers.",
      "content": "Remove the nails with scissors at the first joint, or with tweezers. Remove each nail after they have been softened with scissors by cutting through each toe at the first joint, as this is where the nail ends. If the nails have been softened enough, then you can remove them with tweezers instead and keep more meat on the foot. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Peel the scaly skin away from the toe to the knee.",
      "content": "Peel the scaly skin away from the toe to the knee. After you have removed the nails from each toe, you can peel the scaly skin away from the meat in a smooth motion back toward the knee. It should come off all at once if it was soaked and simmered correctly, but if not, you can take a small knife to carve it away instead. [4] X Research source The scaly skin and nails of the feet are inedible, even for making something like stock, so just throw these away."

      "title": "Put the chicken feet, salt, soy sauce, sugar, garlic and water in a saute pan.",
      "content": "Put the chicken feet, salt, soy sauce, sugar, garlic and water in a saute pan. Combine 1 lb (450 g) of chicken feet, 1 tsp (4.2 g) of salt, 2 tbsp (30 ml) of soy sauce, 1 tbsp (15 g) of sugar, and 3 smashed cloves of garlic to a large saute pan. Then, add just enough water to cover the ingredients. [5] X Research source Use the back of a spoon or a knife to crush the cloves, but do not chop them up. These supplemental ingredients are used to simmer the chicken feet in a delicious medley of flavors and won't be added to the deep fryer."

      "title": "Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 2 hours.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 2 hours. Turn the heat all the way up and allow the water to rapidly boil. Turn the heat all the way down as soon as it boils and let it simmer in the pan for 2 hours, or until the chicken feet are tender when poked with a fork. [6] X Research source It may take less than 2 hours for the chicken feet to become tender, in as little time as an hour, so be sure to continuously check them with a fork so they don't overcook."

      "content": "Remove the chicken feet and allow them to cool while you whisk eggs and flour. Put the boiled feet onto a baking pan to cool for a few minutes, during which you can whisk together 2 eggs and 1 cup (128 g) of flour into a batter in a large bowl. [7] X Research source Save the left-over water if you want to make chicken feet stock later on, as this can save you some preparation time."

      "content": "Deep-fry each foot until it is golden brown, and serve! In small batches, deep fry the feet for about 3 to 5 minutes, and watch for the feet to turn golden-brown. You can store the finished ones in a warm oven to maintain their temperature. [8] X Research source When they are all deep-fried, they are ready to be served! Sprinkle some salt over the chicken feet or add chili oil and soy sauce for extra flavor."

Deep fry them until they are dry, which is when the oil on the feet stops sparkling. [12] X Research source Set the feet on a plate to cool and dry further. Afterward, you can let the feet soak in a pot full of ice water for 4 hours to achieve a \"tiger-skin\" effect, which makes the skin of the feet look stripey. This is only for aesthetic purposes. You can use a deep fryer for this step instead of a wok, but no matter what you choose, be sure to cover it as you do not want to get covered in hot oil while you fry the chicken feet."

[13] X Research source Be careful when handling Thai chili pepper, as it can burn your eyes if you rub them during preparation. Wear latex gloves while you chop the chili — these can be taken off and thrown away, preventing you from accidentally rubbing your eyes or your nose with chili bits."

      "content": "Add the chicken feet to a steamer, then steam them for 15 minutes. Don't add the other ingredients yet, as you need to let the chicken steam first so they can effectively absorb the other flavors — and they take longer to cook. [14] X Research source"

Remove the chicken feet and chopped ingredients from the steamer when they're done, and add them to a large saute pan with 1 cup (240 ml) of water. Saute the mixture for 15 minutes. [16] X Research source This will braise the chicken feet and create a thick sauce to serve alongside the meal. [17] X Research source Serve them hot! If you want a thicker sauce, turn the heat up to the max in the last minute or so."

It's recommended to avoid using western cutlery when eating chicken feet as they don't allow you to manipulate the food as easily as with chopsticks or with your hands.

Aim to bite the chicken foot at the joint of the toe, and suck the meat, skin, and sauce off of the bone in your mouth. Spit out the bone, and continue up to the next joint and to the next toe. If you don't get quite enough meat by biting at the joint, feel free to bite off the whole toe at once. It's only recommended to start with joints to get a taste and see if the chicken feet taste good to you. [19] X Research source"

Start by sucking off its skin and cartilage, and then gnaw around the bone of the foot to get to the delicious and savory meat. You can spit bones discretely into a bowl (one is usually provided at restaurants) when you are done with the foot. [20] X Research source"
