Most people experience no symptoms when they have gallstones; in fact only 5 to 10% of people develop some symptoms of gallstones. This can make it difficult to know what to look for if you suspect you may have gallstones, and further indicates the importance of consulting a doctor for official diagnosis.

      "content": "Note if you experience biliary colic. Individuals with gallstones may experience a recurring pain in the upper right area of their abdomen (right upper quadrant pain) or in front of the lower part of their sternum (epigastric pain). There may be a gnawing pain, nausea and vomiting. The pain, known as biliary colic, usually lasts for more than 15 minutes and can sometimes radiate towards the back. [2] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.). The 5-minute clinical consult standard 2015 (23rd ed.) [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Patients will usually experience recurring episodes of biliary colic after their first time experiencing the pain. In addition, biliary colic often occurs and then goes away. You may only feel this pain several times per year. This symptom can be easy to confuse with other digestive or abdominal pains. If you think you suffer from biliary colic, make an appointment to see your doctor."

Observe whether you have abdominal pains and/or biliary colic after eating large or fatty meals, for example like a greasy breakfast with bacon and sausage or a big holiday meal like on Thanksgiving. These are the moments when you are most likely to experience pain and/or biliary colic. In some patients, minor biliary colic, without signs of infection, can be tolerated without medical intervention."

Gallbladder inflammation is much more serious than biliary colic, and fever is the best way to distinguish between the two symptoms, based on their severity. You should seek medical attention right away if you fear that you have gallbladder inflammation. Infection develops in about 20 percent of patients, with a higher rate for diabetes patients. Infection can lead to gangrene and perforation of the gallbladder. Jaundice can also accompany fever. Jaundice can present with yellowing of the whites of the eyes (sclera) and skin."

      "content": "Understand the role of gender. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with gallstones than men; there is a 2-3: 1 ratio in this regard. Twenty-five percent of women will have a gallstone by the time they turn 60. This gender imbalance is due to the effect of the hormone estrogen, which women have more of. Estrogen stimulates the liver to remove cholesterol, and many gallstones are made from cholesterol. [8] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.). The 5-minute clinical consult standard 2015 (23rd ed.) Women who take hormone replacement therapy pills experience an increase in risk of gallstones due to the estrogen. Hormone therapy can double or triple your risk of developing gallstones. Similarly, the birth control pill can also contribute to gallstone formation because of its effect on women's hormones."

It is a painless imaging technique in which sonic waves produce an image of the soft tissues in your abdomen. A trained technician can find gallstones in the gallbladder or common bile duct. This test can detect gallstones in approximately 97% to 98% of individuals. [23] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.). The 5-minute clinical consult standard 2015 (23rd ed.) The ultrasound procedure consists of a harmless machine that recreates an image of your gallbladder by reflecting inaudible sound waves against your body. Your ultrasound technician will apply a gel to your abdomen that will help the sound waves to travel through your body and be detected more accurately. This painless procedure is usually completed within 15-30 minutes. You should not eat for 6 or more hours before the test."

The CT scan will generate a cross-sectional image of your gallbladder by using special x-rays that will be interpreted by a computer. [24] X Research source You will be asked to lie down in a cylindrical, donut-shaped machine that will scan your body for approximately 30 minutes. The procedure is relatively quick and will not be painful. In some cases, the doctor may prefer to use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, rather than a CT scanner. This type of imaging involves a similar setup and will use changes in magnetic fluctuations to create an accurate image of your internal organs. This procedure may last up to an hour, and will involve you lying down inside a cylindrical scanning device. There is no advantage of a CT over an ultrasound, except that a CT may distinguish a stone in the common bile duct, the small tube that carries bile from the gallbladder to the intestine.

Your healthcare provider or a technician will utilize a small needle to draw blood from your veins into small vials that will be analyzed by a lab for the doctor’s requested information.
