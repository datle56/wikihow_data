      "content": "Scrub off the mold using a toothbrush. Using an old toothbrush, scrub any areas on your garment with mold spots. Gently scrubbing your garment with a toothbrush will remove the top layer of mold and prepare it for spot treatment. [1] X Research source If the garment is wet, pretreat it by letting it sit in the sun until it dries. The sun’s UV rays will help to kill off mold and mildew. Wear a KN95 mask , eye protection , and/or gloves to protect your eyes and lungs from mold spores and discard the toothbrush after scrubbing the fabric. Work in a well-ventilated area or outdoors. Not only are mold spores dangerous to inhale, but they can also travel through the air in your house and settle onto furniture, clothing, and more."

      "content": "Apply stain remover to the mold spot and let it sit for 15 minutes. Once you’ve scrubbed off as much of the mold as possible, liberally apply a commercial stain remover such as Shout or Oxyclean to the moldy portion of the clothing. Most commercial stain removers typically take about 15 minutes to soak into the fabric, so wait at least 15 minutes for the stain remover to jump into action before washing the garment. [2] X Research source Spraying the stain with a 1:4 mix of 3% hydrogen peroxide and water or rubbing the mold spot with a dry bar of Fels-Naptha soap are other effective mold-busting alternatives to using a commercial stain remover."

      "title": "Wash the item by itself in hot water.",
      "content": "Wash the item by itself in hot water. Run your washing machine on a “large” or “extra-large” load size, and set the water temperature to “hot.” Be sure to wash the garment on its own to avoid transferring mold spores to other clothing in the washer. [3] X Research source If your washing machine estimates what load size is necessary based on the amount of fabric in the machine, throw in a few old rags or towels for weight."

      "title": "Add ¾ cup (177 mL) of white vinegar and a capful of detergent to the wash.",
      "content": "Add ¾ cup (177 mL) of white vinegar and a capful of detergent to the wash. Once the laundry machine has filled with hot water, pour ¾ cup (177 mL) of white vinegar into your washer, followed by a capful of your favorite laundry detergent (or as directed). White vinegar's acidity will help eradicate mold spores and smells from the fabric. [4] X Research source White vinegar is safe for all clothing except darker-colored fabrics, as they may fade. Add an optional ½ tablespoon (7.4 ml) of baking soda to your laundry load to help deodorize particularly smelly clothing."

      "title": "Air-dry the clothing.",
      "content": "Air-dry the clothing. Let your garment air-dry on a flat surface, like on top of your dryer, or hang it on a drying rack . If it’s a nice day, dry the item of clothing outdoors , in full sunlight. The heat from the sun will help kill off and remove whatever mold may remain on your clothing. [5] X Research source You won’t be able to tell if the mold has been completely removed from the clothing until after it’s dried and the fabric has returned to its natural color. [6] X Research source If you still see signs of mold, it may be time to use a stronger treatment, such as bleach, or get rid of the garment entirely. Avoid using the dryer. Putting any fabric with mold issues into the dryer risks contaminating the dryer with mold spores."

Alternatively, if your laundry machine has a receptacle specifically labeled “bleach,” pour the bleach in that opening instead. The bleach will effectively kill the mold particles on your fabric or garment—see ya, spores! [10] X Research source Only use bleach on white clothing, as it will fade or remove the color from dyed fabrics. Manufacturer’s recommendations can vary concerning how much bleach to add to a load of laundry. If your bleach recommends using more or less than 1 cup, follow the instructions on the packaging."

Once the load has finished, the bleach will have removed the mold from your clothing. [11] X Research source If the mold is still on your clothing, wash the garment following the same steps again. Air dry your garments in the sun by lying them on a flat, clean surface, like on a towel in your driveway or backyard."
