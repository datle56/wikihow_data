Whether or not your hair is naturally red or dyed red, you still need to know what shade it is before you can make an informed decision about what color of brown you'll need to buy. Look online for different descriptions and examples to pinpoint your shade. Some of the common “reds” are: [1] X Research source Strawberry blonde Bright copper Ginger Classic red Deep red Auburn Red velvet Ruby red"

      "title": "Decide if you want red tones to shine through the brown or not.",
      "content": "Decide if you want red tones to shine through the brown or not. Because red hair is so hard to cover, you may need to dye your hair twice to cover it all. But if you don't mind some red coming through the brown, you can get away with just one application of dye. Red-brunette is an in-style color right now. Look online for examples of “red-brown hair styles” to see if any of them catch your eye."

      "title": "Consider your skin tone when making a color selection.",
      "content": "Consider your skin tone when making a color selection. If you have pale skin, opt for a rich brown with warm undertones for a look that complements your skin. If you have tan or more olive-toned skin, opt for an ashy or more muted brown. If you have deep undertones, look for a more intensely dark brown. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Avoid picking a shade of brown that is similar to your skin tone. Try uploading your picture to a site that'll enable you to envision yourself with a different hair color, like Matrix Virtual Hair Color or Redken's Haircolor Change app."

      "title": "Buy a brown dye that is a shade darker than your red hair.",
      "content": "Buy a brown dye that is a shade darker than your red hair. Choose a semi-permanent dye if you aren't ready to commit to being a brunette just yet, or pick a permanent dye for longer-lasting coverage. Avoid the “10-minute” boxes—since you're going to be covering red tones, you need to use an application that's going to set into your hair over a 15-30 minutes period. Also, buy 2 boxes of the dye, especially if you have thick hair or hair that is shoulder-length or longer—that way you won't run out in the middle of dyeing your hair! If your hair is a red velvet, then you aren't going to have much success dyeing it a medium-brown; you'd be better off opting for a deep-brown. If you have strawberry-blonde hair, though, you can pick nearly any shade of brown that you like as they'll all be darker than your natural color. Look for kits that include a plastic bowl, applicator brush, and gloves."

      "content": "Buy a bleach kit, especially if you have pre-colored hair. Because red tones are so hard to cover, even those with naturally red hair will want to consider bleaching their hair before applying colored dye. Look for a bleach kit that includes bleach, developer, gloves, bowl, and applicator brush. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source You can always try dyeing your hair without bleaching it first, but you probably won't have as good results. Keep in mind that color doesn't lift color. If you've already dyed your hair, you won't be able to lighten it with a different color dye. However, you can dye your hair a darker color. A dark brown dye may take without you having to bleach yourself first."

If you bought a bleach kit at the store, follow the instructions to mix the ingredients together in the supplied bowl. [4] X Research source Always wear gloves when working with bleach."

      "content": "Apply the bleach to your hair and leave it in for 10-20 minutes. Pull the top half of your hair up and then separate the bottom half into 2 sections, using plastic clips or hair ties. Then use an applicator brush to evenly spread the bleach from the roots to the tips. Then separate the top half of your hair into 2 sections and repeat the process. Leave the bleach on your hair until the color starts to lighten. [5] X Research source How long you need to leave the bleach on your hair will depend on the level of volume developer you use. The higher the volume of your developer, the quicker it will work on your hair. Use the bleach bath immediately after you mix it up, otherwise it'll start to oxidize and won't react well with your hair. Make sure you use plastic hair clips and tools when you're using bleach. This is because bleach has a chemical reaction with metal. Avoid getting the bleach bath on any new regrowth (like your roots) that aren't colored."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source You could also trim a few hairs and test those rather than trying to test hairs that are still on your head.

You can wait a few days if you want to between bleaching and dyeing, but chances are you aren't going to like the color of your bleached hair without the dye. It's likely the bleach will turn your hair a yellow, brassy, or orange color. So set aside a few hours one day so you can do everything at once. [8] X Research source You do, however, want to make sure your hair is dry after you bleach it before you attempt to dye it."

Each manufacturer has different guidelines for how to apply the dye and how long it should be left on your hair. Plus, depending on the brand, there might be some helpful tips or warnings included in the instructions. Prepare the dye mix in the bowl provided, and set out your gloves, applicator brush, and some old towels so that you have everything gathered in one place. [9] X Research source You'll want to lay out a towel to set the dye and brush on top of while you're working to protect your counters, and you'll also want one to lay across your shoulders to protect your clothes and skin.

It helps to work in sections —use hair clips to separate your hair into 4 different parts: 2 sections from the bottom half or your hair, and 2 sections from the top half. Start with the top of your head and progress down your scalp, using the applicator to brush the dye into small 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) sections at a time. After you've applied the dye to all of the roots, go back and spread it along the rest of your hair.

Set a timer for the time specified in the instructions (usually 15-30 minutes) and don't leave the dye in for more or less time than instructed. [12] X Research source If your scalp starts to painfully burn, you may be having a reaction to the dye. If that happens, wash it out immediately and visit a professional salon to have your hair fixed. For extra heat activation, wrap your shower capped-head in a towel. If you have a hooded dryer, you can sit underneath it with your shower capped-head. This helps the dye set."
