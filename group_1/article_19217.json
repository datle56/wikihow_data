Finding just the right spot for your inner brows to start is key to creating perfect brows, since starting too far in could throw off the balance of your face. [1] X Research source To figure out where your inner brows should start, use the following technique: As a general starting point, take a pencil or other long, thin instrument and line it up vertically with outer edge of the tip and bridge of your nose. The place where the instrument overlaps your brow is where it should begin. Mark the spot by making a dot there with an eyeliner pencil. Repeat on the other side. However, if you have close-set eyes, space your brows a bit farther apart to the total extent the space between your eyes is smaller than an eye on both sides. If you have wide-set eyes, space your brows a little closer together to the extend this space is wider. This helps to balance your features. If you're not sure what will look best, consider visiting a trained esthetician for a brow mapping session. The esthetician will use your eyes and nose as guides to create brows that will frame and accentuate your features.

Sometimes thick, bushy eyebrows are in style, and sometimes more people prefer them to be thin and well-tailored. Think about what style you're going for before you dive into plucking your brows. The thickness of your eyebrows is a personal decision that should be influenced by the following factors: The size of your eyes. If your eyes are on the bigger side, thicker brows can help balance them out. If they're small, thick brows might overshadow them, so you'll want to choose a brow thickness that's slightly thinner. The size of your lips. A good general rule of thumb is that your eyebrows should be about the same thickness as your upper lip. This can help 'tie the look together'. If you look at pictures of models in magazines than you'll notice this is the case with many of them. The distance between your brows and your eyes. If you have a low brow bone that is set close to your eyes, you'll want to pull up your brows a bit to lighten the area. If you have a high brow line spaced well above your eyes, heavier brows might provide a more balanced look. However, you should avoid tweezing the hair above your brows, rather than below, to create less space above the brows."

Use the tweezers to pluck the hairs that are closer to your nose than the dot. Tweeze the hairs that fall outside the dot on your outer brow. Tweeze hairs above and below the arch area. Look at the place where your arch should peak and carefully tweeze around it to make the peak slightly more prominent. Tweeze the bottom of the brow. Pluck stray hairs under your brow and shape the bottom. If you decided you want thick brows, stop after plucking the hairs that grow outside the brow.
