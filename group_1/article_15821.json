      "content": "Signal that you're ending the letter in the final paragraph. In the last paragraph, wrap up the letter by writing something about how you'd like them to write back or how you hope to visit. Imagine you're having a conversation with your friend in real life, and write down anything you'd like to tell them before they go. Try writing something like \"Thanks for writing. I hope to see you soon.\" If you miss them, you could say, \"It's not the same here without you!\""

      "title": "Summarize anything you want your friend to remember.",
      "content": "Summarize anything you want your friend to remember. The final paragraph is an excellent place to repeat any important information you want your friend to know. That way, it's fresh in their mind as they finish reading your letter. Tantalizing gossip, funny news of home, or trip details like when you're coming to visit are all great things to toss into your ending. For instance, you might write, \"Remember, we'll be there on Saturday at 8 a.m. sharp. Be dressed to impress!\" or \"I cannot wait to tell you what happened at Jeff's house yesterday. Remind me when I see you so I don't forget!\""

      "title": "Try to end your letter on a positive note.",
      "content": "Try to end your letter on a positive note. People love to hear something good at the end of a letter, especially if they're away from home and missing their friends and family. An upbeat ending will leave them feeling glad they read your letter and excited for more! Of course, if you're giving them bad news in the letter, it may not be appropriate to end it with a cheering note at the end, so use your best judgment. [1] X Research source For instance, \"I'm planning to visit soon. I can't wait to see you!\" If you did something fun you'd like to share, you might say, \"I went on our favorite hike the other day. You wouldn't believe how gorgeous the flowers are now that its spring. So excited for you to see them!\""

      "content": "Use a simple \"Love\" for a close friend. This closing is classic for a reason, as it shows your friendly affection and care. Everyone likes knowing they're being thought of with love—it's a no-brainer! [2] X Research source You can also use \"With love\" or \"Love always\" if you feel like spicing things up.

If you're friendly with the person but not close friends, you may not feel comfortable using \"Love\" or even \"Affectionately,\" as it may seem a little too much. \"As always\" and \"Kind regards\" are friendly without being too informal—no worry of weirdness here! [4] X Research source Other options include \"As ever,\" \"Warm regards,\" or \"Cheers.\" \"Until next time\" also works well. For example, you might say, \"It was so nice seeing you at the dinner before my trip, hope to do another when I get back! Until next time, Amy\""
