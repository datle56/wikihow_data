      "content": "Select whey protein powder for a pre-workout option. Whey protein powder is made with a byproduct of the cheese making process and is one of the most popular varieties. While there is a debate as to whether protein drinks are better before or after a workout, whey protein is quickly digested and can serve as a boost of energy and fitness before a workout. You can drink whey protein after a workout too, as its quick digestion helps your muscles repair themselves very quickly."

      "title": "Choose casein or pea protein powder to encourage slow digestion.",
      "content": "Choose casein or pea protein powder to encourage slow digestion. Casein is a chemical that comes from milk, and while whey is quickly digested, casein takes a long time to break down. The same goes for pea protein powder, as it gradually releases amino acids as you digest it. Choose these protein powders for a late-night drink you can digest while you sleep. Casein comes from animal products and therefore is not suitable for vegan diets. If you want to digest your protein powder slowly and don't want animal products, opt for pea powder instead."

      "content": "Try soy or egg protein powder for their amino acid content. Soy and egg protein powder contains essential amino acids that help to grow muscle rather than repair it. The protein content is just the same as others, making soy and egg protein powder great for those looking to build muscle quickly. Soy protein powder tends to be cheap, while egg protein powder tends to be very pricey. If budgeting is an issue, opt for soy protein powder to get additional amino acids."

      "content": "Opt for hemp or rice protein powder for additional nutrients. Hemp and rice protein powder are a bit harder to come by than the other options listed here, but they also contain other nutrients. Rice protein contains B vitamins, which is great for vegan or vegetarian diets as this is normally only found in animal products, whereas hemp protein contains fatty acids and lots of fiber. Hemp and rice protein powder don't contain as much protein as other types of protein powder, so be sure to supplement protein to your diet in addition to using these options."

      "title": "Check your regular protein intake before you start taking protein powder.",
      "content": "Check your regular protein intake before you start taking protein powder. The regular amount of protein that's recommended for most people is 0.36 g per 1 lb (0.8 g per 1 kg), so if you weigh 150 lb (68 kg) you need to ingest 109 g (3.8 oz) of protein each day through food, drinks, and supplements. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Take a week to write down the nutritional content of your foods and drinks and take note of areas you are deficient in. If you are getting less than the regular recommended amount, consider first changing your diet or taking supplements before you use protein powder. Protein powder can give you a boost, but it can also make you gain weight if not used while working out regularly."

      "content": "Double your protein intake if you plan to train strength regularly. While the recommended amount is enough for most people, those who do regular strength training need to take double the amount to effectively allow their muscles to regrow and get stronger. The recommended amount for those who regularly lift weights and do strength training is 0.72 g per 1 lb (1.6 g per 1 kg) of weight.

      "content": "Drink protein mixes either before or after your workout. There is no recommended time to drink protein shakes or mixes when it comes to pre or post workout. Research shows that as long as you are consuming protein around your workout, you will reap the benefits. There is a debate over whether drinking protein shakes before or after a workout is better. Do whichever feels more comfortable for you and is more convenient for your lifestyle."

      "title": "Take protein powder 3 or 4 times a day a few hours apart.",
      "content": "Take protein powder 3 or 4 times a day a few hours apart. If you take your entire daily recommended amount of protein in one go you are not going to feel too good, and your body won't be able to properly digest it. Spread your protein intake throughout the day in 3 or 4 sessions to keep your digestive system going and give your body a chance to adapt. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Spread your protein consumption about 3 or 4 hours apart to fully digest the previous meal or drink before moving on to the next one. Protein is extremely filling, so you likely won't feel like eating anything for a few hours anyway!"

      "title": "Choose a liquid base and a fruity addition to mix with your protein powder.",
      "content": "Choose a liquid base and a fruity addition to mix with your protein powder. There are a huge variety of recipes when it comes to making your own protein shakes . Each recipe has three main components: the liquid base, fruits for flavor, and protein powder. [4] X Research source The liquid base is usually a form of milk or yoghurt, but plain water is also perfectly usable and will reduce the calories of the shake. Opt for milk or yoghurt if you want more protein, but use water if you don't want to go over your daily amount. Some common fruits to include in a protein shake include bananas, berries, and mangos, but choose fruits that you like. Avoid juicy fruits like grapes and oranges as their flavors will not come through as strong and will make your shake much more watery."

      "title": "Pour your liquid base into the blender before anything else.",
      "content": "Pour your liquid base into the blender before anything else. Pour about 1 cup (240 ml) of your chosen liquid base into the blender. Milk, water, and even thin yoghurt are great options for the liquid base, but follow whichever recipe sounds good to you. You can use more or less liquid if you want your shake to be more or less runny, depending on your personal preference. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be sure to use at least 0.5 cups (120 ml) of liquid to effectively blend all the ingredients together. For a sweet option, mix together 1 cup (250 ml) of vanilla almond milk, 30 g (2 tbsp) of protein powder, 1 banana, and a handful of chopped berries."

      "content": "Mix your protein powder and your liquid base in the blender. Measure out 30 g (2 tbsp) of your chosen protein powder and mix it with your chosen liquid base. You don't need to completely dissolve the powder, as the blender will do that for you later on, but try to avoid getting too much on the sides. [6] X Research source You can lose some protein powder if it gets stuck to the sides of your container, so take care to get all of the powder in the liquid for maximum protein intake."

      "content": "Add fruits, nuts, and other additions to bring flavor to your shake. Add your fruits and other additions to the blender and push them down with a masher or with your hands to fit everything in. If you are using a specialty shake container to blend your ingredients, simply fill it to the top with fruit and other ingredients. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use a handful of berries, a whole banana, or other chopped fruits to add to your blender for a sweet and flavorful touch. You can also add a handful of nuts, like almonds or peanuts, to your smoothie for additional fiber, protein, and flavor. Blend it for a little longer to break up these harder ingredients."

      "title": "Blend the mix on low and gradually turn the speed up to high.",
      "content": "Blend the mix on low and gradually turn the speed up to high. Start the blender on a low setting to mix everything around and slowly turn the speed up to high over the course of a minute. This gets the most balanced mix of all the ingredients and ensures that everything is ground up and spread evenly throughout the drink. If the shake still seems too liquidy, add some more toppings and yoghurt to thicken it up. If the shake seems too thick to drink, add some more of your liquid base and blend it again to loosen it up."

      "content": "Mix protein powder and water for an easy workout drink. Water is the most common thing to mix with protein powder as it is very easy, very cheap, and it doesn't taste too bad. Simply add 30 g (2 tbsp) of protein powder to a tall glass of cold water and mix it around with a fork to break up clumps. While it's not very elaborate or especially delicious, this is perfect for when you don't have the energy to break out multiple ingredients and prepare a specialty drink. Add honey to your drink to make it go down a little easier and to add a sweet, smooth flavor."

      "title": "Blend protein powder with milk or a milk alternative for extra protein.",
      "content": "Blend protein powder with milk or a milk alternative for extra protein. Both animal milk and dairy-free milk have a high protein content, so this is a perfect mix for people who require a lot more than the regular daily recommended amount. Mix 30 g (2 tbsp) of protein powder with a tall glass of milk and blend it together with a fork for a boost to both your protein intake and your calcium. Opt for vitamin D milk, if available, to further supplement your nutrition. One glass of milk provides 1/3 of the recommended daily amount of calcium, so mix protein powder and milk sparingly."

      "content": "Mix protein powder with your coffee for a morning protein boost. Whey protein is especially good for coffee as it can be an alternative to creamer (although you can still include that as well). No matter which type of protein powder you choose, hot coffee notoriously makes protein powder clump up — pour 30 g (2 tbsp) of protein powder very slowly into your coffee as you constantly stir it to prevent clumps from forming. You can also blend protein powder and coffee together, resulting in a foamy cappuccino-like drink. This works best with iced coffee. If you want to prevent clumping altogether, add milk first, then add protein powder and mix together the milk and powder with a fork. Then, add the coffee and constantly stir to break up any remaining chunks."
