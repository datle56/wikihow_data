    {
      "title": "Look for an opening.",
      "content": "Look for an opening. If you’ve bought your piñata, it will likely have a small sticker or tab somewhere on the body. This makes opening the piñata much easier. It could be hidden under a flap or other piece, so look carefully!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Open the piñata using the seal.",
      "content": "Open the piñata using the seal. If you’ve found a removable sticker or tab, peel it off. If the seal of the piñata is built in, you should be able to either lift it or push down to open it. Some can be thrown away, while others can be used to reseal the piñata after filling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make an opening with a blade if necessary.",
      "content": "Make an opening with a blade if necessary. If your piñata is homemade, did not come with an opening, or won't open for some reason, you’ll have to cut your own. You’ll want to do this near the top of the piñata so the filling doesn’t fall out. To cut an opening in the piñata, take a knife, box cutter, or pair of scissors and slice three lines in a U-shape into the piñata to form a small “door.”"

    {
      "title": "Remove anything inside.",
      "content": "Remove anything inside. Some piñatas come pre-stuffed with paper or other filler to help keep their shape. Take out anything that might be inside, and make sure the piñata is totally empty. Now you’re ready to fill it!"

    {
      "title": "Fill it up with candy for an exciting and sugary pop.",
      "content": "Fill it up with candy for an exciting and sugary pop. Candy is the most popular stuffing for a piñata. Seeing all the different colors and flavors burst out is a thrilling moment for everyone! The candies should be individually wrapped so that they won’t get dirty when they fall to the ground. If you live in a warm climate, or your party will be during the summer, some candies could melt. Avoid candy that melts easily (such as chocolate or taffy) and go for pixie sticks, lollipops, or gummies instead. Store your piñata in a cool, dry place before the party."

    {
      "title": "Toss in small toys to encourage play.",
      "content": "Toss in small toys to encourage play. Toys are another great stuffing choice, and you don’t have to worry about them melting! Party guests can play with them or take them home as party favors. Finger puppets, jumping frogs, plastic animals, bouncy balls are all great kids’ toys to put in a piñata. [1] X Research source Toys are also a good alternative if you're worried that candy is too unhealthy."

      "title": "Mix different kinds of stuffing together for variety.",
      "content": "Mix different kinds of stuffing together for variety. If you can’t decide on one kind of stuffing for your piñata, then try combining them! Put candy, toys, decorations, stickers, and anything else in the same piñata. Throwing in all kinds of treats will delight your party guests and make the moment the piñata pops open even more fun."

    {
      "title": "Match the stuffing to the party’s theme.",
      "content": "Match the stuffing to the party’s theme. What’s the party about? Depending on the theme of the party, you could stuff the piñata with dinosaurs, fake eyepatches, clip-on earrings, candy coins, action figures, pencil toppers, toy spiders and more-- the possibilities are endless!"

      "title": "Stuff a piñata appropriately for adult guests.",
      "content": "Stuff a piñata appropriately for adult guests. If the piñata is for an adult party, consider stuffing in plastic mini-bottles of alcohol, lottery tickets, gift cards, keychains, or bottle openers. [2] X Research source However, since many adults are also kids at heart, candy can be just as exciting! If the party will have adults and children, mix in some items for both. Gourmet chocolate squares and temporary tattoos are kid-friendly options adults can enjoy as well."

      "title": "Fill your piñata by hand.",
      "content": "Fill your piñata by hand. Take handfuls of the candy, toys, or other fillings you’ve chosen and drop them into the piñata. Do this repeatedly until the piñata is full. A piñata that's 16 to 28 inches (41 to 71 cm) wide can hold up to 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of filling, while a bigger one can hold about 3 pounds (1.4 kg) Depending on the shape of your piñata, there might be thin cavities where treats could get stuck. Stuff these with newspaper before you fill the piñata. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal your piñata back up.",
      "content": "Seal your piñata back up. If your piñata has a replaceable seal, or if you cut a door into the body, close it back up. Cover the opening with clear tape if you’re afraid it may not hold on its own. If you want to hide the cuts you’ve made, you can use a comb to brush any crepe paper over top. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Store the piñata if you won't be using it yet.",
      "content": "Store the piñata if you won't be using it yet. If the party isn’t anytime soon, put the piñata away somewhere you can access when it’s time. You especially want to hide it away if it’s going to be a surprise party! If your piñata is homemade and has flour in the mixture, it could potentially become a snack for hungry insects. Seal it inside a big plastic bag and place an insect repellent of your choice around the outside. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a hanging hook if you need to.",
      "content": "Make a hanging hook if you need to. If the piñata you bought or made has no hanging hook, it’s easy to make one. Get a makeshift hook that will hold the piñata, such as one cut from a coat hanger. Cut a small slit in the piñata, slide the hook in, and push it up through the top of the piñata. [6] X Research source You can use cardboard to reinforce the hook if necessary."

      "title": "Hang the piñata",
      "content": "Hang the piñata to a support using a rope. When it’s time for the party, set up the piñata. Slide a rope through the loop or hook on your piñata, tie it, and double-knot it. Tie the other end of the rope to your support of choice, or have an adult hold it. Tree branches, wood beams, and clotheslines are some common places to hang a piñata. Make sure that the piñata is in a wide open space, and that it’s at a reachable height for the guests of the party (who could be very small!)."
