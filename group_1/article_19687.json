Simply get a box from the grocery store and pour it liberally all over the carpet in the room with the wet carpet smell. Gently spread the baking soda around the carpet with a broom or sponge, working the powder into the carpet as you do so. [1] X Research source Allow the baking soda to remain on the carpet overnight. You can also use powdered borax in a similar manner. If you use borax, follow any safety precautions on the packaging."

[3] X Research source Note that some carpet shampoos are designed to be used in a carpet cleaning machine, while others can be used with a sponge. For instance, you may need to sponge the shampoo into the carpet, allow it to sit for at least 20 minutes, and vacuum the entire area again."

      "content": "Spray on a vinegar solution to kill mold. Plain white vinegar is extremely acidic, which gives it antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties. Not only can it kill mold and mildew, it can also help loosen and lift other debris from your carpet. To make a cleaning solution, mix 2 cups (0.47 L) of warm water with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baking soda in a spray bottle. [4] X Research source Shake the mixture thoroughly and apply liberally to your carpet. Make more as needed. Note that the room will smell strongly of vinegar until the mixture dries. Once the mixture has dried, vacuum the room completely."

      "content": "Mix 3% hydrogen peroxide with a dye-free soap for use in a carpet machine. Mix 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dye-free mild soap, such as Dr. Bronner’s. Blend them into roughly 6 cups (1.4 L) of hot water. This mixture is ideal for home carpet cleaning machines. Find 3% hydrogen peroxide at a pharmacy or grocery store. Hydrogen peroxide may lighten the color of darker carpets. As long as you keep the percentage of hydrogen peroxide below 3%, however, this risk is minimal."

      "content": "Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous spot. Especially when using hydrogen peroxide to clean your carpets, test your cleaning solution to ensure that you won’t accidentally cause discoloration. Simply wet a towel with your cleaning solution and rub it on the carpet in the corner of the closet, for instance. [5] X Research source Let it sit for a few minutes, blot with a dry towel, and wait 24 hours. If no fading or other discoloration occurs, your mixture is likely safe to use on the rest of the carpet."

Then lay it out in the direct sunlight until the carpet is fully dry."
