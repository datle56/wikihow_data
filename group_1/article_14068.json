      "content": "A double die penny has doubled features and may look off-center. This is a rare type of coin minted when the design on the die used to stamp (strike) the coin's features is misaligned. It only looks like the coin has been struck twice, though. In reality, it was only struck once, and it's the error in the die that makes the features look doubled. [1] X Research source For the same reason, the coin design may look slightly or dramatically off-center. [2] X Research source A die is made from a hub, which has an image of the coin engraved on it as it will appear when the coin is minted. To make the die, the hub gets pressed up against a piece of steel so it can imprint the negative (reverse) image of the coin onto it. [3] X Research source If the hub is misaligned (which can happen after a lot of use), the coin image on the die will also be misaligned. It's also possible (though much rarer) for coins to be minted with triple and quadruple dies. Most double die pennies are only worth a few dollars. But the rarer and better condition they're in, the more their value increases."

      "title": "A double die penny has letters, numbers, or designs that look doubled.",
      "content": "A double die penny has letters, numbers, or designs that look doubled. For example, if a die was misaligned and is now doubled on the year the coin was minted, the year on the obverse side of the penny will look like it was struck twice. The numbers will also be noticeably raised from the face (called the field) of the coin. [4] X Research source How do I confirm I have a double die penny? If you suspect your penny could be double died, examine both the obverse (front) and reverse side of the penny closely. Some doubling can be seen with the naked eye, but it can also be so subtle that you need to look at it through an eye loupe or a microscope to see it. Coin collectors and numismatists catalog double die pennies as either \"Double Die Obverse\" (DDO) or \"Double Die Reverse\" (DDR) depending on which side of the coin is doubled."

This penny has strong a strong double die in the words \"IN GOD WE TRUST\" and \"LIBERTY\" on the obverse side. You can also see it in Abraham Lincoln's ear, chin, bow-tie, and vest. Only three 1958 double die pennies are known to exist, and one of them sold in 2023 for a whopping $1.14 million! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "1955 Double Die Penny The 1955 Lincoln penny has the honor of having kicked off coin collectors' interest in double die pennies. And for good reason: it has an obvious double die error – even a newbie to coin collecting could spot it! If you're lucky enough to find one, just look at the obverse side and you'll see right away that the words \"IN GOD WE TRUST\" and \"LIBERTY,\" as well as the year, are dramatically doubled. An ungraded version of this penny can sell for $1000, whereas a mint version can go for up to $30,000 at auction! [6] X Research source In the coin world, \"grading\" is how collectors find an old coin's value . To get a grade, they typically send the coin to a professional grading service like NGC or PGCS , which will check how good the coin looks (i.e., if it still has luster, if any of the details are faded, if the color is dull, etc.). If a coin is uncirculated, meaning it was never used to buy and sell goods in public, and looks almost like it's fresh out of the mint, it could achieve a mint grade – the highest of all! This alone can increase the coin's value hundreds or even thousands of times."

Like the 1955 double die penny, the doubling is strongest in the \"IN GOD WE TRUST\" and \"LIBERTY\" words on the obverse side. The year is also obviously doubled. One of these coins in mint condition sold for $126,000 in 2008! [7] X Research source The \"S\" stands for \"San Francisco,\" which was where this coin was minted.

      "content": "Machine-doubled pennies are made when the die moves during a strike. The die isn't flawed, it just isn't fully secured in its seat. So when it strikes the planchet to make the coin, it bounces, causing the strike to look slightly smeared You can tell the difference between machine-doubled and double die pennies by looking at the doubling's flatness. If it's flat and isn't separated from the original detail, it's machine doubled. If it's more raised and separated, it's a double die. [12] X Research source Because machine doubling is simply an error in the strike and not in the die, it doesn't make a penny (or any coin) more valuable. Machine doubling is also sometimes referred to as ejection, shift, strike, or shelf doubling."

For example, one counterfeit 1955 double die penny was identified partly because the reverse side featured the initials \"VDB\" on the bottom. \"VDB\" stands for Victor David Brenner, the man who designed the Lincoln cent. But that detail only appears on pennies that were issued in 1909.

      "content": "Assess the penny's weight and metal composition. One of the quickest ways to tell if a double die penny is real is to weigh it. Each coin produced in a mint has a specific weight that never changes, no matter how many are struck in a single run. They also have a specific composition of metal. For example, all 1955 Lincoln cents weigh 3.1 g (0.11 oz) and are composed of 95% copper, 2.5% tin, and 2.5% zinc. If you find one that weighs differently or is made with more or less of those metals, it's counterfeit! [15] X Research source A professional grading service like NGC can use X-ray scanners to determine what metals your double die penny is made of."

Pennies with strong, obvious double dies, like those from 1955 and 1958, can sometimes sell for tens of thousands (or even over a million) dollars at auction! Others, like the 1972 penny, have weaker dies, but are still highly sought after by serious coin collectors who are willing to pay upwards of $20,000 for it. Even if your double die penny is in poor condition, it's still worth sending it to NGC or PCGS to get it graded . If nothing else, you may still be able to sell your penny for $10 or $20 – that's a 1000%-2000% profit!"
