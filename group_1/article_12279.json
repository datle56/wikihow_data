      "content": "Leave the sausages in the fridge until they feel soft to the touch. Once the sausages feel soft to the touch and you can't feel any ice or frost on them, they should be fully defrosted. The fridge is possibly the easiest method to use but is also the slowest. If you have a large batch of sausages, it could take up to 24 hours for the sausages to fully defrost. [4] X Trustworthy Source EatRight.org Organization associated with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics providing advice about food, health, and fitness Go to source When the sausages are thawed, you can keep them in the fridge for 3 to 5 days before you cook them. If you do take the sausages out of the fridge before this time, cook them immediately."

A symbol of a dish with wavy lines above it indicates that the plate is safe for microwave use. A symbol of wavy lines also means that the plate is microwave-safe."

The water should feel cool to the touch. This helps to make sure that the water around the meat stays at a constant temperature. [11] X Research source The dripping faucet also ensures that the water in the bowl is constantly moving. This prevents bacteria from growing while the sausages are thawing in the bowl."

If you have 1 or 2 small sausages, they might be fully thawed in 25 minutes. If you have 6 or more large sausages, it might take an hour or more. [12] X Research source Don't leave the bowl of meat under the tap for longer than 4 hours as bacteria will start to grow."
