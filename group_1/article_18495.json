      "content": "There are a few ways to check if a gas station accepts Apple Pay. While many major gas station chains accept Apple Pay, some of them don't accept it at every location. You also may be curious if a smaller, local gas station accepts Apple Pay. You can check if a gas station accepts Apple Pay in one of the following ways: Check beforehand with Apple Maps. Search Apple Pay to see gas stations nearby that accept Apple Pay. You can also search for a specific gas station and scroll down to the \"Good to Know\" section. If you see the Apple Pay logo and it says \"contactless payments,\" that location accepts Apple Pay. Look for contactless payment symbols near the register or on the gas station's front door. One of the symbols is an oval with a hand holding a credit card, and the other is the Apple symbol with the word \"Pay.\" [2] X Research source Ask the cashier at the checkout if the gas station accepts Apple Pay. You can also call ahead of time to ask if the location accepts Apple Pay."
