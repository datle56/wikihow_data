If you're being asked to enter your network security key, the device you're trying to use needs to know your current Wi-Fi password. Fortunately, you can usually find this information printed on your router or modem. Look for a sticker that says something like \"Wireless Password,\" \"WPA2/3 Password,\" \"Wireless security key,\" \"passphrase,\" or \"SSID/SSID Key.\". The password found here is the default password and will not work if you've changed the Wi-Fi password . You might see two passwords on your router: one for the network and one for admin. The network security key is not the admin password . The admin password only helps you login to your router online, not to connect to a network."

This is a common error that pops up whenever you use a network security key for the first time, and there are many reasons for it to appear: Your device is incompatible: Your phone, tablet, laptop, or computer may be too outdated to connect with your router. Fix this by running an update on your device and updating the device's network drivers. Your password is incorrect: Enter the password a few more times, paying close attention to capital and lowercase letters as well as commonly confused letters and numbers, like O and 0 or 1 and I. Copy and paste the network password to a different word processor or try a different font so you can easily tell the difference between an O and a 0. The router is offline: It could've been online a few seconds ago when you were getting the network security key, and then it crashed, causing the \"mismatch\" error. You can wait for your ISP to restore service or restart your router if you think it's not an ISP problem."

      "title": "How can I keep my network secure?",
      "content": "How can I keep my network secure? There are some things that you can do to keep your network secure, including Change the default password: Did you know that many router manufacturers publicly share default login credentials online? While this may seem easy for users who forget their login information, it's a major security issue. Since this information is easily accessible, it becomes much more straightforward for hackers to access networks and steal sensitive data. Protect yourself and your network by changing your router's default login credentials to a strong, unique password. Create a guest network: If there's lots of foot traffic in your network, it's much easier for someone up to no good to access your personal information if they are allowed on your personal network. Luckily, you can set up multiple networks on one router (if you have the right router), and having a guest network greatly reduces the chance that one of your network users will access your information. Enable MAC filtering: this allows you to see who's on your network more easily than if MAC filtering were off. With MAC filtering enabled , no one can piggyback onto your network. Unauthorized devices are not allowed to join the network, even if they know the security key. Set up a VPN on your router: A VPN encrypts the information shared through your router and prevents anyone from snooping and spying on your devices. Many VPN services have a limited amount of devices they can support, but if you add your router, you can use a VPN on every device that connects to that router!"
