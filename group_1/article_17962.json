      "title": "Turn the cuffs of your sweatpants inside-out.",
      "content": "Turn the cuffs of your sweatpants inside-out. Take the bottom hems of the pant legs, and turn them inside out so that they’re folded up over the pant leg by about 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm). Note that it’s easiest to do this hack while you’re wearing them! To crop the legs even shorter, fold the hem further up your leg. This helps them fit better without having to shrink them through alterations."

      "content": "Wrap an elastic band around the middle of the folded cuff. Take an elastic band, like a hair tie or a rubber band, and slip it over the inside-out cuff so that it’s about centered. This will be the new “cuff” of the sweatpants. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold the hem down over the elastic band.",
      "content": "Fold the hem down over the elastic band. Now take the very edge of the pants—which you just folded up, and fold them back down over the elastic band so that the band stays in place but is hidden by the folded hem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck the folded hem inside the pant legs.",
      "content": "Tuck the folded hem inside the pant legs. Finally, use your fingers to “roll” the hem inward, so that it’s inside the sweatpants’ leg and held in place by the elastic. Essentially, you’re just folding the hem into the leg of the pans and using an elastic band to cinch it in place around your leg. Easy peasy! [2] X Research source Now, style your makeshift joggers with high-top shoes or low-cut sneakers for a fresh look."

      "title": "Lay the pants flat with the crotch facing up.",
      "content": "Lay the pants flat with the crotch facing up. Lay them on a flat surface. Use your hands to smooth out the fabric as much as you can, erasing any ridges or wrinkles. This is a simple, quick, and easy everyday fold that leaves very few creases and wrinkles, so you look great in your sweats next time you wear them."

    {
      "title": "Fold the crotch inward.",
      "content": "Fold the crotch inward. You’ll notice that the crotch sticks out, which can make it tricky to achieve a tidy fold. No worries! Just fold the crotch inward so that the pants form more of a rectangle. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the legs up toward the waistband in thirds.",
      "content": "Fold the legs up toward the waistband in thirds. Now, bring the bottom hem of the sweatpants up about a third of the way toward the waistband. Then, fold them up another third, and then another, until the fold reaches the waistband. Nothing to it! [4] X Research source Or, if you’re not great at eyeballing thirds (we’re right there with you), fold the legs up to the midway point, then fold the waistband down to the midway point, and finally fold the bundle in half where they meet."

      "title": "Fold the sweatpants in half lengthwise on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Fold the sweatpants in half lengthwise on a flat surface. Lay your sweatpants down on a flat surface and fold them in half as you normally would—in half lengthwise with one leg stacked on top of the other. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the pants in half again to bring the hems up to the waistband.",
      "content": "Fold the pants in half again to bring the hems up to the waistband. Fold the pants in half again, but this time you must fold them at the midpoint between the waist and ankles. Bring the ankle portions up to the waistband so that the hem of each leg is touching the top of the pants. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the gusset that’s sticking out and fold it inwards. In his viral video , Nate Berkus names this step as the trickiest but most important step in the folding process. Grab the crotch section that’s sticking out from the side and fold it on top of the folded pants to create a straight line. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the sweatpants in thirds to create a brick-shaped final fold. Then, fold the legs up to the hem again, making sure that the gusset stays tucked. Fold the legs up once more. You should now have a brick-shaped item without anything sticking out on the side. This shape will make your sweatpants fit perfectly in your drawer. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the sweatpants flat with the crotch facing up.",
      "content": "Lay the sweatpants flat with the crotch facing up. Lay them on a flat, solid surface, which will make it easier. Smooth the fabric with your hands until there are no wrinkles or ridges. Otherwise, it won’t be as compact as it could be. “Rolling really does maximize the space in a suitcase,” says Naylon. “So if you can roll, that will definitely use up all the space properly.” This method is excellent for packing sweatpants for a trip, or for fitting them into drawers when you don’t have much storage space."

      "content": "Roll the pants tightly from the cuffs up to the waistband. Take the bottom cuff of the pants and, as snugly as you can, start rolling them up toward the waistband. [11] X Research source The tighter you roll, the smaller your final bundle will be."

[12] X Research source Tuck any loose edges into the band, and you’re done! Now you have a small and secure, rolled-up pair of sweatpants ready for travel. Moon says, “When you roll, you can sometimes, depending on the dimension, stand them up so you can see them all at a glance.” Try standing the sweatpants on-end for easy access."

      "content": "Fold the legs up toward the waistband, but leave a little space. Take the cuffs of the legs and bring them up to the waist of the sweatpants, but not all the way. Leave about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) of space. This will come in handy in the next steps. [15] X Research source Now, the sweatpants are folded more or less in half."

      "content": "Fold the legs up toward the waistband again. Now, take the legs of the sweatpants and fold them up to the waist, so that the legs are double-folded. Again, leave a bit of a gap between the folded edge and the waistband—aim for where you folded the legs the first time. [16] X Research source For thicker fabrics or an even smaller bundle, fold this portion in thirds up to the waistband, and skip the next step."

      "content": "Fold the legs up a third time, all the way to the waistband. Now, fold the legs toward the waistband one final time, this time folding them so that the edge meets the edge of the waistband. You’ll be left with a tidy little bundle! [17] X Research source Depending on the thickness of your sweatpants’ fabric, you may need to fold more or fewer times to achieve that sturdy bundle. For thin sweatpants, fold the legs 3 times, as these steps show. For thick fabric, you might only fold them once, then fold them again in thirds rather than folding them in half 3 times."

      "content": "Stand the bundle upright in your drawer. Part of the advantage of the KonMari method is easy viewing and access to your sweatpants while they’re in your drawers. To store them, set them upright so that they’re “standing” on the waistband and the fold you created, almost like a tent. “It's file, don't pile,” says Moon. “You want to be able to see everything without having to dig or guess or mess it all up again.”"

Make sure the crotch faces upwards, then fold one pant leg over the other, taking care to match up the legs as closely as possible. This is similar to the roll fold but a bit more secure and won’t come undone as easily if you’re traveling and jostling your bags, for example."
