      "content": "Gain weight slowly if you’re underweight. Curves are made up of a combination of muscle and fat, so eat a healthy diet to ensure that your body has time to increase both equally. It's not good for you to gain or lose too much weight at once, though, so make small adjustments to add calories into your diet. You may be able to gain as much as a pound of weight a week safely, but not everyone can or should—talk to your doctor before you start a comprehensive weight gain program. Eat a full meal after you work out. Your body needs carbohydrates and protein to build muscle. Eat calorie dense snacks, like nuts, hummus, and full fat yogurt. Enjoy junk food, candy, and soda in moderation. They shouldn't make up the majority of your calories. Incorporate protein into your diet to help stay fit and get an hourglass figure.

      "content": "Wear items that fit you well and hug your natural curves. If you drown your figure in thick fabrics that stand away from your body, you won't show your curves. However, if you wear form-fitting clothing, you can make the most of what you have. Wear clothes that follow your natural curves, but that don't fit too tightly. [8] X Research source For example, you can wear a body-contour dress, a fitted jacket, or a stretchy top to help show off your curves. Avoid wearing items that are loose or baggy as these will make your figure seem boxy or square-shaped. Clothing that drapes across your figure at an angle can also help to emphasize your curves. Try clothing that falls in horizontal folds at your neckline or across your hips."

Some color-blocked items also have 1 color or print on the front of the garment and just black on the sides so that the eye is drawn to the print. [9] X Research source If you don’t have any color-blocked items and you want to accent your upper body, try wearing a brightly-colored, form-fitting top with a pair of black leggings or jeans.
