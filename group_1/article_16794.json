The only way to find a Nether Fortress without cheats is to enter the Nether and look for one. [1] X Research source Nether Fortresses tend to spawn on the positive side of the X-axis. To find one, move north or south while keeping the X-axis positive. Nether Fortresses can spawn within a 368x368 block section in Java Edition or a 416x416 block section in Bedrock Edition.
