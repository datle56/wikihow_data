      "content": "Lie in the most natural sleeping position you can. Don't hold anything, put your legs on the bed, and don't pick your head up. If you normally sleep on your stomach, do so when fake sleeping. What many people find is to pretend like you are eating cereal. Not everyone knows if it is real or not. People you know won't find it suspicious."

      "content": "Avoid tightly pinching your eyelids together. To give the best impression of sleep, your muscles, including your eyelids, should be relaxed. Look down as you close your eyes to keep your eyelids from fluttering. Your eyes aren’t always fully closed when sleeping. Let your eyelids droop and close gently; you may still be able to see out of the slit of your eyelids. To fake REM sleep (the deep stage sleep when your eyes move rapidly) look from side to side quickly with your eyelids closed. You can even twitch the muscles in your face. Try twitching your forehead and jaw muscles for a convincing effect. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "If you hear a loud noise or are touched, take a short, sudden breath and twitch your body slightly. Even during sleep, our bodies are aware of what is happening around them.

Be sure not to smile or open your eyes, or you will give away that you are actually awake."

Put your caffeinated drink into a solid-colored reusable water bottle so it doesn’t look suspicious. Leave the bottle on your nightstand or on the floor by your bed. You’ll feel the effects of caffeine about 45 minutes after you eat or drink something caffeinated.
