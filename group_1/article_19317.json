      "content": "Burn back fat by exercising and adhering to a healthy diet. Back rolls aren't inherently unhealthy, and may be caused by factors beyond your control, such as aging, your environment, or genetics. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source But if you want to eliminate them or reduce their appearance, 2 to 4 days a week of targeted strength training exercises can help, as can eating more fat-burning foods and reducing caloric intake. You cannot spot-treat back rolls specifically, but that's OK! The strength training exercises that will help burn fat on your back will also burn fat elsewhere on your body. Adjust your workout based on your fitness level, but try to do at least 2 to 6 sets of each exercise 2-4 days a week, with 60 to 90 seconds of rest in between a set. [2] X Research source The number of reps of each exercise will depend on the exercise and your skill level. Be sure to give yourself at least a day or 2 each week to rest. In between strength training days, get a half hour of moderate cardio activity in, such as walking, jogging, kickboxing, or dancing."

      "content": "Reverse fly This is a workout that targets your shoulders and arms and will help to strengthen your posterior muscles. You'll need 2 dumbbells to do this dumbbell fly , but any weight will do—choose whatever you’re comfortable with. If you're new to lifting or working with heavier weights, complete 1 to 5 reps; if you're comfortable doing more or using lighter weights, aim for 6 to 12 reps, or more; just go slow to start and listen to your body to know when to stop so you don't injure yourself. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Start a rep by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding one dumbbell in each hand at your side. Take a bow, bringing your pelvis back and thrusting your chest forward until your upper body is parallel to the ground. Keep your knees slightly bent—avoid locking them. Let your arms hang by your sides, still holding the dumbbells, with your palms facing one another. Keep your elbows just slightly bent and your chin tucked. Slowly exhale as you raise your arms out to your sides so that they’re parallel with your shoulders—like you’re an airplane. Then slowly lower your arms again while inhaling."

You can use 2 dumbbells for this exercise, but if you don’t have dumbbells or prefer not to use them, you can do without. Assume a push-up position on the floor: hands flat on the ground about shoulder-width apart, arms fully extended, with your body forming a straight line from top to bottom. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re using dumbbells, assume the same position, but hold a dumbbell in each hand. Concentrating on holding onto the dumbbells adds an extra challenge to this workout. Hold this position for 5 seconds, then slowly lower yourself to the ground. Do this 6 times. For an added challenge, hold one plank for 30 seconds to 2 minutes (rather than doing 5-second reps). Experts don't recommend planking for longer than 2 minutes as there's not much benefit after that.

      "content": "Push-ups Push-ups are one of the best workouts to do to burn back fat. They help to stabilize your lumbar and spine by working out your back muscles. Doing push-ups regularly can also reduce back pain and provide you with a leaner physique. Lie down on the ground on your chest with your hands flat at your sides, just outside your shoulders. Keep your feet hip-width apart. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For an easier push-up, use a sturdy elevated surface, such as a kitchen counter or a desk, and push off of that. Begin one rep by lifting your hips, thighs, and chest off the floor so that your bodyweight is entirely supported by your toes and your hands. Exhale as you extend your arms until they’re straight. Try to keep your body in a plank position the whole time—totally straight and firm. Inhale as you lower yourself back down again. Aim to complete 10 to 20 reps, but go easy on yourself if you're a beginner."

You can do this exercise on a Swiss ball , but it’s also totally fine to do it on the floor if you don’t have one or prefer not to use one. Begin one rep by lying on the floor on your side with your legs stacked on top of one another and your knees bent. [7] X Research source If you’ve got a Swiss ball, position it a few feet from the wall. Lie on one hip on the ball, positioning each foot against the place where the wall and floor meet, one foot in front of the other. Hold your upper body curled slightly inward at all time and avoid lying with your back pressed against the ball to prevent lower back injury. Place your upper hand behind your head with your elbow bent. Hold your bottom arm out from your body, or use your lower hand to clutch your lower knee or thigh. If you’re on your ball, hold your hands behind your head with your fingers clasped. Crunch your upper side by pulling your upper arm toward your middle, exhaling as you crunch. Try to get your upper arm as close to your upper thigh as you can. On the ball, push your inner elbow towards the wall until your torso is almost upright. Pause and hold this motion for a brief second before inhaling and lowering your side again. Repeat with the other side. Do 10-20 reps."

      "content": "Lat pull-downs Lat pull-downs target your lats, or latissimus dorsi —the muscles located at the middle and lower back that connect your arms to your spine. These muscles help you maintain good posture, stabilize your spine, and support your shoulders and lower back, and exercising them regularly with lat pull-downs can help you burn back fat and eliminate rolls. You can use a pull-down machine for this one, but if you don’t want to make the trek to the gym, use a resistance band and do the workout at home. Start one rep by grasping the middle of the band in both hands with your arms extended upward at a 45-degree angle. Bend your elbows to pull the band down at that same angle, sliding your hands apart along the band as you pull it to your chest. Slowly extend your arms again to return the band to its starting position. Keep control of your movements here; avoid letting the band snap back. Do 15 to 30 reps. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Yoga Yoga is a great exercise for anyone, but it can be especially helpful if you’ve got a sore back that prevents you from doing the other workouts on this list or if you’re out of shape and need a mild workout to help you get back into exercising. Doing yoga can help burn fat on its own, but it also alleviates stress, which can reduce your cortisol levels—that is, the hormone that encourages fat buildup. Try taking a weekly class or doing some light yoga on your own every day to de-stress. Because you can modify yoga to suit your needs, it’s perfect for people who aren’t up for an intense workout. But certain stretches, like the half-moon and warrior 3, can help strengthen and tone your back muscles, reducing back rolls. To do a half-moon pose, stand with your feet flat on your yoga mat and bend over forward so that your upper body is parallel to the ground. Lower your right arm until your hand touches the ground (you may bend your knees slightly if you have to). [9] X Research source Lift your left leg behind you so that it is parallel with the ground. Extend your left arm above you, so that it forms a straight line with your other arm. Hold this pose for 10 seconds or so and then repeat with the other side. [10] X Research source To do a warrior 3, begin the same way you began the half-moon, standing with your feet flat on the mat and facing forward. Bend your upper body forward so that it's parallel with the ground, but keep your hands akimbo. Lift your right leg until it forms a straight line with your upper body and is parallel to the ground. [11] X Research source Hold this pose for 10 seconds and then switch legs.

Experts recommend drinking about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men and about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) a day for women. As a general rule, you’re probably well hydrated if you rarely feel thirsty and if your urine is clear or light yellow.

Just be sure you’re getting some plain water throughout the day and not relying on low-nutrient beverages like sugary soda for your hydration. Remember to hydrate more when you exercise, especially if you sweat a lot.

How many calories you need to lose weight depends on your body type and age, but generally, you’ll need to cut about 500 calories a day to lose 1 lb (0.45 kg) a week.

Eat a balance of leafy greens, whole grains, and protein-rich lean meats or plant-based meat substitutes every day.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Fibrous veggies like spinach, sweet potatoes, broccoli, peas, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower are great sides to any meal: the fiber expands in your stomach, making you feel fuller so you can cut back on your main course portions.

Sometimes fat distribution is the cause of back rolls, but if you have poor posture, any soft skin will be more likely to bulge and cause rolls. Your posture may naturally change as you age, making back rolls more likely to occur, but staying aware of your posture may help you eliminate or reduce back rolls. Be mindful of your posture during daily activities, especially sedentary ones, like watching TV or working at a desk job. [21] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Regular movement throughout the day can help promote good posture , even if it's just for a few minutes at a time. Yoga in particular can improve flexibility and posture. Ensure work and dining surfaces—like your desk or your kitchen table—are at a comfortable height for you."
