      "content": "Develop the right attitude. The mind may not be a muscle, but it's still incredibly strong, and can make the difference between succeeding and failing at your goal. Being fit is a marathon, not a sprint, and it requires making changes to your entire lifestyle. Don't give up when you're not getting what you're heading for... Don't approach this with the mindset that you can abandon the changes you make as soon as you reach your ideal fitness goal or you risk slipping into your bad habits again. Being fit should mean incorporating things into your life that you can eventually do by habit."

      "content": "Keep track of your progress and be proud of minor improvements. It is a good idea to start a 'fit journal' so that you can keep track of when you work out, what you do, and for how long. You can also log what you eat each day. You may find that when you have to write down whether you snacked or not you may be less inclined to snack. Don't think that just because you have one setback, you may as well scrap it all and give up for the day. Don't be discouraged if you stop losing weight or stop gaining muscle; remember that plateaus are normal but overall you've put yourself on an upward trajectory and that's definitely something to be proud of."

      "content": "Incorporate more physical exercise into your daily routine. By regularly challenging yourself you keep your physical self \"tuned up\". If getting fit means losing weight, this will help the pounds melt away—and stay away! If you're training for endurance, this is the way to ensure steady improvement.Consistent daily exercise is very important factor.You must not skip days. Take the subway or bike to work or school instead of driving. If that's not possible, park several blocks away from your office building to force yourself into two 15-minute walks every day. When you go to the grocery store, hardware store, movies, or mall, park at the end of the lot instead of wrangling for a spot near the front door. Walk the dog more often—both your body and your pup will thank you. Clean your house vigorously. You'd be surprised how physically taxing housework is: dusting your shelves, cleaning your toilets, doing the dishes, mowing the lawn, pulling weeds, vacuuming and sweeping, picking up the house, and cleaning the garage will definitely give you a workout. Making yourself and your family clean parts of your house on a regular basis will not only create a better environment for you to live in, but also make burning calories, staying flexible, and keeping in shape a much simpler process. Exercise at the office. Believe it or not, it’s completely possible to make sitting at your computer into a calorie-burning activity. You can stretch and workout your muscles by doing leg lifts, oblique reaches, and lower back reaches, among others.Give breaks and stand and hear some music or walk for 5 minutes and get back to work."

      "content": "Start an exercise regimen and stick to it . A proper fitness program has five components: a warm-up, an aerobic workout, strength-building exercises, stretching (flexibility), and a cool-down. A good warm-up is a steady walk outside or on the treadmill, a slow pedal on a stationary bike, or a few rounds on the stair master. You want to exercise just enough to get your blood flowing and put your joints through their full range of motion so that your muscles warm up. Exercising without a warm up could lead to pulling or straining a muscle. Cardio workouts improve circulation and endurance. This could include going on a run, biking at a high resistance, or doing an increased speed on a stair crunching machine. You want to work up a sweat and get your blood pumping. Good cardiovascular health is not only good for heart health and blood pressure, it has even been linked to a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s Disease. Doing interval training (i.e. alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity activity) has been shown to be an especially fast and effective way to improve heart health and endurance, and an efficient way to burn fat. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Building muscle through strength-training will not only increase your strength and tone, but will also increase your metabolism, as muscular people have been shown to burn more calories even when they’re at rest. You could work with weights, do squats, push ups, or crunches, among many other exercises. [4] X Research source If going to the gym isn’t for you, try strength-training at home . Stretching during or after a workout increases your flexibility. It can also relieve muscle and joint stiffness. Stretch your legs, arms, back, any muscles that you used while working out (which should generally be all of them.) A cool-down is very similar to a warm-up. You should perform some sort of cardio exercise at a very low level. Cooling down allows your muscles to relax while the blood is still flowing through them at a slightly increased rate. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Note: anyone over the age of 60 or who has heart disease, high blood pressure, or arthritis should consult a doctor before attempting interval training."

      "content": "Switch things up. Any physical activity that takes a bit of effort will help you get fit, but it's important to remember that variety is the spice of life—and of physical fitness! More importantly, as your body gets comfortable performing a certain activity, it learns to do it more efficiently, making it easy for you to plateau in your workouts. Keep both your body and your mind guessing by enjoying a diversity of activities and having fun. Dance. Anything from ballet dance to breakdancing or even jump style will increase your fitness if you stick with it. Enroll in a Zumba or hip-hop class. You’ll be surprised by how many calories you burn while having fun. Go swimming. It doesn't matter if you're treading water , dog paddling , or mastering the butterfly stroke . Swimming is a good form of exercise that can be fun, too. Do yoga. Yoga is a healthy exercise that keeps both your mind and body fit. Pick one day a week to let your body indulge in some serious stretching, rather than doing your normal workout. Yoga will help you maintain your flexibility, but is also a great way to tone your muscles."

The high fiber and water content will make you feel full, and the high vitamin and mineral content will nourish and transform your body naturally. Try to make meals that are half fruits and half veggies. Eat lean protein foods. Try to buy meat that is lean (which means that it has a lower fat percentage). Eat beans, eggs, and seeds to boost your protein intake without the fat that comes with meat. Eat seafood at least once a week.

Purchase the healthy fruits, vegetables, whole grains, soups, etc. that you want yourself to eat, and keep the junk out of your cupboards so you won't be tempted. It's not bad to indulge once in a while, but it's too easy to do so if you keep your house full of unhealthy treats. Instead, the best litmus test for your true desire to indulge is if you're willing to make the trip to the bakery or supermarket to purchase it. (Even better, make that trip on foot or by bike, if possible). Before you indulge, drink two 8oz (250 ml) glasses of water. If you still want the treat after that, go for it. Sometimes our brain confuses our hunger or cravings for food with thirst. Water is one of the best cures for cravings."

It's also cheaper than purchasing drinks whenever you get thirsty and better for the environment. Drink water instead of sugary drinks like soda. If you feel less compelled to drink water because of its lack of taste, try infusing your water with your favorite fruits, like strawberries, blueberries, lemons, oranges, and limes."

Determine how many hours of sleep you need in order to feel refreshed in the morning, then discipline yourself to wake up and go to bed at the same times on a daily basis. Not getting enough sleep also comes at a huge expense to your immune system. You're much more likely to get sick if you don't give your body the energy or time to fight against infectious viruses and bacteria, and you'll take longer to recover from common conditions like a cold. Sleeping too little has also been linked to overeating. [10] X Research source Be sure that you don’t deprive your body of sleep energy or you will make it up in calories."
