      "content": "Grab the bottom 2 to 3 slinky coils with your left hand. Collapse the slinky and hold it vertically with your left hand underneath it. Get a good grip on the bottom 2 or 3 coils with that hand. Hold the slinky out in front of you at about chest level. [1] X Research source It doesn’t matter which hand is your dominant hand, since you’ll be manipulating the slinky equally with both hands."

      "content": "Whip your top hand up 10 in (25 cm) and to the right to create an arc. Use your right (top) hand to quickly whip the top of the slinky up about 10 in (25 cm) and then out to the right, so that you’re creating a small arc. Stop your right hand about shoulder width away from the left one. Both hands should be approximately even with each other. [3] X Research source It will look like you’re holding a small rainbow in front of you."

      "content": "Wait for the slinky to start the bounce back to your left hand. When you whip the slinky to the right, it uncoils and expands. As soon as your right hand stops and the slinky makes the arc, the slinky’s body will immediately want to bounce back to the left like a spring. Keep both hands in position and wait for the moment it starts the bounce back. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Give the slinky a short, quick tug with your left hand. As soon as the slinky starts to bounce back to the left, whip your left wrist a few inches forward and to the left, like you’re giving the slinky a little tug. Return your left hand to its former position. Aside from the tug, keep your left hand in the exact same position. [5] X Research source Do not let go of either end of the slinky! Your hands will stay in the arc position the entire time."

      "title": "Let the slinky’s body bounce back to the right side of the arc.",
      "content": "Let the slinky’s body bounce back to the right side of the arc. After you tug it, the slinky’s body expands forward and to the left to mimic the movement. When you return the left hand to its former arc position at chest level, the slinky lines back up with your right hand. Visually, the slinky creates a cool swirl motion. Then the slinky’s body starts bouncing back to the right side of the arc. Try not to push or pull with either of your hands. Let the slinky’s body move naturally on its own."

This is basically the exact same thing you did with your left hand, except you’re thrusting slightly to the right instead of the left this time. The slinky will make another cool swirl movement on the right side. [6] X Research source"
