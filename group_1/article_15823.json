      "title": "Refocus the conversation back to the original point.",
      "content": "Refocus the conversation back to the original point. Phone calls often drag on because the conversation goes off track. Bring the call back to its original intention to quickly achieve the goal of the conversation so that you can end the call. If the goal of the conversation has already been met, simply say that you’re glad you’ve achieved your objective. For example, “I’m so glad we’ve finally managed to organise a time to play tennis.” [1] X Research source For example, if a conversation has gotten off track, you could say “Anyway, I’ve gotten us off track, let’s decide on a time to meet for coffee next week.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Summarise the call to signal that the conversation is winding down.",
      "content": "Summarise the call to signal that the conversation is winding down. This is particularly useful if the call has diverged from the original point or if it has been a complex conversation. For example, “It’s been great to finally make a plan for our family holiday. To confirm the details, we are all meeting at Grandma’s house on Thursday next week and will be coming back on Saturday.” [2] X Research source If you want to summarise a casual conversation that didn’t have an original point, say something like “It’s been really nice hearing about your promotion. I’m really glad that your job is going well.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make an excuse to finish the conversation quickly.",
      "content": "Make an excuse to finish the conversation quickly. If the person you are talking to is rambling, consider making an excuse to quickly end the call. Try to be honest if possible, as this prevents you from ending up in a web of lies. [3] X Research source ”My phone battery is getting low so I’d better go” is a good line to end a call quickly. Another good option is “I’ve got someone coming over shortly so I need to go.” If you have kids, you could say “I better go organise the kids.” Avoid using a long, elaborate excuse, as these tend to sound fake. Stick with a short, simple reason for leaving and then end the call."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap up the call with a plan to talk again soon.",
      "content": "Wrap up the call with a plan to talk again soon. This is a polite way to signal that the conversation is coming to an end. Simply mention when you’ll see the person next or say that it’d be great to catch up in-person soon. [4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. For example, “It’s been lovely chatting. I’m looking forward to seeing you at softball next week.” If you don’t have an arranged time to see the person next, say something like “It’s been great catching up. Let’s do it again soon.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wish the caller a great day to signal the end of the conversation.",
      "content": "Wish the caller a great day to signal the end of the conversation. This is often used as a social cue to indicate that the call is about to end. Thank the caller for their time and then wish them the best. If they’ve already wished you the best, simply say “Thanks, you too.” [6] X Research source [7] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. For example, try ending a call with “It’s been so nice talking with you. Have a great rest of your day!” If you have been talking about a specific topic during the call, wish them the best with it, if relevant. For example, “So nice to catch up with you. All the best with your wedding planning.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell the caller that you won’t keep them any longer as a polite exit.",
      "content": "Tell the caller that you won’t keep them any longer as a polite exit. This is a great line to use as it doesn’t place the blame for the long conversation on the caller. Instead, it infers that you don’t want to hold them up on the phone. This is a good way to quickly end a call. [8] X Research source For example, when a natural lull in conversation occurs, say something like “Anyway, I’ll let you go – I don’t want to hold you up any longer” or “I know how busy you are, so I won’t keep chatting.” This is a useful option if you’ve already tried more subtle ways to end the conversation with no success. If they respond saying that you aren’t keeping them from anything, politely say that you need to go."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask the caller if there is anything else you can help them with.",
      "content": "Ask the caller if there is anything else you can help them with. This helps to focus the conversation. Ask the caller if you have addressed their concern and if they have any more questions or queries. If they want further information, simply address the topic and then repeat the same question in order to close the call. [9] X Research source Avoid saying “Is that all?”, as this can come across as rude. It is best to ask if they need anymore information or if they require any further help. If the other person is helping you, simply say that you are grateful for their help and end the call."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for a lull in the conversation to wrap things up.",
      "content": "Wait for a lull in the conversation to wrap things up. If you aren’t sure when to end the call, use the lull as an opportunity to do so. This makes the end of the conversation feel nice and natural. This works particularly well after asking if you can help the customer further. Once they say no, wait a few seconds to create a lull and then take the opportunity to bring the call to a close. [10] X Research source If possible, avoid interrupting the caller, as this can come across rudely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give a polite reason for ending the call.",
      "content": "Give a polite reason for ending the call. If the call has gotten off topic or is no longer serving a useful purpose, utilise a natural lull in conversation to say that you need to go. Try to be as polite and honest as possible, as this comes across more professional than a poor excuse. [11] X Research source \"I’ve got a meeting in 10 minutes so I better go”, “It was a pleasure talking with you about your feedback. I just noticed that my call queue is starting to stack up, though – is there anything else I can help with before I go?”, or “A client has just arrived that I need to speak with” are all appropriate and polite lines to end a call with."

    {
      "title": "Thank the person for their call to signal the end of the conversation.",
      "content": "Thank the person for their call to signal the end of the conversation. If necessary, thank the caller for any advice they gave and for any actions they’ve committed to. If you can’t think of anything specific to thank them for, simply tell them that you appreciate the time they’ve taken to talk to you. [12] X Research source For example, “Thanks for your time today – I really appreciate it. It’s been really useful hearing about your new customer service system”."

    {
      "title": "Wish the caller the best and say goodbye.",
      "content": "Wish the caller the best and say goodbye. It is best to use this technique after you have wrapped up the call, as it can seem a little rude if you quickly say goodbye mid-conversation. Take the time to say why you need to go, thank them for their time, and then wish them a good day. [13] X Research source [14] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. For example, “Thanks for your time today. Have a wonderful rest of your day. Speak soon.”"
