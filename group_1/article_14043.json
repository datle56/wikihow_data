      "title": "The Side Sleeper",
      "content": "The Side Sleeper Dogs often sleep on their side with their legs extended. This is usually a comfortable position for dogs, so it typically means your pup is feeling relaxed and safe. Dogs are also likely in a deep sleep when in this position, so don’t be surprised if you notice some signs of dreaming, like twitching or sleep running. [1] X Research source Personality: Dogs who sleep on their side are often trusting and loyal. They’ll sleep practically anywhere but usually prefer their own bed."

      "title": "The Lion Pose",
      "content": "The Lion Pose Also known as “the Sphinx,” this position is when your dog sleeps with their head on top of their paws. When dogs sleep in this position, they are resting but not sleeping deeply. Dogs often drift off in this position if they feel like they’ll need to jump up quickly. In some cases, it could mean your pup is feeling anxious. [2] X Research source Personality: Dogs who sleep in the lion pose are protective and devoted. They typically sleep by your feet or at the door to protect you and/or your family. Some dogs even sleep in this position to guard newborns!"

      "title": "The Superman",
      "content": "The Superman The Superman position resembles the way Superman flies; your dog is lying on their belly with their legs stretched out in front and behind them. When your dog falls asleep in this position, it usually means they’re tired but ready to play if the opportunity presents itself. This is a common sleeping position for high-energy dogs during the day. [3] X Research source Personality: Pups who sleep in the Superman position are usually playful and energetic. They likely played so hard that they wore themselves out and plopped down wherever they were."

      "title": "The Belly-Up",
      "content": "The Belly-Up The belly-up position is often considered one of the cutest dog sleeping positions. In this position, your dog is lying on their back with their belly up and their paws in the air. When dogs are lying in this position, they are completely comfortable and relaxed, and they fully trust you and their environment. They may also be trying to cool off. [4] X Research source Personality: Belly-up sleepers are trusting and loving. They may also be feeling playful, especially if they’re still a puppy. Dogs may not sleep on their backs as much as they get older. This doesn’t mean they’ve stopped trusting you; it’s just not as comfortable for them anymore."

      "title": "The Donut",
      "content": "The Donut The donut position is when a dog curls up into a tight ball with their limbs tucked close to their body, keeping all their vital organs hidden. When a dog sleeps in this position, they’re trying to protect themselves and/or preserve body heat. They may also be feeling anxious about a new environment. [5] X Research source Personality: Dogs who curl up in the donut are often caring but anxious. This position is common for dogs getting used to a new home, strays, or dogs who are sick."

      "title": "The Cuddler",
      "content": "The Cuddler The cuddler position is exactly what it sounds like; your dog sleeps cuddled up next to (or on top of) you or another animal. This position is a sign of affection and bonding, as your dog wants to get as close to you or their companion as possible. This habit likely carried over from their puppy days, when they cuddled with their littermates for warmth. [6] X Research source Personality: Cuddlers are known to be affectionate and loving. They’re very friendly and will do anything to snuggle up next to their favorite person or animal companion! Not everyone wants their dog sleeping in their bed or cuddling up with them at night. To prevent this , professional dog trainer Ty Brown provides a few tips: “You could crate train your dog during the night. Crate training is a humane way of having the dog be in a place that’s safe and comfortable. Second to that is just providing a really nice bed that the dog wants to sleep in. Or, train the dog to go to their bed on command.”"

      "title": "The Burrower",
      "content": "The Burrower Some dogs like to burrow under blankets, pillows, or clothes when they sleep. When your dog sleeps this way, it usually means they’re looking for comfort and security or they’re trying to calm themselves down. It could also be your dog’s way of taking a cozy break and blocking out distractions while they nap. [7] X Research source Personality: Burrowers are often affectionate but needy. They may also be feeling stressed or anxious and are trying to self-soothe."

When your dog sleeps in this position, they’re showing you trust and affection. Dogs often sleep in this position with the person they feel safest with. [8] X Research source Personality: Dogs who sleep in this position are often loving, trusting, and affectionate. Any dog may sleep in this position if they trust you enough."

      "content": "On a cold surface Dogs often fall asleep on cool surfaces, like the kitchen floor, a shady area of pavement, or in front of the air conditioner. Usually, they sleep in the lion or Superman pose, as having their belly against the floor helps cool them off. [9] X Research source Personality: All dogs may sleep on a cold surface, as this is a way to help them cool off."

      "title": "Head and neck raised",
      "content": "Head and neck raised Some dogs prefer to sleep with their head and neck raised, like on a pillow, a couch cushion, or the side of their dog bed. This can just be a comfort thing, but often dogs sleep like this if they’re having trouble breathing. If you notice your dog breathing at a faster rate, breathing loudly, or having a reduced ability to exercise, take them to the vet to check for health problems. [10] X Research source Personality: In general, this sleeping position has nothing to do with personality and is instead associated with breathing problems."

      "title": "On the stomach",
      "content": "On the stomach This position is similar to the Superman, as your dog is lying flat on their stomach. However, their legs may be sprawled out instead of extended directly in front of or behind them. When dogs sleep in this position, it usually means they’re hot and are trying to use the cool floor to reduce their temperature. [11] X Research source Personality: All dogs may sleep in this position regardless of personality, as it is mainly used to help them cool off."

This is normal dog behavior and is their way of trying to make their sleeping spot more comfortable. This behavior may come from dogs’ wolf ancestry.

Puppies sleep more to help them mature, grow, and process the information they’ve learned. They usually nap several times a day and may even sleep for a while every hour. These naps often come out of the blue, and it’s not unheard of for puppies to fall asleep during play or training sessions!

      "title": "Puppies may be restless at night.",
      "content": "Puppies may be restless at night. Puppies may sleep a lot during the day, but this isn’t always the case at night. When you first bring your puppy home, they may be very restless at night and have difficulties sleeping because they aren’t used to being away from their mother and littermates. [19] X Research source They often get up to go to the bathroom, eat, or drink water. This behavior usually stops after a few months, as they begin to sleep for a full 10 hours or so. To train your puppy to sleep through the night, dog trainer Elisabeth Weiss says, “Sleeping in the same room as the human helps the puppy get used to their sleep cycle. Make sure the puppy does not get water for a certain time, maybe three hours or so, before you go to sleep… You can put a little bed on the floor so you can reach down and tether the puppy so he can’t run off and pee in some corner.”"

      "title": "Adult dogs typically sleep 12-14 hours a day.",
      "content": "Adult dogs typically sleep 12-14 hours a day. Adult dogs can sleep anywhere from 8 to 14 hours a day, with an average of 12-14 hours. Just like humans, this can vary depending on the dog’s age, activity level, and personality. Usually, adult dogs sleep the most between 9 pm and 6 am, though they often have afternoon naps. [20] X Research source Puppies and senior dogs need more sleep than adult dogs, usually between 18 and 20 hours per day. Puppies need the extra sleep for growth and development, while senior dogs often have less energy and simply sleep more during the day. Adult dogs should be able to sleep through the night on your schedule. Dog trainer Beverly Ulbrich explains, “The only reason they should wake you up is if they’re sick, like they’re throwing up or they have diarrhea and need help getting out. But if they’re healthy, they should be able to sleep through the night, no problem.” If you notice your dog is sleeping or staying awake more than usual, take them to a vet to check for any underlying issues."

Some dogs may prefer to sleep somewhere cool, while others prefer somewhere warm. Some prefer soft beds, while others prefer something firmer. Keep your dog comfortable by buying them a bed they’ll love, filling their sleeping area with their favorite toys, and keeping fresh water nearby. [22] X Research source When choosing bedding for your dog, canine behaviorist Colleen Demling-Riley explains that you should observe your dog’s personal preferences: “See how your dog sleeps for at least two weeks. If your dog likes to stretch out and prefers hard surfaces, maybe just a blanket is good for them. If they like softer surfaces, a big, fluffy dog bed with rails on the outside to support them might be a better choice.”"
