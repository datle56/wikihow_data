      "content": "Learn the risk factors for gout. If you have gout, a type of arthritis from high uric acid levels, crystals can form in the fluid around your joints. Although older men are more likely to get it, it can affect anyone. Certain risk factors include a diet high in meat and seafood, obesity, chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, family history of gout or if you are on certain medications. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Gout causes inflammation and attacks of joint pain (usually at night and experienced in your big or great toe), along with redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the joint. The discomfort lingers for days to weeks after the attack ends and could actually develop into chronic gout, leading to impaired mobility."

      "content": "Go to your doctor for an exam. If you have chronic gout, or frequent or painful gout attacks, talk to your doctor about starting a prescription medication. Your doctor may do different tests to diagnose gout, including a blood test to measure your uric acid levels, a synovial fluid test (where a needle draws fluid from your joint), or an ultrasound or DECT scan to detect urate crystals. With the results of the tests, your doctor will be able to decide if and which medication you should start. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Your doctor may prescribe medications like allopurinol, febuxostat, or probenecid."

      "title": "Take medication.",
      "content": "Take medication. Your doctor will most likely prescribe specific medications as a first form of treatment for chronic gout, like allopurinol (Aloprim, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric). While these medications can cause an initial increase in gout attacks, they'll eventually prevent them. [3] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Side effects of allopurinol include diarrhea, drowsiness, rash, and blood in your urine. Make sure to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day when taking allopurinol.

Uricosuric drugs boost your body’s ability to get rid of uric acid. You'll probably be prescribed probenecid, but it's not recommended if you have kidney issues. Start by taking 250mg every 12 hours for the first week. Your doctor may increase the prescription over time.

      "title": "Avoid certain medications.",
      "content": "Avoid certain medications. Some medications, including diuretics, make you need to urinate more. This lowers the remaining amount of fluid in your body, but also increases the concentration of said fluid, which can contribute to gout. You should also avoid low doses of aspirin and niacin because they can also increase your uric acid levels.

In many cases, there are alternatives available."

Liquids generally count toward water recommendations, but it's best to stick to water. You should also minimize or cut out drinking alcohol since it can metabolize and increase uric acid levels. [12] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source If you do want to drink something other than water, look for drinks that aren't high in sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or caffeinated. Sugar can increase your risk of gout and caffeine can be dehydrating.

Some studies show that coffee may reduce the levels of uric acid in your blood, although the studies do not show a decrease in gout attacks."
