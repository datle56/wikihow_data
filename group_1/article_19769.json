Record the date when each contact occurred and keep this record in a safe place. If possible, make copies and give them to a trusted relative or friend, or place them in a safety deposit box. This can be used as evidence if you need to consult the police. Save every bit of evidence, as well as a copy. Keep them in separate locations. Save all digital communications, such as emails and phone calls, as well. Write everything down. If you can take pictures, do so.

Notify your children's school(s) not to give out any of your information, and provide them a list of individuals who are allowed to pick up your children. Ask staff to request that anyone on that list provide photo ID to validate their identity. If you cannot pick up your children, contact the school to let them know exactly who will be picking them up. Give your children a \"secret word.\" If the person who comes for the children does not know the secret word when asked (by the children), then your children do not go with him/her and instead call for help immediately."

Put your indoor lights on a timer system so someone always appears home A dog (or even a 'beware of dog sign') is a deterrent to home invasions. Ask police to do regular check ups of your property if you see the stalker outside or frequently driving by. If you live in an apartment or condominium, ask management about its security policies and make sure that there is not a listing of tenants easily accessible to the public."

Have a safe place where all family members can arrange to meet in event of an emergency (the location only being known to a very trusted relative or friend). At this safe location, have needed supplies in a 'flight kit' (money, clothing, medication etc.), as well as emergency numbers for police, legal assistance, and abuse/stalking assistance. Be ready to leave at a drop of a hat if needed. Instead of always worrying, have a plan in place so that you can flee without having to think or pack."

Keep in mind that a TRO or an Order or Protection is to initiate and assist the legal process -- it can not physically protect you from a stalker who is inclined towards violence. You must be responsible for your safety even with a TRO or OP in place. Always carry on your person two copies of the TRO or OOP that was issued, so that you can easily provide one to police and the stalker can not falsely claim to police that he/she wasn't aware of the TRO or OOP. An abuse/stalking counselor or victim's advocate may better assist you in determining what the best options for your situation are. When discussing your options, bring any evidence and logs of harassment that you have. [8] X Research source"
