      "content": "Be smart. This is the ultimate way to hurt your enemy! Especially if your enemy is smarter and more competitive than you. There are many ways that you can gain intelligence, but the one thing where we all get our intelligence from are books. Read as many books as you can. It can be science, mathematics, English, history, or even magazines and newspapers. All of these things will help you gain information. By being smart, you will totally fire up your enemy. Some of you may be too lazy, but all you've got to remember, is your enemies face when you beat them in exams and in life. Remember being smart will open you lot of doors in life. You will have a well-paid job and live a happy life with lots of friends. People will become interested in you and want to be your friend. Even the people that don't like you that much, will ask for your help. You will be respected and popular for your intelligence and that will burn up your enemy inside, although they may not seem to be on the outside. Eventually maybe they will realize what an idiot they were for leaving you and ask to be your friend again."
