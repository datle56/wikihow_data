      "content": "Use a humidifier to moisten your airways and loosen mucus. Dry air can aggravate your sinuses and make it harder for mucus to drain from the nasal passages, which prolongs congestion. Using a humidifier in your bedroom or living room adds moisture to the air to prevent dehydration, help clear your sinuses, and soothe your throat. The humidity in your home should be between 30% and 55%. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source When the humidity is too high, it can lead to mold and dust mites, both of which are common causes of allergies. Clean your humidifier filter every week using vinegar.
