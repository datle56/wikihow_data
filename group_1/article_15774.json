      "title": "Provide lighting throughout your crawlspace.",
      "content": "Provide lighting throughout your crawlspace. Natural light is best, and many crawlspaces have vents that can be opened or removed to let light in. Alternatively, you can place several crawlspace lights, battery-powered lanterns, or other light sources under your home so you’ll have plenty of light when you start your work. [1] X Research source Without light, you won’t be able to properly fit a vapor barrier and do other work you’ll need to complete."

      "content": "Remove old vapor barriers or foundation insulation. If your home has an older vapor barrier or other encapsulation material, you need to completely remove it before encapsulating your crawlspace. [2] X Expert Source Alberto DeJesus Construction Specialist Expert Interview. 15 December 2021. To do this, start on one end of your home and roll the material up systematically. If it is torn into small pieces, take a contractors’ garbage bag with you and place the pieces of the barrier into it. [3] X Research source Wear a face mask in addition to eye protection when removing these items to prevent dirt, dust, and other debris from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth."

      "content": "Clean debris from your crawlspace. Using a contractors’ garbage bag or a small wheelbarrow, move through your crawlspace from left to right. Pick up everything you see. When you’re done, there should only be dirt left on the bottom of the crawlspace. Some items you may need to remove include: [4] X Research source Old construction debris like concrete, nails, and pieces of metal. Rocks. Leaves, sticks, and anything else that may have washed into your crawlspace from outside."

      "title": "Fill in holes and level areas that aren’t completely flat.",
      "content": "Fill in holes and level areas that aren’t completely flat. Use a short-handled shovel to fill in any holes with sand or gravel. Focus on holes that are more than 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) deep. If you don’t fill in holes, water could pool there and increase the moisture level in your crawlspace. It is okay if your crawlspace is on a slant. This is good for drainage."

      "content": "Secure any holes in your foundation. If they're damaged, repair entranceway doors to your crawlspace. Replace rotten wood that could allow animals or the elements to enter your crawlspace. Place wire mesh on small areas where animals could enter your crawlspace. This way, you'll make sure that your crawlspace remains free of animals that damage your vapor barrier in the future.

Then, measure the length of your crawlspace. Record any other features (like pylons or support pillars) that may impact the encapsulation process. [6] X Research source If your home is an L shape, be sure to get proper measurements for all sides of your foundation. Avoid measuring outside. This may give you an inaccurate account of the space you’ll need to encapsulate. Measure the length and height of your entire foundation. Height is important, as you’ll need to purchase vapor barrier and insulation for the foundation walls, too."

You can do this by multiplying the length times width (if it is a rectangle or a square). If your foundation is in a L shape, calculate the area of each part of the L and add the values together. If you have another shape, calculate each rectangular or square portion of the crawlspace and add it to the other portions. Finally, add 10% to the total area. This will account for measurement errors and waste. In addition to the ground area of your crawlspace, determine the area of the bottom 6 inches (15 cm) of your foundation walls. For example, if you have a 10 ft (3.0 m) section of foundation, you'll need to include another 5.5 feet (1.7 m) in your total."

This thickness of vapor barrier will provide good insulation and will be durable enough to last decades. If you choose a thinner barrier, it may degrade and allow moisture into your crawlspace."

You may need to make additional cuts, but this will provide better encapsulation."
