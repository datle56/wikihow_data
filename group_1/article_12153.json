      "title": "Choose a color theme.",
      "content": "Choose a color theme. Your table will be much more cohesive if there is a theme to your decorations. The theme can be either a color or an event, such as a birthday, a season, or a specific holiday. If the theme is a color instead of an event, limit yourself to 2-3 colors that go well together. If the theme is a holiday, choose colors that correspond with that holiday. For example, if it is a Christmas buffet, use decorations that are red, green, and gold."

    {
      "title": "Buy or make items related to your theme.",
      "content": "Buy or make items related to your theme. Create a centerpiece that incorporates your theme using fruit, flowers, props, or candles. You can then choose items that hint at that theme for the rest of the table, such as edible garnish, flowers, fruit, leaves, or cinnamon sticks. Some other ideas for table decorations, depending on your theme, are ribbons or seashells."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid overdoing the decorations.",
      "content": "Avoid overdoing the decorations. You want the decorations to be classy, not gaudy or overwhelming. Ideally, the food will be on display and any décor around the table will enhance the look of the food, not hide it or overwhelm it. Also, avoid sprinkling the table with glitter or other non-edible decorations, as these often end up on people's plates or in their mouths."

      "title": "Coordinate your tablecloth, a table runner, napkins, and placemats.",
      "content": "Coordinate your tablecloth, a table runner, napkins, and placemats. Choose either a tablecloth or a table runner to place beneath the food on the buffet table. Napkins are a must as well. Placemats are optional, but can be a nice touch to have beneath your serving dishes. When choosing these items, be sure that they are within your color scheme and that they go well with one another. Consider oversized cloth napkins in colors that match your theme. For a more casual buffet, paper napkins are just fine. No matter what, supply plenty of spare napkins in case of a mess. Table runners should hang about 6 inches (15 cm) down the table on both sides."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare a label for each food item.",
      "content": "Prepare a label for each food item. Make labels for each dish that you will have on the table. Use cardstock or paper folded in half, with the name of the dish written on one side. Write or type in a bold, clear font that is large enough for any guest to read. Write whether a dish is vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free on the label, beneath the name of the dish."

    {
      "title": "Consider making a menu to display.",
      "content": "Consider making a menu to display. For an extra touch, you can create a menu of all the different foods that will be served. Display the menu either using a small menu easel on the table or a stand beside the beginning of the table. That way, guests will know what they will find further down the table and can make more informed food choices."

      "content": "Set up a logical journey down the table. Imagine yourself starting at the beginning of the table, picking up a plate, dishing up an appetizer and a salad, and then moving down to the main course dish.

      "content": "Move your buffet table to a convenient location. It needs to be visible, but not in people’s way. If you have a lot of guests and your room is large, set the table away from any walls so that your guests have access to the table from both sides. If the room is smaller, place the table against a wall, out of the way. If possible, leave space for people to stand on either end of the table to avoid too much crowding in the front."

      "title": "Lay down your tablecloth or table runner.",
      "content": "Lay down your tablecloth or table runner. Either of these will create a lovely base for the buffet table, and can mask a table that you may not want to be shown. If you use a table runner, position it in the center of the table and make sure that it runs the full length of the table."
