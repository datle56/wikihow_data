      "content": "Get the right tackle equipment. A sturgeon fishing rod should be 6 to 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 m) in length and made of a single piece (rather than a rod that is assembled). The reel should be outfitted with line that can hold at least 80 pounds and have enough line to run 250 yards (228.6 m)."

      "content": "String the right hook on the end of your line. Many sturgeon fishermen recommend a hook size of 5/0 to 9/0, depending on the species of sturgeon you are fishing for."

      "title": "Add the right bait to your hook.",
      "content": "Add the right bait to your hook. The adage “fresh is best” applies to sturgeon fishing. [1] X Research source Types of recommended bait include crawfish, fresh water clams, salmon eggs or carcasses, shad and other small fish. If fresh bait isn’t available, adding scents to the bait will catch the attention of the sturgeon. Shrimp oil, shad oil and sardine oil are just a few of the many fish oils on the market."

      "title": "Locate the right spot to fish.",
      "content": "Locate the right spot to fish. Ledges, small channels, sand flats and other rocky points are recommended when you fish for Sturgeon. Sturgeon move with the tides as they search for food. [2] X Research source If the tide is out, look for deeper water. If the tide has come in, fishing in small beds of 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) may produce a good catch."

      "content": "Identify the sturgeon’s bite on your line, which can vary according to the outdoor temperature. [3] X Research source During colder weather, the bites are slow and repetitive. The repetitive action will help you differentiate between a bite and the tide moving your line. During warmer weather, the bite tends to be more aggressive. This occurs because the fish are getting close to spawning season (typically in July and August) and are more active. Look for the rod tip to dip and line movements."

      "content": "Pull up on your fishing rod so that you secure the catch. Once you feel the bites, it is important to yank the rod so that the hook lodges securely into the sturgeon. [4] X Research source"
