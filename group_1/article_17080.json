      "content": "Describing a music video can be tough, but we have some solid tips. Even if you can't find the music video by its lyrics, you may be able to find it by searching for standout details, objects, and themes from the video itself. For the best chance at identifying a video: When searching, include the phrase \"video\" in your search so it's clear what you're looking for. If you know when the song or video was released, include the year or era in your search. For example, \"1990\" or \"80s\" would work. Type some descriptors of the music in the video. For example, if it's an R&B song, include \"R&B\" in your search. If the song has no lyrics, add \"instrumental.\" If it's a country song, you'll want to include \"country.\" Enter a few words about the setting. For example, if it took place in a hospital, on a beach, or in a car, add those keywords to your search. If the video or song has a certain theme, like \"breakup,\" \"wedding,\" or \"depression,\" add that to your search. You can also try describing the appearance of the performer(s), such as their outfits, hair styles and colors, or notable features. This will be extra helpful if there's something unique about how they dress or look. Using these tips, you should now have a query like \"video country female singer sets house on fire\" or \"video singer dancing in a multicolored room in a puffy jacket 2015.\" Now that you have some ideas for how to phrase your search, enter your search terms into Google, Bing, and YouTube for the best chance at finding the music video."
