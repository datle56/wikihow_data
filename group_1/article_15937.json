Often, we have become so accustomed to our negative thoughts that they've become \"automatic,\" or habitual reflexes. Taking a moment to record the thought in your journal will begin to give you the distance you need to change these thoughts. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source When you have a negative thought, write down what the thought was. Also note down what was happening when the thought occurred. What were you doing? Who were you with? Where were you? Had anything happened that might have triggered this thought? Note your responses in the moment. What did you do, think, or say in response to this thought? Take a little time to reflect on these. Ask yourself how strongly you believe these thoughts about yourself, and how you feel when you experience them."

      "content": "Note when you are negative toward yourself. Negative thoughts can be about others, but frequently, they're about us. Negative beliefs about ourselves can manifest in negative self-evaluations. These self-evaluations can look like \"should\" statements, such as \"I should be better at this.\" They can also look like negative labeling, such as \"I'm a loser\" or \"I'm pathetic.\" Negative generalizations are also common, such as \"I'm always ruining everything.\" These thoughts suggest that you have internalized negative beliefs about yourself and accept them as fact. [3] X Research source Take note in your journal when you experience thoughts like this. When you write them down, try to give yourself a little space between yourself and the thought. Write down \"I had the thought that I was a loser,\" rather than just repeat \"I'm a loser.\" This will help you come to realize that these thoughts aren't facts."

As you record your thoughts, pay attention to the behaviors that you use to respond to them. Some common unhelpful behaviors include: Withdrawing from loved ones, friends, and social situations Overcompensating (e.g., going to extremes to make everyone else happy because you want them to accept you) Neglecting things (e.g., not studying for a test because you believe you are \"stupid\" and will fail anyway) Being passive rather than assertive (e.g., not voicing your true thoughts and feelings in a clear way)"

      "title": "Examine your journal.",
      "content": "Examine your journal. Look for patterns in your negative thoughts that reveal core beliefs. For example, if you frequently see thoughts such as \"I should do better at tests\" or \"Everyone thinks I'm a loser,\" you may have internalized a negative core belief about your ability to perform, such as \"I'm stupid.\" You are allowing yourself to think in rigid, unreasonable ways about yourself. These negative core beliefs can cause a lot of damage. Because they run so deeply, it's important to understand them, rather than just focus on changing the negative thoughts themselves. Just focusing on changing negative thoughts is a bit like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound: it will not address what's at the root of the problem. For example, if you have a core negative belief that you are \"worthless,\" you will likely experience a lot of negative thoughts related to that belief, such as \"I am pathetic,\" \"I don't deserve anyone to love me,\" or \"I should be a better person.\" You will also probably see negative behaviors related to this belief, such as bending over backwards to please a friend because deep down, you believe you're not worthy of having friendship. You need to challenge the belief to change the thoughts and behaviors."

Once you've been keeping track of your thoughts in your journal for a bit, take some time to ask yourself what unhelpful rules, assumptions, and patterns you can identify in your thinking. Ask yourself questions such as: What are my standards for myself? What do I find acceptable and unacceptable? Are my standards for myself different than my standards for others? How? What do I expect of myself in various situations? For example, how do I expect myself to be when I'm at school, work, socializing, having fun, etc? When do I feel the most anxious or self-doubting? In what situations am I hardest on myself? When do I expect negativity? What did my family tell me about standards and what I should and shouldn't do?

The first step to getting rid of negative thoughts is making a commitment to doing so.

They are the product of negative core beliefs that you've adopted over the course of your life. Reminding yourself that your thoughts are not facts, and that your thoughts don't define you, will help you distance yourself from unhelpful negative thinking. For example, instead of saying “I'm stupid,” say, “I'm having a thought that is stupid.” Instead of saying, “I'm going to flunk the exam” say “I'm thinking I'm going to fail this test.” The difference is subtle but important in re-training your consciousness and eradicating negative thinking."

      "content": "Find the triggers of your negative thoughts. Knowing exactly why we have negative thoughts is hard to pinpoint, but there are several hypotheses about why this happens. According to some researchers, negative thoughts are a byproduct of evolution in which we are constantly scanning our environment for clues about danger or looking for places of improvement or things to fix. Sometimes negative thoughts are brought on by anxiety or worry, in which you are thinking about all that could go wrong or could be dangerous, humiliating, or anxiety-provoking. Additionally, negative thinking or pessimism can be learned from your parents or family when you were young. Negative thinking is also associated with depression and it is thought that negative thinking progresses depression and depression spurs on negative thinking in a cyclical fashion. [5] X Research source Lastly, negative thinking can stem from past traumas or experiences that cause you to feel shame and doubt. Think about any troubling conditions or situations that might be related to why you feel badly about yourself. For many people, typical triggers may include work meetings, school presentations, interpersonal problems at work or home, and significant life changes, such as leaving home, changing jobs, or separating from a partner. Keeping your journal will help you identify these triggers."

To begin changing your negative thoughts, you have to take notice of your thoughts as they happen. Catch yourself thinking negatively and stop to see which of the types of negative thinking it is. You can even write it down in a journal the moment you are first learning to alter your thought to gain some clarity on the process. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Once you’ve identified the type(s) of negative thinking at work, begin to test the reality of the thought. You can look for evidence to the contrary. For example, if you think, \"I always mess things up\", think about three instances where you did something successfully. Also be aware of the things that you do successfully as you practice CBT, as an evidence against the limiting thoughts. You can also experiment with the thought to see if it true. For example, if you think, \"I’m going to pass out if I try to give a speech in front of people\", experiment with this thought by staging a mock speech in front of others to prove to yourself that you will not pass out. You can also try a survey to test thoughts. Ask others about the thought you had to see if their interpretation is the same as yours. You can also try replacing certain words that make the statement negative. For example, if you say \"I should not have done that to my friend” you could say \"Things would have turned out better if I had not done that to my friend\" or \"I’m sad I did that to my friend, and I will try not to repeat it in the future.\" Overtime, these CBT-based exercises can help you adjust your thoughts to be more realistic, positive, and proactive, rather than negative and self-defeating."

      "content": "Attack all-or-nothing thinking. This type of thought occurs when you perceive that life and everything you do only has two paths. Things are either good or bad, positive or negative, etc. You do not allow room for flexibility or re-interpretation. [8] X Research source For example, if you don't get a promotion but are specifically encouraged to apply the next time there's an opening, you might still insist that you're a total failure and worthless because you didn't get the job. You see things as either all good or all bad and there is nothing in between. To challenge this type of thinking, ask yourself to think about situations along a scale from 0-10. Remember that things are extremely unlikely to be a 0 or a 10. [9] X Research source For example, you might tell yourself, “My work experience for this promotion was about a 6 of 10.

You may even blow negatives way out of proportion. [10] X Research source For example, if your boss noted that you made a typo on a report, you might focus on this and ignore all the good things she said about your work. Instead, focus on potentially negative situations, such as criticism, as opportunities for growth rather than attacks. You could tell yourself, “My boss really liked my work, and the fact that she told me about the typo shows that she respects my ability to correct mistakes. That’s a strength. I also know to proofread more carefully next time.” [11] X Research source You can also try to find one positive thing for each negative thing you notice. This will require you to broaden your focus. You may also notice yourself diminishing positives, such as saying “I just got lucky” or “That only happened because my boss/teacher likes me.” This is also inaccurate thinking.

Mindfulness is a technique that invites you to learn to observe your emotions without heightened emotions.The principle of mindfulness is that you need to acknowledge and experience the negative thoughts and emotions before you can let them go. Mindfulness is not easy because it means becoming aware of the negative self-talk that often accompanies shame, like self-condemnations, comparisons with others, etc. However, the task is to acknowledge and recognize shame without getting caught up in or giving power to those emotions that arise. Research has shown that mindfulness-based therapy and techniques can facilitate self-acceptance and help reduce negative thoughts and feelings. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try to find a quiet space to practice mindfulness. Sit in a relaxed position and focus on your breathing. Count the inhales and exhales. Inevitably, your mind will wander. When this happens, don't chastise yourself but take note of what you are feeling. Don't judge it; just be aware of it. Try to bring attention back to your breath, as this is the real work of mindfulness. By acknowledging but de-centering your thoughts and not letting them take over, you are learning how to cope with negative feelings without actually trying to change them. In other words, you are changing your relationship to your thoughts and feelings. Some people have found that in doing this, eventually the content of your thoughts and emotions changes (for the better) too."

      "content": "Watch out for “shoulds.” Shoulds, musts, and oughts are often signs of an unhelpful rule or assumption that you’ve internalized. For example, you might think, “I should not ask for help because that would show weakness,” or you might think “I ought to be more outgoing.” When you notice this language, take the time to ask yourself some questions about these thoughts: How does this thought impact my life? For example, if you think “I ought to be more outgoing or I won’t have any friends,” you might feel embarrassed when you don’t accept social invitations. You might push yourself to go out with friends, even when you feel tired or could use the time to yourself. This could cause problems for you. Where did this thought come from? Thoughts often come from rules that we hold for ourselves. Perhaps your family were very extroverted and encouraged you to be highly social, even if you’re an introvert. This might have led you to believe there was something “wrong” with being more quiet, which could lead to a negative core belief about yourself such as “I’m not good enough the way I am.” Is this thought reasonable? In many cases, our negative core beliefs are based in overly inflexible and rigid thinking that holds us to unreasonable standards. For example, if you’re an introvert, it may not be reasonable for you to be outgoing and social all the time. You may truly need time to yourself to recharge. You may not even be enjoyable company if you don’t get that time you need. What do I gain from this thought? Consider whether you benefit from this thought or belief. Is it helpful to you?"

For example, if you frequently believe you are “a failure” because you make mistakes, try to make a more moderate statement about yourself: “I am good at quite a few things, average at quite a few things, and not so good at a few things -- just like everyone else.” You aren’t saying you’re perfect, which would also be inaccurate. You’re acknowledging that, like every other human on the planet, you have strengths and areas for growth. If you frequently totalize yourself, such as “I’m a loser,” or “I’m pathetic,” rephrase this to acknowledge the “grey area”: “I make mistakes sometimes.” Note that this statement is not something you are, it’s something you do.

If you feel yourself in danger of ruminating, that broken-record loop where you get “stuck” in an unhelpful thought pattern, nurture self-compassion and kindness. Instead of berating yourself and engaging in negative self-talk (i.e., \"I'm stupid and worthless\"), treat yourself as you would a friend or other loved one.

When you’re tracking your negative thoughts, show yourself some kindness regarding them. For example, if you had the negative thought, “I am so stupid and I will fail this test tomorrow,” examine it with kindness. Remind yourself not to totalize yourself. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. Plan on what you can do to avoid similar mistakes in the future. You could write something like, “I am feeling stupid because I didn’t study enough for this test. Everyone makes mistakes. I wish I had studied more, but I can’t change that. Next time, I can study more than a day in advance, I can ask a tutor or my teacher for help, and I can use this experience to learn and grow from.” Reader Poll: We asked 984 wikiHow readers about which positive affirmation works best for them, and only 9% said, “My body is strong in every way.” [Take Poll] While this mantra can still make you feel more positive, try reciting other phrases like “I believe in myself” or “I am enough.”"
