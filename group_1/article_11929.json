If you decide to talk with your colleague, pick a time when you’re feeling completely calm and in control of your thoughts and feelings. [1] X Research source Don’t enter a conversation angry—while your feelings are justified, this will only lead to more conflict.

[3] X Expert Source Devin Jones Career Coach Expert Interview. 5 April 2020. However, not all conversations have to be an obvious confrontation. Ask the colleague if you can talk with them in private, where you can air out how you’re feeling. Explain how some of their behavior or comments make you feel, and see if you can reach a compromise in the workplace. [4] X Research source For instance, you can say, “I really appreciate your friendliness, but it feels like you’re talking down to me whenever we have a conversation.” Additionally, say something like, “You probably didn’t mean to sound hurtful, but the way you spoke to me back there was really disrespectful.” Really listen to what your colleague has to say, too—sometimes the two of you might be butting heads because you have different approaches to a project.

      "content": "Ask probing questions to your colleague about their arrogance. Many arrogant people don’t expect questions to their claims and statements, which is where you can grab the upper hand. In a respectful tone, ask honest questions about the story or statement that your colleague is saying. Chances are, you might be able to take some of the wind out of their sails. [6] X Research source For example, you can ask questions like, “Why do you believe that?” or “What sources do you have to back that up?” Other questions like “Where did you hear that?” or “Why do you feel so strongly?” might also help put them off-guard."

It’s great to defend and assert yourself, but if the person is perpetually arrogant and rude, it might not be worth the effort. Develop a few stock replies that you can toss around when they’re in your vicinity, which will diffuse any unpleasant conversation. [9] X Research source For example, you can say something like, “Thanks for the suggestion,” or “Thanks for your input” so they stop bothering you. “I’ll keep that in mind” is another good stock phrase to have on hand.

[Take Poll] Even though it can be so tough, sometimes the best solution is to just walk away when your coworker is being rude (after all, you shouldn't have to put up with their negativity!)."

      "content": "Examine your own attitude and behavior for blind spots. Talk to a trusted friend or loved one and tell them what’s going on at your workplace. Ask them for their honest opinion—since you’re close to a situation, it can be tricky to see things from a neutral perspective.

Remember, everyone on your team operates differently, and you have to be able to work with a lot of different personalities.
