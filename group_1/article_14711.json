      "title": "Add ruby slippers.",
      "content": "Add ruby slippers. Many major retailers sell flats or heels covered in red glitter. Dorothy's ruby slippers had bows on top, so if you want to be authentic, try to find a red sequined bow to add to the top. [3] X Research source You can make your own red glitter shoes . Take a pair of shoes with a wide heel around 2 inches (5 cm) tall. Clean the shoes, and then in small sections begin to cover the shoes with fabric glue. Apply a liberal amount of red glitter to the section covered in glue. Wait for the glue to fully dry before applying glitter to other sections or filling in holes. Touching the glitter before the glue is dry can cause bald spots. Continue applying red glitter until the shoes are completely covered in glue. [4] X Research source Sequins can also be used when making homemade ruby slippers. Take a pair of shoes with a wide heel around 2 inches (5 cm) tall. Purchase a spool of red sequin string. Using fabric glue, glue the sequin strings in vertical lines along the side of the shoes, making sure none of the shoe's original surface is peeking through. Cut the sequin string at the shoe's edge. Make sure to also cover the heel with sequins, and add a line of sequins along the mouth of the shoe. If you want to be more authentic to the book instead of the movie, wear silver slippers instead of Dorothy's iconic red ones. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Copy Dorothy's braids.",
      "content": "Copy Dorothy's braids. Part of the iconic Dorothy look is her two braids, but there is a little more to the look than just parting your hair and braiding. Part the hair in the middle from the forehead to the neck. Starting with the strands at the part on one side of the head, start twisting the hair back towards the part, adding more hair to the twist as you make your way down the hairline. Make sure to keep the twist tight. [6] X Research source When the twist is around the ear, hold it tightly in place with one hand while you begin a three-part braid with the other. Use a simple braid to braid the hair until around the shoulders, then secure the braid with elastic. Use a curling iron to curl the ends of the hair into ringlets. Separate the hair to form two or three ringlets. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap a light blue ribbon around your braids.",
      "content": "Wrap a light blue ribbon around your braids. The ribbon should be tied around the elastic, at the spot where the braid ends and the curls begin. The ribbon should be tied into small bows. If the ends of the bows are too long, snip them off. The ends should barely extend past the bows. Make sure the bow is a light blue, close to the shade of blue in the dress and socks."

      "title": "Purchase a wig.",
      "content": "Purchase a wig. If you don't have long or dark brown hair, purchase or hire a simple long brunette wig. You can get a wig already plaited, or you can add plaits. Brown hair isn't necessary if you have the costume, the slippers, and the braids. Completing your look with the dark brown hair depends on how closely you want to match the cinematic image of Dorothy."
