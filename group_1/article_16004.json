Here’s how to do it: Start from your feet or ankles, and move the brush upward across your skin in long, fluid strokes. Next, move on to your torso and back. Move the brush in large circular motions across each area. The skin around your abdomen and neck can be a bit more sensitive, so be gentle. Don’t go over any of the areas repeatedly—this can cause irritation. A few overlapping motions over each section of your body is all you need.

If your skin gets irritated easily, you may want to opt for a product with chemical exfoliants (such as glycolic or salicylic acid) instead.
