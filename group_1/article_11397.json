      "content": "Slice the fruit down the middle from top to bottom. Grasp the fruit in one hand, and use a very sharp knife to cut the fruit in half. Be careful not to cut your fingers as you slice the fruit! [1] X Research source You may need to saw the knife back and forth a bit as you go through the fruit."

      "title": "Scoop out the seeds to eat.",
      "content": "Scoop out the seeds to eat. The edible part of the passion fruit is the seeds. Use a spoon to scoop them into a bowl, making sure to get as much of the juice as you can. [2] X Research source Passion fruit is somewhat like a pomegranate; you eat the pulpy seeds and throw away the skins."

      "title": "Drain the seeds in a sieve if you just want the flesh and juice.",
      "content": "Drain the seeds in a sieve if you just want the flesh and juice. Some recipes call for seedless passion fruit. In that case, put a sieve over a bowl, and put the seeds in the sieve. The juice and flesh will drain out the bottom. [3] X Research source Use a spoon or spatula to press on the seeds, which will help release the juices. You can keep cut passion fruit in the fridge for up to a week. You can also store just the pulp in the freezer for half a year. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wash the fruit thoroughly first.",
      "content": "Wash the fruit thoroughly first. Hold the fruit under cool, running water, and use your fingers to gently scrub off any pesticides and dirt. That way, you won't drag the dirt into the fruit when you cut into it."

      "title": "Turn the fruit on one side over a cutting board.",
      "content": "Turn the fruit on one side over a cutting board. It doesn't matter what side you use. You just need to hold it there while you chop off the top of the fruit. Grab the fruit at the bottom to cut it. Make sure to keep your fingers well out of the way of the knife."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice the top of the fruit off.",
      "content": "Slice the top of the fruit off. Using a sharp knife, cut across the top of the fruit. Go deep enough to hit the seeds, but don't go much deeper than the skin, as you want to save the seeds and pulp for eating. [5] X Research source This process is kind of like slicing off the top of a pineapple."

    {
      "title": "Eat the fruit with a spoon.",
      "content": "Eat the fruit with a spoon. You may have eaten a kiwi this way before, where you just scoop out the fruit and eat it. Do the same with your passion fruit, spooning out the seeds and pulp, as it's a great way to save as much juice as you can. [6] X Research source This process is also similar to how some people eat soft-boiled eggs. Store leftover cut passion fruit in the fridge up to a week. Use an airtight container. You can also freeze the pulp in ice cube trays, then move it to a zip top bag in the freezer for up to 6 months. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a fruit that's heavy for its size. When a fruit feels heavier than it should, that means it's extra juicy and delicious. Try to pick the heaviest fruit you can find when choosing your passion fruit. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for a plump fruit.",
      "content": "Look for a plump fruit. The fruit shouldn't look dry or dehydrated. It likely won't be very juicy or tasty if it is. Aim for a fruit that looks properly filled out, like a plum, for instance. [9] X Research source Don't worry about a few wrinkles. Some people say that wrinkles make for a riper fruit. While that's not necessarily true, wrinkles aren't a problem, either. Go ahead and cut into that wrinkled passion fruit you have sitting on the counter. It should still taste delicious! Of course, you should toss the fruit if it looks moldy or rotten."

      "content": "Place whole fruit in a bag in the refrigerator to make them last. Passion fruit are fairly hearty before they are cut. They will last up to a month in the refrigerator, and the plastic bag will help stop the dehydration process. [10] X Research source Keep them in the fruit drawer."
