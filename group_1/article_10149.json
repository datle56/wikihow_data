      "content": "See your doctor if you’ve never had kidney stone symptoms before. If you’re not sure whether your symptoms are from kidney stones, it’s important to get a medical exam and a proper diagnosis. Your doctor can rule out any other possible conditions or complications that could be causing your symptoms. They can also help you figure out the best course of treatment for your kidney stones. [2] X Research source Common symptoms of kidney stones include pain (in the side, back, abdomen, or groin), painful urination, pink or brown urine, nausea or vomiting, urgent or frequent urination, and fever or chills (if you have a secondary infection). [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might feel sudden, constant pain in one side of your back, which is called renal colic. Even if you’ve had kidney stones before, talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. If your doctor suspects kidney stones, they may strain your urine to check for kidney stones or to try to determine their composition."

      "content": "Use pain relievers as recommended by your doctor. If your kidney stones are relatively small, you may be able to manage the pain with over-the-counter pain medication. Common options include ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and naproxen (Aleve). [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Before taking any of these medications, tell your doctor about any other medications you are currently taking or additional health concerns you may have.

While moving around may be the last thing you want to do when you’re suffering from kidney stone pain, staying active can actually bring some relief.

[9] X Research source Step into a hot shower, or fill a tub with warm water and soak for 20 minutes or so. Make sure the water is not hot enough to scald you. You can also put a heating pad over the painful area. Make sure not to lie on top of the heating pad, and keep a layer of cloth (such as a blanket, towel, or heating pad cover) between your skin and the pad. You can use a heating pad 3 or 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time."

If your kidney stones are too large to pass on their own or are causing other complications, such as bleeding or infections, you may need other types of treatment. Talk to your doctor about what treatment option may work best for you. A few common treatments include: [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy). This treatment involves sending sound waves through your body that cause the stones to break up into smaller pieces. It's most often used for simple kidney stones. Surgical removal of the stones. This is usually done using small instruments that are inserted through a tiny incision in your back. Many doctors only recommend surgery if ESWL and other treatments do not work. It's also used for larger stones. Stone removal using a ureteroscope. This technique involves passing a tiny camera through your urethra and bladder into your ureter (the tube connecting your kidneys to your bladder). Once they find the stone, your doctor will insert a tool into your ureter to break up or pull out the stone."
