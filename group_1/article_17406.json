Violet hued shampoos will neutralize yellow brassiness. Blue (silver) toned shampoos will cancel out copper brassiness. This works because blue and purple are opposite orange and yellow on the color wheel, effectively counteracting the brassy tones. There is a wide variety of options, ranging from affordable drug store versions to pricey salon products. If you can't determine your brassy tones, or if they seem to be both yellow and copper, use a shampoo that has both purple and blue tones in it. Look for products that claim to be \"color correcting\" or \"tone correcting.\" You can also ask a clerk at the beauty supply store for recommendations. You can find a drug store brand called Shimmer Lights purple shampoo. If you'd prefer a salon brand, two popular options include Joico Color Balance Purple shampoo and Matrix Total Results So Silver shampoo."

      "content": "Alternate with shampoos and conditioners made for color-treated hair. You shouldn’t use blue/purple shampoos every day – stick to using them only a few times each week. In between blue/purple shampoos, use hair products made specifically for color care. There are shampoos, conditioners, masques and more that will help you preserve your color and fight brassiness without the use of blue/violet pigment. If you use purple shampoo every day, your hair will take on a lilac or light blue tint. Avoid hair care products that are alcohol-based. These will accelerate color fading and dry out your locks.

The foam boosts color and shine while breaking down brassy tones. [5] X Research source The whole process only takes about 5 minutes and it’s extremely effective. These products are gentle enough to use as often as you like, although you will probably only need to use them about once per week.

Follow it up with a good conditioner. For those with an ash or silver hair tone, you may want to use the mousse every day, post-shampoo. Foam glosses are mostly found at beauty supply stores, but there are a few drugstore versions on the market."

Results should last 3-6 shampoos. Avoid shampooing immediately after using a semi-permanent toner. You can condition safely immediately after, however, if you like."

      "content": "Enhance your color with lowlights. Lowlighting means to dye darker streaks into your hair and it can add a lot of dimension to your hair color. Lowlights can also neutralize brassy orange tones by introducing darker blonde shades into the mix, creating an overall cooling effect. It’s a procedure best performed by an experienced hair stylist, so lowlighting isn't the cheapest solution. However, the results can be very striking and it’s certainly something to consider if you’ve tried a lot of other things with no success. As with all “permanent” dyes, lowlights may start to fade after about 6-8 weeks."

Demi-permanent toners are less damaging to the hair shaft than the permanent variety, with results typically lasting about 6 weeks. Permanent toners will give you about 8 weeks of results. To use, separate your hair into 4 large sections. Work with one section at a time, leaving the other 3 clipped up out of the way. Apply the toner in small sections, starting at the top and working your way down to the ends until you have full coverage. Keep a close eye on the dye as it develops and rinse thoroughly."

      "content": "Minimize fading. Preserving your color can go a long way toward preventing brassiness. Even “permanent” dyes start to fade after about 8 weeks, and frequent dyeing can severely damage you hair. Along with all of the other toning strategies, actively try to prevent your color from fading in the first place. Only wash your hair when it’s necessary – try to avoid daily washing. When you do wash it, use blue/purple toning products. Limit your sun exposure and the use of heating tools, like blow dryers and straight irons. [11] X Research source Smoothing serums and other similar products can help you maintain color by sealing your hair cuticle when you apply them. Always condition your hair very well. This also seals the hair cuticle and protects your color."
