[1] X Research source Brush your hair after you wash it so you have tangle-free tresses to work with. You need to apply most dye creams to dry hair, so you’ll want to blow-dry your hair after you wash it, or if you have time, you can let your hair air-dry before applying the dye. You can apply some dye creams to damp hair. Read the instructions on your specific dye cream before proceeding."

      "content": "Divide your hair into four sections. Part your hair down the middle and then part your hair across from ear to ear. This will give you a total of four sections of hair. [2] X Research source Use hair clips or ties to keep the sections apart. When applying the dye cream, you’ll work with one section at a time to ensure even color application. The smaller the sections, the more control you will have."

      "content": "Pull on your protective gloves and apply petroleum jelly around your hairline. It’s a good idea to wear gloves when dyeing your hair so you don’t stain your fingers. You should also apply some petroleum jelly to your hairline so the dye cream doesn’t stain it. This is a common tip that is often overlooked.

Towels and newspapers work great for protecting your work surface, too."

      "content": "Mix the dye cream according to the package instructions. Many dye creams will require you to do some mixing. Follow the instructions on your particular box, making sure you read them all the way through. [4] X Research source Every brand is different, so you’ll want to be sure you know the whole process before you begin.

Using your brush or gloved fingertips, work the dye through the strand of hair from root to tip. You want to make sure you like the color before you apply it to your entire head. [5] X Research source Most dye creams sit for around 30 minutes and can then be rinsed. After this, you should be able to tell if you like the color or not."

      "content": "Dye your first section of hair. Unclip the first section of hair and using your color brush, apply the dye from root to tip. Use your brush to work the dye through your hair. Make sure each strand is fully saturated and that there’s an even coating of dye cream throughout the entire section. [6] X Research source Use your brush or gloved fingertips to smooth out any globs. If your hair is thin, you should have no problem applying the dye evenly to the 4 sections. If you have thick hair, then you will likely need to divide each section into 2 or 4 more sections to apply the dye evenly."

If you feel like you need to wash more frequently, try a leave-in treatment like dry shampoo or leave-in conditioner instead of a normal wash."
