In this case, the first sum, 1, is placed next to an x to the second power (one less than three). The second sum, 0, is placed next to an x, but the result is zero, so you can remove this term. And the third coefficient, -4, becomes a constant, a number without a variable, since the original variable was x. You can write an R next to the 16, because that is the remainder.
