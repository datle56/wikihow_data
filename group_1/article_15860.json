      "content": "Sarcasm involves saying the opposite of what you mean, unlike jokes. Sarcasm usually conveys disdain, mockery, or irony—making it a lot sharper than jokes. Common jokes tend to be more straightforward and lighthearted. If someone falls and you say “You’re so graceful,” it comes off as sarcastic. If someone says “What do you call a pony with a cough? A little hoarse,” it’s a classic joke."

      "content": "Pay attention to others so you can make a sarcastic joke. In our social world, it is easy to overhear conversations. Half of the time, people feel the need to talk about useful information that they think will interest the people that they are around. False. Really, the people listening to the conversation couldn't care less. In this situation it is important to listen carefully because often, people set themselves up. In this case, it's time for action! Listen to your surroundings."

      "content": "Choose a target and make your sarcastic joke or comment. If you find that someone has just set themselves up for a so-called \"burn,\" it's your chance to step in. This is your target. However, if you haven't been listening to a conversation, choose a target that looks the weakest, like the runt of the group. This way, it is easy to make fun of them or blurt out an inappropriate comment. The truth of the matter is, always go for the one that looks like it would be easy to put down. Before you use a witty comment, think before you act. You don't want to look stupid because you already know that you are better than everyone else, so act like it. If you say something stupid, you will look like a fool, but if you say something that was well thought out, you will look like a champion."

      "content": "Act like you don’t care and maintain a poker face. Now here is your chance to really utilize your talent. When you say the comment, have a set tone to your voice, like you couldn't care less what the other person's response will be. Make sure your comment is bitter and ironic. This helps confuse the other person and make them feel uncomfortable. Once the comment has been said, make sure you keep a straight face. If you start to smile, you obviously do not possess the ability that the rest of sarcastic people do. The importance of the face confuses the person hearing the remark who once again becomes uncomfortable in the situation."

      "content": "Make sure the other person understands you were joking. If you just delivered the remark and you are caught in an awkward stare with the person, explain that it was a joke. Give them a genuine apology and make sure you did not offend them. It is necessary to explain the situation, especially if you can tell that the other person is getting upset."
