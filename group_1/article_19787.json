This will cushion the skin and prevent the pen or pencil from rubbing directly on your skin. If it is too warm to comfortably wear a thin glove , protect just the area with the callus by wearing a Band-Aid or moleskin over the callus when you write. You can create a donut-shaped pad by folding the moleskin in half and cutting a half circle out of it. Then apply the moleskin donut around the callus. This will reduce the pressure on the callus.
