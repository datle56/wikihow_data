[1] X Expert Source Bianca Cox Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 May 2019. If you don’t have sulfate-free products, just use whatever you normally do in the shower. [2] X Research source If you don’t have time to wash your hair, spray it down with a water bottle. Damp hair will produce better curls than dry hair."

If you do Bantu knots or flexi rods with super wet hair, chances are it won’t be completely dry by the morning. Use your best judgment—thick hair takes longer to dry than thin hair, so you may want to spend more or less time on this step. [4] X Research source To continue reducing the risk of frizz, consider using a soft cotton T-shirt to towel-dry your hair."

      "title": "Section your hair into squares, securing each section with a hair clip.",
      "content": "Section your hair into squares, securing each section with a hair clip. Using either your fingers or a comb, separate your hair into multiple sections . For tighter curls, create more sections; for looser curls, do fewer sections. [5] X Research source For example, create sections that are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide for really defined curls. Use 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) sections for wavier curls. It’s okay if the parts aren’t perfect—when you take the style out in the morning, the parts won’t be noticeable anymore."

      "title": "Apply a moisturizing conditioner and detangle one section at a time.",
      "content": "Apply a moisturizing conditioner and detangle one section at a time. Choose a light product that won’t weigh down your hair. Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to work through any knots. [6] X Research source Products made with Moroccan oil, coconut oil, shea butter, grapeseed oil, or argan oil will condition your hair and leave it with a healthy shine."

      "content": "Choose Bantu knots for a quick, no-equipment-needed curl. When Bantu knots are taken out, it’s called a Bantu knot-out. These curls are really defined and are easy to create. It’s a great style to know how to do, especially if you find yourself out and away from home for the night. [7] X Research source Bobby pins help keep the knots in place, but you can still put in Bantu knots even if you don’t have them."

      "content": "Grasp one section of hair at a time and twist it until it gets tight. Start twisting about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from your scalp. Keep twisting, moving your hand down to the end of the section until the strand starts to naturally coil around itself. [8] X Research source If you start twisting too close to your scalp, it’ll end up being too tight and painful."

      "content": "Coil each section around itself into a knot as you continue twisting. Follow the natural coil and wrap the section of hair around itself until the entire thing is in a knot. Don’t worry about making each section of hair look identical to the others—a little bit of variety will just enhance the look of your curls the next day. [9] X Research source For a variation on your curls, you could tie each section into a ponytail at your scalp, and separate the ponytail into 2 strands. Twist those 2 strands together and continue to twist them until the ponytail coils around itself and creates a knot."

      "content": "Secure each Bantu knot with a bobby pin or elastic. Once you’ve finished coiling a section, take a bobby pin and tuck it into the knot, securing the end of the hair in place. You could also wrap an elastic around the knot. This will help keep them from falling out overnight. [10] X Research source You may even be able to simply tuck the end of your hair up into the knot, though that increases the risk of it coming loose during the night."

      "content": "Fold the rod under itself once it has reached your scalp. Tuck one end of the flexi rod underneath the other to keep it in place. If your hair feels like it is pulling too much at your scalp, you probably twisted it a little too close. Simply untwist it once or twice and then secure the ends. [14] X Research source It’s okay if sections of your hair end up close to each other after you’ve twisted them."

If you don’t have a silk scarf, you can let your hair air dry—just keep in mind that your hair might be a little frizzy if you toss and turn a lot while you sleep. [15] X Research source Your hair must dry completely overnight. If it doesn’t the curls will just fall out when you remove the rods in the morning."

That way, if any curls did come loose during the night, they’ll still be held in place by the scarf. This can also be helpful if you use any kind of powder during your morning routine. You won’t accidentally get any in your hair!"

Twist them in the opposite direction from what you did when creating them. [16] X Research source Make sure to fully untwist each section so that you can separate the curls easily later on.
