      "content": "Take a break from repetitive tasks. In most cases, trigger finger is caused by repetitive gripping of the hand or flexing of the thumb or forefinger. Those who are farmers, typists, industrial workers, or musicians are particularly susceptible because they constantly repeat certain finger and thumb movements. Even smokers can get trigger thumb from repeatedly using their lighters. As such, stop (or limit) the repetitive action that's inflaming your finger if you can to see if the pain and contracture in your finger will resolve on its own. [2] X Research source Explain the situation to your boss and see if they will give you different tasks to perform at work. Giffin advises that to limit the amount you use that finger when doing things like typing, texting, carrying, cooking, and cleaning because trigger finger is often caused by overuse. Every time it triggers, it can get more irritated. [3] X Expert Source Joel Giffin, PT, DPT, CHT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020. Trigger finger is more common in women over the age of 50. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "content": "Apply ice to your finger. [5] X Expert Source Joel Giffin, PT, DPT, CHT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including trigger finger. [6] X Research source Cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the inflamed tendon (it usually looks like a little bump or nodule in the lower part of your finger or in the palm of your hand, and will be tender to touch) in order to reduce the swelling and pain. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Apply ice for 10–15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside. Compressing the ice against your finger or hand with a bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation, but don't tie it too tight because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your finger."

      "content": "Take over-the-counter NSAIDs. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with any pain or inflammation in your finger. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Dosage for adults is usually 200–400 mg, by mouth, every 4–6 hours. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys, and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 10 days at a time. You can develop gastritis or ulcers from NSAID overuse. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Signs and symptoms of trigger finger typically include: stiffness (particularly in the morning), a clicking feeling as you move your finger, a tender nodule at the base of the affected finger and difficulty straightening the finger. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source According to Giffin, ice and anti-inflammatories can be an important aspect of healing or soothing trigger finger without surgery.

      "title": "Try stretching the contracted tendon.",
      "content": "Try stretching the contracted tendon. Stretching the affected finger might reverse the condition, especially if you address the problem during its early stages. Place your affected hand palm-down on a table and slowly extend your wrist by putting more weight onto the table. Hold for 10 seconds and repeat 6–10 times daily. [13] X Research source Alternatively, grab onto your affected finger and slowly extend it while lightly putting pressure on and massaging the inflamed nodule (if you see one). Soaking your hand in a warm Epsom salt bath for 10–15 minutes prior to stretching may help ease the tension and inflammation in the affected tendon. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Giffin offers an additional stretch: “Hold your [trigger] finger straight, then take your other hand and [hold] the first joint stable. Then, bend your finger down so you're bending just from the top two joints of your finger. That should allow your finger to move but not trigger.” [15] X Expert Source Joel Giffin, PT, DPT, CHT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020. Hand massage by a physical therapist may be best."

      "content": "Get fitted for a finger splint. Your doctor may have you wear a finger splint at night to keep the affected finger in an extended position while you sleep, which helps rest and stretch out the tendon. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Splint use may be needed for up to 6 weeks. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Splinting also helps prevent you from curling your fingers into a fist while you sleep, which can exacerbate trigger finger. During the day, take the splint off periodically to perform finger stretches or light massages. Alternatively, you can make your own by buying an aluminum finger splint from a pharmacy and attaching it with water resistant medical tape."

      "title": "Get a corticosteroid injection.",
      "content": "Get a corticosteroid injection. An injection of steroid medication near or into the tendon's sheath can quickly reduce inflammation and allow normal, unrestricted movement of your finger again. A corticosteroid injection is considered to be the first-line treatment of choice for trigger finger. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Two injections may be given if symptoms return after a period of time. [19] X Research source The treatment is effective in up to 50% to 70% of patients with trigger finger, but may be less effective for those with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. [20] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone. Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy, and nerve irritation or damage. If multiple corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution, then surgery should be considered."

      "title": "Get the finger operated on.",
      "content": "Get the finger operated on. The primary indications for getting a trigger finger surgically repaired are 1) it doesn't respond to any of your home remedies, splinting, and/or steroid injections, or 2) the finger is severely bent and irreducibly locked. There are two main types of surgery: open trigger finger release surgery and percutaneous trigger finger release surgery. [21] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Open surgery involves making a small incision near the base of your affected finger and cutting open the constricted section of tendon sheath. Percutaneous release involves inserting a needle into the tissue around the affected tendon and moving it around in order to break apart the constriction. Finger surgery is typically done as an outpatient procedure using local anesthesia. Possible complications from surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage, and chronic swelling and/or pain. The recurrence rate is only about three percent, but surgery may be less successful if you have diabetes."

      "title": "Treat an underlying infection or allergic reaction.",
      "content": "Treat an underlying infection or allergic reaction. Sometimes, a localized infection can either mimic trigger finger or actually cause tendon contraction. If the joints or muscles of your finger become red, warm, and significantly inflamed over the course of a few hours or days, then seek immediate medical care because these signs indicate a possible infection or allergic reaction to an insect bite. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm saltwater soaks, and sometimes oral antibiotics. [22] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Bacteria are the most common infections of the hand and usually the result of untreated cuts, puncture wounds, or ingrown fingernails. Allergic reactions to insect bites are relatively common, especially to those of bees, wasps, and spiders."

      "title": "Treat possible joint dislocation.",
      "content": "Treat possible joint dislocation. A dislocated finger joint can sometimes mimic trigger finger because it's also painful and causes the finger to look bent or crooked (called pseudotriggering). [23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Joint dislocations are typically caused by blunt trauma, as opposed to repetitive strain, so they require immediate medical assistance to reset or realign the finger joint. Following realignment, a dislocated finger is treated much the same as trigger finger in terms of rest, anti-inflammatories, ice, and splinting. [24] X Research source An X-ray of the hand can readily identify a dislocated or fractured finger. Other health professionals (aside from your family doctor) who can treat a dislocated finger include osteopaths and physiotherapists."

      "title": "Combat arthritis.",
      "content": "Combat arthritis. Sometimes, the cause of an inflamed, contracted finger tendon is due to a bout or flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis or gout. [25] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune condition that aggressively attacks the body's joints, and it requires the use of strong prescription anti-inflammatories and immune system suppressors to combat. [26] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Gout is an inflammatory condition caused by uric acid crystal deposits in joints (typically in the feet, but also in the hands), which can affect related tendons and lead to contracture (or even lead to trigger finger later). [27] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Rheumatoid arthritis commonly affects the hands and/or wrists and can grossly disfigure the joints with time. Your doctor may send you for a blood test to check for markers of rheumatoid arthritis. To reduce the risk of gout, cut down on purine-rich foods such as organ meats, seafood, and beer."
