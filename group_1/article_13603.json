      "content": "Use threading to remove facial and body hair . Threading is a temporary hair removal technique primarily used for excess hair removal on the eyebrows, lips, cheeks, chin, and legs. Although it may seem complicated, learning to remove unwanted hair at home is easy with a bit of patience and practice. Threading your eyebrows has several advantages over other methods, such as the following: [1] X Research source Threading eyebrow hair is faster and less painful and irritating than tweezing or waxing , not to mention it’s more effective at removing the tiny, almost invisible hairs you might miss with tweezers. Threading your eyebrows is faster and cheaper than at-home wax kits. If you learn how to thread yourself, you’ll save a lot of money, as an inexpensive thread will cost around $1. See a professional if you’re not confident in your ability to thread your eyebrows yourself. Improper threading technique could result in injury or total damage to your eyebrow shape and unwanted hair loss."

      "content": "Get a lash comb and grooming scissors. You will need a lash comb , and a pair of small grooming scissors to aid you in threading your eyebrows at home. Use the lash comb to brush the eyebrow hair in place and the scissors to trim any lengthy hairs. The best part is, these items are inexpensive and easily accessible, as you likely already have most of them at home. [2] X Research source Dusting your brows with baby powder or loose setting powder before threading can be beneficial, as it makes hair easier to pull out."

      "title": "Use cotton thread.",
      "content": "Use cotton thread. Thread is the most important tool you will be using to shape your eyebrows properly. The key is to only use 100% cotton thread, as it’s less likely to snap, making the threading process much easier. [3] X Research source Use a piece of thread around 11 inches (28 cm), or the length of your forearm plus 3 extra inches (2.6 cm). The less string you use, the more control you will have.

      "title": "Choose your brow shape carefully.",
      "content": "Choose your brow shape carefully. Using an eyebrow pencil to outline and fill in your eyebrows exactly how you want them will help you to ‘stay in the lines’ when you’re threading and prevent you from removing too much hair. Map your desired brow shape by marking the following 3 measurements to use as a guide for where not to thread: Find the inside limit of the brow by measuring a straight line from the corner of the nose to the inside corner of your eye. Determine the outside limit of the brow by measuring the edge of the nose to the outside edge of the eye. Find the highest arch of the brow by measuring the outside edge of the nose through the pupil."

      "content": "Sweep your eyebrow hair upward using a lash comb. Work on your eyebrows one section at a time by combing the front of the brow, then the arch, and finally, the tail with your lash comb . [5] X Research source Use your grooming scissors to carefully trim the hairs that extend over the line you’ve mapped. Then, sweep your eyebrows downward, and snip any particularly long hairs that stand out. Don’t overdo it. When in doubt, cut less hair than you think is necessary. Finish by combing your eyebrow hair back into place."

      "content": "Tie the thread into a big loop. Tie a large, loose loop with your 11-inch (28 cm) thread to prepare for the threading process. Fold the thread in half, then tie the ends of the thread together. The 100% cotton thread is what you’ll be using to pull out and shape your eyebrow hairs. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist the thread loop in the middle.",
      "content": "Twist the thread loop in the middle. Start by stretching the loop between your hands. Stretch the thread between your thumb and index fingers and do the following: Put one hand inside each end of the looped thread, with your palms up, before rotating your hands several times. It might be enough to rotate them twice, although some experts suggest as much as 15 times. Twist one hand clockwise and one counterclockwise to twist the thread 6 or 7 times until you have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of intertwined thread between your hands. When you open up your palm and fingers with the thread around them, you will create a circle of thread at each end with twisted thread in the middle."

    {
      "title": "Test the thread.",
      "content": "Test the thread. Hold the string with your thumbs and index fingers inside the loops on each side, then pull your right thumb and index finger apart. This threading motion traps hairs in the twisted thread and pulls them out. [7] X Research source Open and close your hands to move the thread. Place your hand inside the thread loop when you open it so that part of the thread is on top and the other part of the thread is on the bottom of your hand. Close the space between your right thumb and index finger and open the space between your left thumb and index finger. The twists of the thread will move toward your left hand."

      "title": "Position the thread under the hair you want to remove.",
      "content": "Position the thread under the hair you want to remove. After practicing your threading technique, you’re ready to shape and remove your brow hairs. Open up the loop and hand in the opposite direction that you want to thread (left hand to thread to the right; right hand to thread to the left). Place the twisted section of the thread under the hair that needs removing. Make sure to thread the eyebrows in the opposite direction from which your hair grows. [8] X Research source When you open and close the loops, the twisted portion of the thread will tug out the hair. Applying a light dusting of baby powder across your eyebrows might make it easier for the thread to pull out your hair."

      "title": "Grab the unwanted hairs with your thread.",
      "content": "Grab the unwanted hairs with your thread. As you twist the center of the loop, the twisted threads will pluck out the hair. Some experienced practitioners will hold the thread in their mouth while manipulating the other ends of it with both hands. Others hold each end of the thread in a different hand. [9] X Research source Starting at the highest hairs you want to remove, align the twists of thread to that hair. Open your right fingers smoothly, moving the thread down, and then open your left fingers to move the thread back. Continue these motions, working from top to bottom, aligning the coil of thread carefully before rolling it up and down the removal area until all the unwanted hair is gone. This same threading technique can remove unwanted facial and body hair, such as above the lip or on the legs. Areas other than your eyebrows don’t need mapping—simply roll the thread from top to bottom over the entire area to remove the unwanted hair. Thread at whatever pace works best for you. Experienced practitioners can do this process very quickly, but when you’re first starting out, it’s best to take your time and go slow. The results of threading can last about 2-3 weeks.
