Make your first single crochet into the second chain stitch away from your hook after you complete the foundational chain. Single crochet 20 times down one side of the chain. Single crochet another 20 times down the other side of the chain."

Work another series of single crochets into the all of the stitches of the previous round, including the increases, until you travel around the entire perimeter of the piece. For this round, you need to increase three times at both ends. To increase three times, make three chain stitches."

Increase at both ends for each round. Continue adding an extra increase for each round. Round four gets four increases. Round five gets five increases. Round six gets six increases. Round seven gets seven increases. Round eight gets eight increases. Note that if the rug begins to seem too loose or floppy, you can reduce the number of increases you use at the ends of each round."

Round nine gets nine increases. Round 10 gets 10 increases. Round 11 gets 11 increases. Round 12 gets 12 increases. Round 13 gets 13 increases. Note that if the rug begins to seem too loose or floppy, you can reduce the number of increases you use at the ends of each round. To change the color, cut the yarn you are currently working with, leaving a tail 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Slip this end through the back of the next stitch, turn the rug around halfway, and begin single stitching your next round with the new color. Tie the next color onto the crochet hook using a slipknot. When you reach the tail from your previous color after working your way around, weave it into the new color as you make your next stitches."
