      "content": "Try to scare the birds away with loud noises. If you hear flapping or thumping sounds coming from your chimney, bang some pots and pans together near the fireplace—it might work its way back out the top. Birds hate loud noises and will try to get as far away from them as possible. It's not the nicest thing, but it can sometimes do the trick. This likely won't work with larger adult birds because they can't open their wings enough to fly out.

      "content": "Shine a flashlight to coax the bird down the chimney. If the bird can't go up the chimney, it might be able to come down. Block off the room where your fireplace is and turn off all the inside lights. Then, open the doors and windows. Open the flue damper and shine your flashlight from the side of the chimney. The bird should see the light coming from below and head down and outside. [3] X Trustworthy Source The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Research lab of Cornell University dedicated to interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research and education about birds Go to source If the bird isn't injured, once it gets into the fireplace it will see the open doors and windows and make a break for it. If the bird is injured, toss a towel over it, then pick it up and place it in a box. Call a local vet or wildlife rescue to help the bird . Never dump an injured bird outside. The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council has a global directory of wildlife rehabilitators you can use to find a wildlife rescue near you."

      "content": "Call a wildlife rehabilitator if you can't get the bird out. It can be potentially dangerous to try to reach up in your chimney and dislodge a bird that's stuck—let the pros handle something like that. Call a local wildlife rescue and someone will come out to help you. While you could potentially call a pest control service or a chimney sweep, a wildlife rescue is your better option. Their job is to care for the bird and—perhaps more importantly—they won't charge you for their services."

      "title": "Use sound or scent deterrents to convince birds to move.",
      "content": "Use sound or scent deterrents to convince birds to move. An ultrasonic bird repeller device will emit ultrasonic sounds that birds can hear but you can't—so you don't have to sacrifice your own peace and quiet. You might also try a bird repellent spray in and around your chimney. [4] X Research source Birds are opportunistic creatures. These deterrents might keep birds from nesting in your chimney by making it seem less convenient or attractive to them. Scent and sound deterrents don't work forever, but they can convince the bird to find a better place to lay its eggs so you have time to put more permanent preventive measures in place."

      "title": "Isolate an active nest so the birds don't get into your house.",
      "content": "Isolate an active nest so the birds don't get into your house. Close your flue so that no bird droppings or other debris falls down into your fireplace. You might also tape a garbage bag over the fireplace opening—it'll keep the birds out of your home and also serve as a good reminder not to use the fireplace for the time being."

      "title": "Call a chimney sweep to remove the nest in the fall.",
      "content": "Call a chimney sweep to remove the nest in the fall. Migratory birds typically abandon their nests in the early fall. The fledglings have all left and the nest is safe to remove. A professional chimney sweep will remove the nesting materials and bird droppings so that your fireplace is safe to use. In some areas, only wildlife control professionals can remove nests of protected bird species, even if they're already empty or abandoned. Your chimney sweep will let you know if this is the case where you live. Migratory birds don't reuse the same nests, and they don't necessarily return to the same spot to nest every year—but they will if it's convenient. Talk to your chimney sweep about permanent preventive measures that will keep them from coming back."

      "title": "Install a chimney cap to keep birds from going into your chimney.",
      "content": "Install a chimney cap to keep birds from going into your chimney. You can install a chimney cap yourself—just measure the chimney to make sure it fits properly. If you don't feel comfortable going up on your roof, a chimney sweep will do it for you. For extra protection, cover the opening of the chimney with a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) mesh screen to keep the birds out. Chimney caps also protect your chimney from the elements, so they're just generally a good thing to have—especially if you use your fireplace on a regular basis during cooler weather."

      "title": "Get your chimney and cap inspected every year.",
      "content": "Get your chimney and cap inspected every year. Birds can get through even the smallest crack in a chimney cap. Have yours inspected for damage every year in the spring. That way you can make repairs before the migratory birds return. Set a regular appointment with your favorite chimney sweep to come every year to clean and inspect your chimney and cap, and you won't have to worry about birds nesting there. Regardless of whether you have birds, clean your chimney at least once a year so you can continue to use your fireplace safely."

      "title": "Use bird spikes to keep birds off of your roof completely.",
      "content": "Use bird spikes to keep birds off of your roof completely. Bird spikes are stainless steel spikes that you can install on your roof and around your chimney. Because they prevent birds from roosting on your roof, the birds will also be unlikely to venture down your chimney. [5] X Research source Bird spikes keep all birds off of your roof, not just the ones that are likely to end up in your chimney. Chimney caps are a more selective option in that they just keep the birds out of your chimney but allow them to land on your roof."

      "content": "No, you should never try to smoke birds out. This is cruel to the birds and could kill them. Beyond that, you risk significant smoke and fire damage to your home. If the bird (or a nest) has blocked the chimney, the smoke will come right back out into your home.

      "content": "Unfortunately, you cannot use your fireplace while there is a bird or nest in the chimney. Keep in mind that birds nest in the spring and summer, when it's typically too warm to use your fireplace anyway. Just make sure you call a chimney sweep to clean out the nesting materials when the birds abandon the nest in the fall. [7] X Trustworthy Source The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Research lab of Cornell University dedicated to interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research and education about birds Go to source Lighting a fire in the fireplace with nesting materials in the chimney is a fire hazard. It could also cause significant smoke damage to your home if the nest is completely blocking the chimney."
