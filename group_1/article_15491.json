      "content": "Remove the stem and bottom. Lay the pineapple on its side. Hold it in place with one hand and grab the base of the leafy stem with your other hand. Gently twist and pull the leaves to remove the stem. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut off the top and bottom half-inch (1.3 cm) of the pineapple. To determine if a pineapple is ready for eating, hold the fruit steady, pinch a center leaf from the stem with two fingers, and gently pull the leaf. If it comes out easily, the pineapple is ripe.

      "title": "Remove the skin.",
      "content": "Remove the skin. Stand the pineapple on its bottom base. Use a sharp knife to slice off thin lengthwise strips of skin from the pineapple. The slices should be about a quarter-inch (0.6 cm) deep to remove as much of the skin and divots as possible. Go around the entire fruit until all the skin has been peeled off. [2] X Research source Once the skin is gone, go around the fruit and carefully cut out any brown divots that are still left in the fruit."

      "title": "Cut the fruit into slices.",
      "content": "Cut the fruit into slices. Lay the peeled pineapple on its side. Hold the fruit steady with one hand and use the other to cut. Cut the pineapple into slices or discs that are between a half-inch and an inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. [3] X Research source You may need to cut the slices thinner or thicker than this for different applications, so read and follow any recipes that you may be using before slicing the fruit."

    {
      "title": "Remove the cores from the slices.",
      "content": "Remove the cores from the slices. Lay each pineapple slice flat on a cutting board. Use a 1-inch (2.5-cm) round cookie cutter to punch the center core from each slice. [4] X Research source The core is the darker yellow flesh that runs through the middle of the fruit. You can also use a knife to cut the core from each slice if you don’t have a cookie cutter."

    {
      "title": "Eat slices with your hands.",
      "content": "Eat slices with your hands. It is perfectly acceptable to eat pineapples slices with your hands. Pick up a slice either with your hands or a serving utensil, bring the slice to your mouth, and bite off a small piece of fruit from the slice. Chew and swallow your bite before taking another one. Sometimes, people serve pineapple wedges with the skin still on. In this case, eat the wedge from the tip toward the skin, but don’t eat the skin."

      "content": "Eat small chunks of fruit with a knife and fork as an alternative. You don’t have to eat pineapple with your hands, especially if you don’t want to get your hands covered in juice. Place the pineapple on a plate and use a knife and fork to cut it into bite-sized pieces. Use the fork to pick up single bites of pineapple and bring them to your mouth. Eat one bite at a time, and don’t pick up more pineapple until you’ve chewed and swallowed the piece in your mouth."

      "title": "Don’t be alarmed by the tingling sensation.",
      "content": "Don’t be alarmed by the tingling sensation. Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain, and this may cause a mild tingling in your mouth. This is perfectly normal, and it doesn’t mean that you're allergic to the pineapple. Bromelain is concentrated around the center and core of the fruit, so removing the core will reduce the tingling you feel. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Grill the pineapple.",
      "content": "Grill the pineapple. Barbecued or grilled pineapple can be enjoyed on its own, served with meats or burgers, or even added to warm salads. You can either marinate the pineapple beforehand or cook it plain. You can also cook it in foil or directly on the grill, depending on your preferences. Cooking pineapple breaks down the bromelain that makes your mouth tingle, so if you don’t like the sensation you get from eating raw pineapple, try eating it grilled. [6] X Research source"
