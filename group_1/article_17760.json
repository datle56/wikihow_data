      "content": "Make sure that your recipient is still able to use iMessage. If they switch to using a non-Apple device, iMessage will stop working correctly for their account and it will appear that they won't ever be delivered. Contact them from another device or call the iMessage user to ensure that they couldn't simply just \"be away\" and not have been able to have it delivered to the device."

      "content": "Press the Home button (the circular button) twice at the bottom of your device. Swipe up on all the extra apps including the Messages app to clear away apps that may cause iMessage to fail, lag, and freeze. Too many open windows can cause your Apple device to lag and freeze, and swiping up on all the apps closes and restarts the applications."

    {
      "title": "Restart the device.",
      "content": "Restart the device. Sometimes a fresh restart can be all that is required to get it back to peak performance. You can also press your off and home button at the same time until it shows you an option to shut off your phone. Swipe that and wait for several minutes (five to ten minutes should be more than adequate). Turn your phone back on."

If your device is still within the warranty period of 6 months to 1 year (depending on when you bought the device and if you bought an extended warranty plan for the device), you can bring it back in and have them help you troubleshoot the issue for a price. (However, nothing lasts forever.)"
