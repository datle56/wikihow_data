      "content": "Sprinkle powdered sugar over the top for a simple decoration. Arrange your brownies on a plate and then use a sifter to pour the sugar over the top. It's important to run the sugar through a sifter to get an even and fluffy spread over all of your brownies. Try not to move your brownies around too much after you add the sugar, and avoid stacking them so that the sugar doesn't smear. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a sifter, you can use a fork or a whisk to mix the powdered sugar in a bowl and then gently sprinkle it over your brownies with a spoon or your fingers. For a more advanced decoration, cut parchment paper into a decorative design and place it over the brownie. Add the powdered sugar, then gently remove the parchment paper."

      "content": "Coat the top with chocolate or coconut shavings for a sophisticated touch. You can buy coconut shavings or flakes from most grocery stores and sprinkle them over the top of your brownies with your fingers.

[2] X Research source Add the shavings immediately before serving, as they are incredibly delicate decorations."

      "content": "Cut up your favorite cookie or candy bar to spread over the top. Use a batch of chocolate chip cookies or oreo pieces to sprinkle over the top of the brownies to create a textured layer. This will give your brownies an extra crunch, while adding a decorative layer to the top. [3] X Research source Sprinkled chocolate chips or chopped candy look great as a brownie topping. Use a candy like M&M's to give your brownies a pop of color. Alternatively, add licorice or candy corn for a fun decorative look. If you’re trying to make a particular design, use candy that matches the shape you’re going for, like licorice strings for the legs of a spider."

      "content": "Add a layer of fresh fruit to the top for a refreshing taste. Use raspberries or strawberries to decorate the top of your brownies. It may be helpful to coat the top with frosting before adding fruit, to ensure that the fruit stays attached to your brownies. [4] X Research source Try sticking to fruit that works well with chocolate, like fresh berries or apricots. This is a great way to dress up your brownie for a dessert course. You can try cutting strawberries into thin slices and arranging them in a pattern on top of your brownies for a more sophisticated look."

      "content": "Drizzle chocolate or caramel sauce on with a fork to add complimentary flavors. Soften chocolate sauce or caramel in the microwave for about 15 seconds, and then use a fork to spread the sauce over the top of the brownies. You can move the fork back and forth to create a zigzag pattern, or spread the sauce more randomly over the top of your brownies [5] X Research source Wait to cut your brownies until after you’ve drizzled the sauce over the top to avoid a messy experience! Make your cleanup easy by laying down a sheet of parchment paper below the brownies before you add the sauce. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Place a scoop of ice cream on top to create a decadent sundae look.",
      "content": "Place a scoop of ice cream on top to create a decadent sundae look. Take your favorite ice cream out of the freezer to soften for 5-10 minutes. Right before you serve your brownies, add a scoop on top or to the side of your brownies. This will not only add a new texture and taste to your dessert, but will add a decorative touch to your brownies as well. [7] X Research source Try not to overpower the flavor of your brownies by choosing a bland ice cream to pair with your brownies, like strawberry or vanilla. If you'd like, you can also drizzle some chocolate sauce over the top of the ice cream for a classic sundae look."

      "content": "Spread frosting over your brownies for extra flavoring. After you’ve finished baking a pan of brownies and let them cool, use a butter knife to spread your preferred frosting on top of the brownies. Or, before adding the frosting, add a drop or two of food coloring for a colorful surprise! [8] X Research source Wait to cut the brownies until after you’ve added the frosting to the top. If you want extra control over the flavor and texture of your frosted brownies you can make your own frosting. If you want to make double chocolate brownies, consider using chocolate or fudge. [9] X Research source For a thick creamy topping, try using a cream cheese frosting instead. For some extra flare, try adding sprinkles on top of your frosting! [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a piping bag to decorate your brownies with intricate icing designs. Unlike frosting, icing tends to be thinner and glossier. To spread, simply fill a piping bag ⅔ of the way full with icing, then squeeze the bag until icing comes out of the opening. You can use the icing to write out letters or words, or you can freehand any design that you like. [11] X Research source Add a metal tip to the bag to create more controlled designs. To make your own piping bag, scoop icing into a ziplock bag and cut the corner off! There are many store-bought varieties of icing, like caramel icing, fudge icing, or fondant. [12] X Research source Pick out an icing that you like from a local grocery store, or make your own icing at home. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a layer of caramel to the top to add a sweet taste. Buy caramel sauce at a nearby grocery store or make your own to use to top the brownies. Stir the sauce until it appears smooth and then pour it on top of the brownies after they have cooled. Use a spoon or an offset spatula to smooth out the caramel layer, and then chill the brownies for 30 minutes in your freezer. [14] X Research source Leave the brownies in the freezer until the caramel is set and does not jiggle around when you move the pan of brownies. Feel free to add other ingredients to the top before you chill the brownies. Try sprinkling nuts over the caramel for a salty taste. The nuts will stick to the caramel on top, and will stay in place once the caramel chills."

      "content": "Coat your brownies with a raspberry swirl for an elegant touch. If you have plenty of time to prepare your brownies, you can add a layer of raspberry jam to the top of your brownies before you bake them. Use a knife to spread the jam over the top of your brownie batter, and make cuts in the brownie where you want to create a marbled effect. [15] X Research source Add fresh raspberries and powdered sugar to the top for a sweet and decadent dessert."

      "content": "Use themed decorations for a special occasion. If your brownies are for a special occasion, don't be afraid to show it! Try making red, white, and blue frosting for a Fourth of July party, or decorating your brownies with orange and black sprinkles for a Halloween themed event. [16] X Research source For a sports related theme, think about decorating your brownies with gear from the sport, like with a soccer ball or a hockey stick. You can also use pre-made decorations to help get the look you want. For example, use snowflake sprinkles on top of brownies you plan to sell at a winter bake sale. For Christmas decorations, add red and green icing to the brownies to make them look like a tree. You can even use part of a candy cane as the tree trunk. [17] X Research source"

Save the excess brownie pieces to make a brownie pudding or to bake into brownie truffles."

Keep the brownies in the refrigerator until an hour before you want to serve them, then take them out and cover them with plastic or keep them in an airtight container as they warm up to room temperature. [20] X Research source Try to avoid stacking your brownies to high, as they’ll quickly start to stick together. Store uneaten brownies in a container on your counter or in your refrigerator for up to about 2 or 3 days. To keep brownies for even longer, store them in your freezer for up 3 months."
