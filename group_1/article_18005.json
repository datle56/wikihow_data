Crease the fold with your fingers, working from the center outwards. Choose any color you'd like, so long as the two sides are different in color or texture. In the origami world, this is known as a \"valley fold,\" because it creates a little valley in the paper Almost every origami project begins with a valley fold or its opposite, the mountain fold, which creates a ridge.

The crease you are trying to get the bottom edge to meet with is located one fourth of the way down the paper from the top. [5] X Research source Crease the new fold with your fingers or a bone folder. If you've done the fold correctly, the area between the crease in the middle of the paper and the crease three-fourths of the way down the paper has been split in half with your new fold. You can unfold the crease you just made to make sure you did it right. However, make sure to fold it back into place before moving on to the next step."
