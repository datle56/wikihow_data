      "content": "Look into Lolita if you love Victorian- and Rococo-inspired fashion. These styles feature feminine, elaborate elements such as lace, pin-tucks, corsets, full skirts, headdresses, petticoats, and knee-length stockings. There are three main styles of Lolita (Gothic, Classic and Sweet), though are also many more subtypes that you can look into. Classic Lolita delves into more vintage Victorian and Rococo prints, with mature colors, pleats and pin tucks, and floral or damask prints. It's a good starting point for those new to the fashion, as it's more subtle than some other Lolita styles. Gothic Lolita incorporates a darker look and feel, with some visual-kei influence. It has a strong emphasis on elegance, with dark colors and lace. Common Gothic Lolita themes include crosses, graveyards, skulls and dark imagery. [1] X Research source Sweet Lolita is punctuated with bright, colorful patterns and themes. It has more of an emphasis on frill, lace, and pastels, with more cupcake-style petticoats (as opposed to the A-line petticoats more common in Classic and Gothic fashions). [2] X Research source"
