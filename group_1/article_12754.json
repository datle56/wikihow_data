      "title": "Make lots of gentle contact with the ball.",
      "content": "Make lots of gentle contact with the ball. Every time you contact the ball in soccer, it's called a “touch.” By using smaller, more gentle and fine-tuned touches, you contact the ball more often, which allows you to advance quickly and with more control over the ball. A lot of dribbling comes down to speed, and it’s better to make many rapid touches than just a few forceful touches. [1] X Research source The more your foot touches the ball, the more control you have over the ball's movement. On the other hand, if you’re only touching the ball every so often, you have much less control over the ball’s moment-to-moment position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the ball close to your feet.",
      "content": "Keep the ball close to your feet. When the ball is close to your feet, you maintain control, and can more easily maneuver the ball where you want it to go. [2] X Research source Keep your knees bent and the ball always within reach of your feet. Against an opponent, your body should be between the defender and the ball. You'll also be able to change direction faster. [3] X Research source When you keep the ball close to your feet, defenders have a more difficult time intercepting the ball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the leading edge of the foot to dribble over long distances.",
      "content": "Use the leading edge of the foot to dribble over long distances. If you need to cover a lot of ground, aim to dribble the ball with the laces of your shoes, or with the outside edge of your toes. [4] X Research source While running, “gallop” with the ball by kicking it with the same foot each step: step-kick-step-kick. This keeps the ball close to your foot at all times, even as you pick up speed. Keep the leading edge of your foot forward as you're running. This keeps contact between the ball and the leading edge of your foot, giving you the most speed and balance. This doesn't apply to making cuts, stops, direction changes, etc. This is just for moving the ball downfield with as much speed and control as possible."

      "title": "Make sharp turns by dribbling with the inside of your foot.",
      "content": "Make sharp turns by dribbling with the inside of your foot. Franquesa says to use the inside of your feet mostly to change directions quickly, like when you need to dribble past someone. When you’re mostly dribbling with the inside of your foot, you’re constantly pivoting your ankle outward, which slows you down and can lead to injury. Save the inside of your foot for when you need to quickly change the ball’s direction. Aim to dribble mostly with the outside edge of your foot, or with the laces of your shoes."

    {
      "title": "Keep your head up, with the ball in your peripheral vision.",
      "content": "Keep your head up, with the ball in your peripheral vision. Franquesa tells us that for soccer players, it’s “super important…to dribble at the same time that they are able to look, at the same time that they are able to see a teammate, to see the field, to see the next options.” If you’re only looking at the ball, you’re not seeing the player coming to steal it! [5] X Research source Think of it like riding a bike. Instead of looking down at your wheels, look at the field in front of you, and practice glancing around you as you dribble, keeping the ball in the corner of your eye."

    {
      "title": "Change your pace often to make your movements less predictable.",
      "content": "Change your pace often to make your movements less predictable. Just running in a straight line down the field at the same speed makes you an easy target. When you come to an opponent and you can’t outrun them, slow down to keep control of the ball and get ready to juke. Then, be ready to speed back up once you out-dribble them. [6] X Research source As you train, practice changing your dribbling pace."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your body to protect the ball.",
      "content": "Use your body to protect the ball. Shield the ball with your body when a defender gets close. [7] X Research source Put yourself between your opponent and the ball, either dribbling at an angle, or dribbling away from them. Use your arms, legs, and shoulders to keep the defender away from the ball. Also aim to keep the ball on the foot that is furthest from the defender. Remember that soccer isn’t a contact sport! It’s okay to use your body as a wall, but avoid pushing or shoving your opponent."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice dribbling in a field.",
      "content": "Practice dribbling in a field. As you’re starting out and improving , find a long open space where you can practice sprinting while using gentle, leading edge touches. Keep the ball within a few feet of you rather than several yards ahead. Get comfortable just handling the ball. As you progress, practice keeping the ball within a section of the field to practice dribbling with different amounts of open space. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Dribble the ball around your house to get more comfortable.",
      "content": "Dribble the ball around your house to get more comfortable. The name of the game is getting to a point where dribbling feels totally natural—that’s how you get better at soccer . Merino recommends practicing at home. Keep the ball near your feet as you move around inside, through tight spaces, until it feels second-nature, and you can handle the ball without even thinking. Of course, keep in mind this can be dangerous! Don’t do this around stairs, or where other people are moving around. Keep the ball in control, and put it away if you need to do something that demands your attention."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick the ball against the wall.",
      "content": "Kick the ball against the wall. Merino says this is an excellent drill to practice if you don’t have someone else to help you. Kick the ball against the wall and let it come back, then repeat. Aim to mix up how high you bounce it, your speed, and which foot you use. This gives you a super versatile and unpredictable way to practice passing, receiving, and controlling the ball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice speed dribbling.",
      "content": "Practice speed dribbling. Speed dribbling refers to moving the ball downfield with speed and control. For a proper speed dribbling technique, your foot should be slightly turned in at the ankle with the front of the foot down. This way, the front-outside of the shoe contacts the ball just above the middle toe. Time how long it takes you to dribble the ball from one end of the field to the other, and aim to shave seconds off that time. Aim to touch the ball with your foot every 3-4 steps to stay in control."

      "title": "Dribble in and out through cones with one foot.",
      "content": "Dribble in and out through cones with one foot. Set up 5 cones, each roughly 3 ft (0.91 m) apart, and dribble with only 1 foot to weave the ball through the cones. Alternate between the leading edge of your foot and the inside part of your instep to pass the ball back and forth between the cones. [9] X Research source Once you reach the end of the cones, simply turn around and start back through them in the opposite direction. Do this drill in several bursts such as down and back 3 times before taking a break. If you knock the cones over, you're going too fast or don't have enough control of the ball. Slow down until you don't knock the cones over. Since being able to use both feet is extremely important in soccer, make sure to alternate which foot you’re using to strengthen both of them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Alternate your feet as you dribble through cones.",
      "content": "Alternate your feet as you dribble through cones. Now, as you zigzag between the cones, stop and turn the ball with the inside of your outer foot, then use the outside of your inner foot to budget the ball between the cones, and repeat. [10] X Research source This drill engages both sides of both feet and helps with your coordination. If you don’t have cones, simply practice dribbling the ball from one foot to the other as you move forward. Or, find a line on the field and practice dribbling back and forth over the line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the ball between the cones.",
      "content": "Roll the ball between the cones. “Rolling” is a great dribbling move that lets you quickly pivot the ball instead of just knocking it in a new direction. Place your foot on top of the ball, like you’re going to step on it, then roll the ball between the cones. Roll at such an angle that the ball passes in front of the foot you use to roll when the foot comes off. Then catch the ball with the inside of your opposite foot, and roll it through the next cones. [11] X Research source Take another step with the original rolling foot between the foot stop and the next roll movement. This allows you to position yourself correctly."

      "title": "Practice a crossover drill through cones with both feet.",
      "content": "Practice a crossover drill through cones with both feet. Set up several cones in a zig-zag pattern about 3 ft (0.91 m) apart. Practice dribbling the ball along the zig-zag, around the outside of each cone. [12] X Research source As you do, focus on changing the ball’s direction with the outside edge of your inside foot. Then, practice dribbling with the inside edge of your outside foot. This side-to-side motion is great practice for changing direction of the ball on a moment's notice. Keep the ball in control and practice doing the drill with as much speed as possible. If you have to look down at the ball while moving through the cones, keep working at it so you know where the ball is without looking."

    {
      "title": "Dribble as you approach a goalie.",
      "content": "Dribble as you approach a goalie. Merino says practicing approaching a goalie helps with your ability to change direction, to manipulate the ball, to fake one way and go the other way.” Grab a friend and have them play goalie. Then, start from midfield, dribble up to the goal, and attempt to score . As you approach, focusing on faking the goalie out and being unpredictable. The less predictable you are, the easier it’ll be to score. This drill also has you practicing real game situations, instead of practicing just a rigid and monotonous movement."

      "title": "Play sharks and minnows while dribbling.",
      "content": "Play sharks and minnows while dribbling. Grab a few friends. Every player but 1 gets a ball, and lines up on one side of the field. The last player is the shark, and tries to steal a ball while everyone else dribbles to the opposite side of the field. This drill helps you practice real game scenarios where you must keep the ball away from an opponent. [13] X Research source If the shark steals the ball from a minnow, that minnow becomes the new shark."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pass the ball as you dribble down the field.",
      "content": "Pass the ball as you dribble down the field. The best dribblers aren’t the ones who are always dribbling—they know how and when to pass the ball , too. [14] X Research source Grab a friend and jog down the field together, keeping about 10 ft (3.0 m) apart. Take turns dribbling the ball for 5-10 steps, then pass it to your partner. This helps you with your game awareness as you dribble. As you practice, pay special attention to your “first touch,” when you first touch the ball. Controlling the ball even when you touch it for the very first time is important! Take care to pass mostly with the outside of your foot."
