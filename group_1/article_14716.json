If you truly want to embody the disco era, opt for a one-piece jumpsuit that reaches your ankles. This garment is great if you plan on dancing a lot—you can even jazz it up with high heels or platform shoes. [1] X Research source For example, wear a sleeveless coral jumpsuit along with a pair of chunky, high-heeled sandals. For a more masculine approach, opt for a two-toned jumpsuit instead, like purple and black or tan and brown. Unlike other fashion staples of the disco era, jumpsuits are still worn today!
