      "content": "Smear the eyeliner or add a dark shade. Smudge the eyeliner around your eye. If you would rather use a bit of color, apply a dark shade of red, purple, or, for those who would like, a dark brown."

      "title": "Add some eyeshadow of your choice.",
      "content": "Add some eyeshadow of your choice. Start under your eye to make it look like you haven't slept in 7 days. Use your finger to smudge the eyeshadow around, to blend it in. You don't want to overdo it, as you will look like a druggie! Next, apply to the top. This should only go up to the eyebrow, not any higher. Smudge and blend in as desired."

      "title": "(Optional) Add some color to your lips.",
      "content": "(Optional) Add some color to your lips. Go with pale pink, or, if you would like, a dark red. If you do not want to add any color, your white makeup should cover your lips. (Only the parts where you would apply lip balm or lipstick.)"

    {
      "title": "Use black or red paint to create a mask over your eyes.",
      "content": "Use black or red paint to create a mask over your eyes. Put tape (masking tape) on your face, so that you can see. Add a strip of tape to your forehead (put on as straight as possible ) and then one on your nose. This part takes 3 pieces of tape: apply 1 piece to the bridge of the nose, 1 on the left, and 1 on the right. Try to make them as straight as possible. These pieces will end up making a bar in the middle (where your eyes are). Then, apply red or black face paint in the middle. Once done, remove the tape, there should now be a bar of red or black over your eyes.(See video, a lesson by Gerard Way himself!)"
