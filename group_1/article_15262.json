      "content": "The canister may be full. If the canister that contains the dirt is starting to get full, this could be preventing airflow. You can see when the canister starts to get full. To empty the canister , hold it over a trashcan and pull the red lever on top or on the side of the canister. The base of the canister will open, dropping all the dirt into the trashcan. Test the vacuum to see if it is working."

      "title": "The filters may be dirty.",
      "content": "The filters may be dirty. Dyson recommends you clean the filters every three months. Handheld vacuums have a filter on top of the canister. The upright ball vacuum cleaners have two filters—one above the canister and one in the ball. Remove the filters and rinse them under the sink. Wring them out and then let them sit and dry for 24 hours. Do not put it back in the vacuum until it is dry. To remove the filter that sits above the canister on an upright ball vacuum, remove the canister. Pull the lever to open the filter compartment on top of the canister. Remove the filter. To remove the filter from the ball compartment, lean the vacuum all the way back to expose the ball. Press the button on the ball to open the ball compartment. Then press the red button inside the compartment to release the filter holder. Remove the filter from the holder. For handheld vacuums, the filter slides into a compartment on the top or back of the vacuum. You can usually just grab it and pull it out. Some models have a filter on the top and back of the vacuum.

      "content": "The filter may need replacing. If you are unable to clean the filter by rinsing it, or you notice the filter is starting to deteriorate, you may need to replace the filter. You can purchase a new filter online or from the store you purchased your Dyson vacuum from. It's a good idea to purchase an extra filter so that you have one on hand that you can use while you're waiting for another filter to dry after cleaning it."

      "title": "The head may be clogged.",
      "content": "The head may be clogged. The head is attached to the ball using a red clip or a tab you push. Grab the clip by both ends and pull it off or push the tab in. Then you should be able to easily detach the head. Check the ducts from the head to the vacuum for clogs. Also, check the duct on the vacuum that leads to the ball. Remove any dust and debris you may find. On some models, you remove the baseplate by flipping the tabs holding it in place. On other models, there a metal release that you can turn with a coin to release the brush. Remove the baseplate and/or the brush. Clean the brush and the inside of the head."

      "title": "The hoses may be clogged.",
      "content": "The hoses may be clogged. Most of the upright ball model vacuums have three hoses. There is the main hose that runs down the back, the changeover valve hose near the bottom, and the lower-duct hose that attaches to the ducts on the bottom. On most models, you can remove the hoses. Check the inside of the hoses for clogs and remove any clogs you find. Also, check the ducts that the hoses attach to for clogs. When you remove the canister, there should be an opening that leads to the main hose. It may have a cover that flips up to allow access to the duct. Check that opening for clogs as well.

      "content": "There may be a leak in the hoses or seals. You can stretch the hoses to spread the ripples apart and check for any holes, cracks, or leaks. If the hoses are damaged, you may need to purchase a replacement hose. Check the seals where the hoses, canister, and head attach to make sure they are secure and there are no leaks around the seals.

      "title": "The motor may be damaged or not working.",
      "content": "The motor may be damaged or not working. If you hear any loud grinding noises or smell a burning smell, there's a good chance something is wrong with the motor. If this is the case, your vacuum will most likely need to be repaired or replaced. If your vacuum is getting older, it may be reaching the end of its life cycle."
