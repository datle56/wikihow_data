      "content": "Remove the fake tan cream from your carpet using a spoon. Whatever you do, do not wipe or rub the fake tan product in any way, this will only drive it further into the carpet fibres and make the stain worse. Instead, pick up as much of the fake tan liquid or cream with a spoon or similar instrument. [1] X Research source This process will remove as much of the liquid or cream before you attempt to remove the actual stain. You do not want to rub that excess product into the carpet when trying to clean it. If the fake tan product has been on the carpet for some time, and is therefore dry, you can skip this step."

      "title": "Mix together warm water and gentle dish soap in a bowl or bucket.",
      "content": "Mix together warm water and gentle dish soap in a bowl or bucket. Pour 2 cups (470 mL) of water into a bucket or bowl and add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of gentle liquid dish or laundry soap. Stir the soap into the water until it is well mixed. [2] X Research source Use a bucket, bowl, or tub that’s easy to carry to the location of the stain."

      "title": "Dab at the stain with a clean cloth and soapy water.",
      "content": "Dab at the stain with a clean cloth and soapy water. Dip a clean cloth into the soap and water mixture, then dab the cloth on the stained carpet. Repeat this process until the stain disappears. Use different sections of the cloth, or get a fresh one, if the cloth becomes stained with the fake tan product. [3] X Research source When wiping or rubbing the stain, start at the outside and work your way to the middle. This will help prevent the stain from being spread further. If you need a little more scrubbing effort, try an old toothbrush to get between the carpet fibres."

      "title": "Rinse the soapy water out of the carpet with a clean towel and water.",
      "content": "Rinse the soapy water out of the carpet with a clean towel and water. Replace the soap and water mixture in your bucket (or bowl or tub) with fresh, clean water. Dab the clean water onto the previously stained area with a clean cloth or towel to remove all the soap. Repeat this step until all the soap is gone. [4] X Research source One easy way to remove excess water and soap is to get a clean, dry towel, put it on top of the cleaned area of the carpet, then stand on it. The pressure from your body will help soak up wetness deep inside the carpet."

      "title": "Vacuum the stained area of the carpet once it’s dry.",
      "content": "Vacuum the stained area of the carpet once it’s dry. Once all the soap has been removed from the carpet, allow it to air dry. Once the carpet is dry, run your vacuum over the previously stained area to remove any dirt or debris that may be leftover. [5] X Expert Source Haim Shemesh Carpet & Rug Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 May 2020. Inspect the area to determine if the stain is completely gone or if you need to repeat the cleaning process a second time. [6] X Research source Do not be surprised if you need to repeat the cleaning process multiple times to completely remove the stain, especially on light-coloured carpets."

      "title": "Try hydrogen peroxide for stubborn stains on light-coloured carpets.",
      "content": "Try hydrogen peroxide for stubborn stains on light-coloured carpets. If the soapy water mixture didn’t remove all of the stain, even after a couple of tries, you may want to try hydrogen peroxide. Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of hydrogen peroxide with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water in a bowl or bucket. Scrub and blot the hydrogen peroxide mixture onto the stain with a clean cloth or towel. [7] X Research source Always test a hidden area of your carpet with the hydrogen peroxide mixture to ensure it won’t damage your carpet. [8] X Expert Source Haim Shemesh Carpet & Rug Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 May 2020. Do not use hydrogen peroxide on dark-coloured carpets, only light-coloured carpets. Hydrogen peroxide may bleach the colours of a dark carpet. Read the bottle of hydrogen peroxide for safety instructions. Hydrogen peroxide can be purchased at your local drug store or pharmacy."

      "content": "Blot at stains on your carpet with baby wipes. Baby wipes, in general, use very gentle cleansing products as they’re designed for your baby’s skin. This means that most baby wipes are gentle enough to use on any type or colour of carpet and they are quick. Simply take out a baby wipe and dab at the stain until it’s gone. [9] X Research source Use a new baby wipe when the existing one is dirty so you don’t transfer the fake tan product back onto your carpet. Scrub gently at the stain, and try not to scrub outwards from the stained area, but inwards towards the centre of the stain."

      "title": "Spray Windex onto your carpet to breakdown and remove the stain.",
      "content": "Spray Windex onto your carpet to breakdown and remove the stain. For some reason, Windex has been found to work well on cleaning more than just windows. Spray the stained area liberally with Windex until the area is wet. Scrub the Windex covered stain with a clean cloth or towel, using some elbow grease. Use a second clean towel to mop up the rest of the Windex and stain. [10] X Research source If the stain doesn’t come out completely on the first try, repeat the process a second time. You can also try a window cleaner made by another manufacturer, but it might not have the same effect, as it may be made with different ingredients."

      "title": "Apply water and white shaving cream to your stained carpet to scrub the stain away.",
      "content": "Apply water and white shaving cream to your stained carpet to scrub the stain away. Fill a spray bottle with water or wet a towel/cloth to dampen the stained area. Spray white shaving cream onto the stained area, then rub at the stain with a wet towel or cloth. Rub the stain in a circular motion (being careful not to circle outwards and make the stain bigger). Spray the area again to rinse the carpet and remove any leftover shaving cream. [11] X Research source As with many stain removal methods, this method may not work completely the first time. You may need to repeat this process a second or third time to completely remove the fake tan stain."

As a last resort, if you can’t get the fake tan stain out of your carpet using items you’d find at home, it might be time to rent a steam cleaner. You can normally rent steam cleaners (and purchase the associated cleaning liquid) at a grocery store for a nominal amount. Follow the instructions that come with the steam cleaner for the exact procedure, as different steam cleaners will operate differently. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Several at-home steam cleaners or spot/stain cleaning machines are now available for purchase to keep at home. Even if you don’t own one, you may have a friend or relative who does, who might be able to lend it to you."
