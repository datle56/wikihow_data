Women in the UAE are considered dependents either of their husbands or their fathers, regardless of whether they work or live independently. Women cannot pass on their Emirati citizenship. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, you will never be able to get Emirati citizenship as a result of being married to her, no matter how long the marriage lasts."
