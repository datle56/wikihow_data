      "title": "Have a face-to-face conversation.",
      "content": "Have a face-to-face conversation. Sometimes people are simply unaware of the fact that a problem exists, so do not assume that your neighbour is thinking about the problem. If it is settled in your mind that something should be done, you should schedule a face-to-face meeting to communicate your concerns. There is a possibility that your neighbour will promptly resolve the problem after hearing what you have to say. [1] X Research source Before scheduling a face-to-face meeting, you need to assess whether or not the situation is safe. Not everyone is neighbourly and sometimes having a face-to-face conversation is not prudent. It could even be dangerous. It is particularly unwise to just show up on a person’s property uninvited. You may decide to handle the situation with anonymity to avoid physical harm or any type of retaliation. If you decide to move forward with a meeting, be prepared to say exactly what the problem is and provide a reasonable date by which you think the issue should be resolved. Here are a couple of examples: \"I have always appreciated you as a neighbor, but I am concerned about the current condition of your property,\" and \"I think 30 days is a reasonable amount of time to resolve the problem. What do you think?\" There is an old saying that “good fences make good neighbours.” If you would prefer to avoid interacting with your neighbour about this situation and future matters, consider putting up a fence that blocks your view of your neighbour’s property. Not having to look at your neighbours unsightly property could resolve the problem from your perspective and keep the peace altogether. If the neighbours are renters, contact the homeowner directly. You can find the homeowner’s information through the county assessor’s office."

      "title": "Discuss the financial impact.",
      "content": "Discuss the financial impact. If you are trying to sell your home then it is perfectly fine to communicate urgency, while also communicating that the problem may affect the value of your home. You may want to remind your neighbour that this matter also affects the value of their property, which can be a financial incentive for them to solve the problem. Consider telling them that you want prospective buyers to know that they are good neighbours and then offer assistance to expedite the resolution so that it does not affect the sale of your property (this could mean actually helping to clean up the litter)."

      "content": "Prevent a confrontation. When communicating with someone regarding a difficult subject, it is important to be polite to avoid escalating the situation. It is possible to address a sensitive topic without being confrontational or hostile. A gentle approach is generally best. Prepare yourself for a counterattack and reconcile in your mind that you will remain diplomatic and calm if your neighbour becomes angry. If the situation escalates, walk away and plan to discuss the matter at a later date. Being cordial prior to a problem arising will sometimes go a long way towards resolving conflict down the road. A kind “hello” over the years can make a big difference."

      "content": "Avoid inflammatory language. Do not use language that is accusatory or disrespectful. For instance, words such as “nasty” or “disgusting” are offensive and can quickly escalate the matter. Refrain from threatening your neighbour. Most people do not respond kindly to threats and it is best to remain respectful. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "List other neighbours. Keep track of other neighbours who may have expressed the same or similar concerns.

      "content": "Write letters. If you meet face-to-face, follow up by writing a non-aggressive letter to confirm and reiterate what you discussed. You can send subsequent letters as necessary. If you plan to follow-up on your conversation in writing, you may consider telling your neighbour to expect a confirmation letter in the mail so that they are not caught off guard upon receipt of the letter. Be sure that all letters are dated and copied for your records. You may consider sending the letters via certified mail to confirm receipt."

      "content": "Clarify your concerns. When dealing with a neighbour’s unsightly property, it is important to put things into perspective before having any conversations or making any decisions. Always keep in mind the importance of maintaining positive relationships with your neighbours, when it is within your control. While you can certainly address problems, you do not want to do anything that would unnecessarily create a hostile environment or further diminish the enjoyment of your property. Think about whether or not this is a recent problem that may be soon resolved or if this has been a long-standing issue. The situation may be the result of a health problem that your neighbour is experiencing and they may be unable to do anything about it at this time. This is particularly important when you have elderly neighbours with limited mobility."

What may be unsightly to you may be perfectly acceptable to others. Carefully consider whether or not your concerns are truly warranted and weigh the risks and benefits of addressing the issue. You may decide that your neighbour’s property is good enough for you to let the situation go without pursing it any further in order to keep the peace. [7] X Research source"

Sometimes talking through the situation with someone else will help you to decide whether or not you want to move forward with a course of action.

If you have already spoken to your neighbour and the problem is not resolved, consider contacting the homeowner’s association to share your concerns and provide the details that you have gathered. If you decide to handle the situation with anonymity, contact the homeowner's association before speaking with your neighbor and ask to remain anonymous."

While problematic, your situation is far from unique and many homeowners have experienced the same issue. Local or municipal authorities may assist you with finding a quicker resolution. Start by contacting city hall. You will need to read the local regulations to ascertain the procedures more clearly in your jurisdiction. In addition to the homeowner’s association and municipalities, you may also find assistance and direction through the fire department or police department, depending on the nature of the problem.

Before you start, realize that engaging with your neighbour regarding this issue may result in a long-standing feud that lasts for years. Be prepared to engage in the process and mend the relationship, if necessary. [10] X Research source Some homeowners have found this type of issue to be so disruptive, that they chose instead to sale their home (when they were not otherwise planning to do so) and move on with their lives. While this may be a last ditch solution, it may be something worthy of your consideration depending on the complexity of the situation and your ability and willingness to relocate."
