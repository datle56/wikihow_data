In order to die, spiritually speaking, first you need to detect that there’s a compulsive voice in your head and emotions that accompany it. If you’re reading this, you probably already have. Realize that this impersonal Voice speaks and acts through you, commentate, non-verbally and verbally reacts, resists, likes or dislikes [2] X Research source Singer, Michael A <i>The Surrender Experiment</i> New York City, NY: Harmony, 2015. Page 10 , labels the now, generates mostly pointless and negative thinking and so on. Recognition of this “voice” and the accompanied emotions is the beginning of egoic death."

      "content": "Experiment by not following or believing the voice or egoic mind. See it as an experiment and notice the peace within and quality of your actions and words, when you 'don’t follow' or negate the mind, as compared to when you do. However, 'don’t follow' or negate it in a non-reactive, accepting and non-judgmental way, so awareness is required. Or else, mind will likely “try” to ‘not follow’ the “voice” in a reactive and resistive way and make concepts about 'how not to follow it'. That is to say, one part of mind will try to 'not follow' the other part of the mind. Which means, the same voice will come through the back door. [3] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 6 In this context, mind also implies non-verbal reactions, background unease, mental-emotional resistance or blockages (more on this later), impulses, negative emotions , conditioned urges etc. The more you become aware of your compulsive and conditioned thoughts and emotions, and not follow or believe them, they begin to become less noisy, lose energy and slow down. It’s because your unconscious identification, following or resisting them, is what gives them energy. As this implied disidentification becomes a natural practice, you will realize how negating the egoic mind or entity and its concepts makes way for true intelligence which brings about a transmutation of the accumulation of past and egoic blockages (horizontal dimension) in you, into unshakeable aliveness, peace and joy. This is also mentioned in Tao Te Ching in a cryptic way, “Throw away holiness and wisdom (mental concepts, in this context) and people will be a hundred times happier. Throw away morality and justice and people will do the right thing”."

Negating or disidentifying with the ‘voice in head’ also includes negating the non-verbal mental-emotional resistance, energy, pain and blockages, which are its aspects. Look within now; can you feel a wall of resistance or dense accumulation of time (past and future) in brain, heart, face, forehead, chest, behind left cheek, jaw etc.? Can you feel or become aware of the unconscious automatic resistance or unease or patterns, “trying” or \"willing\" or \"suppressing\" it to dissolve the wall or blockages or get away from the pain or treating the Now as a means to an end? That’s egoic entity that wants to survive and not feel the pain. Deeply realize that it can’t dissolve it by fighting or resistance, and in fact fighting or resisting is what keep the pain and suffering alive. The root of this fighting is a spiritual one. Ego wants to dissolve the pain [4] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 62 in psyche. Unaware that it's the intrinsic cause of the pain. Notice that pain stops or lessens when trying and/or willing to dissolve the pain stops or lessens. Which could also be seen as a proof that the resistance or fighting is more disturbing than the original cause. Also, if you look deeply, fighting, resistance, willing are ultimately sensations, tension, subtle physical movements or pushing etc. They don't cause unhappiness but the egoic thoughts, however subtle or unconscious, that come in response to them do. If you voiced this egoic energy, it would say something like \"Why this not going away?\", \"Go away, I don't want to feel this pain\", \"This is relentless\", \"its still here\", \"Hold on to the pain\", \"These thoughts are stubborn\", \"There's no end to pain.\" etc. Yield to it. Accept that it’s there. Realize that it is not you but an impersonal condition that most humans have that cannot be dissolved by resisting or making it into an enemy or means to an end. Feel the inner space of head and body. The inner-space is the outlet for the blocked energy that wants to flow up freely [6] X Research source Singer, Michael A <i>The Surrender Experiment</i> New York City, NY: Harmony, 2015. Page 41 . The more you feel it and negate the mind, naturally the wall or egoic layer becomes weaker. In other words, chakras will open more, if you want to see it that way. Even feeling or state of sleepiness and fatigue, unless you are genuinely tired and sleepy, are not you but are effects of boredom, which is mind created. As boredom could induce sleepiness [6] X Research source and tiredness. Here’s an experiment: When you are feeling sleepy and/or tired, do or watch something interesting and see if you still feel the same."

Page 216 . So feel the pain (dread, fear, loneliness, anger, guilt, resentment or whatever it is) fully, wherever in body it arises. If the urge to turn away from them comes, watch it but don't act on it. In other words, suffer consciously. That's dying to the past or dying an easy death. Then you will see how pain is redeemed into peace of God that passes all understanding. You can also hold the entire egoic mental-emotional energy clamoring for control, into your loving knowing and see how it naturally lessens its stubbornness and transmutes it into itself. Emotions don't cause suffering. Emotions and unhappy or negative thoughts or stories do. It because ultimately emotions are sensation, pressure, tension etc. you feel somewhere in the body. When mind names or labels or commentates on the emotions and you believe it, is when you experience pain and suffering."

More you go deeper into the practice of negating the mind and becoming present, awareness or light of consciousness within deepens, and it eventually exposes the core location of the reactive, involuntary and compulsive activity of 'voice in head' and emotions i.e behind the left side of face, jaw, forehead and chest(including heart area) [8] X Research source . It seems one of the main reasons the egoic entity is able to make you, awareness , identify with it is because it, egoic thought activity and blockages, are so close to You, point of awareness . Also, notice the difference between the energy behind the left and right side of your face, chest and head. That’s the energy of Egoic mind. It’s like an entity living in the left side of your brain, behind left cheek, jaw and forehead, backed up by the accumulation of dense past and impersonal Egoic structures of your mind and pain-body. Ready to make concepts, react negatively, seek conflict, absorb consciousness or attention to generate pointless and often negative egoic thoughts and emotions, hypnotize you to do and say things with its unsolicited subtle or not so subtle activity, constantly trying to be in control, personalizing events and people, and pretending to be you. Again, don’t make it into an enemy or obstacle. Instead become friendly and/or accepting towards the unhappy and inflamed entities (Egoic mind and pain-body) . Make it a practice to smile and even laugh, when you see or detect the 'voice in the head' or 'unhappy self' or egoic energy in you. Compassionately listen to it, “Yes, Madam/Sir, I am listening”. If you are into visualization practices then imagine a funny but “never content” character, “little me” or something like that, living in the left side of your head and chest, displaying its tantrums, being needy and uneasy, chattering constantly, labeling, liking and disliking, complaining, narrating and negatively commenting about anything that arises in the Now. This may also help you smile when you see the same impersonal voice or character operating in other people. Which is why it is said that primary reality is within [10] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 43 . Yes the influx of presence or cosmic energy [11] X Research source Yogananda, Paramahansa. <i>Autobiography of a Yogi.</i> New York, NY: The Philosophical Library, 1946. Page 87 may make it easier to become friendly towards it and recognize its ultimate insignificance to an extent, but the degree of presence may not be the same all the time so moment to moment negation and disidentification from mind (spiritual work) are required. That’s the true measure of your spiritual success. That is if you can remain present during day to day activities, challenges and amidst pain."

      "content": "Observe within that Egoic entity wants to survive. Since the mind wants to ensure its survival, so it will relentlessly do all it can to make you follow it. It may use tactics like being pretty subtle, waiting for you to become unaware, generating thoughts(subconscious and unconscious) in milliseconds to change your behavior without you knowing it, self justify its behavior with made up or selective perception, triggering an emotional response and/or pain-body to absorb more attention and add weight to the reaction to make you identify with it [12] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 69 etc., so alertness is required. As a general guideline, sensations of thoughts and reactions arising from the left side of your face (especially behind jaw, cheek and temple areas), head and chest are ego generated. You can examine their nature and it’s likely going to fall within egoic mechanics . In case you become frustrated, angry, too serious etc. allow it to be or negate those mental-emotional states. Following, believing or resisting these egoic reactions and thoughts is only going to feed it. However, even following them can become part of your spiritual path because it will intensify the pain and may eventually force you to realize that Egoic actions and words ultimately lead to suffering. As Tao Te Ching said, “If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand. If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish.” The more you practice being aware and negating the mind i.e not follow and believe it, awareness deepens and the peace and joy that come along with it, intensify. Eventually you will be able to detect the unconscious and hypnotizing egoic thoughts, reactions and accumulated emotions, samskaras , that have been running your life without knowing it."

You are letting the attention or cosmic energy flow up to the top of the head or wherever it feels natural and easy like face, neck, hands, shoulders, chest, abdomen, pelvis, hips, hands, legs etc. As a precise practice, you simply latch onto any openings or cracks through the egoic shell [15] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 195 , letting the loving dimension of stillness to shine through. Feeling the inner-space of the body and/or head makes it easier to become aware of awareness . Then notice how thought activity naturally lessens and peace within deepens. This practice will become more natural when you truly realize how much pain, lost and disconnected you feel when attention is trapped in mostly negative and useless Egoic mind activity and resistance. You let the life take over and watch how beautifully it runs your life and unfolds synchronous events without any effort, while you watch this as a witness. In a way that’s also what retreat means because you are retreating from your noisy and unhappy Egoic mind. You may have to make this retreat or shift again and again and again until the life at the wheel or surrendered state becomes a natural state [16] X Research source Singer, Michael A <i>The Surrender Experiment</i> New York City, NY: Harmony, 2015. Page 194 . The act of retreating will become easier and natural as you realize deeply how much pain and suffering you go through when ego is at the wheel i.e when mind absorbs attention, and how smoothly things flow and lightness, peace and bliss you feel within when you let the ever present life take over. \"The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao.\" Tao Te Ching. With this realization, also comes devotion, awe and love for the bliss or peace or cosmic energy within. Peace of being conscious. You deeply realize that you are loved and are inseparable from totality . \"The Tao is called the Great Mother: empty yet inexhaustible, it gives birth to infinite worlds. It is always present within you. You can use it anyway you want.\" Tao Te Ching."

In other words, it will absorb attention to generate mostly pointless and negative thoughts, emotions, resistance(including blockages) etc, in an attempt to dissolve the pain or 'what-is' or cover up the Now. To prevent that, spiritual teachers and Zen masters often have a fierce and gentle look on their face. What’s happening is that they are keeping the egoic mind drained by replacing incessant chatter and non-verbal activity of the mind(including emotions and blockages) with chanting and/or feeling the love/devotion for the Being and/or continuously focusing and keeping their attention on the 'third eye' (and/or other chakras , if you'd like to see it that way) or inner-body, to stay in touch with the source of awareness or stillness . This also implies staying present or negating the mind. “The whole essence of Zen is walking along the razor’s edge of now that no problems, no suffering, nothing that who you are in essence can survive in you.” Eckhart Tolle. Experiment to see what happens when you devotionally chant and/or keep your attention on the third eye and/or inner body and/or breath. See if mental-emotional activity naturally lessens or not."

When you consciously negate the mind, desires and fears lessen naturally, and you realize what the sages meant when they said “death is the ending of desires and fears”. Since it’s the mind which has desires and fears and not You , so negating the mind is also the death of desires and fears. Along with this shift comes the peace and joy of being conscious. Indian sages called it sachidananda ; joy of truth. Infinitely more meaningful than any transient achievement, titles, success , happiness or pleasure this world has to offer. The world around you becomes alive and vibrant because ultimately everything is alive and came through one consciousness . “Synchronous and favorable events happen more frequently. Things, experiences and people you thought you needed for your happiness now come to you without any effort on your part and you are free to enjoy them while they last” - Eckhart Tolle."

When you go deeper into the practice of not following the mind (which includes emotions) and inhabiting the inner-body, then the mental reaction won’t completely take over you, especially when some challenge arises. There would be a sense of disidentification with it, even if it is slight. This means you will not be completely taken over by the mental-emotional reaction, which is always an unintelligent way of dealing with a situation and challenges because it’s always based on time and conditioning. Part of your attention remains in its unidentified or formless state [17] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 94 . That’s the state of true intelligence or no-mind, where lies your true power. The more you disidentify from the mind, less and less your actions and words will come from the will-power and reaction, which are aspects of mind. Something much more intelligent takes over; the Life itself. Tao Te Ching pointed to the same truth, “Less and less you try to force things until finally you arrive at non-action. When nothing is done and nothing is left undone.”"

The vibrantly alive, radiant and healing invisible warm light shining through the core of your being. Infinitely more loving, fulfilling, meaningful and peaceful than anything this world has to offer. You realize the insignificance and ultimate dissatisfaction of chasing after transient things, experiences and pleasures of the world. As Michael Singer said “You are on a tiny speck of dust in the infinite space”. At the same time you honor and enjoy them, while they last [18] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 34 . Since everyone has their own journey, came into this world with different karma , is identified with the mind and world ( ultimately world is in your mind ) at different levels, may not have same degree of arising presence etc., so everyone may not realize this truth at the same pace in their spiritual journey. Some people may need more suffering, while some people won’t as they may embrace the shift from thinking to consciousness, voluntarily . Some people may need a mix of challenges, suffering, devotion and realization [17] X Research source to deepen their connection with “One Consciousness”, while some may need vast upheavals or deep loss and so on. Since the Universe is infinitely intelligent, it sends tailored situations, people, conditions and challenges to help you become more conscious [20] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 29 . “Life will give you whatever experience is most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness. How do you know this is the experience you need? Because this is the experience you are having at the moment.” Eckhart Tolle. Although it’s possible that the dimension of stillness may get obscured again and again by the mind because of its momentum and deep-seated grip on humanity for thousands of years. And you may identify with the clever egoic patterns, thoughts, concepts and reactions arising from the left side of your head and chest that may say “This pain has no end”, “The mind is relentless”, \"Ego’s going to take me over\", “It’s so hard to stay present”, “I am not these thoughts.”, “Feeling is not deep enough.” etc. In other words, identification with these thoughts implies that you are making the Now into an enemy or obstacle, or \"trying\" to negate the mind and feel the stillness . In other words, deeply realize that these thoughts imply that you are identified with tricky and clever mind and are trying to solve the problems of mind at the level of limited mind by following it, which will eventually lead to suffering. While only in the Now, which is outside of psychological time, can you access the deathless dimension, which is going to liberate you from pain and bring transcendence. So watch or negate these thoughts as well along with the mind patterns and emotions that accompany them."

Page 151 and feel it becoming more spacious. You are tracing the life energy back to its source; ocean of pure stillness . As you go into it, notice that mind automatically becomes less noisy and distant. It’s because attention is naturally withdrawn from its identification with dense egoic and pain-body structures in your head and body, and becomes aware of its source; the infinite emptiness . Body and head become lighter, alive and vibrant. That’s the deathless state and the more you live in that state, you realize that there is no death, just conditioned concepts, past, desires, fears, stories, Egoic structures and physical body die [23] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>Stillness Speaks</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 2003. Page 101 . The “Never content” mind or “little me” may try to pull you back into reaction and resistance mode because it has a magnetic pull and wants to survive. It may say something like “It’s not deep enough”, “this is not familiar”, \"Give me something interesting to think\", “Do something interesting”, \"I don't want to meditate.\", \"I will do it later\", “You are going to lose everything”, “There’s still so much resistance.”, “Resist to dissolve this pain” etc. Smile at the entity (which includes the mental-emotional blockages, field of unease or pain in head and chest) and politely refuse to follow it \"Sorry Madam/Sir, you are not me\" and deeply realize it by immediately feeling the inner-space and/or any chakra i.e any opening through the Egoic shell, otherwise it will become another concept or blockage. Offer the egoic thoughts and emotions in you to the fire of inner space . Feel the devotion, reverence and love for the radiant, alive and joyful light within emanating from the eternal source. Notice how such simple practice almost immediately lessens or dissolves the momentum of egoic entity, struggles to become present. As you go deeper into the dimension of stillness , you become one with it and anything which is not you, dissolves; including the beliefs like \"you are nothing more than this finite body and personality\". This also implies faith and trust in spiritual dimension or love for God [24] X Research source Yogananda, Paramahansa. <i>Autobiography of a Yogi.</i> New York, NY: The Philosophical Library, 1946. Page 132 . It’s because you don’t want anything but oneness with God. If you look at it deeply, this is what bible verse \"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\" means. That is becoming one with the presence or stillness . Tao Te Ching basically said that same thing “Stay at the center of the circle and let everything fall into place”. Bhagvath Geetha mentioned the same truth in different words \"My devotee never perishes.\". Becoming one with the dimension of presence and abiding in it is true devotion."

You feel the same alive and vibrant stillness emanating from other people, beings and things all around; which is what love is. Thoughts become less noisy and gap between thoughts becomes longer.

Notice that this accumulation of time makes it difficult to access the source of awareness, or it seems to, because you unconsciously resist or treat it as an obstacle, which makes it real. When the grace of presence comes intensely it may dissolve the accumulation of time in brain, thus giving you a glimpse of enlightened state. J Krishnamurty pointed to the same truth when he said “We learn that truth comes uninvited, \"with glory,\" when one puts all in order, and \"in that there is great sacredness.”. But again, presence may not be intense all the time, so moment to moment spiritual work is needed. So you need to practice monitoring your inner state or any other present moment practices that resonate with you the most at that time. The more you “try” [26] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 40 to monitor your mental-emotional state, access the source of awareness and trace the opening to the formless dimension, you will notice that brain and/or face and/or heart muscles become tense, as if trying to suppress or control or clear the mental-emotional patterns and external events or to feel the awareness . This is a clear sign that your nonreactive and friendly negating and monitoring has become a mental concept and ego has seeped through. So be very alert. As mentioned before, notice the mental-emotional-physical reactions or sensations, however subtle or intense, arising especially in the left side your face, head and/or chest or anywhere. Which is why it is said that being present is a subtle art. Here's the miracle: When you truly realize that the dense accumulation of psychological time(resistance, blockages etc.) and emotional pain in you are not You and retreat from them, they dissolve or lessen almost instantaneously. In a way, you let them take care of themselves because you deeply realize there’s nothing that can be ‘done’ about them as trying doesn't work and creates more pain and frustration. You may not realize it until one of the Chakras or vortex of energy has open in you.

Page 27 . But because of the automatic, pushing down and unconscious resistance it gets blocked and you experience suffering and pain. You may \"try\" to clear the path for the energy to flow fluidly. That trying actually blocks it even more because trying is a mental thing. You may even feel the mental-emotional blockage in your head and chest, as there is a physical component to it. For example: tenseness in face, brain and chest. As a more precise pointer, find the least resistive path to guide the energy upward. This is why it was hinted to simply feel the energy in the top of your head and/or third eye and/or inner-space and trace it to its source. It’s because when you simply feel the inner space, shakti becomes more intense and flows up more freely. Again, it’s a subtle art. Hint: feel the 'third eye' chakra from below and/or spaciousness of your body. Whichever feels natural. This simple practice has deeper implications because when you simply and sincerely feel the inner space or energy of the body, you are allowing this moment to be as it is. You don’t want anything from this moment and mind stops automatically because it never wants the Now or what-is. It’s because its whole existence is based on dysfunctional relationship with the now [28] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 188 .

Page 115 . Challenges are also a good way to test your degree of presence and spiritual depth. As how you respond to challenges is a reflection of how deeply rooted you are in the deathless dimension at that time. During your spiritual journey, which is also your life journey, actions and/or words are likely to come from a mix (for lack of a better word) of reaction and consciousness . For example: In the beginning, you may respond 98 percent from ego and 2 percent from consciousness or awareness . But as you practice negating the mind and go farther on the spiritual journey, presence within deepens. You develop more faith or trust as you recognize the high quality of actions and words through you, and how easy life becomes when you are rooted in presence or consciousness . Ego, which wants to survive, may try to take you over by generating resistance, compulsive thinking, blockages etc. to obscure the light coming from eternal dimension. Or it may try to convince you that fleeting pleasures of the world are better than the peace and aliveness of Now. So moment to moment practice of negating the mind is required. This will also help you stay present when a big challenge arises."
