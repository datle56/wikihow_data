Fold the bill in half widthwise by bringing the narrow ends together. Run your fingernail along the folded edge to make a crease, then unfold the bill.

If you can't find floral wire, you can use thin beading wire, string, or even a pipe cleaner. The twisted wire must be sticking out of the folded edge of the petals.

[19] X Research source Repeat this step if you feel that the tape layer is too thin. For a more realistic touch, use florist's tape to secure 2 to 3 more petals right under the rose blossom.

[20] X Research source Make sure that you are curling the corners downwards, not upwards. Curl the petals tighter the closer you get to the center, and looser towards the outside.
