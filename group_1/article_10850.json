Women with round or wide faces benefit from the height of the hair, that elongates the face. Women with oval faces will also look good with this hairstyle. Women with narrow faces can style the rolls more outward than up and will balance their features, but it may not work for all women of narrow faces. This can also can be a good look for women with glasses, so long as the frames aren't so thick on the sides as to disrupt the flow of the hair up from the face, so wire glasses would look best. Women who want a better balance between their figure and face will achieve a nice balance with this hairstyle. The hips, bust, and hairdo will all be in better proportion for curvier women, to heavier women. Slender women should wear this style in a more petite manner with limited height and width in order to keep proper proportions."
