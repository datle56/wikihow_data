      "title": "Be respectful.",
      "content": "Be respectful. Happy parents are less likely to stick to their guns with a severe punishment than parents who continue to feel upset with you. Show your parents a little bit more respect and even consider doing something nice for them. However, remember that, if you did nothing wrong, you shouldn't pretend to apologize and repent just to get out of the punishment. Virtue and honesty is better than comfort."

      "content": "Meet in the middle. Compromise with them to see if they will unground you. Try to talk them into making your grounding shorter, or ask if they will give you an alternative punishment , like doing extra chores or giving you a spanking instead. If that doesn't work then give up, your parents won't budge they will see that you aren't enjoying your punishment and think they are doing the right thing [1] X Research source Respond in a mature way. Do not throw tantrums or give them the silent treatment. These responses will only confirm in their minds that they're doing the right thing. If possible, try to talk with your parents when you're all calm, not in the heat of the moment. This way, you can try to convince them to give you an alternative punishment that is more in line with the rule you broke."
