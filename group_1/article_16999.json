While the fit is ultimately most important, you also want to make sure the style compliments your face. Ideally, you want your glasses to balance the natural proportions of your face. While faces come in all shapes and sizes, most can be lumped into either square, triangle, oblong, round, or oval. Oval faces are complemented by any shape and style of frame shape."

      "content": "Use your current frame size for reference. The frame size is typically found on the inside of the temple arm or nose bridge, depending on the manufacturer. The eye/lens size is usually first, followed by the bridge size, then temple size. The eye/lens size is generally used to determine the best frame size. [2] X Research source You have a margin of 3 millimetres (0.12 in) on each measurement, except for the bridge. Stick to a margin of just 2 millimetres (0.079 in) on the bridge. Frame width will not be printed on the frame. Follow the guide below in order to accurately measure frame width and ensure the perfect fit."

      "content": "Take your own measurements of old glasses. Don’t worry if the numbers aren’t printed on your glasses. You can always use a ruler or measuring tape. To start, measure the frame width horizontally across the entire front of the frame. Make sure to include any bolt or hinge that sticks out on the side! Then, measure the temple arms from the hinge to where they begin to bend around the ear. After that, measure from the top of the bend to the bottom tip. Add the two measurements together for the total temple length. [3] X Research source The lens height is measured vertically at the tallest point of one lens. The bridge is measured horizontally, at the top of the bridge, from the edge of one lens to the other."

[4] X Research source While lens size may vary by brand, most credit cards are the approximate width of a standard size lens. Using a mirror, take a credit card with one hand and hold the edge against the bridge of your nose and under your eyebrow. Note where the other edge ends. If the end of the card aligns with the end of your eye, you should be comfortable with a standard size. If the card extends beyond the end of your eye, you should consider a smaller size. On the other hand, if the card does not reach the end of your eye, you should opt for a larger size. [5] X Research source"
