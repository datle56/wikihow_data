The Water Key is not a guaranteed drop, so you might have to fight the Tide Keeper multiple times. [2] X Research source The Tide Keeper's respawn time is 30 minutes, and you must be level 1475 to fight him. The best strategy to beat the Tide Keeper is to use long-range attacks. If he spawns a Sea Beast, you can either use Portal V to escape the beast or simply reset your character and go back to the Forgotten Island (as the Sea Beast will despawn and the Tide Keeper won't regain any health)."

If you don't have all the requirements but you do have the key, you can give the key to Daigrock and come back later when you've gotten all of the other requirements.
