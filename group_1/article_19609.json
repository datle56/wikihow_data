      "content": "Sebaceous filaments are hairlike strands of oil and dead skin cells. They move oils from the sebaceous glands (sebum) to the skin’s surface, protecting your skin and keeping it hydrated. [1] X Research source Although they’re off-white to yellow in color, many people mistake them for comedones like blackheads and whiteheads. [2] X Research source Sebaceous filaments are typically found in the T-zone (nose, chin, and forehead), especially in people who have oily skin.

      "content": "Exfoliate with salicylic acid twice a day. Gently exfoliate your pores with a salicylic acid cleanser or leave-on treatment . Salicylic acid is a lipophilic beta-hydroxy acid, so it dissolves oil and dead skin cells, reducing sebum production. [6] X Research source You can add salicylic acid into your routine via a cleanser, cream, gel, or pad form, but be sure to perform a patch test before using any new skincare product.

      "content": "Incorporate a retinol serum into your nighttime routine. Retinoids are the most consistent ingredient to decrease oil production and minimize sebaceous filaments. They also increase cell turnover, preventing dead skin cells from becoming trapped in your pores. [9] X Research source To incorporate retinol into your routine, start with a pea-sized amount every other day and then use it daily after 3-4 weeks. [10] X Research source If you’ve never tried retinol before, you may experience dry, flaky skin at first. [11] X Research source To avoid this, use the “retinoid sandwich” method: apply a layer of moisturizer before and after your retinol to protect your skin barrier. [12] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, incorporate retinol into your routine slowly. During the first month, use it every third night, and if you don’t see any irritation, apply it every second night during the second month, and then every night the following month. [13] X Research source Retinoids increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun so only apply it at night, and be sure to wear SPF and sun protective clothing during the day.

      "content": "Apply a niacinamide serum to regulate oil production. Unlike retinol and salicylic acid, niacinamide complements a variety of skin types, including dry, sensitive, and rosacea-prone skin. It’s excellent at removing excess sebum and reducing the appearance of pores, while also supporting the skin barrier. [15] X Research source Niacinamide is the active form of water-soluble vitamin B3, so you can easily find it in cleansers, eye creams, moisturizers, serums, and sunscreen. If you’ve never used niacinamide before, purchase a serum with 5% niacinamide (instead of 10%) to avoid irritation. [16] X Research source Alternatively, use products with green tea, like a toner or essence , to reduce oil production and minimize sebaceous filaments. [17] X Research source"

To remove all traces of oil and grime, massage your face with a cleansing balm for 1-2 minutes, and then follow up with a normal water-based cleanser . When you double cleanse , you can physically feel the sebaceous filaments coming out of your nose, leaving your pores squeaky-clean. [18] X Research source If you don’t wear makeup, there’s no need to double-cleanse—it can actually strip your skin. Always apply a hydrating moisturizer after cleansing your face to replenish and protect the skin barrier."

      "content": "Use a clay mask to absorb excess oils on the skin’s surface. Once a week, apply a kaolin clay mask to minimize the appearance of pores and sebaceous filaments. [19] X Research source Kaolin is the most mild natural clay, so it’s ideal for all skin types. It gently exfoliates your pores, without stripping your skin and leaving it dry. [20] X Research source To make a mask from powdered clay, combine 6 tablespoons (7.6 g) of kaolin clay with 1 tablespoon (14.8 mL) of water or hydrosol (floral water). [21] X Research source Since powdered clay doesn’t have water or preservatives, you can store a clay mask for up to a year. Alternatively, use a bentonite clay mask if you have especially oily or acne-prone skin. Bentonite has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that detoxify your pores, reducing sebum production. [22] X Research source"

Dilute tea tree oil with a carrier oil like olive or jojoba, and dab this mixture onto your T-zone (or anywhere you have sebaceous filaments). Tea tree oil effectively kills bacteria, which prevents sebaceous filaments from turning into blackheads.

      "content": "No. Unlike blackheads, sebaceous filaments are a natural part of the skin. Sebaceous filaments help oil flow toward the skin’s surface, while blackheads are plug-like bumps that clog your pores. If your skin produces too much oil and bacteria (and it combines within your pores), a sebaceous filament can turn into a blackhead. To avoid this, don't touch your face during the day, and always wash your face after sweating. [32] X Research source Blackheads are bumpy and dark, while sebaceous filaments are smooth and lighter in color. The same treatments for sebaceous filaments also remove blackheads , but you can try getting a facial peel for more immediate results."
