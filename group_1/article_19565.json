      "content": "Throw away any infested food and open packages. Check the oldest food near the back of your pantry first since they’re the most susceptible to infestation. Pay special attention to packages of flour, rice, and other grain-derived products since that’s what many bugs eat. If you find any food infested in your pantry, just throw it away along with any other open packages in your pantry. Even if you don’t see bugs in open packages, they’ve likely laid eggs in your food. [1] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. If you really don’t want to throw away all of your open packages of pantry goods, try freezing the ones that you didn’t see bugs in for 3-4 days to kill any eggs or larvae. [2] X Research source Bugs can reach food in plastic bags or cardboard boxes since these pantry pests can squeeze through very small spaces to get at your food. If you have a hard time seeing bugs, try pouring the food onto a baking sheet and using a flashlight to search for them."

      "content": "Wash the shelves with warm soapy water. Mix some dish soap in hot water and use a microfiber cloth to wipe your pantry down. Clean up any remaining crumbs, dust, and bugs that you missed with the vacuum. Focus more on corners, crevices, and cracks where crumbs could collect and be an easy food source for bugs.

      "title": "Wipe down all the shelves with a 50/50 water and vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Wipe down all the shelves with a 50/50 water and vinegar solution. Combine equal parts water and distilled white vinegar in a spray bottle. Mist the solution on your pantry shelves and wipe it in with a microfiber cloth. Vinegar kills any pantry bugs that may still be hiding in your cupboards and deters them from coming back. Do not use pesticides, bleach, or ammonia to wipe down the pantry. These chemicals will prevent infestations, but can be dangerous if they touch any of your food. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your trash outside immediately. Tie up any bags of trash where you threw out contaminated food items and take them out of the house. If you leave the garbage in the kitchen, the bugs could get out and re-infest your pantry. [6] X Research source Wash out your kitchen trash can with soap and water as well. Then, wipe it with your water and vinegar solution to disinfect it. Take the trash out of your kitchen at least once a week to lower the likelihood of attracting pests. If you dumped any infested food into your garbage disposal, run the garbage disposal under hot water for 1 minute to kill any bugs stuck in the drain."

      "content": "Wipe up any spills and crumbs right away. Always keep your kitchen and pantry as clean as possible. If you accidentally spill something on your pantry shelves, counters, or floor, wipe up the mess immediately.

      "content": "Check packaged food for signs of pests before buying it. Whenever you buy packages of dried goods in the store, look for signs of a broken seal before taking them home. Even a small hole or tear means that pantry pests could already have infested the package. If the package is transparent, shake the bag and look inside for any signs of bugs. [8] X Research source Try to buy amounts of flour, rice, and other grains that you’ll use up in 2-4 months. The longer something sits in your pantry, the more likely it is to get infested.

Weevils are similar to pantry beetles, but only grow to 1 ⁄ 5 inch (5.1 mm) and have a long distinguishing snout on their head.

Any type of ant will go where it finds food, but the most common types are pharaoh ants and rover ants . Place ant bait traps along the ant trails to help get rid of the colony and prevent them from coming back. [19] X Research source Double-check any sweets, like open chocolate, sugar, or cookies in your pantry for signs of ants. Avoid spraying the ants with pesticides since they could split into separate colonies."

If you notice bugs scurrying away really quickly when you turn on the light in your pantry, then you may be dealing with cockroaches. If you see oval-shaped bugs that are reddish-brown with long antennae, then take care of the roaches by putting out some roach bait traps and throwing away any food sources. [20] X Research source"
