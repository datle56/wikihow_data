Learn to make a distinction between people you find sexually attractive and people you notice because you'd like to look like them. This limbo you're in is a perfect time to do some exciting soul-searching and learn to know more about yourself. Picture your ideal self in your mind. What kind of person would you really like to be? What skills would you have? How would you look like? Where would you live ideally? What things is this person able to accomplish? How are they different to you at the moment? What steps can you take right now to start going in that direction? This might include exercising/working out, developing new skills, changing jobs, or getting more social. Even if you are unable to tackle your gender right now, you are always able to improve yourself and your life in some way. Think this journey as a way to make yourself better on all levels as a person. Gender can hugely affect things but gender isn't everything . Are there things you are not happy with yourself at the moment? You can work on depression, social anxiety, anger issues, and self-esteem; expand your comfort zone little by little, try new things, quit smoking, sort out your relationships with people, and develop as a person. Even if gender is on hold, you can advance in other areas of your life. Try to be a better person than you were yesterday, and don't compare yourself to others. Only the sky's the limit for what you can achieve! Explore yourself, let go of bad traits/habits, and develop new life skills. Become a completely new person who is able to do all those things you wouldn't dream doing before!"

Just changing the way you sit can make a difference to you and others. For some, \"passing\" can be an ugly term. You don't have to change anything about yourself or your behavior - just do it if it makes you feel better. The most important thing is to be yourself , after all. And not all trans people ever go on HRT. Some are still able to pass as their preferred gender regularly. Passing is about looks to certain degree, but it is also about the cues and vibes you give out, and the way you move and carry yourself. There are people who don't pass at all pre-everything, and then there are people who pass most of the time.

When anxiety hits and you feel really hopeless and depressed, it is good to know how to overcome that feeling. Because that is what it really is: a feeling. It will pass. And it oftentimes does not reflect the actual reality. Your situation seldom is as hopeless as you perceive it to be when you really feel down. Stimulate your senses! Smell something (perfume, a flower, deodorant), taste something (something strong-flavored or something you really like), listen to something (nature sounds or music), touch something (a fabric, a teddy bear), stimulate your vision (by looking at beautiful photographs or pics you were happy in or pics of baby animals). Keep something at hand all the time! Using your senses will reduce anxiety in a heartbeat. [20] X Research source Hoffman-Fox, D.

During the whole day you will not let yourself worry - each time you think of a worrisome or negative thought, you will firmly state to yourself, 'I don't have time for this right now.' Instead write that thing down to be dealt with during the actual worry time. This exercise frees up lots of mental energy usually spent on worrying and teaches you to control your mind and anxiety. You can decide to do a self-care activity right before and after the worry time. That will make you feel even better. [23] X Research source Hoffman-Fox, D.

If you are a \"guy\" to them and grow your hair long, they can't know you did it because you want to look like a sexy woman. Many cis-women have extremely short haircuts. If you have to make compromises (like for work), acknowledge it to yourself when you make them. They may be necessary, but they're likely temporary. Don't let the compromising eat away your personality and sense of self. Try to bend the lines whenever possible, and aim for choices that make you feel comfortable (or even a little rebellious). If you need to wear a suit type of outfit to work, maybe you can get that from the women's section or vice versa, or add some accessories that make you feel better about yourself. Remember that people can be blind about this: they'll see a man in a suit or a woman in a jacket; only you know that you're actually dressing in the clothes of your preferred gender. You could at least wear affirming underwear or socks. Whenever possible, treat yourself with something nice like a new piece of clothing, accessory, some makeup or gift.

You are probably already suffering from isolation as it is very common for LGBT people [27] X Research source [28] X Research source , let alone for trans people who are unable to transition. You may feel that you are completely alone in the world and that no one is able to see your true self. Taking the first step to reach out for help can therefore feel absolutely overwhelming. If you have faced discrimination or transphobia in the past, you may be unable to trust others easily. Remember that: Your perceived state does not reflect the reality. Even if you don't know that yet, there are others like you, and thousands of people have been where you are right now. Every trans person has experienced the pre-everything state at least for some period of their life. Others only transition in their 60s and still come out just fine if they just don't lose hope. Not having anyone to turn to is a miserable state. If you are not out to anyone, consider confiding in some trusted individual. There are almost 8 billion people on this planet - contact as many as you need to find that support. Your personal experiences might have been bad in the past. That does not mean that the majority of people are unable to accept transgender people. If you feel isolated, being alone in the world can make your current struggles that much more difficult. It's crucial that you reach out for help if you feel like this. Find trans support sites and groups online you can contact. Other trans people can give you invaluable insight and advice on how to cope with life and your process. That can't be stressed enough. Avoid mental traps like 'trying to cope on your own' 'it's too embarrassing to tell anyone' 'I just can't contact anyone' 'no one will understand' 'I'm completely alone'. If you find yourself feeling/thinking like this, it's crucial you try to get some help! There isn't a situation that can't be improved. The first time you reach out can be overwhelming. But when you just take that first step in some direction, it will get easier after that. If you are embarrassed by your situation, find one person or hotline you can confide in. Once you get it all out for the first time, the power the shame has over you diminishes dramatically. The more you open up and tell people about your situation and your struggles, you will find that others have gone through similar and you are not as alone as you thought you were. Start opening up little by little. Many places offer local trans or LGBT support groups. Attend these if you in any way can. If you find it extremely hard to interact with people in general because of your body/gender, you will find that these groups are safe spaces where you can be yourself and also respected as such. The isolation, humiliation and shame will lessen when you notice there are people who are able to take you seriously and appreciate you as your true self. The first step to combat isolation is to make that first contact. It might be easier to do online or via email if you have social anxiety. Every step you take will create other steps naturally as well. Each new person you contact will expand your social network. The more people you know, the less isolated you'll feel. Don't be shy to lean on others for support when it gets tough. Your new contacts will support you through the tough times. It is very relieving to have someone to talk to when you need it - even if just online. The internet is your best friend here! You can contact anyone anywhere in the world! If you are living in a remote area or one that is anti-LGBT, you can find your community and like-minded people online. You can also contact support centers in other countries. Just don't suffer alone! There are lots of people out there ready to help. No situation is so tough there isn't a way out of it.

If you suffer from low self-esteem or self-deprecation, you can challenge this by learning positive thinking and combatting negative thoughts. Scheduling your worries and keeping a gratitude journal can help a lot. Learn to jot positive things down every single day! Anything goes, however small. Make this a daily practice and weekly read through what you've written down. It will enhance your mood. Learn to treat yourself with respect and practice kind inner dialogue.
