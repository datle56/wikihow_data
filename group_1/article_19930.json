      "content": "Use dish soap and water to gently clean super glue off your glasses. First, rinse your glasses lenses in lukewarm water. Next, pour a drop of dish soap directly onto the dried super glue on your lenses. Use your fingertip or a damp microfiber cloth to rub the dish soap gently into the glue. Repeat this entire process as many times as needed for the super glue to come off. [1] X Research source When you're done, rinse the soap and glue residue off your glasses, then let them air dry to avoid streaks. This method is safe and gentle for all types of glasses lenses and frames."

      "title": "Make a diluted rubbing alcohol solution to clean uncoated lenses.",
      "content": "Make a diluted rubbing alcohol solution to clean uncoated lenses. If your lenses aren't covered with special coatings (such as a UV blocker), rubbing alcohol may do the trick. Combine 1 fl oz (30 mL) of 70% isopropyl alcohol with 1 fl oz (30 mL) of water in a spray bottle, then add 2 drops of liquid dish soap and swirl the bottle around to mix its contents. [2] X Research source Spray the DIY glasses cleaner onto the lens with the super glue residue, then gently rub it into the adhesive with a microfiber cloth. Repeat this step until the super glue comes off on the cloth or peels up so you can pull it off with your fingers. 70% isopropyl alcohol breaks down the bond in super glue and Krazy Glue, which are both the same type of adhesive (called cyanoacrylate). This makes it easier to get the adhesive off. [3] X Research source Check your glasses prescription or call the office where you purchased your glasses if you're not sure if they're coated. If they are, avoid using rubbing alcohol to clean them. It could strip the coatings off and ruin the lenses."

      "title": "Use acetone to remove super glue from glass lenses with no coatings.",
      "content": "Use acetone to remove super glue from glass lenses with no coatings. Pour a few drops of acetone-based nail polish remover onto a cotton ball. Hold the cotton ball against the super glue on the lens and wait several seconds for the acetone to seep into the adhesive. When the adhesive loosens up and gets sticky, wipe it off with the cotton ball. [4] X Research source Don't use acetone to clean lenses made of polycarbonate or any other type of plastic. Polycarbonate can crack when it comes into contact with acetone. [5] X Research source This harsh solvent can ruin the plastic in your frames, too. Only apply it to your lenses, not your frames!"

      "title": "Apply non-abrasive toothpaste to any lens to break down the super glue.",
      "content": "Apply non-abrasive toothpaste to any lens to break down the super glue. Buy plain, non-gel toothpaste with no whiteners, sparkles, or other abrasives that could scratch your lenses. Apply a pea-sized amount to the super glue on your lenses with your finger and lightly rub it in. Finally, rinse the toothpaste off with water and dry it with a microfiber cloth. [6] X Research source The toothpaste method works for some people but doesn't for others. Some people also say you can use it to fix scratches in your lenses ."

      "content": "Dilute vinegar with water and spray it on your lenses and frames. Vinegar is acidic and can break down the bonds in strong adhesives like super glue and Krazy Glue. To make it safe to clean your glasses with, mix a 1:1 ratio of distilled white vinegar with distilled water in a small spray bottle. Then, spray the solution directly onto your lenses or a microfiber cloth. Rub the super glue with the cloth, adding more vinegar water as needed until the adhesive pulls away. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Try glue remover, but use it with caution. A brand called Loctite makes a glue remover that it claims is safe for cleaning super glue off glasses. But it's not clear how the remover impacts special coatings. If you've tried other methods and none worked, the glue remover could be a good option. To use it, pour a tiny amount on a tissue, then wipe the glue stain on the lenses with the tissue."

      "title": "Acetone can ruin plastic lenses and strip the coatings off glass lenses.",
      "content": "Acetone can ruin plastic lenses and strip the coatings off glass lenses. Acetone is a solvent, a type of chemical that can dissolve other substances. It's known for stripping the coatings off glass lenses and cracking lenses made out of a hard plastic called polycarbonate. [8] X Research source But it's also great at breaking down super glue. So if you do decide to use this method, make sure your glasses are made of real glass and don't have any special coatings on them. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Rubbing alcohol can damage special coatings on your lenses. Rubbing alcohol is safe for cleaning most types of glasses as long as it's diluted with water. It's only unsafe when your lenses are coated. Many people ask for extra coatings on their lenses to make them anti-reflective, scratch-resistant, or shield their eyes from UV rays. Unfortunately, rubbing alcohol can strip those coatings away so they're no longer effective. That's why it's best not to use it unless you know your glasses are uncoated. [10] X Research source Rubbing alcohol can also damage or discolor plastic glasses frames. So use it to clean your lenses only, and keep it away from your frames!"

      "content": "No, never use WD-40 to clean your glasses. WD-40 is drying, flammable, and toxic when inhaled. It's definitely not a substance you want near your eyes! [11] X Research source The reason some people suggest using WD-40 is that it's oil-based. Oil helps loosen the bond in super glue and Krazy Glue. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source But it's best not to use any oil-based products to clean your glasses, period. They can scratch the lenses and leave residue behind."

      "content": "Buy an eyeglasses repair kit. An eyeglasses repair kit generally costs less than $10 and comes with almost everything you need to repair your glasses at home. You can, for example, use it to screw the arm of your glasses back on instead of making a mess with Krazy Glue. You can also attach new nose pieces and replace any old screws that fall out."

      "title": "Tape your glasses back together in a pinch.",
      "content": "Tape your glasses back together in a pinch. If you can't fix your glasses using a repair kit, wrap strips of clear adhesive tape around your glasses to hold the pieces together. Then, visit an eyeglasses store as soon as possible to get them repaired. The tape is definitely only a temporary fix, but it won't ruin the lenses or frames like super glue will. The store might be able to put the lenses in new frames and save you an additional cost."

      "content": "Take your glasses to the store where you bought them. The best solution for broken glasses is to take them back to the store where you bought them initially. If they can fix them, they may not charge you any money for the repair. They'll also be able to put it back together more securely and safely than you would using super glue. And if they can't repair them, they can help you get new glasses as soon as possible."

      "content": "Soap and water is the safest way to clean super glue off your glasses. If this method doesn't work, try cleaning them with a diluted rubbing alcohol solution. Just make sure your lenses don't have any special coatings on the outside, or the alcohol will strip them off. Nail polish removers with acetone in them also work, but only use them on glass lenses with no special coatings. Another method to try is plain, non-whitening toothpaste. If all else fails, you may need to visit an eyeglasses store and buy a brand-new pair of glasses."
