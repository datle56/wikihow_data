The ordered pair is always expressed exactly the same way: ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,y)} . The first number represents the x {\\displaystyle x} coordinate on the plane while the second number represents the y {\\displaystyle y} coordinate. The x {\\displaystyle x} -coordinate tells you how far away the point is horizontally from the y {\\displaystyle y} -axis. The y {\\displaystyle y} -coordinate tells you how far away the point is vertically from the x {\\displaystyle x} -axis."

In this standard linear equation, x {\\displaystyle x} represents the x {\\displaystyle x} coordinate of a point and y {\\displaystyle y} represents the y {\\displaystyle y} coordinate of that same point. So you have two variables you'll need to find—your ordered pair. [2] X Research source For example, the equation 5 x + y = 1 {\\displaystyle 5x+y=1} is a linear equation. If you see a \" − {\\displaystyle -} \" instead of a \" + {\\displaystyle +} \", that means the y {\\displaystyle y} coordinate is negative. If you're working on a problem that asks you to determine whether a given ordered pair is a solution to the equation provided, you'd just plug in the numbers for x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} and see if they worked."

Sometimes, you'll have a problem that asks you to find ordered pairs that are solutions for the equation. The easiest way to do these problems is to get one of the variables on the other side of the equation so you can solve for it. [3] X Research source Try working through it with 5 x + y = 1 {\\displaystyle 5x+y=1} : Start by subtracting 5 x {\\displaystyle 5x} from each side to get the y {\\displaystyle y} by itself: 5 x + y − 5 x = 1 − 5 x {\\displaystyle 5x+y-5x=1-5x} Simplify: y = 1 − 5 x {\\displaystyle y=1-5x} Almost there! Swap the order of the expression so it matches the slope-intercept form: y = − 5 x + 1 {\\displaystyle y=-5x+1} You might recognize this as slope-intercept form. It's also referred to as function form . [4] X Research source"

So yes, unless the problem specifies the numbers you should use for x {\\displaystyle x} , you can choose literally any number. [5] X Research source Don't make this too hard on yourself! Choose a simple number, like 1 {\\displaystyle 1} . For example, if you're working with y = 1 − 5 x {\\displaystyle y=1-5x} , you could replace the x {\\displaystyle x} with 1 {\\displaystyle 1} and get y = 1 − 5 ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle y=1-5(1)} ."
