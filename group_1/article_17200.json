    {
      "title": "Look closely.",
      "content": "Look closely. Turn the roll slowly in your hands, and carefully examine every inch of the circumference. The edge should look like a thin, almost invisible ridge that runs straight across the width of the tape. It may be slightly darker than the rest of the roll, and it may blend in almost perfectly. If you don't find it on the first pass, try again. If the tape is patterned, look for the flaw or break in the continuous pattern. On a roll of zebra-print duct tape, for instance, look carefully for a point where the stripes do not entirely match up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider that the edge might not be completely straight.",
      "content": "Consider that the edge might not be completely straight. If the roll of tape has been treated roughly, the \"edge\" might be jagged, patchy, or even extremely long. Tape-roll edges have been known to run all the way around the roll at an angle, diminishing very gradually until they taper off."

    {
      "title": "Run your finger around the roll.",
      "content": "Run your finger around the roll. Use your fingertip for heightened sensation, or use your fingernail for the sake of precision. Slip your finger around the roll and feel for bumps and ridges. The edge should feel like a slightly raised ridge in the tape. If the lip is large enough, your finger will catch slightly. If you think you've identified the edge by looking closely, use your finger for a closer inspection. If you have very short fingernails, try running the edge of a knife around the rim of the roll. [1] X Research source You might also use a toothpick, a paperclip, a key – anything that allows you the sensation and precision to feel a slight ridge in the surface of the tape. Be careful not to press too hard and puncture the tape. If you don't feel anything on the first pass, try going around in the opposite direction."

    {
      "title": "Once you find the edge of the roll, peel it up carefully.",
      "content": "Once you find the edge of the roll, peel it up carefully. Pick at a corner until you can hold it between your thumb and forefinger. After you manage to get a corner up with your fingernail, use your finger or thumb to roll up the edge diagonally from the corner. Pull the edge until you can hold the full width of the tape. The oils from your hands will keep the rolled edge from sticking back down."

    {
      "title": "Use flour or chalk as a tracer.",
      "content": "Use flour or chalk as a tracer. If your tape is dark-colored, you can use use a light-colored, contrasting \"tracer\" to reveal the edge of the roll. The basic idea here is to rub a clumpy white material—flour, chalk, and baking powder are good choices—around the outside of the tape roll until the tracer sticks to the hidden edge. If you are using a thicker tape, such as duct tape, this effect may be more apparent than if you are using a thinner tape."

    {
      "title": "Put a bit of flour or chalk dust into a cup or small container.",
      "content": "Put a bit of flour or chalk dust into a cup or small container. Any material will do, as long as it clumps together and the color contrasts with the color of the tape."

    {
      "title": "Dip your finger into the cup or container.",
      "content": "Dip your finger into the cup or container. It may help to wet your finger, slightly, beforehand. If you don't want to use your finger, you can also dip the roll of tape directly into the flour or chalk dust. Be sure to immerse it thoroughly. There is a chance that the flour will stick to the edge of the roll, revealing your goal!"

    {
      "title": "Run your floured finger around the circumference of the tape.",
      "content": "Run your floured finger around the circumference of the tape. Go slowly and methodically in one direction, then the other. This way, your finger is more likely to catch the edge of the roll. Make sure not to skip over any sections, or you might miss it! The edge should become quickly apparent: the flour will catch along the crack, forming a white line."

    {
      "title": "Use a pencil as a tracer.",
      "content": "Use a pencil as a tracer. If your tape is light in color, try running the flat side of a pencil point around the roll. The dark-grey graphite from the pencil will serve a similar function to the flour. The pencil should bump up very slightly when it hits the edge of the roll, and you will be able to see the break in the graphite line."

      "title": "Cut a V-shape into the tape roll.",
      "content": "Cut a V-shape into the tape roll. Use a sharp knife or a pair of scissors to cut a small wedge out of the entire roll of tape – from the outermost edge to the innermost end. This way, you'll tear the tape off in the same spot every time, and you may have less trouble finding the edge in the future!"

    {
      "title": "Mark the end of the roll with a toothpick.",
      "content": "Mark the end of the roll with a toothpick. When you are done using a roll of tape for the time being, stick a toothpick underneath the adhesive about a half-inch from the edge. This way, when you return to use the tape again, you will be able to easily identify where to begin. This method is especially useful for clear packing tape. [2] X Research source In theory, you can use almost anything to mark the end of the roll: paper, a paperclip, a twig, a card. Use anything that isn't too bulky and sticks cleanly to the edge of the tape. Improvise a solution using the materials you have lying around your home or office."

    {
      "title": "Fold the edge of the tape back on itself.",
      "content": "Fold the edge of the tape back on itself. Fold the sticky end of the tape back into the roll—not far, just a centimeter or so—to make a \"pull tab\" for the next time you use the tape. You can fold the tape directly in, or you can fold at a 45-degree angle for a triangular fold."

      "title": "Use a tape dispenser.",
      "content": "Use a tape dispenser. Consider buying a dedicated tape dispenser. These devices usually include a spool (which you can continually refill with new rolls of tape) and a serrated tape-cutting edge. When you stretch the tape over the serrated edge, it slices cleanly and naturally. The edge of the tape sticks there until you need it next. Consider buying a \"tape gun\" for packing tape. This device is a convenient, handheld version of the standard tape dispenser. Run the tape gun along the surface of a box, and you will seal the box without losing the edge of the roll. You can find tape dispensers online or at office-supply stores. Be aware that many standard tape dispensers are designed for use with Scotch tape"

      "title": "Buy striped or patterned tape.",
      "content": "Buy striped or patterned tape. It is easier to find the edge of a roll of patterned tape, as you can visually parse out the breaks in the pattern. If you consistently have trouble finding the edge of a roll of tape, consider making a habit of buying patterned tape for the sake of convenience. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy sticky tape with non-stick sides.",
      "content": "Buy sticky tape with non-stick sides. Some tape is designed with black lines on the sides to denote where the adhesive ends. This way, you will not need to find the edge of the roll – you'll be able to pull it up at any point! Look for this specialty tape online or in large office-supply stores."
