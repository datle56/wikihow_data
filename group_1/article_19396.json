      "content": "Gear up with some rubber gloves and a dust mask. Mice already carry diseases to begin with, but a dead mouse is especially likely to harbor some nasty bacteria or viruses. Once you find the mouse, throw on a dust mask and put on some thick rubber gloves. [1] X Research source If you don’t have rubber gloves, you can use nitrile or plastic ones."

      "content": "Locate the mouse's body. The stronger the rotten cabbage smell is, the closer you are to the mouse. Pull back appliances and look in cupboards, since mice often hide when they’re dying. If you start noticing flies attracted to one area, investigate carefully to find the culprit. If you can’t find the mouse, call a professional. [2] X Research source Frankly, if the animal is trapped in your wall , you may be better off just trying to mask the smell and waiting for the mouse to decompose. If you do want to get a mouse in your walls, put small holes in your wall to try and locate the source. Once you find and remove the mouse, you can patch the wall ."

      "title": "Put the corpse inside of two airtight plastic bags.",
      "content": "Put the corpse inside of two airtight plastic bags. Grab two plastic bags (Ziploc-style zipper bags are ideal). Lift the mouse up by the base of the tail and put it inside of the first bag. Seal the first bag and then set that inside the other bag. This will prevent any odors or bacteria from getting out. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If the mouse is in a trap, you can either throw the trap out with the mouse, or soak it in bleach and water after removing the mouse."

      "content": "Discard the bagged-up mouse in your normal trash. Set the bag in your trash. To play it extra safe, take your trash outside right away. You don’t need to take any extra steps when it comes to discarding a mouse carcass, so sleep tight knowing the mouse is fine in the normal trash. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source As tempting as it may be to toss a tiny mouse in the toilet and flush it, don’t do it. The mouse can get stuck in your pipes quite easily, and it’s really bad for your septic system even if it does make it through."

      "title": "Wash your rubber gloves with bleach and water.",
      "content": "Wash your rubber gloves with bleach and water. Before you remove the rubber gloves, you need to sterilize them. Pour a capful of bleach onto the gloves and scrub the fingers thoroughly. Run the gloves under warm water and wash away the bleach. Then you can remove the gloves and dust mask. [5] X Research source If you’re uncomfortable reusing the gloves in the future (which is totally understandable), feel free to throw them out after you give them a bleach wash. You don’t want to take the gloves off right away because you may accidentally spread whatever virus or bacteria you picked up when you grabbed the mouse."

      "content": "Mix a solution of 9-parts water and 1-part bleach in a spray bottle. Put your gloves and dust mask back on. Use a 1:9 ratio of bleach to water to avoid damaging whatever surface you’re applying the bleach to. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Diluted bleach should be safe on most surfaces, but you may want to spot check the solution first in an inconspicuous area to ensure that the diluted bleach won’t stain or damage the surface. [7] X Research source Do not mix the bleach with any other cleaning agent (especially vinegar, which will create chlorine gas). Bleach can react in dangerous ways with other cleaning agents. Vinegar and baking soda are great deodorizers, but they won’t do as good a job at sanitizing and disinfecting as bleach will. Alternatively, you can use a general disinfectant cleaning product, like Lysol. So long as it’s designed to disinfect surfaces, it’ll work."

      "content": "Scrub the area with a paper towel and discard the towel immediately. Fold up a few paper towels and work the bleach into the floor. Use firm, circular motions to work the watered-down bleach into the flooring. Once you’ve scrubbed the area thoroughly, discard the paper towel immediately in the trash. [9] X Research source You can do this multiple times if you want to completely ensure that you’ve fully cleaned the area."

However, if you don’t want to let the bleach sit for too long, grab a paper towel and dampen it with water. Wipe the area you scrubbed to soak up any excess bleach. Then, dry the area with another paper towel. Dispose of all of it immediately. [10] X Research source You’re now good to go. Short of any lingering odors in the air, your problem has been solved safely!"

[11] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You do not need to air your home out after cleaning up after the mouse. You only need to do this if you smell anything strange. If the mice were around for a while, you might notice a sticky, musky smell. That’s mouse urine.

If you’ve got ceiling fans, turn them on. If you’ve got any table or standing fans, bring those into the room and point them at the open windows. Direct all the airflow out of your home. This will help to drive any bad smells outside. [12] X Research source Leave the fans running for as long as you reasonably can.

If you’ve got some scented candles, light them . Alternatively, you can light some incense or sage. Other options include: [13] X Research source Roasting coffee beans or orange peels in your oven at a low temperature for 30 minutes or so. Orange and coffee particles are known deodorizers. Use a plug-in scent product to fill the room with a pleasant smell over a longer period of time. Set charcoal briquettes out around your home to absorb the odor particles in the air."
