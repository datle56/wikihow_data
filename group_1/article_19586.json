      "title": "Apply some oil to your hair.",
      "content": "Apply some oil to your hair. You can use a hair oil, argan oil, or coconut oil. Start with a pea-sized amount, and apply it to your hair using your fingers. Start at the ends and work your way towards the roots. This will help make your hair appear smoother. A little oil goes a long way, so adding too much can make your hair greasy. Be sure to start with a small amount. Remember, it's easier to add more if you need it than to shower and start your hair routine all over again."

      "content": "Use an anti-frizz spray. This aerosol hair spray uses a very fine layer to lock your style where you want it. It helps reduce frizz, whereas non-aerosol spritzes reintroduce moisture to your hair. This moisture causes your hair to be susceptible to puffiness. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim your hair. If you’re noticing that your hair is repeatedly frizzy, there’s a chance that your split ends are getting bad. Make sure that you get the right haircut, however. Blunt haircuts tend to bring out frizz. Layers tend to conceal them (and split-ends). Avoid getting too many short layers, especially towards the top of your head. This can cause your hair to poof up."

Pour this over your hair after you shampoo. Leave it for up to 10 minutes, then rinse it out with cool water. Condition your hair as you normally would after this. This rinse not only helps fix puffy and frizzy hair, it's also a great scalp cleanser and clarifying treatment."

      "content": "Make a mask using avocado and olive oil. Cut an avocado in half and scoop the meat out into a bowl. Add one to two tablespoons of olive or coconut oil, and mash everything with a fork until you get a gooey paste. Apply the mask to damp, freshly-shampooed hair. Pull your hair up into a loose bun and tuck it under a shower cap; this will keep the mask from drying out. Leave it for 30 minutes, then take the shower cap off and rinse the mask out."

      "title": "Wash your hair twice a week using lukewarm water.",
      "content": "Wash your hair twice a week using lukewarm water. When you wash your hair too often, you strip your hair of its natural oils. This causes your hair to dry out and become frizzy. [3] X Research source Avoid using hot water while washing your hair, as this can damage it and cause it to become puffy. If you notice the roots of your hair getting too greasy, shake a dry shampoo or baby powder onto your scalp. Let it sit for five minutes, then run your fingers through your hair to disperse the white powder. Dry shampoo is a great tool for keeping your hair fresh between washes, but it can't completely replace regular washing. If you notice that your dry shampoo is getting cakey or is otherwise ineffective, it may be time to wash."

      "title": "Use the right shampoo and conditioner.",
      "content": "Use the right shampoo and conditioner. Try to find something that is made for curly or dry hair. Look for labels that say: smoothing, moisturizing, hydrating, or dry & damaged. When using conditioner, leave it in your hair for two to three minutes; this will allow your hair to absorb the nutrients in the conditioner. Consider using a protein-infused conditioner. This kind of deep conditioner helps repair dry, damaged hair. It also protects it from humidity, which can cause puffiness. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Comb your hair using a wide-tooth comb.",
      "content": "Comb your hair using a wide-tooth comb. Comb your hair in small sections, starting from the ends first, then working your way towards the roots. Never comb your hair straight down, as this can cause the strands to stretch and snap. The best time to do this is while your hair is still damp and covered in conditioner. The conditioner will lubricate the comb and help it glide between the strands easier. [5] X Research source If you need to detangle your hair while it is dry, do not use a brush. Use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. Brushing dry hair with a hairbrush leads to frizz and puff. If you must use a hairbrush, try to use one made with soft, natural bristles. These will be less likely to snag your hair. The natural bristled brush will also polish your hair and smooth the ends."

      "content": "Use a soft, microfiber towel or old t-shirt to blot your hair dry. Gently wrap your hair with the towel or t-shirt, and squeeze it so that the fabric can soak up the excess moisture. If you want, you can wrap the towel around your hair in a loose turban.

This will cause the fibers to snag on your hair and cause it to rip and tear. [7] X Research source Also, try to avoid blow drying your hair. Hairdryers are often too hot for curly hair.

      "content": "Avoid using anything with sulfates, parabens, and silicones. Parabens have been linked to cancer, which is not something you'd want to put into your hair. Silicones, while great at making hair smooth and shiny, can only be removed by sulfates. Sulfates are harsh, cleaning agents found in many household detergents; they can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it brittle and dry. You don't want to leave those silicones in your hair either. This can lead to buildup, which can make your hair appear limp and dull. You may also want to avoid products that contain alcohol, especially towards the top of the ingredient list. Alcohol is very drying on hair, which can cause puffiness and even breakage."
