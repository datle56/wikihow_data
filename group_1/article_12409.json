Fortunately, Facebook has a built-in feature that can hide your profile from search engines. It may take a few days for this change to take effect, but it's one way to better protect your privacy. On a computer: Log into Facebook and click the downward triangle ▼ at the upper-right corner of the page. Go to Settings & Privacy > Settings > Privacy . Scroll down to the \"Do you want search engines outside of Facebook to link to your profile?\" Click Edit and select No . Phone or tablet: Open the Facebook app and tap the three-line menu ☰ at the top-right or bottom-right. Tap How People Find and Contact You . Tap Do you want search engines outside of Facebook to link to your profile? and select No . This will only prevent your personal Facebook profile from appearing in Google, Bing, and other search engine results. If you've made posts or comments on public Facebook Pages or groups, they could still appear on Google. If this happens, follow the link and edit or delete your comment/post as needed."

There's a good chance that the people you care about on your social networks know who you are, so changing your name will help hide your profiles from search engines. This is a bit harder on Facebook, as their real name policy requires you to use the name on your government ID. However, you can make your name anything you want on Twitter or Instagram. Twitter: Go to your profile, select Edit profile , and change what appears in the \"Name\" field. Facebook: Click the down-arrow at the top of the page (or tap the three-line menu on a phone or tablet), go to Settings & Privacy > Settings , tap Personal and Account Information (mobile only), and then change the \"Name\" field.

For example, if you have an Amazon.com account, people may be able to search for your name and find your wish list, reviews, and other details. The best way to tackle this issue is to delete any online accounts you no longer use, and lock down the ones you do use. Try to remember the places you've shopped online (or search your email for receipts). Log in to any site you don't plan to use again and either change your name or delete your profile. If you've signed up for online forums, such as help forums for services or discussion boards, your posts and profiles could appear in searches for your name. If you can't remember which forums or groups you've signed up for, try searching your email for \"Welcome to\" or similar."
