      "content": "Memory is where your computer stores data before processing. The most common type of memory that is used in a computer is Random Access Memory , or RAM. The RAM is stored in removable chips that are inserted into your computer's motherboard. These chips are removable so that you can upgrade your RAM and improve your computer's performance. Your computer can access the data on your RAM much more quickly than the data on your hard drive. But unlike the data stored on your hard drive, the data stored in your RAM is temporary and disappears when you reboot your computer. [1] X Research source"

The BIOS is a ROM chip on your motherboard that contains basic instructions that test your computer's hardware for errors, locate your operating system and pass control of the computer's hardware to the operating system. It also contains a configuration program you can use to configure your computer's hardware settings, including settings related to memory. [2] X Research source"

To do this, you will need to restart your computer and press the BIOS setup key when prompted as your computer is booting up. [3] X Research source The key you press is different from one computer model to the next. Common BIOS setup keys include; F2 , DEL , Esc or one of the other function keys. Unfortunately for many newer computers, the bootup process happens so quickly that it's hard to press the Setup key on time. If this is the case, you can boot into the BIOS from within Windows."

      "content": "Look for the memory option you want to disable. Available memory options will vary from one computer's BIOS menu to the next. You may have several memory options that other computers don't have, and vice versa. The following are some memory options that you may find in your BIOS menu: Memory Caching — Memory caching allows computer programs and applications to store bits of data in the RAM so that it can be quickly accessed. If you are having issues with blue-screen crashes, disabling memory caching may fix the problem. [5] X Research source Shadow Memory — Shadow memory (also known as \"Shadow RAM\" or \"Shadowing\") is when a copy of BIOS routines are saved to the RAM for quicker access. This is useful for many older operating systems (such as DOS), which rely on BIOS for normal operations in addition to the boot-up process. Most newer operating systems (such as Windows) do not use this function. However, it could be useful if your BIOS is ever corrupted and you need to restore your BIOS. If you have a computer that does not have a lot of memory, you may want to consider turning this function off or limiting the amount of RAM it uses. [6] X Research source Disable RAM — If any of the RAM chips installed on your motherboard aren't working, you may be able to disable them from the BIOS without physically removing it from your computer. Frequency Limiter — Memory Frequency Limiter or RAM Frequency Limiter limits your computer's memory and CPU transfer speed. This often lowers your RAM speed below the manufacturer's specifications. Not all BIOS menus have this option or allow you to disable it. If you are not getting the full potential out of your RAM, disabling the frequency limiter and entering your own RAM speed may improve your RAM's performance. XMP — Some motherboards support XMP (extreme memory profiles). These profiles allow users to increase select different memory speeds and voltage consumption settings. This allows you to overclock your RAM. If you are using an XMP and your RAM is not behaving properly, you may want to disable this function. You can usually find memory profiles in the XMP section of the BIOS. DRAM Settings — DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. This is the type of RAM that most computers use. A lot of motherboards limit the speed of your RAM by default. You may be able change the speed and voltage consumption of your RAM in the DRAM settings. [7] X Research source"
