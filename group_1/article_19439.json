[7] X Research source While apple cider vinegar is commonly used as bait for this DIY trap, a piece of ripe banana can also be used and be just as effective. [8] X Research source"

Herbs can also be planted in a pot and placed near doorways, trash cans, and drains to repel flies in infested areas."
