      "content": "Shamrock While most people think of modern Ireland when they see a shamrock, its symbolic origins are much older. The clover is native to Ireland and was revered by the Druids and Celts because its leaves symbolize a triad (the number 3 was particularly spiritual in ancient Celtic times). [10] X Research source In the 5th century AD, it’s thought that St. Patrick used the shamrock to explain the idea of the Holy Trinity to the Celts and pagans in Ireland. This is another reason why the shamrock is so closely associated with Ireland, Christianity, St. Patrick, and Celtic culture."

      "content": "The Druids were a learned class of Celtic society. They were highly educated and acted as priests or spiritual guides, teachers, and judges. They kept no written records and passed their knowledge down orally, so little is known about them today (historians often turn to the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar (100–44 BC), whose accounts of the Druids are the biggest source of primary information about them). [26] X Research source The Druids believed in the divinity of nature and spent up to 20 years studying ancient texts and verses, astronomy, natural philosophy, and the lore of their gods. The word “Druid” might be derived from a Celtic word meaning “knower of the oak tree.” The Celts were an ancient, indigenous Indo-European people whose influence stretched from Britain to Asia Minor during the peak of their civilization during the 4th century BC. [27] X Research source It’s believed that the Celts (and Druids) arrived in Ireland in largely peaceful waves between 700 and 100 BC and had a lasting impact on the island’s culture.
