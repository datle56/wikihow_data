This is because the eustachian tubes (tubes running from the middle of each ear to the back of your throat) are smaller in children and more prone to fill with fluid. Children also have weaker immune systems than adults and are also more prone to viral infections such as colds. [4] X Research source Anything that blocks the eustachian tube can cause an ear infection. There are other risk factors for an ear infection, including: [5] X Research source Allergies Respiratory infections such as colds and sinus infections Infection or trouble with the adenoids (lymph tissue in your upper throat area) Tobacco smoke Excess mucus or saliva, such as that produced during teething Living in a cold climate Changes in altitude or climate Not being breastfed as an infant Recent illness Attending daycare, especially a larger daycare with many children"

A middle ear infection ( acute otitis media ) is the most common type of ear infection and hence recognizing its symptoms is very important. Middle ear infection is caused by a virus or bacteria.

When the area becomes filled with fluid, bacteria and viruses can get in and cause an infection. An ear infection often occurs after a respiratory infection such as a cold, although severe allergies may also bring one on.
