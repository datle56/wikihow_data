      "title": "Set the acrylic on a flat surface like a work table.",
      "content": "Set the acrylic on a flat surface like a work table. To make it easier to work with, find a flat surface big enough to accommodate your plastic sheet. Keep in mind that you can't use the floor, as you need an edge to break the acrylic over later. If your sheet is extra large or unruly, place a protective sheet of wood or other firm material over the acrylic and clamp both layers to your work table to hold the sheet in place. Just make sure to leave the area you need to cut visible. Scoring and cutting acrylic by hand is best when the sheet is about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) thick or less. Safety tip: Wear protective gloves and goggles. Even though you’re making a simple straight cut by hand, there’s always the chance a sharp shard of acrylic could break off and go flying."

      "title": "Mark your cut line with a straightedge.",
      "content": "Mark your cut line with a straightedge. Begin by deciding where you want to cut the acrylic. Measure it out and use a ruler to make a perfectly straight line. Mark the line with a permanent marker or grease pencil , or just use the ruler as a guide for your blade if it’s a shorter cut. [1] X Research source If you plan to keep your straightedge on the acrylic to guide your cut, clamp it down on top of the acrylic so it doesn’t move."

      "title": "Score the line in the acrylic with a plastic scoring blade or utility knife.",
      "content": "Score the line in the acrylic with a plastic scoring blade or utility knife. Using your straightedge as a guide, run a plastic scoring blade along the cutting line, trying to make one continuous line with gentle, even pressure. Pull the blade towards you along the line. It's especially important to get a straight line on the first go-round, as that line guides your subsequent lines. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Flip the acrylic sheet over and score the other side in the same place.",
      "content": "Flip the acrylic sheet over and score the other side in the same place. Once you have a substantial groove on the top side, unclamp the sheet (if needed) and flip it over. Secure it to your work table again and then score a line along the backside that follows the line on the other side. [3] X Research source Scoring on both sides makes it easier to snap the acrylic into pieces, making for a cleaner cut. For super thin sheets, you may only have to score one side before the score line is breakable. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Snap the acrylic sheet along the score line.",
      "content": "Snap the acrylic sheet along the score line. Place the line you've scored directly along the edge of the table. Using clamps to hold the sheet, break the sheet at the scored line by pressing down on the outer edge in a quick motion. You can wrap your hand around one edge and use your body weight to push down. [5] X Research source The acrylic should give fairly easily. If it seems too difficult, score the cut line even deeper and try snapping it again."

      "title": "Use a circular or table saw with a blade meant for acrylic.",
      "content": "Use a circular or table saw with a blade meant for acrylic. Circular and table saws are ideal for making perfect cuts through thick material. For plastic, you need a blade with a high tooth count. Look for a blade that’s made for acrylic or plexiglass , or use any metal-cutting blade with carbide tips. Also check for evenly spaced teeth of a uniform height with no rake (teeth that lean forward or backward). [6] X Research source If you use a regular saw blade, the cut will be jagged and harder to smooth later."

      "title": "Lay the acrylic sheet on a large, decluttered saw table.",
      "content": "Lay the acrylic sheet on a large, decluttered saw table. Make sure the surface is large enough to support your sheet and to run it through the saw in one, continuous motion. If you have to stop and reposition the sheet, you risk cutting a line that’s not perfectly straight or smooth. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mark your cut line with a metal straightedge.",
      "content": "Mark your cut line with a metal straightedge. Before beginning, mark where you want to cut with a permanent marker, using a metal straightedge or ruler to make a perfectly straight line. If you’re making multiple cuts that intersect, use different colored markers for each line to help you keep track of them. [8] X Research source To make a cleaner cut and prevent cracking, cover the area you want to cut with painter’s tape, then mark your cut line over the tape. This helps protect the surface of the plexiglass or acrylic from scratching and reduces the amount of sanding and buffing you’ll have to do later."

      "title": "Push the acrylic through the saw to make a straight cut.",
      "content": "Push the acrylic through the saw to make a straight cut . If you’re using a table saw , secure your sheet to the saw table and line up the blade with your cut mark. Start at one edge of the mark you made and push the acrylic through the table saw at a steady pace, being sure to keep your fingers out of the way of the saw. Don't move too quickly, as you'll create a rougher edge. [9] X Research source If you’re using a circular saw , clamp the sheet so the cut line sits just off the surface of your table and place a soft surface like a moving blanket on the ground underneath to catch the cut piece. Run the blade of the saw along the cut line, using the edge of the table as a guide. If needed, put painter’s tape on the bottom of the saw’s housing so it doesn’t scratch the plexiglass as it moves. [10] X Research source For the cleanest cut, make sure the blade doesn’t overheat. Saw slowly and take breaks or water-cool the blade. Otherwise, the acrylic is more likely to chip or crack. Pro tip: Using a table saw is a great way to cut multiple acrylic sheets at once."

      "title": "Use a jigsaw, rotary tool, coping saw, or band saw.",
      "content": "Use a jigsaw, rotary tool, coping saw, or band saw. All of these tools are powerful enough to cut through acrylic sheets, but give you the control and finesse to cut curved or intricate lines. Like with a table or circular saw, use a blade that’s meant for acrylic or thin metal (a high tooth count with evenly spaced teeth of uniform height). Jigsaws and rotary tools are handheld electric saws that allow you to easily follow curved or straight lines. A coping saw is a handheld manual saw that’s great for intricate lines. A bandsaw is like a jigsaw, except stationary (you’ll have to push the plexiglass through the saw, similar to a table saw)."

      "title": "Mark your cut lines on the acrylic.",
      "content": "Mark your cut lines on the acrylic. Use a permanent marker to draw your curved lines (you can do this freehand or with a template—whichever works best for your project). Draw on top of the protective film if it’s a new acrylic sheet, or cover the areas you want to cut with painter’s tape and then draw your cut lines. Having a layer of tape prevents the surface of the acrylic from getting scratched and makes for a smoother cut. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the acrylic sheet on 2 beams so that the saw can cut through it. Place the beams as close together as you can while still giving yourself enough room to move the saw freely in as few, continuous cuts as you manage. If the beams are too far apart, the acrylic can bounce and vibrate from the saw’s action, making for messier cuts, chipping, or breaking. Clamp the sheet in place. For small designs, you could clamp the sheet to a work table and leave the portion you want to cut hanging off the edge slightly. [12] X Research source If you’re using a stationary band saw, you’ll be guiding the sheet through the saw by hand and don’t need to support it."

      "title": "Guide the saw from an outer edge of the sheet along the cut line.",
      "content": "Guide the saw from an outer edge of the sheet along the cut line. Keep your eye on the blade and cut line to stay on course. Try to make as few, continuous cuts as possible (the more you have to stop and reposition the saw blade, the less clean and precise your cut will be). If you get stuck at an angle, pull the jigsaw out the way you came, and cut from the other edge. [13] X Research source If you’re using a band saw, guide the sheet through the saw at a consistent rate and rotate it as you push to follow your curved lines. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "File down any sharp burrs with a metal file . Check for any large chunks that the saw or scoring method left behind on the edge. Use a metal file to smooth them out so they are even with the edge you cut. When it comes to filing and smoothing, you’ll start with your roughest tools to take care of the biggest and sharpest burrs. Then, you’ll gradually use finer tools for an ultra-smooth finish."

      "content": "Wet sand with 120-grit sandpaper, then repeat with gradually finer sandpaper. With the sandpaper on a sanding block, apply water to the sandpaper. Use enough to get the sandpaper thoroughly wet. Then, sand down the edge of your acrylic. Move to finer and finer sandpaper to refine the edge, ending up with 600-grit sandpaper. [15] X Research source Us a sandpaper variety pack with a range of fine grits for the most flexibility."

      "title": "Buff the edge.",
      "content": "Buff the edge. Attach a buffing edge to an electric drill. Rub the buffer with a polishing compound , and then buff down the edge until it is smooth and shiny. This step really refines the edge, but it is not absolutely necessary. [16] X Research source If you don't have a buffing edge, you can stop with fine sandpaper."
