      "content": "Curl your hair. Pin curls and victory rolls were a popular look for most pin-up girls. Curls were often achieved by a “permanent” which made hair easier to mold into a curl, but you can achieve this look without chemicals. To get pin curls: dab gel onto the root of a small section of damp hair, then twirl that section of hair around your finger until you get to your scalp. (You can twirl in whatever direction you’d like the curls to flow.) Slide your finger out of the curl and pin the curl to your head. Repeat for your entire head of hair, allow hair to dry, then remove pins, and voila! You can find many authentic vintage ways to style your pin curls online. There are also books that show you how to do these hairstyles. You can also use hot rollers or a curling iron to create curls, although it will take some practice to get the right look."

Apply a vanilla or champagne colored eye-shadow to the entire upper eyelid, [3] X Research source then contour with a darker neutral color, and blend. [4] X Research source Next, use black liquid eyeliner, making sure the eyeliner wings out at the corners of your eye. This is called the “Cat Eye” or “Bedroom Eyes.” Allow eyeliner to dry and then apply at least 2 coats of a good lengthening and thickening mascara. It's a good idea to practice this look a lot before actually using it formally. For extra points, try applying false eyelashes before applying your mascara. This can be tricky but well worth the effort."

      "content": "Shop vintage and secondhand stores. Look for genuine vintage items from this era, including pencil skirts, A-line skirts, Cuban heeled stockings, round toed pumps, wiggle dresses, swing dresses, petticoats, 3/4 sleeve cardigans, cropped cardigans with full sleeves, and high waist capri pants, to name a few. If you don’t live near any good vintage stores, you can search for vintage goods online. You can also buy vintage reproduction clothing online from numerous companies such as Bettie Page Clothing and Stop Staring! True vintage clothing was produced in the era you are trying to portray, whereas retro clothing looks like it’s from that era but was made more recently. Retro is a copy of the real thing produced in mass market, whereas vintage is the real thing. If your clothing was made before the eighties, check for the “Made in the USA” seal or whatever country you are situated in. On the tag there should be a union name and ID number. A tag that says “Made in China” is a sign that the article of clothing is not vintage. Clothing made of linen, cotton, and other natural fabrics are more likely to be genuine vintage items. Instead of buying clothes, you could invest in fabrics with vintage patterns and make your own clothes. This will require time and some level of skill, however, and so is better left to those with experience in sewing."
