In order to make the impossible possible, you will need a concrete goal, and a plan to complete it. Choose an actionable, concrete goal that you can put into a sentence. Then break that goal into smaller sub-goals. For instance, you might want to scale Mt. Everest, lose 100 lbs., or buy a house. For these goals, sub-goals might include: raising (or saving) money, finding a personal trainer, or applying for a mortgage. For a big goal, you will probably have at least five sub-goals. Set deadlines for each of your sub-goals."

If a major obstacle is time, brainstorm ways to carve out some free moments. Maybe you could rearrange your work hours, wake up earlier, or spend less time on the internet. If a major obstacle is fear (such as a fear of heights), brainstorm ways that you could overcome your fear slowly. You might begin by standing on a ladder or climbing a hill.

There are two basic types of reinforcement: Positive reinforcement: This involves rewarding yourself for a job well done. For instance, you might treat yourself to something (like a dessert or a new pair of jeans) you want for achieving a specific sub-goal. Negative reinforcement: This involves taking something away. For instance, you might deny yourself TV over the weekend if you fail you fail to meet your goals that week."
