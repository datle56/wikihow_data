Exfoliative cheilitis can be linked to serious medical issues, such as a vitamin deficiency, immunosuppression, or your body’s inability to efficiently process toxins. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Therefore, if minimizing toxin exposure and maintaining a healthy diet do not reduce the symptoms, then it may be necessary to see a doctor to rule out other causes. Medical professionals have used a variety of medications to treat this condition. Remember that the cause of exfoliative cheilitis is unknown, so medical treatments may vary depending on the practitioner. One study found that the use of Topical Calendula officinalis ointment (10%) was very effective. Other treatments, such as topical steroids, antibiotics, keratolytic agents, sunscreen, and antifungals may have less of an effect. Make sure to discuss these options with your doctor. Your doctor may suggest using lip balms and other emollient products to help soothe your symptoms, but keep in mind that exfoliative cheilitis is resistant to emollients, so they may not provide much help."
