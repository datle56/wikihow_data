This could be a low skill job like waitressing, bartending, or working as a service employee in retail. You could also take on side opportunities that relate to your full time job. If you are a teacher, for example, you may earn more money on the side by taking open subbing positions or teaching an extra class at a community college nearby. If you are planning on earning part time cash by waitressing or bartending, you will likely need to get your ProServe license before you can get hired by an employer at a bar or restaurant. Most ProServe certifications can be done online for $25-$30 through your state's Preserve program."

Another option is to pay yourself first before you pay your bills. This means putting your paycheck into your savings account and then making recurring weekly payments to your checking account to pay for bills and expenses.

This can help you save for retirement and be smart about your savings. [4] X Research source"
