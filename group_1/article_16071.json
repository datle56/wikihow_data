      "title": "Illness is typically considered the most valid reason to miss practice.",
      "content": "Illness is typically considered the most valid reason to miss practice. Whether it’s Covid, the flu, or a common cold, being sick is the best excuse because it’s so unpredictable. Most coaches won’t ask for too many details, but if they do, mention a few symptoms that could quickly spread to other players—a cough, runny nose, or any Covid-related symptoms are a legitimate reason to stay home. “I woke up with a sore throat and fever, so I won’t be able to make it to practice.” “I’ve got a terrible cough and runny nose, so I’m going to miss practice. I don’t want to get the rest of the team sick.” “My friend just texted me that he got Covid, and I was with him all day yesterday. I also woke up with a mild sore throat, so I’m going to skip practice to get tested.”"

      "content": "Injuries are a universal struggle that all athletes understand. Strains, sprains, and swelling are common in an athlete’s life, and putting stress on an injury can make it worse—and possibly put you on the bench all season. Fake an injury that interferes with your sport, like a pulled muscle or shin splint. If your coach still asks you to participate in the non-physical parts of practice, tell them that it’s too painful to move or get into a car. “I think I might have just twisted my ankle. I need to miss practice to go to the doctor.” “I was at the gym this morning, and I hurt my back lifting. I’m going to have to skip practice.” “I hurt myself on a run last night, and my knee is starting to swell. I’m going to skip practice so it doesn’t get any worse.”"

      "title": "Food poisoning is unpredictable, so it’s the perfect last-minute excuse.",
      "content": "Food poisoning is unpredictable, so it’s the perfect last-minute excuse. Bad food reactions can happen at any time, and the symptoms usually range from bad to horrific. Your coach will likely understand if you tell them you keep throwing up or running to the toilet every ten minutes. Plus, you don’t have to provide proof that you’re sick! Many people recover from food poisoning at home by staying hydrated, eating bland foods, and resting. “I’ve been throwing up all night because of food poisoning, so there’s no way I can make it to practice.” “I think I’ve caught a really bad stomach bug or a case of food poisoning. I can’t keep anything down, so I’m going to have to miss practice.” “I ate some seafood last night, and I think I contracted food poisoning. I can’t even hold water down, so I’m going to be resting at home until tomorrow.”"

      "title": "Period pain is a legitimate excuse that most coaches won’t question.",
      "content": "Period pain is a legitimate excuse that most coaches won’t question. If you just don’t feel like heading to practice, use your period to get away with being lazy. People will do almost anything to avoid talking about menstruation, so the second you mention cramps or bleeding, you’re good to go. This excuse is especially effective if your coach is male, but female coaches will also understand the painful symptoms you might be experiencing. [1] X Research source “I just got my period and can barely move out of bed. I’m going to have to miss practice.” “I’m having the worst menstrual cramps of my life. I’m sorry, but I have to skip practice.” “I have endometriosis, so I’m having the most terrible menstrual cramps today. I don’t think I’ll feel better before practice, so I wanted to let you know that I won’t be attending.”"

      "title": "Athletes prioritize their health, so your coach won’t push back too hard.",
      "content": "Athletes prioritize their health, so your coach won’t push back too hard. This is a cliché excuse that works when used sparingly, and most coaches won’t press for details because medical information is personal. Whether it’s a dentist appointment or routine check-up, tell your coach that you need to miss practice because there weren’t any available times within the next few months. [2] X Research source “I’ve been having some issues with my vision and had to make a last-minute appointment to get it checked out. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to miss practice tomorrow.” “I’m sorry for the late notice, but I’ve been trying to schedule an appointment for weeks and a slot just opened up for tomorrow. I won't be able to attend practice.” “I got a call that my doctor is going to be out of the office for a while because of an emergency, so I had to reschedule my appointment for tomorrow. I’ll have to skip practice.”"

      "title": "Family emergencies are effective because they don’t require much detail.",
      "content": "Family emergencies are effective because they don’t require much detail. Most coaches won’t question this excuse because it’s considered highly sensitive and personal. However, you might want to come up with a brief story in case you get questioned later on. Family emergency excuses include injuries, car accidents, travel assistance, and mental health crises, so choose one that isn’t too serious to sound believable. “There’s been an unexpected emergency in my family, so I won’t be attending practice.” “I’m sorry for the late notice, but I have to pick up a family member from the hospital during practice.” “My mom fell this morning and has to go into emergency surgery. I need to be at the hospital with her, so I won’t be attending practice today.”"

      "title": "A family event is an acceptable reason to miss practice occasionally.",
      "content": "A family event is an acceptable reason to miss practice occasionally. The idea of a team revolves around family, so most coaches will understand if you need to prioritize your actual family from time to time. Use a rare or milestone event to avoid pushback, but if you need to get out of practice at the last minute, say that you have unexpected visitors to explain why you couldn’t inform your coach in advance. “My sister is having her rehearsal dinner next Friday, so I won’t be able to attend practice.” “My grandma is turning 90, so my family is having a huge gathering on Thursday. I won’t be able to attend practice.” “I’m sorry for the late notice, but I’ll be missing practice today. My family just flew in from Japan without notice, and I need to spend time with them before they leave.”"

      "title": "Maintaining your grades is an effortless excuse to skip practice.",
      "content": "Maintaining your grades is an effortless excuse to skip practice. Both college and high school athletes must maintain a certain GPA to be able to participate in sports, so many coaches stress the importance of school before the beginning of the season. [3] X Research source While homework isn’t considered an acceptable reason to skip, mandatory assignments are much more difficult to dismiss, especially near the end of the semester. “I have to retake a test after school, so I’ll be missing practice on Thursday.” “My final project is a presentation, and the only time that works with the rest of my schedule is Wednesday night. I’ll have to skip practice then.” “I have a group project that’s worth over 30% of my final grade, and the only time my group can meet is during practice. I’m sorry, coach. I’m going to miss practice.”"

      "title": "Place the blame on a family member who won’t get punished.",
      "content": "Place the blame on a family member who won’t get punished. When in doubt, find a scapegoat that won’t face the wrath of your coach. Parents, younger siblings, and older family members are great options, especially if they don’t speak English. Depending on your relationship with your coach, you can be as elaborate or vague as possible, but be sure to let them know before practice so you seem accountable. “My mom had to go to work early, so I couldn’t catch a ride to practice.” “My dad has a DMV appointment today, and I need to be there with him because he doesn’t speak English. I’ll need to miss practice this afternoon.” “My parents had to leave town due to a family emergency, so I have to stay at home and watch my younger brother. I’m sorry, but I’m going to miss practice tonight.”"

      "title": "Pets are the perfect reason to miss practice without proof.",
      "content": "Pets are the perfect reason to miss practice without proof. If your coach requires a doctor’s note to prove that you’re sick, have your pet take the fall for you. Most people think of their pets as family members, so you’ll probably be able to skip practice without raising too many eyebrows. [4] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source Just let your coach know that your parents are working or out of town, and there’s no one who can watch your furry baby. “My dog just got attacked by another dog at the park, so I have to take him to the hospital.” “My dog ate something outside and is now very sick. I need to skip practice to watch him while my parents are at work.” “My cat hasn’t been eating anything for the past few days, so I had to make a last-minute vet appointment during practice.”"

      "title": "Bad weather conditions can impact traffic and disrupt practice itself.",
      "content": "Bad weather conditions can impact traffic and disrupt practice itself. While you can’t pull out this excuse on any given day, it is a valid reason if there’s a big storm or weather warning in your area. If you live in a far-off location from where you practice, feel free to exaggerate the conditions, or tell your coach that your parents aren't willing to drive you to practice because they don’t want to get stuck in the storm. “The creek beside my house got flooded, so it’s impossible to get out of my neighborhood.” “I got a tornado warning on my phone, so my mom isn’t comfortable driving me to practice.” “The roads look pretty icy from last night’s weather, and my dad doesn’t want to risk getting into a car accident. I’m sorry, but I can’t make it to practice today.”"

      "title": "Car troubles are a legitimate reason to miss (or arrive late) to practice.",
      "content": "Car troubles are a legitimate reason to miss (or arrive late) to practice. Some coaches may ask you to hitch a ride with another teammate, so use this excuse near the end of practice to avoid disrupting your plans. If your coach asks why you couldn’t let them know earlier, tell them your phone died or you didn’t have reception. Or, say that your car stopped in the middle of the road, and you were left in a panic—practice was the last thing on your mind. “I can’t get my car to start, so I won’t be able to make it to practice until I figure out the problem.” “I’m so sorry for the late notice, but my car stopped when I was driving to practice. I would have informed you earlier, but I was extremely stressed.” “I was driving and got a flat tire, which is why I missed practice. I would’ve called someone to pick me up, but my phone died.”"

      "content": "This is a good excuse if you’re planning to play sports in college. If you’re currently in high school, tell your coach that you’re going on a campus tour if you’re going out of town. Your coach will be extra supportive if you want to play professionally, but be sure to wear some collegiate merchandise when you return to school to make your excuse more believable. [5] X Research source “I’m going to visit UT on Monday, so I won’t be able to attend practice.” “I’m visiting Stanford next Friday, so I’m going to miss practice.” “I’m taking a tour of Auburn next week, so I won’t be attending practice on Thursday.”"

      "title": "Religious holidays are a valid excuse if you tell your coach in advance.",
      "content": "Religious holidays are a valid excuse if you tell your coach in advance. Look at your calendar to see if there are any upcoming holidays, and mention you need to miss practice at least one week earlier. To avoid raising any suspicion, try to choose a holiday that aligns with your faith. [6] X Research source “I’ll be skipping practice next Friday in observance of Diwali.” “I will be missing practice next Friday to observe Good Friday.” “I won’t be able to attend practice next week in observance of Yom Kippur.”"
