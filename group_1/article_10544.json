      "title": "Assess the rod to ensure the end is suitable for threads.",
      "content": "Assess the rod to ensure the end is suitable for threads. The end of the rod that will be receiving threads should be smaller than the normal diameter of the rod. The optimal diameter would be 0.005 inches to 0.010 inches less than the normal diameter of the rod. If diameter at the end to be threaded is greater than the optimal diameter, either sandpaper or a file may be used to bring the rod end to the optimal diameter. One easy way to accomplish a fast and even reduction in diameter is to put the rod into a drill motor to rapidly rotate the rod while removing material. Clamp a file in a bench vice such that the rounded portion of the rod can contact the file. Continually drive the drill motor and check the diameter intermittently as filing. If the diameter becomes less than the optimal range, efficacy will be reduced or it may become unusable."

      "content": "Begin cutting threads into the rod. Ensure the die is perpendicular to the rod and force is applied downward while rotating the die. Turn stock in direction of desired thread. Turn stock 1 full turn, then back off 1/2 turn to break off chips. If possible, use pressurized air to blow out the chips every turn. As the die becomes hard to turn, apply more lubricant through the middle of the die to the rod."
