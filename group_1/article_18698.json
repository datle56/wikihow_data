To keep your skin happy and healthy, wash your face in the morning and at night. It's especially important to wash it at night, as you're removing bacteria, dirt, makeup or skincare products, and other contaminants that may have built up on your skin throughout the day. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source It’s also important to wash your face any time you sweat, since sweating can irritate your skin and clog your pores. Unless you’ve been sweating or your face is especially dirty, try to stick to washing your face no more than twice a day. Excessive washing can irritate your skin. To avoid drying out and irritating your skin, wash with cool or lukewarm water and use your fingers to apply your cleanser. Always pat your face dry instead of rubbing it."

This will help you maintain a fresh and dewy glow, minimize fine lines, and prevent inflammation and breakouts. It's also a good idea to apply moisturizer before you put on makeup. Pick a moisturizer that’s free of dyes, perfumes, alcohol, and other harsh ingredients.

However, exfoliating too often can be hard on your skin, so don’t get too carried away. Try using a gentle exfoliating treatment 2-3 times a week, and reduce the frequency if you experience breakouts, dryness, or irritation. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you’re using any treatments for acne, talk to your doctor or dermatologist before trying exfoliation. It’s important to be gentle with your skin to avoid making any breakouts worse. Many dermatologists recommend chemical exfoliants, since these are gentler on your skin than scrubs or other mechanical exfoliants. If you have dry skin, try a lactic acid peel. For oily or acne-prone skin, a salicylic acid exfoliant may be helpful. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can also gently exfoliate by lightly rubbing your face with a soft washcloth and lukewarm water.

Headphones and cell phones can cause outbreaks, as can hats. If your shirt is too tight at the neck, you may develop acne there. Similarly, a backpack can put pressure on your back, causing an acne outbreak. As much as possible, avoid wearing clothes or using items that might rub or irritate your skin in acne-prone areas. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, try putting your phone on speaker instead of holding it up to your head. You can also reduce pressure and irritation around your face and ears by using earbuds instead of large headphones. If you tend to get breakouts on your neck, try wearing shirts with loose, breathable collars that don’t rub against your neck. Wearing a backpack can contribute to acne breakouts on your back, so try using a handheld bag or carrying items in your arms sometimes instead."
