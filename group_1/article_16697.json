      "content": "Find exposed stone. Coal blocks are found amongst stone blocks. Stone blocks can be found alongside mountains, cliff sides, in caves, or underground. Since Minecraft worlds are randomly generated, there is no way to say exactly where you will find coal blocks. You will need to search for them. However, they are pretty common and not too hard to find. If you are searching for coal in caves, be careful not to venture too deep inside the cave. Not only is it easy to get lost inside a cave, but caves also have lots of hostile mobs and other dangers. If you die in a cave, you will drop everything in your inventory. The only way to get it back is to go back inside the cave to where you died and pick everything up. You can nerdpole to get a good view of the landscape. This involves stacking lots of dirt blocks under your feet to raise your avatar high off the ground."

On PC, you do this by pressing the number on the keyboard that corresponds to the slot in your toolbar or use the mouse wheel to cycle through your toolbar items.
