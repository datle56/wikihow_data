If, after opening the image, you see that there is a padlock on the layer, simply double-click on the layer and hit \"Enter\" to unlock the layer."

If you can't find the Quick Selection tool, it should be the fourth button down from the toolbar, and you may have to click and hold on the \"Magic Wand\" to reveal it. For even more control: Hold either Alt or ⌥ Opt while clicking to remove parts of your selection. Use the two [ and ] keys to make your selection tool bigger or smaller, making it less or more precise. Switch to the Magic Want to quickly select all pixels of similar colors.

      "content": "Use tools to select what you want to silhouette. Use the Pen Tool (P) for the most exact outlines to make silhouettes. The Pen tool is, in many ways, Photoshop's most powerful tool, though it takes getting used to. Select it from the menu, or press P, then click to create little points around your outline. When you complete the entire selection, you'll have a \"Path,\" or solid line around your entire image. When done, simply right-click or control-click on the path and choose Make Selection . If you're working with a very curvy shape, try the \"Free Form Pen Tool,\" found by clicking and holding the Pen Tool in the toolbox. The pen tool is perfectly precise, but only if you know how to handle it. Take some time to experiment with it, especially with curves. It will trace the best shape for you, with practice. Alternatively, use the Magic Wand ( W ) tool to separate a simple 1-2 color background. For example, say you've got a woman standing against a mostly blue sky, and you want to silhouette her. Instead of selecting her, you can select the sky behind her, removing it from the layer. Simply use the Magic Wand to select the background, then delete it away to leave just the silhouetted object. Change the tolerance at the top bar to make the Wand more or less precise. A higher number (75-100) selected a wider range of colors, while a low tolerance (like 1-10) will only select very similarly colored pixels. [3] X Research source"
