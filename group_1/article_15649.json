      "content": "View your flaws as what makes you an individual. We’re all human, and we all have flaws, quirks, or oddities that sets us apart from others. Instead of viewing your flaws as bad things, reframe them into what makes you a unique person. [1] X Research source For instance, maybe you feel like you aren’t as good at math or history as your classmates are. However, that same quality might also mean that you’re great at art or are awesome at English. Or, maybe you have a birthmark or a beauty mark that you aren’t too fond of. However, that mark might make you stand out from a crowd and draw people toward you."

      "content": "Flaws make us human, so try to bond with others about them. Maybe you and your best friend are both super clumsy, or perhaps you meet someone else who has braces or headgear, too. When you admit to your flaws, you show your vulnerability, which makes people like you even more. [2] X Research source Plus, finding out that other people are flawed in the same way as you can help you feel less alone."

      "content": "Your quirks don’t need changing, while problems are something to work on. A quirk may be unusual, but it’s harmless. A problem is something that’s harmful to you or other people (physically or emotionally). You can embrace and see the upsides of your quirks without trying to change them. However, problems are something to work on. Examples of quirks: a big nose, gap teeth, fidgeting a lot, excitability, being obsessed with cats Examples of problems: a hot temper causing you to lash out, unhealthy eating habits, making rude jokes, unsafe driving habits"

      "content": "Avoiding perfectionism will help you stress less about your flaws. We are often our own worst critics, and we tend to hold ourselves to standards that we wouldn’t expect of other people. Think about the standards you set for yourself, and then think about if you’d hold a friend or loved one to the same standards. If you wouldn’t, then you don’t need to hold yourself to those standards either.

While it can be tough to do, try not to compare yourself to your peers or the people you see online. Everyone’s life path is different, and you don’t need to match someone else’s journey. Be grateful for what you do have, and think about how far you’ve come to make it where you are today. [8] X Research source It can be super tough to stop comparing yourself to others, especially on social media.

Oftentimes, our “flaws” are simply things we don’t like about ourselves; they aren’t necessarily bad things. Whenever you catch yourself thinking negatively about something, ask yourself questions like, “Is that really true?” or, “What evidence do I have to support that?” Then, reframe the thought to turn it into a positive. [11] X Research source For instance, maybe you think, “I’m too sensitive.” Reframe that by saying: “My sensitivity makes me caring, kind, and empathetic.” Maybe you think, “I’m so stubborn.” Turn that into a positive by saying, “I’m passionate about the things that I care about.”"
