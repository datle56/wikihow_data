      "title": "Acknowledge your feelings.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your feelings. If you feel resistant to change or uncomfortable with impending change, then it is important to acknowledge your feelings. Don’t avoid your emotions, listen to them. Emotions are part of self-awareness. When you acknowledge an emotion, you accept it as if to say, “this isn’t so bad” and allow yourself to understand it and manage it. [1] X Research source Often, change brings up feelings of anxiety such as worry and fear. It’s okay to feel worried and feel fear. Grieve and take care of your feelings. Even if the big change in your life is a happy one like getting married or moving to a place you always wanted to live, accept that there will be some emotional losses and work through them. Try to identify the feelings you are having and why by writing or saying them out loud. For example, you might write or say something like, “I am feeling anxious and overwhelmed because I have to move to a new city next week.”"

      "title": "Prepare yourself.",
      "content": "Prepare yourself. No matter what sort of change you are facing, you can take steps to prepare yourself for the new situation. Think about what your new situation will be and then identify some ways that you can learn more about what you will be facing. For example, if you plan to move to another city, state, or country, learn as much as you can about the new place before going. If you are starting a new job, find out as much as you can about what you will be doing. Try to create a plan for how you will approach the new situation. For example, if you are moving to a new city, you might ask: what restaurants do you want to check out? How will you get around the city? What other places would you like to explore? You can also make a plan to change your situation if it is not where you want to be in life. [2] X Research source For example, you might not like your new job, so you could create a plan to find a new one that you will enjoy by searching the job listings, applying for jobs that interest you, and attending job fairs."

      "title": "Create a mental script.",
      "content": "Create a mental script. If you are facing a life change that you cannot control, then it may be hard to accept the situation. However, you can work towards acceptance by reassuring yourself in the form of an accepting mental script. [3] X Research source For example, when you are feeling upset or anxious about the oncoming change, you might repeat to yourself, “I do not like the change that is happening, but it is beyond my power to control. I may not like this change, but I will accept it and try to make the best of it.”"

      "title": "Remind yourself that you control your attitude and actions.",
      "content": "Remind yourself that you control your attitude and actions. Change may turn your world upside down but you still have control over how you respond to the situation. You can choose to approach the situation with anger and take your feelings out on other people, or you can choose to see the situation as a new opportunity and approach it with excitement. Some people find list-making to be an effective way to reduce anxiety and feel happier. [4] X Research source If you are feeling miserable about the situation, try writing down a list of positives. For example, if you have just gone through a breakup, then you might identify the positives as things like more free time, a chance to get to know yourself better, and more time to spend with your friends and family."

Writing it down can help you realize that things are less negative than you imagine. If you feel overwhelmed by having a puppy and are having a difficult time adjusting to all the changes, write down what has changed in your life and what is difficult about it. Write down possible solutions to your issue, such as creating a schedule to help you manage the changes."

      "content": "Talk to others with similar experiences. It can be comforting to talk to someone who’s going through a similar change as you. Maybe you are starting college, having a baby, or changing careers. Talking to someone who’s “been there” can be comforting, knowing that he or she got through it okay. Ask for advice on what you can do to get through the change well. If you’re going through a divorce, meet with other people who are experiencing the same thing, or have already gone through it."

      "content": "Expect new patterns of living to take time. Change is a shock because it destabilizes the life you've made for yourself to this point. All habits and routines are up for questioning when change interferes, so going slowly and easing yourself into the new is an essential strategy for coping. Expect that any change will take time to adjust to; be realistic when enduring big life changes. [10] X Research source Give yourself time to recoup. For example, if you're grieving after a death, be it a person or a pet , acknowledge that how you grieve and how long you grieve for are decisions only you can make. Nobody else can rush you, no matter what they insist."

      "content": "See change as opportunity. Change is an opportunity to re-examine the life you've been leading to see whether you've been making positive choices or paying too much (time, money, effort) for leading a lifestyle that isn't bringing you happiness. Although sometimes painful, change can bring a silver lining. Learn to enjoy the process of change by creating positive reinforcements around change. [11] X Research source This can include treating yourself to ice cream after you finish physical therapy for your injury, or getting to spend a small amount of money each time you save up $100."

      "content": "Leave complaining and blaming behind you. When a change thrusts you into constant complaining and blaming, it can be understandable for a short period of time. Friends and family will rally at the beginning of a misfortune. It’s important to keep a positive outlook when in the midst of change to help decrease stress and cope with difficulties.

      "content": "Let go of what has happened and move on. Focusing on the past will not help you to move on with your life. It’s no use wanting your ‘old life’ back or spending all of your moments wishing things would go back to what they used to be. Instead of focusing on the past, anchor yourself in the future by creating excitement and things to look forward to doing. Try something that you’ve never done before like taking a painting class, going ice skating, or visiting a new city. If you still find yourself dwelling on the past and it is interfering with your life, then you may want to seek the help of a therapist to help you move forward in your life."
