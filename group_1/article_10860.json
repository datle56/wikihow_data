      "content": "Know what you want to do. [1] X Expert Source Jennifer Clark Life Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. The less clear you are about what you want to do, the less effective your plan will be. Try to specifically define what you want to achieve as early as possible — preferably before starting your project. Example: You are trying to complete your master’s thesis — basically a very long essay — which needs to be about 40,000 words. It will include an introduction, a literature review (in which you critically discuss other research that informs yours, and discuss your methodology), several chapters in which you put your ideas into practice using concrete examples, and a conclusion. You have 1 year to write it."

      "content": "Work backwards from your end goal. Identify your end goal, then list everything you need to do to accomplish it. Depending on your goal, you may even consider different ways to reach your goal. After you know what you need to accomplish, break this down into actionable steps to help you create a more realistic plan. Keep in mind that your plan may change as you work toward your goal, so stay flexible. Make sure that your goals are S.M.A.R.T. to ensure that your plan is effective: [2] X Research source Specific - Be clear about what you want to achieve. Measurable - You can break down the goal into measurable checkpoints. Attainable - You are capable of completing the steps necessary to reach the goal. Relevant - The goal makes sense for your life and purpose. Timely - You have the time to work toward your goal and are progressing on schedule."

      "title": "Be specific and realistic in your planning.",
      "content": "Be specific and realistic in your planning. Having a specific goal is just the beginning: you need to be specific and realistic in every aspect of your project — for example, by stating specific and achievable schedules, milestones, and final outcomes. Being specific and realistic while planning a long project is all about pro-actively reducing stress that can accompany poorly planned projects such as missed deadlines and exhausting long hours. Example: To finish your thesis on time, you need to write roughly 5,000 words per month, which will give you a couple of months at the end of your timeline to polish your ideas. Being realistic means not placing the expectation on yourself to write more than 5,000 words each month. If you’re working as a teaching assistant for three of those months, you’ll need to consider that you may not be able to complete 15,000 words in that time, and you’ll need to spread that amount out over your other months."

      "title": "Set measurable milestones.",
      "content": "Set measurable milestones. Milestones mark significant stages along the road to achieving your end goal. Create milestones easily by starting at the end (the accomplishment of the goal) and working your way backwards to your present day and circumstances. Having milestones can help you — and if applicable, your team — stay motivated by breaking the work into smaller chunks and tangible goals so that you don’t need to wait until the project is completely finished to feel as though you’ve accomplished something. Don’t leave too much time or too little time between milestones — spacing them two weeks apart has been found to be effective. [3] X Research source Example: When writing your thesis, resist the urge to set milestones based on chapter completions, as this could be a matter of months. Instead, set smaller milestones — perhaps based on word counts — every two weeks, and reward yourself when you hit them."

      "content": "Break large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Some tasks or milestones may seem more daunting to achieve than others. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a large task, you can help ease your anxiety and make it feel more doable by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Example: The lit review is often the most difficult chapter to write, as it forms the foundation of your thesis. In order to complete your lit review, you need to do a significant amount of research and analysis before you can even begin writing. You can break it into three smaller chunks: research, analysis, and writing. You can break it down even smaller by choosing specific articles and books that you need to read, and setting deadlines for analyzing them and writing about them."

      "content": "Make scheduled lists. Make a list of tasks that you need to complete in order to hit your milestones. A list on its own will not be effective — you must write this list into a timeline associated with specific, realistic actions. Example: By breaking your lit review into smaller chunks, you’ll know exactly what you need to get done, and can figure out a realistic timeframe for those tasks. Perhaps every one to two days you will have to read, analyze, and write about one key reading."

      "content": "Put timelines on everything. Without specific time frames and deadlines, work will definitely expand to fill the time allotted, and some tasks may never get completed. No matter what action items you choose for which phase of your action plan, it is essential that a time frame be attached to absolutely everything. Example: If you know that it takes you roughly 1 hour to read 2,000 words, and you’ll be reading a 10,000-word article, you need to give yourself at least 5 hours to complete that article. You’ll need to also account for at least 2 meals during that time, as well as short breaks every 1 to 2 hours for when your brain is feeling tired. In addition, you’ll want to add at least an hour onto your final number just to account for any possible unanticipated interruptions."

Studies have shown that physically writing things down (i.e. with pen and paper) will make you more likely to do them. [4] X Research source For this reason, you may be best off using a physical planner to plan your time out. Keeping a planner also helps you relieve stress and feel calmer because it makes it less likely that you'll ruminate on what needs to be done.

Just sit quietly and try to clear your mind.
