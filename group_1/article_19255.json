      "title": "Get some hair extensions for volume or length.",
      "content": "Get some hair extensions for volume or length. Try to get the longest extensions you can find—about 30 inches (76 centimeters). Make sure that they match your hair color, not Rapunzel's. Make sure that you are using the weft type extensions. You can skip the extensions if you have long and thick hair. A little extra volume won't hurt, however. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Clip the extensions in",
      "content": "Clip the extensions in . Use the handle of a rat-tail come to part your hair horizontally at about ear level. Twist and clip the top section out of the way, then clip in the longest weft to the back of your head, at an angle. Let down another layer of hair, and add another extension. Use this process to add more extension to the back and sides of your head. If you already have long hair, you don't have to use all of the extensions in the package. Use enough until you get the volume you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curl your hair",
      "content": "Curl your hair with a curling iron. A 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) curling iron will work the best for this, but you can also use a ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) one instead. Curl your hair away from your face. Start from the front and work your way to the back. You don't need to make your hair super curly; something between loose curls and tight waves would be ideal. [3] X Research source The curl will add some volume to your braid. You can also curl your hair using alternate methods, if you prefer. If your hair is already curly or wavy, you can skip this step. Always use a quality heat protectant before applying heat to your hair."

    {
      "title": "Gently comb the curls to fluff them out.",
      "content": "Gently comb the curls to fluff them out. Be very careful, especially if you added extensions. Comb the curls with your finger or a wide-toothed comb, and don't get too carried away. [4] X Research source Don't touch the curls too much because your hair will become frizzy."

      "content": "Start a regular, mini braid on the side of your head. Choose a side to start on: left or right. Gather the hair from in front of your ear, and split it into three strands. Cross the top and bottom strands under the middle one. This is just for the crown braid, which will eventually lead to the big braid. The big braid will come in the next section. If you are starting from the side that has more hair, keep your braid loose so that you don't lose the \"bump\" made by the part."

Here is how you do it: Gather a thin strand of hair and add it to the bottom strand. Cross the bottom strand under the middle strand. Cross the top strand under the middle strand; don't add anything to it. Do this two more times, then stop."

[9] X Research source Depending on the length of your hair, you may only be able to do this once or twice. Alternatively, you could use loose extensions to bulk up the braid.
