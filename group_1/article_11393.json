      "content": "Ask how he wants his hair cut. Before you start his cut, it’s important to find out how short he wants his hair, how uniformly he wants it cut, and how he plans to style it. Asking these essential questions will help you better understand what his desired look is, as well as avoid any potential misunderstandings. Start off by asking questions like, “This is the length you want, right?” [1] X Expert Source Yan Kandkhorov Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 28 January 2020. When cutting men's hair, section it into 7 parts: the top, left side, right side, back, left sideburn area, right sideburn area, and the fringe. This way, they can describe how much hair they want to be trimmed or buzzed from each section. As you cut the man's hair, periodically ask whether or not it's to his liking. Give him access to a mirror (wall-mounted or hand-held) where he can review the cut to ensure that you’re both on the same page."

      "content": "Choose a face-flattering haircut suitable to his hair volume. Work together to choose a cut and style that is appropriate for the hair volume he has. For example, a man with a full crown of hair might be interested in a pompadour, while a man with thinning or balding hair might prefer a buzzcut. [2] X Expert Source Yan Kandkhorov Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 28 January 2020. More dramatic hairstyles like quiffs and pompadours work best when a man has a fuller head of hair. More conservative hairstyles like an all-over trim or buzzcut are particularly flattering for men with thinning or balding hair."

      "content": "Give yourself plenty of time to execute the cut. Around 1-2 hours of uninterrupted time to execute the haircut should be perfect. It's important not to be in a hurry when cutting hair , especially if you have little experience. The less time you have, the less you’ll be able to dedicate your efforts to the task at hand."

      "content": "Set up your work area. Seat him in a sturdy chair, and ensure you can reach his head without straining. Cover his shoulders with a barber’s cape , bed sheet, or towel to keep the hair off of him and make cleaning up easier. Make sure to set up your work area on a surface that will be easy to clean afterward. Tile, wood, linoleum, and concrete are all great choices, whereas carpet will swallow clipped hair and make cleaning up difficult. Bathrooms, kitchens, and patios are ideal locations for haircutting."

      "content": "Start with clean hair. Shampoo the man's hair before you begin the cut. Starting with a clean base makes the cutting process easier, as you’ll be better able to tell where the hair falls naturally, free from oils or product build-up. Then, lightly towel the hair dry, so it’s still somewhat damp. [3] X Expert Source Yan Kandkhorov Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 28 January 2020."

      "content": "Detangle his hair by running a comb through it. Combing through his hair will give you a good idea of where it needs to be cut. Then, comb his hair in his desired style: some men prefer a side part on the right or left side of their head, whereas other men prefer a middle part. Comb the hair from bottom to top to make detangling easier."

      "title": "Choose a clipper attachment.",
      "content": "Choose a clipper attachment. Use your clippers to trim the back and sides of the head to tidy up excess hair or even to buzz the entire head for a uniform finish. Electric clippers come with blade-guard attachments that determine the length of the hair that gets cut. The longer the clipper attachment, the less hair gets cut. Many men have a preference for what guard you use, so it’s a good idea to ask him if there’s one he prefers—most clipper sets come with 6 guides. [4] X Research source Use a 6 to keep the hair on the longer side. Use a 3 or 4 for a standard cut. Use a 2 for a close cut and a 1 for a \"buzz cut.\" The lower the guide number, the shorter his hair will be."

Round the clippers up and out to finish that cut. Work around to the sides, cutting upward and against the direction the hair is growing.

Turn the clippers upside-down, press the blades perpendicular to the head, and cut downwards. Have the man look downwards to get a close cut, then have him look straight ahead to ensure it’s even. [6] X Research source If the man has a longer tail of hair at the nape of the neck, be sure to clip that off too."

Pinch the hair between your index and middle finger, and slide your fingers up or down to the length you want. Leave the hair below your fingers on his head, and trim the hair above your fingers away. Snip the hair at a 45-degree angle with haircutting scissors so it won’t look blunt or uneven. [9] X Research source Cut perpendicular to the hair’s direction for a clean cut. For example, if his hair points downwards, towards the back of the neck (vertical), cut horizontally across the back of his head. Don't cut one big clip with the whole scissor blade. Instead, use the tips of the scissor blades to cut the hair in short spurts. If you're nervous, just cut a bit at a time. You can always cut more if you need to."

[12] X Expert Source Yan Kandkhorov Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 28 January 2020. Be sure to step back periodically while cutting his bangs to check how the overall haircut looks. Remember that you can cut more hair off but can't add it back on, so be sure you know exactly where you're cutting. Make sure that the bangs are damp and take drying into account. After spritzing the bangs with a spray bottle, keep in mind that curly hair can shrink up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) when it dries, and straight hair can shrink as much as 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm), so don’t overcut."

Use your scissors to trim the hair that pokes out of the comb, blending, or fading, the harsh line that separates the clipper cut from the scissor cut—this is called the shear-over-comb technique. Repeat this technique all the way around the head for an even, well-blended finish.

Trim his sideburns, stepping back occasionally to look at him head-on to make sure they’re even. Start at the top and work the clippers downward, so you don’t clip too high. If he asks you to trim his beard , use the clippers to shave or clean up the hair below his sideburns. If you are shaving , use a razor (for a close shave) or clippers without any attachment (for a rough shave). If you’re cleaning up the beard, ask him how short he'd like it, and choose a clipper attachment accordingly. You can also use scissors to snip away the longest hairs of his beard for a uniform finish."

If you’re feeling extra fancy, you could blow dry his hair to add volume and eliminate those pesky hair particles once and for all.
