[13] X Research source A viral sore throat is usually accompanied by cold symptoms. Look for things like a cough, runny nose, or general sinus congestion. Bacterial throat infections show different signs. They often come on very suddenly and are more likely to affect children. Strep throat is frequently described as a severe sore throat, and the symptoms last for longer than a viral throat infection. Swallowing may be hard. The tonsils and back of the throat can also look very red and swollen, while streaks of pus or red spots occur on the roof of the mouth. Other symptoms include fever, headache, nausea, and swollen lymph nodes. Visit your doctor to get tested. Strep throat is very contagious and can pass through the air and close contact. If untreated, it can lead to ear infections, Scarlet fever, Rheumatic fever, blood poisoning, kidney disease, and bone infections. See a doctor right away if you suspect you or a child has strep throat."
