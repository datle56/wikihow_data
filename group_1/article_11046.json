      "content": "Snack on bland, fast-digesting carbs like toast or crackers. Eating is probably the last thing you want to do right now, but it is one of the best ways to help relieve nausea. Try nibbling on a little bit of dry toast or plain crackers. Continue eating little snacks until you feel well enough to have a meal.

      "content": "Drink plenty of fluids. Dehydration is one of the main causes of a hangover, so replenishing your fluids will help you feel better faster. Sip a full glass of water as soon as you wake up to start rehydrating. As your stomach begins to settle, feel free to add fluids like fruit juice, vegetable juice, soup broth, or sports drinks to replace lost salt, potassium, and electrolytes. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Electrolyte-replacing products like Pedialyte are usually in liquid form, but you can also find freezer-pops and other options. Avoid drinking more alcohol to ease your symptoms. The \"hair of the dog\" remedy is a myth and will probably make you feel even worse. Skip soda and other high-sugar drinks while you're nauseous since they can make you feel worse.

      "content": "Eat a banana or make a fruit smoothie. Bananas are bland, easy to eat, and replace lost potassium in your body.

Liquids are a lot easier on the stomach when you're feeling nauseous, and the fruits can help replace fluids and nutrients.

      "content": "Limit yourself to 1 cup of coffee (if you must have it). Coffee has long been considered a hangover cure, but this advice is misguided. A cup of coffee can help wake you up and ease a pounding head, but coffee can also aggravate your stomach. If you're a daily coffee drinker, try just having just 1 small cup. If you don’t usually drink coffee, it's better to avoid it completely when you have hangover nausea. [7] X Research source If you suffer from acid reflux, avoid coffee altogether when you're hungover. Caffeine can make your acid reflux worse. [8] X Research source"
