      "content": "Remind yourself that one bad grade won't break your academic career. Your academic career is made up of lots of different tests, not just the tests you take in class or the presentations that you give. Your academic career depends on the relationships you make with your teachers; the impact that you make on other friends; and most importantly, the stuff you learn . Judging the success of your academic career by only looking at a single grade is like judging the success of a party after only a single guest has arrived. It's not an accurate guess."

      "content": "Just to make sure, go over the test and recalculate your points. Make sure the teacher didn't make a mistake in counting the points or arriving at a grade. Remember, even math teachers make counting mistakes! If you do happen to find a mistake, double check that it's actually a mistake and then find a time when you can talk to your teacher. Instead of accusing them of making a mistake — \"You made a mistake on my test, I want my grade changed immediately!\" — try to be more understanding. Remember that you get more bees with honey than you do with vinegar. Try something like: \"I noticed that the numbers don't add up here. Am I missing something?\""

      "content": "Carefully figure out what grades other classmates received. You probably won't feel bad about getting a C or a D if everyone else in the class got a C, because C was the benchmark. Still, be careful about finding out other people's grades — they may not want to share, or they may want to know yours in exchange. If your teacher grades \" on the curve \", the grade that you get will take into account the grades everyone else got. So if the highest grade on a test was a C, then a C might become an A and a D might become a B-."

      "content": "Let your panic pass quickly. When we get a bad grade and we're not used to it, we panic. We think we've lost our smarts, our focus, our mojo. But that's just not the case most of the time. Everyone can slip up from time to time. In fact, it's the mistakes we make in life that really teach us who we are and how to do even better the next time. Don't panic because panicking will cause stress, and stress doesn't make for good grades. One recent study found that students who stressed over big exams actually did worse than those who stay calm.

So if you go up to a teacher after a bad grade and say something like \"Hi Ms. Kowalski, I'm not happy with my performance on the test. Could we go over the problems that I missed or talk about preparing better in the future,\" they just might faint with satisfaction. Even though it's really hard to do, a lot of good can come from meeting with your teacher: The teacher will explain problems you missed or ideas you struggle with The teacher will see that you want to learn and may factor this into your final grade The teacher may give you extra credit work"

It feels good to help other people, which is why many students who ace tests offer to help out students who didn't. Just be sure to actually spend time studying and working on improving instead of goofing off. And remember to try to choose someone you're not attracted to or have a secret crush on — we all know how much \"studying\" gets done when you're in the same room as a total man-hunk or she-angel."

      "content": "Consider telling your parents that you got a bad grade. Although you may not have to tell your parents, it may very well be a good idea. Your parents care about you succeeding. That's why they show concern over a bad grade — not because they want you to feel bad. Remembering this will help you open up and hopefully make getting help a lot easier. Your parents may sit down and explain to you what you got wrong; they may hire a private instructor or tutor to help you out; they may schedule a meeting with your teacher (even though this is unusual after just one bad grade) in order to learn how you could improve."

Studies have shown that writing with a pen and paper actually enhances your memory over simply typing the same out on a computer. [5] X Research source That's because the act of writing out letters and numbers with a pen activates motor memory in your brain. Increased motor memory means increased overall memory of whatever it was that you put down in your notes."
