      "title": "Apply bleach to the roots again.",
      "content": "Apply bleach to the roots again. This step is only necessary if your orange roots are significantly darker than the rest of your hair. With each application of bleach, your hair is lifted three or four shades lighter. If your roots were very dark to begin with and the rest of your hair is very light, you may need to apply bleach for a second time in order to get it light enough. [1] X Research source Many websites mistakenly suggest first toning orange hair. Toner will only work for hair that is already the desired lightness, but simply has hints of orange or yellow. It will not fix dark orange hair."

      "title": "Rinse.",
      "content": "Rinse. After the bleach has been on your roots for the time specified on the packaging, rinse your hair thoroughly. After a second round of bleach, your hair may still be orange, but it should be lighter. If you’re satisfied with the lightness of your roots, you can move on to the next step. If your roots are now a yellow color and the rest of your hair is light blonde, you should be all done bleaching. If your roots are still slightly orange and the rest of your hair is a darker blonde, you’re all set. The trick is to bleach your hair to light yellows in order to achieve light blondes, and darker yellows and oranges are great bases for dark blondes."

      "title": "Use a toner.",
      "content": "Use a toner. You can find toner at beauty supply stores. If you aren’t sure which toner you need, you can always ask someone who works there. As stated before, a toner will not magically turn your hair from dark orange to a platinum blonde, because it will not lighten your hair at all. It will, however, remove the orange or yellow notes from hair while keeping it at the same lightness level."

      "title": "Purchase a hair dye.",
      "content": "Purchase a hair dye. Once you’ve bleached your roots and they’re the right lightness, you’re ready to apply a demi or semi-permanent dye. In other words, your roots may still be orange, but another application of bleach would make them much lighter than the rest of your hair. [2] X Research source Buy a hair dye that is lighter than your hair. For example, if your hair is a dark blonde and you don’t want it any darker, buy a shade of hair dye in a platinum blonde. Because the hair dye will layer over your dark blonde, applying a matching shade of dark blonde hair dye will darken it up. A lighter shade of blonde will keep your hair light and bright, but help mask the orange."

      "title": "Follow the instructions on the package.",
      "content": "Follow the instructions on the package. Make sure that you evenly coat your roots so that all orange and yellow sections are saturated. Because the demi-permanent color doesn’t have bleach, it’s not a big deal if it touches the rest of your hair, but try to keep it only on your roots. [3] X Research source Leave on for the amount of time specified on the package. Check your roots before rinsing¬– if you can still see hints of orange or yellow, you can keep the dye on for a bit longer."

      "title": "Rinse your hair.",
      "content": "Rinse your hair. The bleach should have gotten your orange roots down to the desired lightness, the toner should have removed some of the brassiness, and the demi-permanent hair color should have masked any remaining bits of orange. It can be really hard to bleach your hair on your own, so this process may take some practice. With a little bit of experimentation, you won’t even break a sweat at the sight of bright orange roots."
