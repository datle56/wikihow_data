      "title": "Stretch the balloon to get it ready for inflation.",
      "content": "Stretch the balloon to get it ready for inflation. Before filling your balloon, give it a tug to prepare it. Stretching the balloon will soften the rubber and help it inflate more easily. Don’t get rough with the balloon. You just want to get it ready so it's less likely to pop when you fill it. If you're in a rush, you can skip to filling the balloon with water. Just be sure to keep the water pressure low so it doesn't fill too quickly."

      "title": "Attach the balloon's opening to a faucet or hose.",
      "content": "Attach the balloon's opening to a faucet or hose. Carefully slide the balloon's opening over your water source. If you have a narrow nozzle or aplastic funnel, attach the balloon to this instead. [1] X Research source Be extra careful when attaching and removing the balloon so as not to tear it."

      "title": "Turn on the water and keep the pressure low.",
      "content": "Turn on the water and keep the pressure low. If you turn the water on full blast, the balloon might fill up too quickly and pop. Fill the balloon until it's about 90 percent full. That way, you'll have enough room to tie the end. [2] X Research source While you shouldn't overfill the balloon, make sure the rubber has spread and become thin. If you don't fill it enough, it won't pop when you throw it."

Pinch the end so water doesn't spill out, then pull it in a loop around your fingers. To make a knot, slide the tip through the loop you made, then pull it tight. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for balloons that come with a hose nozzle.",
      "content": "Look for balloons that come with a hose nozzle. Water balloon packages often include nozzle attachments that twist onto threaded hoses and faucets. Don’t underestimate the nozzle’s importance! Using a nozzle or other narrow tool is the key to filling up a water balloon. [4] X Research source Filling a balloon by sliding its opening over a metal faucet is risky. Even if the opening fits over the faucet, there’s a good chance the metal will shred it when you try to remove the balloon."

      "title": "Attach the nozzle, then slide a balloon onto it.",
      "content": "Attach the nozzle, then slide a balloon onto it. Screw the nozzle onto your hose or faucet, then carefully slide a balloon’s opening over it. If the nozzle came with your package, it’s probably just the right size for your balloons. The balloon's opening should fit snugly and slide just enough up the nozzle’s length to allow for proper filling. [5] X Research source If you slide a balloon too far up a nozzle or other tool, there won’t be enough room to fill it."

      "content": "Turn on the water and fill the balloon about 90 percent. Keep the water pressure low so you can turn it off before the balloon pops. The balloon will be ready when the rubber starts to stretch and it’s about 90 percent full. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn off the water, remove the balloon, then tie it. Don’t overfill the balloon, and make sure you leave enough room at the end to tie it. When it’s ready, turn the water off and slide the balloon off of the nozzle. To tie it, pull the opening in a loop around your thumb and index finger, then slide the end of the opening through the loop. [7] X Research source If necessary, let off a little water so you have room to tie the end."

      "content": "Store the balloons in a bin filled with water. Fill a plastic bin large enough to hold your balloons about one-third with water. Place each balloon into the bin as you finish them. Storing the balloons in a water-filled bin will help cushion them and prevent accidental popping. If you’d like, keep a few ice packs in the bin to keep the water balloons cold. There’s nothing like a splash of chilly water on a hot day!"

      "title": "Use a funnel if you don’t have a nozzle.",
      "content": "Use a funnel if you don’t have a nozzle. Don’t worry if you’re stocked with balloons but are missing a faucet nozzle. Look around the house for a medium-sized plastic funnel or buy one from a grocery, department, or hardware store. If the funnel is used for food, wash it thoroughly after using it to fill your balloons. Avoid using a funnel that’s used to pour automotive fluids or other dangerous chemicals."

      "content": "Stretch a balloon, then slide its opening over the funnel’s tip. Give your balloons a little stretch to prepare them for filling. The balloon should fit snugly over the funnel, but don’t slide the opening more than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) up the tip. Take care not to snag the balloon opening on the funnel’s tip."

      "content": "Pour water into the funnel’s opening. Turn on the faucet, then hold the funnel under the stream of water. Keep the water pressure low so you don’t overfill the balloon. One advantage of funnels is that they’re great for both indoor and outdoor filling. Nozzles typically screw onto threaded outdoor faucets and hoses, so you can't use them on indoor faucets that don't fit or aren't threaded."

      "title": "Purchase a tank sprayer and fill it with water.",
      "content": "Purchase a tank sprayer and fill it with water. You can find inexpensive tank sprayers online or at department and hardware stores for under $10 (USD). Fill it up at home, then use it to blow up balloons at another location. In addition to being portable, a tank’s spray nozzle is perfect for filling water balloons. They come in multiple sizes; a 1 gallon (3.8 L) tank makes about a dozen balloons. Water balloons can be tough to transport. If you need to bring some to a park or other location without a water source, filling up balloons on-site will prevent accidental popping during during a car ride."

Bring them along to the park so you can refill the tank and make more balloons. Use the water in the tank to make one batch of balloons, then refill the tank with the jugs and make additional batches."
