You might also see the error message \"NET::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET\" or phrasing like, \"This site can't be reached; The connection was reset.\" In other web browsers, the message might look a little different. For example: Edge browsers say \"Hmmmâ€¦ can't reach this page\" or \"This page isn't working\" with the ERR_CONNECTION_RESET error code. Firefox browsers display \"The connection was reset\" with the PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR error code. Safari browsers show a \"Safari can't establish a secure connection to the server\" message."
