      "title": "Dreaming that someone tried to kill you means you may be fearful.",
      "content": "Dreaming that someone tried to kill you means you may be fearful. Now, you may not actually fear for your life. But, you might be afraid of change, failure, or the future, and this fear is showing up in your dreams, especially if you see blood in your dream. Nightmares are often triggered by stress, anxiety, or even PTSD. [1] X Research source Note the identity of your killer, where your dream took place, and the weapon they used to help you understand its meaning. Big life changes, like getting married or having a baby, may manifest in dreams. Our minds perceive failure as a kind of death, so dreaming about dying is one way we can process failure. A fear of the future is similar to having a fear of the unknown. Worrying too intensely about what will happen a few days, weeks, months, or even years down the line can impact your subconscious mind negatively, leading to these violent dreams.

      "content": "Spiritually speaking, death represents rebirth and transformation. If you dream someone tries to kill you, it could be a sign that you're craving change in your life. If the killer is your spouse, it symbolizes that your relationship could benefit from a change of attitude or perspective. If the killer is naked, it illustrates a lack of clarity about a certain situation in your life, urging you to change it."

      "title": "In Hinduism, dreaming of death signifies rebirth.",
      "content": "In Hinduism, dreaming of death signifies rebirth. Dreaming that somebody is trying to kill you symbolizes more of a metaphorical end to something than a literal end to one's life. These dreams could relate to rebirth, transformation, and personal growth. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "If you’re pregnant in the dream, it symbolizes transformation.",
      "content": "If you’re pregnant in the dream, it symbolizes transformation. Being pregnant could also mean that you’ve outgrown old behaviors. Additionally, it could mean that you have a heightened sense of awareness. Being pregnant while being chased by a killer doesn’t have the scary implications that you might think, and generally represents that you’re evolving into a better, more confident version of yourself."

      "title": "If your killer is a stranger, it’s likely a reflection of inner turmoil.",
      "content": "If your killer is a stranger, it’s likely a reflection of inner turmoil. A mysterious figure in your dream points to the unresolved issues and current emotional struggles you might be facing. These negative feelings can be anything from stress, doubt, frustration, anxiety, or fear about certain situations you may be trying to escape from. Feeling overwhelmed at a job you can’t afford to leave or in a relationship you don’t want to give up on could cause these emotions to bubble over into the dream world. Your subconscious mind still wants to solve these issues, even while you’re in a REM cycle. In fact, your dreams might be the ultimate reflection of the expression, “No matter where you go– there you are.” [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "If your killer is your spouse, there may be unresolved issues between you.",
      "content": "If your killer is your spouse, there may be unresolved issues between you. If the attacker in your dream is your significant other, this is likely a sign of resentment, distrust, or emotional detachment. It could be that you’re sensing changes in the relationship that scare you, that you feel your partner is growing distant toward you, or that the real conflict in your real lives is beginning to affect you. [6] X Research source This shouldn’t translate into literally fearing for your safety around them, as the symbolism of conflict is really what your dreams are bringing to the surface. Try talking things out with your spouse to resolve the issues and put a stop to your nightmares."

    {
      "title": "If your killer is a friend, it symbolizes conflict in the relationship.",
      "content": "If your killer is a friend, it symbolizes conflict in the relationship. Perhaps this person has wronged you before and you’re afraid to trust them again, or perhaps you’ve wronged them and their scorn is clearly reflected in your nightmares. Maybe you just feel threatened by them and your intuition is trying to warn you while you sleep. Try to talk out and resolve your issues."

      "title": "If the scene is somewhere familiar, it may point to issues in your home.",
      "content": "If the scene is somewhere familiar, it may point to issues in your home. The call for help may be coming from inside the house, so to speak, if that’s where your nightmare took place. It could have to do with fear surrounding setting proper boundaries, or living in a space that doesn’t feel totally safe. [7] X Research source A common pattern with dreams is an overflow of real-life issues, so reconsider or rearrange your living situation and see if this doesn’t improve your dream situation."

      "title": "If the scene is a place you’ve never been, it could mean a fear of change.",
      "content": "If the scene is a place you’ve never been, it could mean a fear of change. Or it could mean you're being forced to face unresolved issues. In dreams, our minds come up with physical manifestations of our problems, and finding yourself in an unfamiliar dream location could be linked to long-repressed conflicts finally being brought back to life. This rings even truer if you happen to be chased in the dream through an unfamiliar location, as this is likely a symbol for trying to outrun your problems. Being chased illustrates an innate anxiety about your current emotional state."

    {
      "title": "If your attacker tried to shoot you with a gun, it points to anxiety.",
      "content": "If your attacker tried to shoot you with a gun, it points to anxiety. This type of dream reflects being in a vulnerable situation, or even in physical or emotional danger. Additionally, it could signify that you’re feeling trapped in your life or routine. If you recognize your attacker and they’re pointing a gun at you, this might be your intuition yet again warning you to stay on your toes around that person. Something in your psyche doesn’t trust them and you should trust that. On the other hand, a gun could also symbolize your desire to go on an adventure."

    {
      "title": "If you’re being stabbed by a knife in the dream, it symbolizes betrayal.",
      "content": "If you’re being stabbed by a knife in the dream, it symbolizes betrayal. Either the dream is a reflection of a betrayal that already took place, or you’re expecting someone to betray you. Betrayal could simply come in the form of not feeling supported by those close to you in your personal life."

      "content": "Being axed to death reveals a tense conflict at the core of your life. If you’re about to be hacked in your dream, it may indicate that someone in your life is holding you back. If it’s a sword instead of an axe, it's a symbol of criticism and shame."

      "content": "Keep track of your dreams to help interpret their meanings. Interpreting dreams is not an exact science, but key details can help you figure out what they mean. After waking up from a dream or nightmare, try to remember as much as you can about the dream, and interpret each element. [8] X Research source You might even keep a dream journal where you can jot down these thoughts before they’re swept away by your reality. Reader Poll: We asked 133 wikiHow readers what they find most effective for dealing with nightmares, and 51% of them said that it's best to talk with friends or family. [Take Poll] Nightmares are no joke, and by talking with close connections, you can process the experience and start to move on."

Instead, dreams discuss the issues we are plagued by in the waking world, but are afraid to resolve because they’re too complicated or scary. If the problems don’t keep you awake at night, they’ll haunt your dreams. So, really, it might be best to tackle them headfirst!"
