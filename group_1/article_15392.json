      "title": "Gather seeds in the spring or summer.",
      "content": "Gather seeds in the spring or summer. Maple seeds are at their ripest in warm weather. As the weather gets colder, the seeds start entering their winter modes and become much more bitter. [2] X Research source Ripe seeds have a full, green pod. If the pod is starting to shrivel or turn brown, the seeds will probably be bitter. Seed pods fall off the tree when they’re ripe. To get the freshest seeds, pick up newly-fallen pods that are still all green."

    {
      "title": "Find smaller seeds for a sweeter taste.",
      "content": "Find smaller seeds for a sweeter taste. All maple seeds are edible, but some taste better than others. As a general rule, smaller maple seeds are sweeter and larger ones are more bitter. Seek out smaller seeds for the sweetest taste. The taste of the seeds can also vary from tree to tree. Try harvesting seeds from several to find the best taste. If you can only find bitter seeds, don’t worry. You can improve the taste by roasting or boiling the seeds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the seed pods in water for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Soak the seed pods in water for 1 hour. Removing the seeds from the pod is much easier after they’ve been soaked in water. Fill a pot or bowl with water and let the seeds soak for 1 hour. [3] X Research source If you’re using water out on a hiking trail, make sure it’s clean. If you aren’t sure, boil the water over a fire for 1 minute to kill any germs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the seeds from the pod.",
      "content": "Remove the seeds from the pod. Each maple pod usually has 2 seeds, if both wings are still connected. Peel away the pod and any remaining pieces of the outer skin. The outer skin is not dangerous, so don't worry if you leave some behind. It just may not taste great."

      "title": "Lay the seeds on a baking sheet.",
      "content": "Lay the seeds on a baking sheet. Spread them out so all the seeds get equal seasoning and bake evenly in the oven. Don't let them pile up or they won't cook evenly. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle on the seasonings of your choice.",
      "content": "Sprinkle on the seasonings of your choice. Here you can get creative and add any flavoring you want. Salt and pepper are always good options. For some extra spice, try ground cayenne pepper. Drizzle some olive oil on the seeds for extra flavor. Cinnamon can pair nicely with a maple flavor. Maple seeds are small so don't cover them in seasoning. Scoop some into a spoon or your fingers and just sprinkle the seasonings to add extra flavor. To sample different flavor pairings, put seeds on several baking sheets and season each one differently. See which one you like the best."

    {
      "title": "Boil the seeds for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Boil the seeds for 15 minutes. Bring the water to a boil, and then lower the flame so the water simmers. Leave the pot on the flame for 15 minutes.

      "title": "Drain the water.",
      "content": "Drain the water. Use a strainer and pour the water and seeds through it. Then pour the seeds into a bowl and let them cool. [5] X Research source When the seeds are cool enough, squeeze a few to make sure they’re soft. If they’re still hard, they weren’t boiled enough."

      "title": "Season the maple seeds however you want.",
      "content": "Season the maple seeds however you want. Boiling improves the taste of maple seeds, but you can also add whatever flavors you like.

      "content": "Eat the seeds raw for a convenient option. Eating maple seeds raw is not dangerous, and some hikers recommend picking them for a snack while on the trail.
