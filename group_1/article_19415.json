A key to eliminating dust mites is getting rid of their food source, and that means dusting with a damp cloth. Rinse the cloth regularly to avoid spreading dust. It's important to use a cloth slightly dampened with a disinfectant solution like Lysol and water because a dry cloth will simply stir up allergens and spread dust around the house. The exception is using a dry microfiber cloth since it traps dust instead of spreading it. [1] X Expert Source Ashley Matuska Professional Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 April 2019.
