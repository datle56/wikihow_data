It's good for the environment—and for your garden, if you have one, since homemade compost will fertilize the soil. You can compost food scraps such as fruits and vegetables, coffee grounds, eggshells, nutshells, and tea bags. Don’t try to compost meat, dairy, or oils this way.

If you don’t have the space to compost at home, you can still deal with food waste responsibly by visiting your local recycling center. Plenty of them have facilities to deal with food waste and composting; you’ll generally be able to bring your food waste there and either leave it with someone or dump it into the appropriate container. Be sure you check the specific guidelines for your recycling center before you go. [3] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. You may need to separate your food waste in a particular way before you take in it. Make sure you know what food waste they accept and what they don't. For example, they won’t take meat, but they will take organic waste, such as fruit and vegetables. Your local government will be able to provide details on recycling facilities near you."

Donating food to local charities, such as food banks and soup kitchens, is a great way to make sure nothing goes to waste. [4] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. Search for food banks and food drives in your area, and call up to ask how to donate. Many national hunger charities—such as Salvation Army —also have online search tools that’ll help you find food banks in your area. If you run a business in the food industry, there are also apps to help businesses donate unwanted food, such as Waste No Food . As an individual, working with established charities, either local or national, is often the most effective way to help people."

Dried foods like pasta and rice can be great to donate to food banks and generally have a long shelf-life, but if you do find some really old, out-of-date pasta or rice at the back of your cupboard, just toss it in the trash. Dairy products also can’t be recycled or composted, so if you need to dispose of them, throw them in the trash. You might be tempted to feed stale bread to birds in your garden, but it has little nutritional value, and moldy bread can even hurt birds."

Act fast and deal with any food that’s spoiled; it should be separated from the rest of your trash and wrapped in heavy-duty plastic bags, then disposed of quickly. If you can, put meats and other foods that rot fast into the trash on the day it’ll be collected, since rotting food can attract pests and insects. Put meats and any raw foods you’re throwing out into plastic bags and tie each one tightly before putting them into your trash bag. This will minimize leaks and odors. Ensure your trash can is fully secured and there aren’t any odors coming out that could attract pests. Get rid of your spoiled meat as fast as possible to avoid any potential problems with maggots."

Ideally, it should be made of glass—such as a pickle or spaghetti sauce jar—but you could also use a sealable metal can, like a coffee can. Just keep in mind that the metal might create a rust ring if left in the sink. Then, store your food scraps in the slop jar and seal it up until it’s time to throw it away. If necessary, chop the food scraps into small enough pieces to fit into the slop jar. Once it’s sealed, don’t reopen it; this will let the odor out (unless you freeze the jar). Avoid cardboard containers, like the cylinders oatmeal comes in, since they may get wet and leak from the decomposing food. On garbage day, throw the entire slop jar out! You can also dump the contents in the trash and reuse the slop jar, but this can be messy. If you do so, wash the jar outside."

Just make sure you don’t forget about any frozen items on garbage day! Try placing a post-it note on your freezer or the trash can to remind yourself to throw out any frozen scraps."

For instance: Freeze any fresh foods you won’t use right away so you can still use them at a later date. Consider freezing cooked leftovers like soups, stews, casseroles, and pasta if you aren’t going to finish them within the next 3 to 4 days. Secure all of your storage containers and store them in the appropriate temperature and climate conditions. For example, some foods need to be kept in the fridge, and others should be in kept in a cool, dry place."

Even if you think there’s nothing left to do with some food scraps beyond throwing them in the compost or trash, you might be surprised! There are plenty of ways to upcycle food (or even just the scraps). For example: Use banana peels to water your plants . Put your banana peel in a jar or bucket of water and let it sit overnight; the potassium and phosphorus in the peel will leak into the water! Then, use that water to hydrate your plants. Make homemade air freshener . Boil a few citrus peels in water to create a natural air freshener for your home. Or, just toss the peels in your garbage disposal if it’s starting to smell. Infuse your water or olive oil . You can use fruit peels (orange, lemon, grapefruit, and limes, for example) or zest to infuse water or olive oil and give it a bit of flavor. Start a vegetable garden . Use the seeds, pits, and cuttings from vegetables to start your own little garden and grow veggies of your own! You can do this with lettuce, celery, green onions, avocados, and more. Save your bread crusts . Nobody wants the end piece of a loaf of bread—so put it in your bag of brown sugar instead. The bread will keep the brown sugar soft! Reuse almost-empty food containers . If there’s a tiny bit left inside a jar, you can use what’s left to flavor your food by cooking inside the jar itself! For example, you could make overnight oats in a jam, peanut butter, or Nutella jar."

Putting food waste in your septic system (by flushing it down the toilet or putting it down the sink drain without a garbage disposal) can affect your plumbing system, block sewer systems, and potentially require you to get your septic system pumped more often. While it’s possible to flush soft food scraps down the sink drain or toilet, it’s not recommended. In particular, take care not to wash food scraps, coffee grounds, oils, or fats down the sink if you have a septic system. Even using a garbage disposal can potentially affect the warranty on your septic system, so be mindful of how often you use it (and limit yourself where possible)."
