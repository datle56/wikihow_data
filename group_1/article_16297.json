It's okay to use a fake identity to protect yourself or have fun without offline consequencesâ€”but only if you're not hurting anyone or breaking laws. This should be a way to stay safe, not a way to trick people or cause harm. Here are a few legitimate reasons to create a fake identity: To stay safer online To be open about part of your life (such as LGBTQ+ identity, mental illness, or disability) without it being linked back to you offline So you can share things without them coming up when an employer searches your name online To enjoy yourself online without a controlling relative watching"

For example, don't pretend to be a biologist if you don't understand biology, [1] X Research source and don't pretend to be a black person if you're white. Your identity should be created respectfully, and it should involve things you're comfortable discussing. Don't pretend to know a lot about something you don't understand. If a real expert comes along, you could end up embarrassing yourself. Stick to things you actually know. Pretending to be a member of a minority group that you aren't part of can feel insulting to them. [2] X Research source You could make a lot of people very upset with you if they found out. Don't pretend to have an illness or disability that you don't have in real life. That's not fair to people who do live with these things."

      "content": "Make a new email address to use while creating social media accounts. Some websites (like WordPress) make it possible for people to see your email address, so it's best to use something not associated with your real name. Put in your fake name as the name associated with the account. You can make an email address related to your fake name (like violinistjane42) or make it random."

      "content": "Recognize how strict the website is and how much info gets shared. Consider avoiding the stricter websites and looking for sites that don't police people's identities too much. Secret identities are more common on sites like Tumblr as opposed to Facebook and LinkedIn. For example, WordPress will share your email address and IP address to any website you comment on.

I can't believe that... That's not right. I think he should be thrown in jail.\" \"Well, I am astonished to hear that.

That's why I like using avatars I made on Picrew.\" \"I don't like to share details of my location on the internet for safety reasons.

Pick a few favorite things that don't match up with who you really are. For example, if your favorite color is purple in real life, then pretend it's blue online. Use a different browser. For example, if you usually use Firefox under your real name, try using Chrome for your fake identity. Pick different favorite hangouts. For example, if you prefer Twitter and Facebook under your real name, maybe you'd prefer to use Tumblr and Instagram under your fake name. Use a VPN to hide your IP address.

I know it's ironic, but a fake name makes it safe for me to be my real self.\" \"Yes, I realize I was inconsistent. I change a few personal details because I'm using a fake name.
