Take all of the Assets cards as well as the Silver and Gold Wild cards, and shuffle them together . Once they’re mixed up thoroughly, deal the cards one at a time to the players until each person has 5 cards. You can look at the cards in your hand, but keep them secret from all the other players. Set aside the Swap, Move, and Penny Jar cards the first few times you play. Once you’re familiar with the game, try them out using the Advanced rules . The basic rules for Cover Your Assets are best with 4–6 people. If you’re playing a 2-player or 3-player game, we’ll cover the rules changes later."

Set the cards in a face-up pile in front of you, which is also known as your Stack . You may use a Silver or Gold Wild in place of one card when you’re forming a set.
