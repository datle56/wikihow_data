      "title": "Place the bill on a flat surface, face up.",
      "content": "Place the bill on a flat surface, face up. It should have no wrinkles. Smooth it out as much as possible. This works best with a new, crisp dollar bill. If it’s old and wrinkly, consider ironing it first."

    {
      "title": "Fold the top margin down.",
      "content": "Fold the top margin down. Do it so that the fold falls just under the white edge. For each fold, make sure to run your fingernail or use a creasing tool, such as a bone folder, along the crease. This will help make the fold sharp and crisp, giving your work a clean, professional look. This covers the white edge and makes the finished ring a bit slimmer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom margin up.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom margin up. Do it the same as the top fold, to cover the white edge. Crease the fold with your fingernail."

      "title": "Orient the bill so that the numerals are facing out.",
      "content": "Orient the bill so that the numerals are facing out. Position the bill so that the numerals are facing outward and are right side up in front of you. This orientation ensures you’re working with the bill correctly aligned. You can fold under the white margins on either side if you'd like. Crease them right where the white part meets the green."

      "title": "Fold the right third of the bill upwards.",
      "content": "Fold the right third of the bill upwards. Form a 90-degree angle with the fold. The placement of this fold can be adjusted to make the ring larger or smaller."

Make sure that the number ‘1’ is well positioned, then tuck the end underneath. Arrange the number so it's on the outside, then tuck the end underneath. This is the \"stone\" or \"gem\" part of the ring. [1] X Research source"
