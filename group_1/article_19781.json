      "content": "Run hot water over a corner of a washcloth. Using only the corner will allow you to get your unibrow wet without dripping on your whole face. Another option is to pluck your unibrow directly after getting out of the shower. The warm water and steam of the shower will have opened up your pores a great deal."

      "content": "Begin tweezing in the middle of your eyebrow region. [1] X Expert Source Cassandra McClure Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 7 March 2019. Work outwards towards the part of your eyebrows that you wish to keep. If there are particularly difficult hairs to pluck, use your other hand to pull your skin and make it taut. Be careful not to pluck too much of your eyebrow. Continuously step back to see your results and determine how far you want to pluck. To figure out where your eyebrow should begin, hold a pair of tweezers vertically so that the tweezers are touching the widest part of your nose (nostril) at one end and the other end is going straight towards your eyebrow. The place where the tweezer touches your eyebrow is where your eyebrow should begin. To find where your arch should be, rest the tweezer horizontally against the bridge of your nose, and then tilt the tweezer at a 45-degree angle. The place where the tweezer points to is where your arch should be. To find the end point of your eyebrows, hold a pair of tweezers at a 45-degree angle from where your top and bottom waterlines meet at the inner part of your eyes."

      "content": "Apply an antibacterial soap and soothing lotion when you are done plucking. Aloe works well. Applying antibacterial soap will ensure that your newly empty pores do not get bacteria in them (thus leading to pimples.) If your eyebrow area is red or puffy after plucking, run an ice cube over the area. This will reduce both the redness and the swelling. You can also use a washcloth dipped in cold water or carefully apply a small dab of hydrocortisone cream."

      "content": "Purchase an at-home waxing kit. Waxing kits come with everything you will need to wax away that pesky unibrow. Wax kits use either cold or warm wax that will pull the hair out by the root. Unibrows that are removed with wax will stay removed for longer than unibrows that are tweezed away. There is also the option of purchasing wax-covered strips. These are best for newcomers to the waxing world. Simply press a pre-waxed strip against the area that you wish to remove hair from. Pat the strip down, hold the skin around it down with your fingers, and swiftly pull the strip off. Wax is notoriously painful, even though it's so effective. If you have sensitive skin, consider applying a little topical numbing cream to the area you intend to wax prior to embarking on the process. [2] X Research source"

However, you can certainly do it yourself if you use a mirror and have good aim. If you mess up and put the wax on a part of your eyebrow that you do not want to remove, rinse it off and try again. Take a thin brush or pencil and hold it vertically against the widest part of your nose. The point at which the brush meets your eyebrow is where your eyebrow should begin from the center. Repeat on both sides to determine how much hair to remove. [3] X Research source"

This cream is good for those who do not like the pain involved in tweezing or waxing. Be aware that this cream only removes surface-level hair, whereas waxing and tweezing removes hair and its roots. This means that your unibrow will grow back faster when you use this cream."
