      "title": "Laser Removal",
      "content": "Laser Removal Laser treatment involves using a special type of laser to release small powerful pulses on the ink of your tattoo. The ink is then heated and shattered, exposing your lighter, flesh-colored skin. You’ll often be numbed with anesthetic before laser surgery making it less painful. Because of this (and the overall effectiveness, according to dermatologists), it’s usually your best option for tattoo removal. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Laser surgery often requires multiple treatments (even for stick-and-pokes). This can be costly, so, if your stick-and-poke is already fading, you may want to try a different method to save time and money. Laser removal works best for larger pieces with lighter colors. While size usually isn’t an issue, blacks and dark blues tend to be harder to remove with lasers."

      "title": "Skin Excision",
      "content": "Skin Excision Surgical removal involves cutting into the skin and removing the tattooed area altogether, then sewing the remaining skin back up. While it may sound painful, anesthetic is usually applied beforehand. However, this type of removal usually leaves a scar, so, for cosmetic purposes, only select this option if your stick-and-poke is on the smaller side. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some surgeons may also inject a small acid-based solution under the skin to lift up the tattooed area before surgery. However, these injections are inconsistently effective. Be cautious if your specialist recommends this. Skin excision is usually your best option if your stick-and-poke is small or in a place that’s not usually visible."

      "content": "Dermabrasion Dermabrasion involves using a special rotary tool to “sand” away your outer layers of tattooed skin. While this method is usually cheaper than surgery and lasers, it’s not as consistently effective. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The quality of your stick-and-poke can affect the effectiveness of dermabrasion. If your stick-and-poke was applied unevenly or left scars behind, removal may be harder. Some doctors may also use salabrasion (“sanding” away the skin with salt) to help remove your tattoo.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While laser removal is the most common and recommended option, since stick-and-pokes are generally smaller and less intricate, it may be easier and more cost effective to perform one of the other two. Get some pain numbing agents before the removal begins. Most doctors will provide a general anesthesia, a numbing spray, and/or sedatives before your removal begins to make each session more tolerable.
