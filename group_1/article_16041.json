Mankey can be caught in South Province Area One and Area Five, as well as West Province Area One. [1] X Research source It evolves into Primeape at level 28. [2] X Research source Primeape can be found in South Province Area Four, West Province Area One and Area Three, North Province Area One, and Glaseado Mountain. [3] X Research source"

If you caught a Primeape that is a higher level than 35, you'll need to change your Primeape's moves to include Rage Fist. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Get some Ethers. To save time, bring along some Ethers or Max Ethers to help replenish Rage Fist's PP. A regular Ether restores 10 PP to a move, and Max Ethers restore all of a move's PP. You can find Ethers and Max Ethers all over the world in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source You can also get Ethers and Max Ethers by having a Pokémon with Pickup in your party. You can also use Elixirs and Max Elixirs. These items heal your Pokémon as well as replenish PP. You can also heal your Pokémon at a Pokémon Center to replenish PP, but some users have anecdotally reported this resets your evolution progress."

      "title": "Use Rage Fist 20 times.",
      "content": "Use Rage Fist 20 times. Your Primeape must use the move Rage Fist 20 times to level up into Annihilape. After using Rage Fist 20 times in battle, your Primeape will evolve into Annihilape. Rage Fist has 10 PP, so you will need to use a minimum of one Ether before Primeape can evolve into Annihilape. Rage Fist doesn't have to land a hit to count, but it won't count if your Primeape is paralyzed, confused, or infatuated. It also won't work if the enemy Pokémon makes your Primeape flinch or if it uses Disable. [7] X Research source To quickly level your Primeape into Annihilape, find a low-level Normal-type Pokémon (such as Lechonk, Yungoos, or Skwovet). Rage Fist is a Ghost-type move, which is ineffective against Normal-type Pokémon. [8] X Research source You can use Rage Fist 20 times in one battle, and as long as the Normal-type Pokémon is a low level it won't be able to hurt your Primeape enough to knock it out."
