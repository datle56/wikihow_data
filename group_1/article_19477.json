      "title": "Cut greasy and spicy foods out of your diet.",
      "content": "Cut greasy and spicy foods out of your diet. Fatty and spicy foods are more difficult for your body to digest, so they irritate your stomach and cause heartburn easier.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Aim to have between 20–40 grams of fiber daily. For example, 1 slice of whole wheat bread has about 2 grams of fiber, 1 cup (175 g) of broccoli has about 5 grams, and 1 cup (150 g) of peas has about 9 grams.
