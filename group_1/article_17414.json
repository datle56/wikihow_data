      "title": "Wash your hair with a good quality shampoo.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with a good quality shampoo. This means a salon-quality shampoo made with high-quality active ingredients. Spend some time looking at the list of ingredients and choose one based on the contents, not just the name brand. Avoid ingredients like sulfates (ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate, and sodium lauryl sulfate), isopropyl alcohol, formaldehyde, and propylene glycol. These ingredients will dry out your hair, break down healthy hair proteins, and leave your hair prone to more damage in the future. [1] X Research source Look for ingredients like sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, and disodium laureth sulfosuccinate. These compounds are gentler than the sulfates used in many cheaper shampoos and are derived from more natural ingredients like coconut oil. You can also choose shampoos that contain glycerin and panthenol. Glycerin helps fortify your hair by creating a protective barrier and panthenol allows your hair to retain more moisture and thickens the hair follicles."

But using too much oil in your hair can make your hair look greasy, so be careful not to overdo it. Usually, 1-3 times a month is enough for this kind of treatment. Heat up 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of an essential oil, such as olive oil or coconut oil, so that it is warm to the touch, but not boiling, and massage it into your hair. If you don't heat the oil right away, apply it to your hair, put on a shower cap, and you sit underneath a hairdryer. Cover your hair with a plastic wrap (or even a shower cap if you don't have a plastic wrap) and leave it in for 30-45 minutes, depending on the severity of your hair's damage. When you are finished, rinse the oil out of your hair with lukewarm water."
