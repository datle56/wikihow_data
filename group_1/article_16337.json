      "title": "Write a short, memorable, and personal caption for your family photo.",
      "content": "Write a short, memorable, and personal caption for your family photo. According to social media expert Kasey Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. Instagram hides the rest of your caption after a few lines of text, so include the most eye-catching details at the beginning. Other tips to create the perfect family caption: Use quotes and song lyrics: If you’re struggling to come up with a caption, think of quotes and lyrics from your favorite authors, poets, and artists. Their words can perfectly describe your family dynamic and the vibe of your photo. Include a question to increase engagement: This encourages your followers to leave comments and like your post. For example, you could caption your photo with “Guess who’s mom’s favorite?” or “Do we look normal?” Add personality with emojis, slang, and references: Social media and digital marketing consultant Candace Gasper recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption. Using emojis and slang terms like “POV,” “ride or die”, or “the CEO of (something)” can make your caption extra punchy too."
