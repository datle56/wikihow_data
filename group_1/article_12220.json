He'll ask for Drowzee in Gold and Silver, and Abra in Crystal. Both can be found on Route 34, the route below Goldenrod City. Abra can also be bought from the Game Corner for 200 coins if you don't want to deal with it fleeing from a wild battle."

      "content": "After using your accuracy-lowering attack against the Miltank a few times, attack it. Special attacks such as Thundershock or Ember will work better than physical attacks, given Miltank's lower special defense. You can buy Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, and Ice Punch in the Goldenrod Department Store if you have any Pokémon that can learn one or more of those attacks (Abra, in particular, can learn all three and has a high special attack)."

If you started with Chikorita, it'll be able to learn Stun Spore and Poison Powder. Paralysis lowers a Pokémons' speed and has a 25% chance of stopping the Pokémon from making a move during a turn. Poison damages the opponent a bit at the end of their turn. Sleep makes the opponent fall asleep, preventing them from moving until they wake up."

When Miltank comes out, it'll be hit by Rollout, and (depending on your level) should do a good amount of damage against it, if not a one-hit KO. If it misses at any point, you get flinched by Miltank's Stomp attack, or your Pokémon is immobilized by love through Attract, though, Rollout will end, making this strategy dependent on luck."

If you use a different attack, though, the attack power will reset, so be sure that you're using it constantly."
