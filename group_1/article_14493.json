      "content": "Check the instructions for your math problem. The steps below tell you how to make a parallelogram with certain side lengths and angles. If your problem only tells you an angle, or only one length instead of two, the rest is up to you. For example, if a step below tells you to draw a line of the specified length, and the problem you are following doesn't mention a specific length, just draw the line as long as you like.

      "content": "Draw a line using the ruler. Put your ruler flat against the paper and draw a line across its edge with your pencil. Make this a long line, but don't bother measuring it yet. A longer line will make some of the later steps easier."

      "title": "Position your protractor.",
      "content": "Position your protractor. Put the protractor down so the flat side is along the line (this is where a longer line will help guide you). Move it from side to side so the dot in the center of the protractor is over the left pencil mark that represents a corner of the parallelogram."

      "title": "Measure the angle.",
      "content": "Measure the angle. The edge of the protractor is labeled with numbers from 0 to 180. These are the degrees in the angle. If you are trying to draw a parallelogram with a 75º angle, find the line labeled 75, or estimate where the line would be halfway between the 70 mark and the 80 mark. Draw a pencil line at the edge of the protractor, continuing the line you found. [3] X Research source If your protractor has two sets of numbers, use the one that has \"0\" on the line between your two pencil marks. If your protractor has one set of numbers and the line between your pencil marks is labeled \"180,\" move the protractor to the right pencil mark instead and count from there."

Move the protractor out of the way and arrange your ruler between the corner where the protractor was placed, and the pencil mark you just drew using the protractor. Connect these two marks by running your pencil along the ruler edge. Measure the length this side is supposed to be with the \"0\" of the ruler on the lower pencil mark. Make yet another pencil mark to show where the side ends."

Position the protractor on the other corner of the parallelogram, and mark the same angle using the method described above. When you have both the left and right sides drawn, they should be parallel to each other and exactly the same length."
