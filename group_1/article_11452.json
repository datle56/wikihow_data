      "content": "Cute is someone who’s attractive, while hot is someone sexy. While it might not seem like a huge difference at first, there are some key ways that people use “cute” and “hot” differently. Cute people are attractive, but in an innocent, endearing way. Hot people are attractive as well, but in a stunning, modelesque way. [1] X Research source Cute can also refer to someone without any sort of sexual connotations at all. For instance, you might call a baby or a puppy “cute.” On the other hand, “hot” is always used for people you think are sexually attractive. You might use “cute” and “hot” in different settings, too. For instance, you might call your partner “cute” when you’re talking to your parents, but “hot” when you’re with your friends."

      "content": "Charming personality Cute people tend to be easy going and friendly. You might spot them from across the room laughing with their friends or telling a funny joke. They draw people in, both with their looks and their behavior. [2] X Research source Along with their charm comes an innocent-yet-wholesome personality. They might act silly or goofy sometimes, but at their core, they have a heart of gold."

      "title": "Youthful appearance",
      "content": "Youthful appearance When someone is “cute,” they often appear slightly younger than they actually are. This doesn’t detract from how attractive they are—in fact, a youthful appearance is a draw for many people!"

      "title": "Caring",
      "content": "Caring Cute people are often not just cute in the looks department, but in their actions, too. Someone who is cute probably has a very good heart, and they might spend their free time helping their friends or strangers. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Easy to talk to",
      "content": "Easy to talk to If you want to go up and talk to a cute person, they’ll almost always welcome you with open arms. Sure, you’ll think they’re attractive, but you’ll feel totally comfortable striking up a conversation with them in most places. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Long-term relationship material",
      "content": "Long-term relationship material Yes, it’s true: when most people call someone else “cute,” they’re probably thinking of them as a potential significant other. It’s because “cute” encapsulates more than just your looks: it’s your personality that really seals the deal. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Conventionally attractive",
      "content": "Conventionally attractive When you call someone “hot,” you’re probably talking about someone who’s attractive enough to be a model. They’re likely toned and fit, and they probably spend a lot of time on their hair and skin, too. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mature",
      "content": "Mature While “cute” typically refers to someone who’s youthful looking, a hot person might even look a couple years older than they actually are. Typically, hot people look serious and angular (like a model!), which can make them seem more mature."

    {
      "title": "Sensual",
      "content": "Sensual “Hot” and “sexy” are almost synonyms. When you call someone hot, there’s a very good chance that you’re thinking about them in a sexual way. [7] X Research source Some people assume that hot people are easier to hook up with or have one-night stands with, but that isn’t always the case. Remember that just because someone is hot doesn’t mean they aren’t looking for love!"

      "content": "Confident A hot person’s biggest draw is that they radiate confidence. You could find a hot person wearing sweatpants with messy hair and still think they’re totally hot! Know why? It’s because they’re completely confident in who they are (and how they look). [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Radiate confidence. The key difference between someone who is “cute” vs someone who is “hot” is how they occupy space. It doesn’t matter what they’re wearing, as long as they feel strong and confident in it! When you walk into a room, hold your head up high and make eye contact with people. Give someone a big smile, and don’t be afraid to walk up and introduce yourself to someone new. [9] X Research source Being confident might not be the easiest thing in the world, especially if you struggle with your self-esteem. However, the old saying is true: if you fake it until you make it, you’ll eventually feel confident in yourself."

Wear outfits that are revealing and catch the eye, do your makeup a little heavier than you’re used to, and use light touches to flirt with people . When you ooze sex appeal, you’ll automatically be hotter. [10] X Research source Take inspiration from people you think are hot and sexy. How does your favorite model act in public? What does that A-list movie star wear to the red carpet?"
