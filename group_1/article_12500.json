      "content": "“Denial is a river in Egypt” is a way to say that someone is in denial. This phrase is often used in a playful, joking way to point out that someone is ignoring or refusing to accept the truth. [1] X Research source It’s also a pun—the word “denial” sounds like “the Nile,” which is the name of the largest river in Egypt. And, since the Nile River is so large, the phrase suggests that this person is in a huge amount of denial. For example, if someone refuses to accept that their partner is cheating on them even though there's a ton of evidence, a friend might tell them “denial is a river in Egypt” to point out that they’re ignoring the truth. The expression actually started out as “denial isn’t just a river in Egypt,” but over time, different variations, like “denial is a river in Egypt,” have become popular. Other variations of the phrase include: Denial ain't just a river in Egypt Denial is not just a river in Egypt Denial isn't a river in Egypt Denial ain't a river in Egypt"

      "content": "Use this expression to point out that someone is ignoring the truth. This phrase is a common way to let someone know that they may be avoiding the truth about something because they don't want to face it. However, since this expression usually has a joke-y tone, it’s best to use it in casual, lighthearted situations, rather than super serious ones. Here are some examples: Example 1: Person 1: “He said he’s going to try out for American Idol. ” Person 2: “But he's never even sung before.\" Person 1: “He says his star-power will make up for it.” Person 2: “Yeah, and denial is a river in Egypt.” Example 2: Person 1: “I think I’m gonna get an A on this test.” Person 2: “Really? I thought you said you didn’t even study.” Person 1: “I didn’t, but I feel really prepared anyway.” Person 2: “Okay, well, denial is a river in Egypt.” Example 3: Person 1: “I’m thinking of getting back together with my ex.” Person 2: “Wasn’t he pretty much the worst boyfriend ever?” Person 1: “Kind of, but he promised he’s completely changed.” Person 2: “Well, denial isn’t just a river in Egypt.”"

      "content": "This phrase also appears in a popular TikTok meme.

[2] X Research source For example, this TikTok by @itsanw uses the sound to playfully call out people who eat dairy even though they are lactose intolerant."

      "content": "“DENIAL IS A RIVER” is also the title of a popular song by Doechii. The song’s title is a direct reference to the viral Wendy Williams clip, in which Williams says, “Denial is a river in Egypt, your husband is gay.” Doechii’s song is about the experience of finding out that her boyfriend was cheating on her with a man, which directly plays into the themes of the original TikTok meme. [3] X Research source In an interview after the release of the track, Doechii said that the song is about “someone who was lying to themselves.” She clarified that the problem wasn’t that her ex cheated on her with a man—the problem was the cheating itself, and the fact that he was in denial about his own sexuality. She also pushed back against any biphobic interpretations of the song, saying that she herself is bisexual, and she has no problems dating bisexual men. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Ignorance is bliss This popular idiom basically means \"if you don’t know about something, you won’t worry about it.\" [5] X Research source Like “denial is a river,” it’s usually used to point out that someone is ignoring the truth about something, but it has more of a positive connotation. Here are some examples: “He says he doesn’t follow the news at all. I can’t imagine not being informed on current events, but he seems pretty happy. I guess ignorance is bliss.” “If my mom knew I was throwing a party, she’d be worried about the mess. But I’ll clean before she gets home, so she’ll never know. Ignorance is bliss!” “If I knew how Jell-O is really made, I’d be too grossed out to eat it, so I just ignore it. Ignorance is bliss, I guess!”"

      "content": "Cry me a river This phrase is a sarcastic way to say that you don’t have any sympathy for someone. It basically means that this person can cry enough tears to fill a river, but you still won’t feel sorry for them. Like “denial is a river,” this idiom inspired the title of a popular song, “Cry Me a River” by Justin Timberlake, which is about not having sympathy for an ex who cheated. [6] X Research source Here are some examples of how the phrase is used: “You’re apologizing now that you need something from me, but you couldn’t be bothered to make things right before. Cry me a river—I’m not forgiving you!” “He asked if we could get back together, but I know it’s just because things didn’t work out with his new girlfriend. I told him to cry me a river.”"
