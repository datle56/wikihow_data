      "content": "List the things that are most important to you in life. While you might not think of them as values, you likely have a few things that you care about most in your life, like your family and friends. Take 5-10 minutes to think about what you believe is important in life and write these things down. Try to think of at least 5 things. [1] X Research source For instance, you might write, “My family, being creative, helping others, being kind to animals, and learning new things.”"

      "content": "Identify 3-5 experiences where you truly felt alive and engaged. When you’re doing something that’s important to you, it’s easy to lose yourself in the moment. Think about the times in your life when you’ve felt this way. Keep in mind that these experiences don't need to be \"happy\" to be engaging and enlivening. Then, ask yourself what made the experience fulfilling to figure out which value it might reflect. [2] X Research source You could write, “When I helped my friend Amy after her accident,” “When I won a service award at school,” and “When I fostered a litter of kittens.” Next, examine why you felt alive while helping your friend Amy. You may have enjoyed feeling helpful, but you might also realize that you had to get creative in finding activities you could do together during her recovery, which felt exciting."

Picture yourself celebrating 8 decades on Earth and all that you’ve accomplished. Then, decide what this might suggest about your values in life. Ask yourself these questions: Who is at my party? What do people love about me? How have I impacted people’s lives? What have I accomplished in life? What do your answers to the previous questions say about your values?"

      "content": "Think about what you admire in other people to discover your values. First, identify 2 or 3 people who you admire, such as family members, friends, leaders, celebrities, or fictional characters. Then, figure out what you admire about them, such as their accomplishments or talents. Next, decide what values they might reflect from your perspective. These are likely personal values that you hold. [3] X Research source For example, you might admire Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. for his courage, commitment to standing up for what is right, and selflessness."

      "content": "List the things you really want in life. Fold a piece of paper in half or create 2 columns in a word document. On the left side of your page, write down your answers to the questions below. On the right side of the page, write down what each entry on your list might show about your values. Your list will probably be really long, but that’s a good thing because it gives you more ways to learn about yourself. What do you want to accomplish? What do you want to be in life or your career? What things do you hope to have? What do you hope to experience? How do you want to spend your time? What are your goals and aspirations?"

Think about how each value is reflected in your life and how closely you follow it. If you feel this value is fully expressed, give yourself a 10. However, if you don’t see this value at all in your life, give yourself a 1. For example, let’s say you value artistic expression. You might give yourself a 10 for artistic expression if you make art, learn about art, go to local art museums, and have a few art prints that you love. However, you might only give yourself a 1 if you have a few books about art but don’t really include it in your life."

Ideally, you’ll express your values through your career choice so that you’re fulfilled in your life and work. Think about how your job or career might express each value. Give it a 10 if you feel like your career reflects the value, but give it a 1 if it doesn’t. For example, let’s say you value helping people. If you work at a local nonprofit, you might give yourself a 10 for helping people. On the other hand, if you have a job where you don’t interact directly with people, you might only give yourself a 3, which might make you feel unfulfilled."

[7] X Research source For example, you might decide that in your ideal life you’d be helping people get fit through dance. You might imagine yourself living in a big city on the coast, teaching cardio dance classes at a gym, and going to the beach with friends in your spare time. Additionally, you might decide you want to own several pets because you love animals. You can even narrow this down to your ideal week or day. What would you be doing throughout the week? Who would you be spending time with? [8] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 March 2020."
