      "content": "Pour an ounce of whisky straight from the bottle into your glass. Especially if you are new to drinking whisky, you should consider drinking it plain, or “neat,” which means without water, ice, or mixers. Enjoying Black Label directly from the bottle will allow you to fully taste its complex flavors, which include smoky, nutty, and sweet notes. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Drink plain whisky out of a snifter glass for the best smelling experience. There are several types of whisky drinking glasses, and it may come as a surprise that each type creates a different tasting and smelling experience. For drinking blended whiskey (i.e. Black Label) plain, experts recommend using a snifter, whisky tumbler, or Neat glass. [2] X Research source These glass shapes are well-suited to the appreciation of whisky aromas, a key part of enjoying whisky “neat.” A snifter, traditionally used for brandy, is curved with a stem. It is the connoisseur's choice for fully enjoying the aromas of spirits. [3] X Research source A whisky tumbler is short with a heavy bottom and no stem.This is the classic choice for enjoying whisky “on the rocks” (with ice), but it is not the best choice for neat whiskey because its shape is less suited to “nosing,” or smelling, the spirit. The Neat glass is a new type of short whisky glass with an hourglass shape. It is ideal for beginners because its shape negates the harsh smell of ethanol from reaching the nose."

      "content": "Drink slowly to take in the many tastes of the whisky. You may want to rest the whisky on your palate for ten seconds before swallowing. Consider keeping a carafe or glass of water nearby to take between sips. This can help you handle the whisky’s intensity without diluting its flavor."

      "content": "Add a small amount of ice or water to your whisky to open its flavors. Many people swear by ice or water in their Black Label, which can dilute tastes of smokiness and harsh alcohol. This can be a great choice for beginners who are new to the intensity of whisky. [5] X Research source When ordering Black Label with ice, always ask for it \"on the rocks.\" A bartender will add the ice first before pouring the whisky on top, so it's on top of \"the rocks\" of ice."

      "content": "Adjust the flavor and temperature by adding more ice or water. The amount of ice or water you use is totally up to you. Some swear by a small amount of water in their Black Label, but too much water can flatten the complexity of its flavors. How much ice you use also impacts the temperature of the drink, which is a key part of its taste."
