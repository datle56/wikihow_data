      "content": "Choose a high-quality, reputable epilator. The quality of your epilator matters. Pick a well-known, well-reviewed brand that you know you can trust. A cheap epilator may not work as well and it may be more painful to use. Since your epilator will last a long time (and you won't have to buy wax and fancy razors) it's worth springing for a good one! [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Trusted epilators include Braun , Panasonic , and Remington . If your epilator is cordless, be sure to charge it completely before you start. You don't want to be stuck with a job half finished when your epilator dies."

      "title": "Shave your legs 1 to 3 days prior to epilating.",
      "content": "Shave your legs 1 to 3 days prior to epilating. Epilators work best when your hairs are just a few millimeters long. If your hairs are too long, they can get tangled in the epilator; too short, and there's not enough for the spinning heads to grab as you work. Shaving a few days beforehand is the best way to ensure that your hairs are all the same length and ready to epilate. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Set aside at least 1 hour for your first session.",
      "content": "Set aside at least 1 hour for your first session. Once you get used to the process, you can probably do it in half an hour or so. For the first session, though, you'll want to give yourself plenty of time. The process is definitely slower than shaving, but the results will last much longer. [3] X Research source Many people like to epilate at night. Your legs will be red and a little swollen when you're finished. If you epilate at night, they'll return to normal by morning. It's best not to epilate the day you have a big event or date, unless you're planning to wear tights or pants. Do it the day before so your legs won't be red and swollen when you go out."

      "content": "Take a painkiller 1 hour before you begin. This is optional, but many find that taking an over the counter painkiller helps make epilating less painful . Epilating feels a lot like waxing; it hurts at first, but eventually you get used to the feeling. Try using pain killers the first few times you epilate. After that, you probably won’t need the pain relief anymore."

      "content": "Exfoliate your legs in the shower. Getting rid of dry skin will prevent ingrown hairs from occurring later. Take a warm shower and exfoliate your skin using a loofah or body scrub .

      "title": "Epilate dry to work faster and more efficiently.",
      "content": "Epilate dry to work faster and more efficiently. Dry skin helps the epilator grasp onto the hairs faster and pull them out more efficiently. If you’ve epilated before or you want to go quickly, dry off your legs completely with a towel. [6] X Research source The drier your hairs, the better the epilator will be able to grip them; damp hairs will get slippery and sticky, making the process harder."

      "content": "Epilate wet to relieve pain and discomfort. If you’re new to epilating, it’s a good idea to epilate in the bath or the shower. Get your legs wet and smooth on some shower gel to help the epilator glide over your legs. [7] X Research source If you’re epilating wet, be sure that your epilator is waterproof. In general, cordless epilators are waterproof while ones with cords are not. However, always read your instruction manual to be sure."

      "title": "Use the lowest setting first.",
      "content": "Use the lowest setting first. Many epilators come with two settings: low and high. When you're first starting out, use the low setting so you can get used to the feeling of epilating. Once you're familiar with the sensation, you can switch to the high setting and speed up the process. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Start on the inside of your lower leg.",
      "content": "Start on the inside of your lower leg. This is the least sensitive area on your leg, so it's a good place to start so you can get used to the feeling of epilating. Save the most sensitive spots for last, since by then your body will be accustomed to the feeling. [9] X Expert Source Alicia Ramos Skincare Professional Expert Interview. 12 June 2019.

      "content": "Hold the epilator at a 90-degree angle to your skin. Pass it lightly over your skin in a straight line. The spinning heads will grasp your hairs and pull them out. Keep the epilator over 1 area for about 30 seconds. [10] X Research source You will definitely feel a pinch as the epilator grabs your hairs and pulls them out. If you need to stop and take a break, there's nothing wrong with that."

      "title": "Move the epilator against the grain of your hair growth.",
      "content": "Move the epilator against the grain of your hair growth. For your legs, this probably means you’ll be moving the epilator upwards the whole time. Going against the grain will help the epilator grasp onto the hairs and pull them out fast. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull your skin taut to relieve pain.",
      "content": "Pull your skin taut to relieve pain. Hold the epilator in 1 hand and hold your leg with the other. Pull the skin taut before epilating the area. That way, the epilator will catch onto your hairs instead of your skin. [12] X Research source Pulling your skin taut also makes it less likely that your legs will bleed."

      "content": "Epilate 1 leg, then switch to the other leg. Once you’ve gone over your entire leg, you can give yourself a break before switching to your other leg. All in all, this process will probably take about 1 hour, but you’ll get faster as you go. [13] X Research source"

If you need to, use your epilator to spot treat any areas that you missed the first time. After that, you'll be able to enjoy smooth legs for several weeks before you have to epilate again. [17] X Research source In general, the results from epilating last for 6 to 8 weeks."
