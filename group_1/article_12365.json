If you're trying to remove a page in the middle of a document, the rest of the text in the document will shift up and the pagecount will be the difference of how many pages you originally had and how many pages you deleted. If you had removed a blank page at the end of a document, the pagecount will be one less than it was before. [2] X Research source If you want to remove a page from your document but you don't want to lose the text or other data that was on it, you must cut and paste that text somewhere else as deleting the text will remove it permanently. To cut press Ctrl + X on Windows or ⌘ Cmd + X on Mac, and to paste press Ctrl + V on Windows or ⌘ Cmd + C on Mac. You can paste your data into a new document and save it for future reference. You can also copy ( Ctrl + C on Windows or ⌘ Cmd + C on Mac) data you don't want to lose and paste it somewhere else, but you'll still have to hit the ← Backspace or Delete button to delete it from the original document. Using the cut hotkey will copy and remove the text with one keystroke."

If you don't want to remove any data but you want to reduce the amount of pages in your document, you can adjust some attributes of your text to lower the pagecount. Try one or more of the following: Change the font family. In the top ribbon there is a dropdown that allows you to change what font you're using. Try selecting a different font to see if the characters take up less space, which can reduce page count. Change the font size. In the top ribbon, next to the font dropdown, there are controls to increase or decrease the font size. Click the - button a few times to make your font smaller, which can lower your page count. Adjust your line spacing. In the top ribbon near the right-hand side, there is a button that has an icon of three horizontal lines with an up-and-down arrow next to it. Click this button to adjust your line spacing . Try decreasing your line spacing ( single is the smallest line spacing and double is the biggest) or removing spaces before or after paragraphs. Note that if you don't have paragraph spacing on, there will not be an option in the line spacing menu to remove it (it will say add instead)."

Make sure to follow these guidelines, and opt to remove information from your paper instead to lower the page count. If you are looking to print your document, don't reduce the margins too much. Margins are necessary not only to increase the legibility of a document, but to allow space for the printer to print your document properly. Printing to the edge of a page is called a \"full bleed\" and requires specialized equipment to achieve this. Most at-home or office printers are not equipped to print full bleed, so if you reduce your margins to zero, the edges of your text will get cut off when you print."
