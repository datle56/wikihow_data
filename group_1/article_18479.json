Bowe adds “the best thing you can do is…tip your hips forward and put a little bit of arch in your [lower] back” so you’re in a better, more comfortable position. The gap between the back of your knees and the front of your chair’s seat should be about the width of 3 fingers. If the distance is shorter, then the seat is too deep. Check if your chair allows you to adjust the tilt of the seat until you have a larger enough gap."

She also mentions to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees so they’re directly above your feet. If your feet do not reach the floor or if your knees are not at 90 degrees, use an under-desk foot rest for additional support."

If you have an adjustable desk, raise or lower the surface so your forearms are flat and parallel to the floor. [4] X Research source When your desk is at the proper height and your forearms are parallel to the floor, you can move your mouse around faster so aiming in a game is easier."

      "content": "Arm Position: close to your body and elbows bent at 90 degrees Bowe says that keeping your elbows at your sides and bent at 90 degrees helps prevent arm pain when you’re at a computer. In the proper position, she mentions that you should not have to raise your arms or bend unnaturally to reach something on your desk. If your chair has arm rests, make sure they’re in a position that keep your elbows bent at 90 degrees and your shoulders in a neutral position. If your arm rests are too tall, then they’ll raise your shoulder and cause discomfort."

If your wrists bend or flex when you place them on your desk, then rest them on wrist supports to keep them straight."

While you’re sitting in your chair, look straight ahead and tuck your chin back to straighten out your neck. If your ears are directly above your shoulders, then you’re in the right position. [5] X Research source It’s okay if this position feels unnatural at first. Try to hold it for a few minutes at first, and increase the time as it starts to feel more comfortable.

Raise or lower the monitor so your eyes line up with the top third of the screen when you’re sitting up straight.

Overextending or reaching for your keyboard and mouse can make you lean forward and limit your range of motion when you’re trying to game."
