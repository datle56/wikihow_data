Make sure you are rinsing off any cream that may still be on your body, including the residue.

Instead, apply a thin layer of a gentle, scent-free moisturizing cream or a petroleum jelly-based product like Vaseline or Aquaphor . You can then bandage the area with gauze to protect it as it heals. [6] X Research source Aloe vera is also a good option to soothe and hydrate the skin affected by the rash.

      "content": "Take an antihistamine to control itchiness. You can get over-the-counter antihistamines in drowsy or non-drowsy formulas. Your body will have released histamines to protect you from infection, but these may also cause you to itch (they're the same things that cause your nose to run when you have an allergic reaction). The antihistamine will suppress the side effects of the histamine, leaving you itch-free. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If the itching is keeping you awake at night, try an antihistamine that makes you sleepy (it probably won't be labeled as such, but it won't have \"non-drowsy\" on the box). Because antihistamines can make you tired (sometimes even the non-drowsy antihistamines can have this side effect), don't take any before driving or doing anything else that requires you to be very alert.

You may even have some depilatory cream still under your nails. Wear loose clothes that won't rub or chafe the rash and possibly cause a friction burn. When using a cloth to wash the Nair off, don't rub too hard or scrub it, and try not to wipe the same area too many times."

Pick a mild, fragrance-free cleanser or a gentle non-abrasive soap such as Cetaphil and use as little soap as possible. Do not use deodorant soaps.

      "title": "When using hair removal creams, follow the directions carefully.",
      "content": "When using hair removal creams, follow the directions carefully. Following the package directions will help to ensure that you don’t keep the product on your skin for too long and that you don't apply it to unsafe areas of your body. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Here are some specific tips to keep in mind: Perform a patch test first. To do this, put a small amount of the cream on a small area of your arm or leg to test whether it causes a reaction. Check the product label to make sure it’s safe to use on certain areas. Some hair removal creams are formulated specifically for the face or bikini area, which tend to be more sensitive, while others are meant only for your arms or legs. If you’re using hair removal cream on your bikini line, only put the product on your external pubic area and avoid direct contact with your genitals. Don’t leave the product on longer than the instructions say to. Most hair removal creams only need to stay on for 5-10 minutes, and leaving them on longer can increase your risk of skin irritation. Rinse the product off thoroughly. Leftover residue can cause irritation, so make sure to flush the area with water until every trace of cream is gone. When you're done, apply some gentle, unscented moisturizer to hydrate and soothe your skin. Avoid using hair removal creams if you have sensitive skin, eczema, rosacea, psoriasis, or acne, or if you’re sunburned or use a retinol (which may make your skin more sensitive).
