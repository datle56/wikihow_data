[1] X Research source You can even hire a professional designer to create your page (and if you can't, just be sure to keep it updated and looking modern). You'll also want to focus on the quality of the text. Google likes to see lots of text with correct grammar and spelling. Make sure your content matches the preview of your site from the search page. If you bait and switch readers, or if they otherwise immediately leave and look for something else, your rankings will be docked.

      "content": "Choose a good domain name. If you can make it work, fit your main keyword into your domain name as the first word in the domain. To boost rankings, you can also use a country TLD (top level domain, like .com) if you have a local business. You'll be rewarded for searches in your area, but doing this will hurt your searches outside of your country. Of course this doesn't matter if your business is local. At the very least, avoid replacing words with numbers (and other 90s tricks) and avoid using a subdomain. This applies to subpages as well. Use descriptive and valid URLS for each page of the website. Give the pages names that tell search engines and users what they are instead of using generic names like \"page1\". Instead, do something like weddings , for your wedding rentals and catering page. Keywords in subdomains also work in your favor. So for example, if you have a section of your site that is for wholesale, use an address like \"weddings and wholesale\"."

Find websites that are in the same vein as yours and see if they'd be willing to do some cross promotion. You can also contact relevant blogs and ask about guest posting, giving you another chance to link to your site.

Google can tell the difference. Do not spam comment sections trying to build backlinks for yourself. You will be docked for this behavior."

For free, you're allowed to search and find what people are looking for most. For example, for your winery, search the term winery (applying any filters you think matter). Click on the Keyword ideas tab and it will tell you how often people are searching your term, what the competition is like, and suggest some alternatives that are also frequently searched.
