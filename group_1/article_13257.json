      "content": "Recognize that ego, in this context, is identification with mind and form. When you say things like \"I am a security guard\", \"I am a technologist,\", \"I am a CEO\", \"I am homeless\", \"I am a parent\", \"I am a writer\", \"I was betrayed\", \"I am a sufferer of some disease\" etc., this is part of identification with the mind (aka mental conditioning). This means thinking or seeing the role or function or label or story, which is no more than a bunch of thoughts in your head that the primordial “I” thought, is attached with. In more direct words, you become your conditioned thoughts, resistive patterns, reactions, and emotions. That's what 'mind-identification' implies in this context. [2] X Research source Ego, which is unaware of its true source within, derives its sense of self from fleeting and unstable things, status, conditions, culture, looks, physical appearance, relationships, gender, experiences, stories, knowledge, history, etc. \"Better\" or \"worse\" the label or story or condition, stronger the identification. Ego says: 'I have, therefore I am. And the more I have, the more I am' and vice versa. This delusion is the opposite of the truth."

      "content": "Recognize form-identification. Identification with things and conditions like looks, body, diseases/illnesses, physical or mental conditions, titles, money, assets, religion, gender, skin color, race, degrees, age, nationality, etc. It's all part of form identification, contributing to the 'illusory self-image' of who you think you are. Ego continuously needs to feed and identify with forms to survive and strengthen its false sense of self. Since all things and conditions are subjected to the law of impermanence, that is to say fleeting , so the ego lives in a constant state of fear; anxiously looking for the next thing to identify with or to maintain its existing identifications to survive. Here's a few questions to ask yourself: What if you lost your looks, vigor, and health due to aging, illness, or an accident? Would you feel complete if you lost your status, job, knowledge, relationships, title, money, or possessions? Sooner or later you will have to relinquish these things and conditions anyway. When you’re on your deathbed, all forms, relationships, concepts, and conditions that you identified with will become irrelevant and illusory. [3] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 41. . Like a dream . This does not mean you can’t or shouldn't enjoy and honor relationships, experiences, things and passing pleasures of the world. When you truly realize their impermanent and passing nature, you honor and enjoy them more. It’s because fear of loss and attachment to forms, relationships, memories, and experiences lessen or dissolve. Their transient nature is allowed to be. Suffering arises when you seek yourself and long-lasting fulfillment in the fleeting world, relationships, pleasures, experiences, and things, which they can't give. If you didn't realize this, you will be condemned to chase after experiences, sensory or sexual pleasures, relationships, and things of this world, one after another, unconsciously seeking long lasting fulfillment, peace and sense of self, which they can't give. [4] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 80. Ask yourself, 'If I lost the things, assets, titles, relationships or conditions in my life, would I feel complete?' or 'What would I be without them?'. Feel the answer within your intelligent body, rather than asking the mind. Make the deep intuitive responses through inner-body or Being as the primary source of intelligence."

      "content": "Realize deeply that fundamentally it’s all in mind. Whether its desire, fear, jealousy, commentary about conditions, happiness, sadness, stuff you have, your achievements, looks, relationships, titles, longing, depression, your job, possessions, nationality, or any other identification. They are all ultimately conditioned thoughts and emotions that are attached to the primordial 'I' thought and its other forms; the Ego. Like your car becomes a thought in your head and gets attached to the primordial or conceptual 'I' thought and its other forms, that says 'I have a nice car' or 'my beatup car'. Similarly primordial 'I' thought or Egoic self attaches itself to other thought forms or labels, such as 'I have been suffering from depression/anxiety', 'My whole life has been a struggle', 'I make a lot of money', 'I am an average looking person', 'I have achieved this or that', ‘I was betrayed’, 'I am a woman/man/trans' etc. This, of course, doesn't mean to not enjoy things you have or use words and labels for communication and practical purposes. However, we are pointing to the phenomenon of identification with them. \"Ego is identification with form, primarily thought forms.\" Eckhart Tolle. It may seem like fear, desire, longing, frustration, anxiety, anger and so on are caused by external circumstances, events, and people but are actually mind-created. Example: You see a \"desirable\" thing, experience or person, and feelings and thoughts of desire and/or fear and/or frustration may arise. Which are conditioned responses. Be very alert to recognize that 'desire' or ‘frustration’ are not out there but are created by the mind that seeks forms, relationships, identity, security, experiences, pleasures, etc. in the transient world to enhance its ultimately fictitious sense of self with an unconscious expectation that they will provide long-lasting fulfillment. Then feels frustrated when it doesn't get them Another example: You experience pain, tension or pressure in your body and mental-emotional reactions (anxiety, worry, fear, etc.) arise in response to it. Be alert to recognize that suffering, which is psychological, is not caused by the condition (pain or pressure or tension) but due to your mostly negative and distorted conditioned thoughts, reactions, and emotions in response to it. As you will read later. That's why Ramanan Maharshi said, \"Mind is maya (illusion)\"."

Here's a practice: Simply watch your thought activity. Which is involuntary and usually arises in the front-left side of your head and chest .

Here's another pointer: if you are the 'watcher' or observer of the voice, reactions, physical sensations and emotions (observed), how can you be them? \"Recognizing the false as false is meditation. This must go on all the time\" Nisargadatta Maharaj. What is 'false' in you? Incessant 'voice in head', reactions and emotions; the conditioned mind. Doesn't matter how subtle or close to the point of awareness . A large part of suffering and the problems arise when you believe the voice, reactions, and emotions are \"you\" and follow or believe them.

      "content": "See that mind is an impostor that pretends to be you. Mind is a wonderful tool, but the problem comes when you seek yourself in it; then it becomes egoic mind and takes over your whole life. That's when your sense of self is derived from content and conditioning of your mind, which is based on past and identification with forms. This does not mean that all the thoughts are painful or unproductive. [11] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. \"A new Earth.\"Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005.

These can be practical and counter or replace negative, repetitive thoughts and beliefs; thus not letting you fall into a deeper level of unconsciousness (i.e. identification with the mind). However, they are no ordinary, repetitive or attention-seeking thoughts. So words or content can be part of your spiritual journey. However, deeply realize that words or content can at best point to the truth but are not the truth. [13] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 25.

      "content": "Recognize the impersonal nature of mind. Like a code or program repeatedly performs the same function, in the same way your conditioned mind runs you as a bundle of conditioned reflexes or reactions. [18] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 79 That is to say, you are not even there but a mind-created 'personality' or entity or psychological image or 'sense of self' that labels, judges, resists, interprets, reacts, interacts with other mind created images, personalities, and world. So, no wonder why so many human interactions and relationships are so inauthentic. It doesn't matter where you are, as long as the ego is running your life, same egoic patterns will emerge in different situations and places. Hence the saying \"Wherever you go, there you are.\" This is one of major reasons why ego is not personal. As all egos have same structure that is based on fear, desire, comparison, greed, attack, complain, self-pity, defense, judgement, anger, survival, seeking conflict and enemies, resistance to what is, and primarily identification with thought forms. No matter how well disguised. [19] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page72. Although some of them could be more predominant than others. For example: For some people self-pity could be a more predominant Egoic state than others. In other words, Egos differ only on the surface, deep down they are all the same. So, words or content or stories that Ego identifies with could be different on the surface but the underlying energy and structure is of the Ego. For example: Most people compare themselves with others using different aspects like looks, height, life stories, strength, money, wealth, nationality, national or regional history, knowledge, education, experiences, skills, job, background, upbringing, title, gender, location, even illnesses, stories, problems, etc. to feel superior or inferior, balance the comparison, judge, complain, feel victim, self-pity, etc. The words, language, aspects, things and so on they use to compare may be different on the surface but the underlying energy and structure is of the Ego that feeds on comparison, division, negativity, reactivity, and so on. Another example: Just like voice in your head speaks incessantly, similarly it speaks incessantly and compulsively in other people’s head. The words it speaks could be different on the surface(language, stories etc) but the underlying structure (energy, blockages , reactions, resistance, compulsiveness etc.) is of impersonal Ego. So, if you consider Ego a personal problem or personalized someone's unconsciousness, that's a sign of more ego. As ego loves to thrive on it. Once you truly see the impersonal and dysfunctional nature of conditioned mind or Ego, you naturally relinquish identification with it and become non-reactive, forgiving, tolerant, and compassionate towards yourself and others. Events and egoic patterns are not personalized or labelled as good or bad or even ‘neutral’. The 'fact of the moment' is allowed to be."

      "title": "Monitor what happens in your head.",
      "content": "Monitor what happens in your head. Our mind is conditioned by thousands of years of cultural, societal, genetic, and years of personal conditioning, which have a strong momentum. So trying, controlling, suppressing, resisting, or using will power, which are aspects of limited mind, in an attempt to dissolve the mental activity and pain are futile and strengthen the ego. [20] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 64, 116, 130, 243 It's because problems of the mind cannot be solved at the level of the mind. That's why it is said that you don't become good by trying to be good, but finding the good that's already within you. [21] X Research source So simply watch the automatic conditioned narration or commentary of mind with high alertness to go beyond it. When you watch, you reclaim trapped consciousness from the mind and more clearly see the dysfunction and irrationality of the 'voice in the head' that causes so much self-created suffering by resisting, commentating, and labeling 'what is'. [22] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 8,12,10. Its because 'Watching' or awareness is a new dimension of consciousness that is not part of thinking mind. More you watch or negate the mind and/or feel the formless dimension, compulsive and conditioned thinking slows as watching or negating the mind imply stepping out of it. Example: Have you noticed when you procrastinate, the 'voice in the head' or sensation of thought and emotions that accompany it say something like 'I can do it later' or 'You have lot of time', etc.? If you simply observe the voice or allow it to be, even if it hypnotizes you to procrastinate, because of degree of identification with it, you may notice how dysfunctional the voice and unproductive procrastination are. In a way, it's like collecting evidence (truth) and seeing the insanity of the 'voice in head' more clearly and to disidentify from it. That's when presence deepens, and ego starts to dissolve and separation of thinking (observed) and awareness (observer) begins. As you realize that you are not your mind but the observing presence or awareness behind it. This realization is the greatest discovery of humanity. Similarly, when you detect mental-emotional resistance within, just observe and allow it to be. Deeply realize that resistance serves no purpose and in fact is dysfunctional, can never dissolve the pain, keeps the undesirable situation, condition and thought patterns in place, and is more disturbing than the original cause its trying to dissolve . [23] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 18 . Resistance only keeps the Ego alive, which is why it loves it. Watching the 'voice in head' or mind also implies to watch and detect the background psychological unease, non-verbal urges, tension, impulses, physical movements or reactions (more on this later), negative emotions, mental noise and pre-verbalized thoughts and reactions, which are aspects of egoic mind, that are so deeply embedded and considered normal that many people are not even aware of them. Watching doesn't mean criticizing or condemn or ignoring or fighting the 'voice in head', else it would be the same voice that came through the back door. This also implies to Not treat Ego as an obstacle or enemy or means to an end. Again, you can never dissolve unconsciousness or Ego and emotional pain by fighting, resisting, trying, controlling, suppressing, making it a personal problem or running away from them. Bringing them in the 'light of your awareness' is all that is needed. In other words, to dissolve the ego, in essence, there is no doing or trying required but an alert seeing and/or shifting attention to the Now and/or acceptance and/or negating the egoic mind. So watch it impartially without judgement. Here's another way to look at it: Fighting, resistance, reactions, suppression, trying, condemning etc. arise in form of conditioned thoughts, emotions or reactions, and you are not your thoughts, reactions and emotions. In other words, one part of mind is fighting the other part. True intelligence is formless, unconditioned and intuitive. That's why be aware of deeper feeling responses as you read. \"Don't take your thoughts seriously.\" Eckhart Tolle. Being rooted in the inner body is an essential aspect of being present and to be the watcher of the mind and disidentify from it. Else, the mind will take you over like a wild river. When you are rooted in your spacious inner body, attention is withdrawn from the mind or Egoic structures, to the Now. That is to say, attention remains in its unmanifested state. You can also experiment to notice that there's no suffering when your attention is in the Now. While you suffer when attention is trapped in useless and compulsive thinking, mental patterns, emotions (negativity) and reactions."

It’s because when you are in mind identified state, you are subject to karmic cycle of action and reaction, good or bad, because your actions and words arise out of your conditioned mind, which is dysfunctional and based on past. However, when you simply watch, a new dimension of consciousness emerges through, that is not part of thinking and not subject to law of karmic cycle and mind made 'polar opposites'. As awareness has no opposite because it’s formless and beyond form. That's why just being aware and non-reactive is so powerful and peaceful.

So, it becomes more important to acknowledge and watch or allow the resistive mental-emotional patterns than incessant thinking or events (thoughts, people, situations, conditions etc.) that trigger it.

Often these mental stories are distortions of the truth and designed to trigger the biggest possible reactions, so Ego can feed on them to strengthen its false sense of self. \"She rejected me, I am ugly and a loser\", \"Why is it raining? I hate this weather\", \"He didn't have the decency to text me back.\", \"I am feeling so much pain. Why this feeling won't go away?\" etc. Can you refrain from adding mental stories commentary or narration to 'what is' and just see the 'suchness' or ‘fact of this moment’? Buddha called it Tathata . How simple life would be without those mental stories. [27] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. \"Stillness Speaks\" Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2003.

You don't suffer or feel uncertain or angry or sad because of the situation or condition or physical pain. However, you feel unhappy because of the automatic negative thoughts or stories that come in response to it and degree of identification with them. \"There's nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.\" William Shakespeare. Here's a spiritual practice: watch the situation or condition as well as the mental-emotional reactions or thoughts that come in response to it.

Mental positions like viewpoints, opinions, dogmas, interpretations, etc., which by their very nature are limited and are ultimately no more than a bundle of thoughts, doesn't matter how deeply rooted and unconscious, that the Ego has identified with to get a false sense of \"I know\" and \"self\". This identification has caused separation, conflicts, violence, and wars. While only \"inner space\" or unconditioned consciousness or presence within can provide a true perspective or holistic answer that's in alignment with the totality of the universe. Be aware and alert as the ego is very clever as it may identify with facts and make them as mental positions to ensure its survival. For example: the relative fact that the earth rotates or spins towards the east may become a mental position in your head and in case you get into an argument with someone about it, you may be defending your mental position and not the truth. Like \"Believe me that earth rotates towards the east\". Look closely and you will see that Ego is hiding in the word \"me\". \"Truth doesn't need any defense.\" Eckhart Tolle. Here's an experiment: Next time you feel a compulsive need to be right, urge to react, argue, resist, interject, control, defend a mental position etc., which is basically identification with mind i.e. ego and a form of violence, can you drop it just to see what happens? Allowing the 'false self' to diminish and de-emphasizing your form identity are powerful spiritual practices. That is what Jesus meant when he said \"Deny thyself\". In other words, deny the false in you. This allowing of the diminishment or vulnerability makes way for your true power to shine through. The formless truth within that you are beyond your name and form. \"Only by becoming vulnerable can you discover your true and essential invulnerability\" Eckhart Tolle. However, it doesn't mean to let yourself be abused by people or put up with bad behavior. There may be times when you would have to say a non-reactive and firm no (in no uncertain terms), express something clearly, take action, walk out of a situation, etc. With spiritual energy behind your words and actions, there will be great power.

That's why if your inner psyche is polluted i.e. when you are completely identified with dysfunctional mind, then the materialized form will be polluted as well.

Egoic emotions (fear, anxiety, depression, sorrow and so on) come in response to unhappy(mostly fearful) egoic thoughts. Since body cannot tell the difference between thoughts and what's actually happening, so egoic emotions have no outlet because there's no actual danger. So the energy gets trapped, becomes toxic and interferes with the harmonious functions of the body and creates illnesses. Which is why it is said Ego is pathological.

Which is a collective disease on our planet. As your presence deepens, you will have more and more of a choice to step out or negate egoic emotions to the inner-space.

So, it’s an effective practice to catch and witness the pain-body in its early stages, before it takes you over. That is to say, detect it the moment it becomes activated or comes out of its dormant state. Since there's no way out of pain (anxiety, fear, anger, worry, sorrow or whatever it is), the only way is through. Take your attention deeper into it or feel it fully but don't think about it. In other words, bring the pain-body into your 'light of consciousness' or accept it rather than fighting or trying to control or run away from it. Which are futile anyway and cause further suffering. In case pointers like 'allow it to be' or 'feeling it fully' get misinterpreted as clinging, dwelling, or resisting the pain body, it helps to shift attention from pain-body to the inner energy field of body (wherever it feels most natural) and/or breath and/or sense perceptions and/or constructive activity. Especially when pain-body is about to get activated. If that's not possible, accept it as part of \"suchness\" of the present moment by allowing it to be there or remove yourself from the situation, if possible. When you become friendly and/or ok with your pain and/or don't resist it i.e. when you allow it to be, only then it becomes a fuel that transforms into consciousness, like coal that burns into heat and light. \"If you don't mind being unhappy then what happens to the unhappiness?\" Eckhart Tolle. You can express or describe the isness or fact of how the pain-body feels like but don't let it come up and turn into thinking. [35] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 131. . Even if it comes up, watch or negate the negative thoughts. When you become unconscious, that is to say when you become identified with thinking and emotions (or pain body), then later guilt may arise. Which may say something like \"I shouldn't have lost my calm there.\", \"I shouldn't have said those things.\" etc. Observe and allow it to be. As guilt is one of the cleverest ego's strategies to keep you identified with it. In other words, resisting or identifying with the feelings and thoughts of 'guilt' means Ego came through the back door. So, simply forgive yourself and enter the Now from there. Why add a layer of negative story and psychological pain to 'what already is' the case? Forgiveness becomes easier when you deeply realize that one doesn't have a \"choice\" when they are in the grip of the pain-body and/or Ego but to act them out. Although they still suffer the consequences of their unconsciousness i.e. identification with mind. As long as the structure behind pain-body and Ego is not recognized as impersonal and not who you are, they will take you over again and again and make you unconscious, spiritually speaking. Also, it’s essential to dissolve the pain-body to be free of Ego, as they are close relatives and need each other."

      "title": "Accept what is.",
      "content": "Accept what is. The most natural way to live life is to completely accept the present moment the way it is. [36] X Research source In other words, offer no resistance to life. Which is now and never not Now. There is a saying in Zen, \"All that arises, passes away.\" Which means resistance is futile. The more you are aware, deeply you realize this to be true. So completely accept whatever arises in the present moment, as if it was your choice . [37] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 221 For example, people around you, your habits (bad or good), your physical appearance, thoughts you are thinking now (including persistent negative mental-emotional patterns, blockages , interpretation or commentary of the events, people, thoughts about things you said or did), suchness of pain-body, your location, life situation at this moment, experiences, condition you are in, etc. Fundamentally, accept any form this moment takes without adding any judgments or mental labeling or commentary, because it is as it is. Deeply realize that your whole life unfolds in the Now. This renders the mind powerless because its very nature is based on a dysfunctional relationship and resistance to 'Here and Now' or 'what is'. In addition, resistance is what keeps the suffering and pain alive. In the state of acceptance, you clearly see what action, if needed, to take. This action is truly intelligent because it's in alignment with One consciousness . Negativity or dissatisfaction may motivate you to take action to change your life situation, but sooner or later you will realize that it keeps you stuck in suffering; even if your life situation and external environment has drastically improved. It's because inner resistive patterns have not been dissolved. If acceptance of the outer form is not possible then bring inner acceptance. This means to say an 'inner yes' to present moment, doesn't matter what you say or do externally. What does it mean to say an 'inner yes' or 'surrender to what is'? It means to say 'yes' to the thoughts (including stories), persistent reactions, mental patterns and emotions that are arising at \"this\" moment in response to anything (situation, condition, people, other thoughts and emotions), by allowing, accepting, watching, being aware, giving them full attention, etc. However, you don't have to follow them. It’s because identification with thoughts and emotions creates a lot of problems too. [38] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 40 When there is true inner acceptance, you step out of thousands of years of conditioning or 'living past' in you and an intelligent response, if required, comes from infinitely intelligent 'unconditioned consciousness' or space within. Not from the limited conditioned mind. There will be times when you would have to say 'No’, but that would be a deeper or a high quality 'no', not a reactive or conditioned one. So do experiments, like non-reactively refuse to follow some thoughts and emotions (including pre-verbalized thoughts and reactions) and then see the result. However, there should always be an inner acceptance or inner yes. Or else you will suffer. Again, suffering, which is psychological, always arises due to some form of non-acceptance (negativity or resistance) i.e negative thoughts to 'what is' and not because of the situation, person, emotions, sensations or condition. Here's an experiment to see it: Whenever you detect psychological pain in you, intensely become aware of inner space and/or breath and/or negate the thoughts around it and/or feel the inner body. See if it dissolves the pain partially or fully. Smiling also helps to shift attention to the Now. When you are completely in inner alignment with what happens or arises in the now, that is to say when you are 'one with life,' circumstances or conditions lose power over your state of consciousness. Just like the depth of the lake remains unaffected regardless of the weather. The miracle is when you are in inner alignment with 'what is', outer circumstances and inner conditions (illness, pain, wounds, etc.) tend to heal or improve greatly and quickly without a great deal of doing on your part. Also, synchronistic chance encounters and favorable events happen more frequently. It’s because you are connected to One Consciousness or One life underneath all forms. If acceptance is not possible then accept that you cannot accept. This means allowing the thoughts, reactions, and patterns of non-acceptance to be. Otherwise, take action or remove yourself from the situation, if possible. Anything else is madness."

      "title": "Surrender.",
      "content": "Surrender. \"Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life\" (Eckhart Tolle in \"The Power of Now\"). In other words, surrender is inner acceptance of what is, without any reservations. [42] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 205 In more direct words, Surrender is allowing or accepting the thoughts, reactions, and emotions that are arising at \"this\" moment in response to anything (conditions, situations, thoughts, memories, sensations, surroundings, emotions, or people). Don't misinterpret the meaning of surrender. For example: If you have a disease or illness and you say \"Ok...I surrender to the illness\", which is a mental position, that's not surrender. Surrender doesn't mean resigning or ignoring the life situation, condition, or story about illness and do nothing about it, which wouldn't work anyway, but yield to whatever arises within (thoughts, emotions, reactions, pain, pressure in body, sensations, etc.) in the tiny segment called the Now . Else, the clever Ego will continue to survive underneath the mental label or concept of surrender. Ask yourself, \"What's the problem at this moment?\" You are reading 'this' now. Even if you are suffering from a terminal condition or illness, that condition, at \"this\" moment, could be pressure, weakness, physical pain, burning sensation, tension, etc. you are experiencing somewhere in your body and head, and that is what you surrender to. In addition, allow or accept the label of condition, emotional story, idea of illness, condition or life situation that say something like \"I have had this condition my whole life. Life has treated me harshly\" or \"I have been suffering from depression for last 20 years\" and/or \"I am dying from cancer\" and/or \"I was betrayed/rejected by my own family\", “What happened with me was wrong.”, \"I have been trying to get what I want for a long time.\" etc. Allow these Egoic stories or mental commentary, which are conditioned thoughts accompanied by negative emotions that are arising in the space of Now, to be. Also, notice that these stories and thoughts make you suffer so much more than the actual situation or condition. Some of these thoughts (stories) can be pretty deep-seated and subtle, so an intense alertness is required to bring them in the light of your awareness and accept them. However, if these stories have become part of your identity or sense of self, you may not be able to recognize them for what they are and let go of them. There's no suffering in the Now because there are no problems in the Now. As suffering needs time and a mind-made story. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. It’s because that's the most precious thing and the only time there is. Ego loves to identify with labels or stories or problems, complain, react, etc. without any true intention of solving or letting go of them. In fact, the ego never wants an end to its problems because it gives it a false sense of self or identity. Without them, who are you? So, you will only surrender when you are ready to let go of the victim story, negative thoughts about illness or condition or something that happened, resentment, complaints, resistance, etc. because you realize that they have no purpose other than to keep the 'false sense of self' or Ego and suffering alive. Even if you need to take action to resolve a life situation or deal with a condition or challenge, you can do so Now because the time is always Now and you have power only in the Now. \"What at this moment is lacking?\" (Zen saying) Surrender happens naturally when you relinquish the 'inner state of war' or resistance, and suffer willingly because you see the futility and suffering nature of inner resistance and egoic habits. You surrender because you can't take the pain or constant torture of mind (psychological suffering) anymore, which is always due to resistance to the Now. The phrase from Bible \"Not my will but thy will be done\" points to this truth. Only a surrendered person has spiritual power. Hence, there's a great strength in surrender, and it is perfectly compatible with action. It’s because in that state, your actions and words arise out of unconditioned consciousness, infinitely more powerful than conditioned mind [43] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 83 So surrendering to 'what is' is the most powerful practice to end suffering and realize who you are beyond your name and form. Also, if you look deeply, you will see that all spiritual practices ultimately lead to surrender to the Now because all of them directly or indirectly point to yielding or inner acceptance of 'what is'. When you truly realize that resistance is mad, delusional and futile, a shift happens and peace emerges through you. This is the peace of God , that bypasses all understanding. [44] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 56. . However, for some, it may require deepening of presence to fully realize this truth, as resistance to ‘what-is’ is a deep seated habit and identification with mind has momentum and hypnotic pull from many years of compulsive and self-serving thinking."

Here's another pointer: Who is aware of the sensations or tension in your body and head? Who knows or sees the unhappy emotions or unease in you? Your mind may be reacting with things like 'This article is stupid', 'What is this?', 'I'm a loser', 'I can't stop thinking', 'The author is a moron,' etc. That's not you. It's your mind in its habitual resistive and survival mode, reacting to these pointers. Don't give it any reality. Just allow it to be. Your presence or awareness is more than capable of dissolving the phantom self ( Egoic entity ) pretending to be you. If something deeper in you is responding to these words then the process of awakening has begun in you. That's why don't just read with your mind, but pay attention to any deeper feeling responses as you read. Once you learn of the basic dysfunction i.e. identification with the mind and workings of Ego then you don't need to learn a lot of spiritual truth to become free of it, recognize its mechanics and avoid its traps as they arise in the Now. So Now is the key. Awareness is the key. It's possible that in the future the mind and/or pain-body will take you over and push you into a state of suffering, despair, and unconsciousness. But remember, suffering can either push you deeper into more unconsciousness or it can become your greatest teacher to enlightenment by forcing you to accept what-is, depending on the degree of consciousness in you. Be aware. Stay present. Deeply realize that suffering has a noble purpose. According to a Buddhist saying, \"All suffering is an illusion.\" It is true. The question is: Is it true for you?

If conditioned thoughts, emotions, and urges to speak arise, allow them to be but don't act on them. True listening is a rare art, as most of the time when people are “listening”, they are analyzing the words, waiting to speak, preparing or planning for the next thing to say, lost in their own thoughts and mental movies, etc. [54] X Research source Experiment. While interacting with people just listen without any judgement or interpretation. Don't validate or confirm their story by reacting or resisting, no matter how sad or great it is. That is to say, look through their ego rather than looking at it. When you look at the ego, it's your ego that's looking. But when you look through the ego, it's the awareness that you are looking at itself, because essence of all things and beings is formless consciousness . In other words, relinquish all mental positions or judgments and be there as a field of spacious presence by inhabiting the inner body deeply.

So listen and look through your mind, which also implies watching the mind. Recognize the interconnection? What you do to others, you do to yourself. So, when you look through other people's ego, you also naturally go deeper within yourself. That's why it is said that human interaction can be a great spiritual practice.

The resistance (irritation, anger, discontent and so on) that it creates is far more disturbing than the original cause that it is attempting to dissolve. It may seem like the situation or condition are causing the suffering but if you look deeply, it is actually the automatic mental-emotional resistance in response to them. We spoke about this earlier. \"The greatest difficulty is the mental resistance to things that arise, and the underlying assumption is that they should not\" (Eckhart Tolle). Resisting 'what is' is no different than doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. Which is also how Einstein defined insanity when he said \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\" To deal with the automatic mental resistance, be there as the background witnessing presence or the Knower and/or allow or accept it to be or offer up your suffering to God.

Have you noticed when an egoic reaction arises, then it is usually reflected on an emotional-physical level in form of pressure, movement, sensations, twitching, tension etc. in brain, heart, body, tongue, chest, hands, legs, face muscles (which also include involuntary facial expressions) etc. If you are alert enough, you may notice sensations, tension or movement in muscles or body parts as if trying to control or fight or suppress 'what is' (thoughts, emotions, condition, situation etc.) in form of fidgeting, muscle contraction and expansion, leg shaking, clenching hands, teeth grinding etc. These are the reflections of egoic reactions on a physical level. The stronger the reaction, more tense the brain, face or body muscles become and may even cause physical pain. Just as you watch the thoughts and emotions in you, detect and watch the physical reactions and patterns. As becoming aware of physical and/or emotional reactions also makes you more aware of Egoic reactions, especially pre-verbalized and unconscious ones, that cause them. For example: Body may respond to an anxiety pattern or reaction, even before it becomes a thought, in form of leg/legs shaking, fidgeting, anxious emotions in your chest and/or head, you grinding or clenching your teeth, scratching objects, biting your lip or finger nails or inside of your mouth, tension in face, brain, muscles, and so on.

For example: You may notice your arms and legs being tired after fidgeting or shaking for a long time while you were taken over by anxiety in you, experience pain after biting your mouth/lips/fingers or digging your nails in your palm or fingers or pressing your knees, elbows or feet against a furniture, headache or soar body after muscles contraction or tension, stinging sensation after unconsciously rubbing toes and fingers or scratching body parts, and so on. This can also be seen as an evidence of how self-destructive Ego can be. Even the slightest and subtle physical and/or mental and/or emotional reactions or patterns need to be detected and accepted or else they will continue to remain unconscious, inflict suffering and run your life. Therefore, a high degree of alertness is required. Here's a hint: see if you can detect physical reactions or patterns like tension in heart, tongue, cheeks, jaw and brain muscles in response to an undesirable thought, reaction, situation, condition or people, as if trying to control, deny, fight, control or suppress them. That is to say, resisting 'what-is'. To detect these reactions, it helps immensely to be aware of inner body. Also, it’s relatively easier to detect physical reactions than subtle mental-emotional ones that cause them as they are little more tangible. As awareness or presence deepens, it becomes easier to detect involuntary physical patterns deep in the core of head and face. Like muscles moving and becoming tense. Notice the same muscles involuntarily firing up when you encounter something \"unpleasant\". Becoming aware of these muscle movement also makes you aware and dissolve the Egoic entity which is so concentrated in head."

      "content": "Free yourself from all concepts . Did you notice your mental interpretation after reading 'Watch your inner-self', 'Accept what is' and other pointers in the article? Your mind may have asked something like, 'How can I watch my inner self?' or 'What does 'watching inner self' even mean?' And mental answers to these questions may become your definition of 'watching your inner-self'. That is to say ego has found another concept or construct to identify with. [63] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>A New Earth.</i> Vancouver, BC: Penguin, 2005. Page 43-44. As mind has a compulsive need to conceptualize or label or understand ‘what-is’, because that's all it knows. In other words, concepts (thoughts) are familiar to the mind and mind adheres to the known. As it thinks unknown is dangerous. This is one of the reasons why egoic mind ignores and dislikes the present moment. Concepts and pointers can be part of your spiritual journey, but deeply realize that they are no more than stepping stones or viewpoints to be left as quickly as possible, and never to be taken as absolute truth. [64] X Research source Tolle, Eckhart. <i>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.</i> Vancouver, BC: Namaste Publishing, 1999. Page 9 Again, thought, by its very nature is limited, can never dissolve the psychological pain and can at most show you the relative truth. In your spiritual journey, concepts may get replaced with more helpful spiritual sounding concepts or explanations or pointers. However, they are still bundles of words (thoughts). True intelligence is holistic, formless and unconditioned. It's the stillness within you. This is also pointed in Tao Te Ching, \"Can you step back from your own mind and thus understand all things?\"."

      "content": "Meditate. It may seem like a cliché, but meditation essentially means to be present. In essence, there's no trying or doing involved, but keeping your full or part of your attention in the Now. [65] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Since time is always Now, so you can be present, fully or to some degree while doing any task like interacting with someone, sitting, working, cooking, walking, even while thinking, etc. So, allotting dedicated time for meditation is not always necessary. Here are a few structureless meditation practices : Be aware of your breath as much as you can. Feel the flow of in-breath and out-breath, notice the gaps between inhaling and exhaling cycles, movement of your belly, sound, and so on. Simply witnessing the breath naturally creates a gap between incessant stream of pointless, compulsive, and repetitive thinking and emotions. Or at least slows them down because attention is shifted or withdrawn from mind to the Now. Witness or watch your thoughts, reactions, and emotions as they arise. We talked about this already. Become aware of your inner body. Can you feel that your body is alive and full of life ? Vibrant energy field in your feet, legs, thighs, pelvis, abdomen, back, chest, hands, shoulders, neck, head, face, lips, nose and so on. That's the intelligent life , inseparable from One Life, that animates and runs thousands of incredibly complex functions of your body synchronously. Only through feeling the inner energy field of the body can you connect with it. Also, being rooted within inner body is an essential aspect to be present. Become aware of your sense perceptions. Can you just look, taste, listen, touch, and see without any mental commentary? Give full attention to whatever you are doing Now. For example: when you are walking, give full attention to each step, movement of your body parts, feel the sensation of feet touching the ground etc. That anchors you to the Now."
