Many of these games test seniors’ memory and encourage them to think strategically, while also helping them connect with others socially. [16] X Research source Here are a few fun games that can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards : Gin Rummy : A classic 2-player card game that involves using your hand to form “melds,” which are either sequences of three or more cards of the same suit, or groups of three or more cards of the same rank. [17] X Research source It’s a bit complicated to learn, but very rewarding for seniors once they master it! Bridge : In bridge, each player is dealt 13 cards. One person plays a card from their hand, and all other players must play a card of the same suit (if they can). Whoever has the highest ranked card wins that round (called a “trick”) and leads the next one. [18] X Research source Players are split into teams, so this game is a wonderful way for seniors to engage in some teamwork. Crazy Eights : Each player receives 7 cards, and the rest of the cards form the discard pile. To discard a card, it must match either the rank or suit of the card that’s at the top of the discard pile during your turn. The goal of crazy eights is to be the first player to discard all of your cards. [19] X Research source Hearts : The object of hearts is to be the player with the lowest penalty score at the end of the game, so players try to avoid ending up with heart cards (which = 1 penalty point) and the queen of spades card (which = 13 penalty points). [20] X Research source Old Maid : To play old maid, you’ll need to remove three queens from the deck. The remaining queen is the “old maid” card. Each person takes turns playing pairs of cards of the same rank and color, until there are no more pairs to be played. The player who is left with the old maid card (the queen with no pair) loses, while everyone else wins. [21] X Research source Solitaire : Solitaire is a mentally stimulating single-player card game, so it’s a great option if you (or the senior in your life) are looking for a fun way to fill up some alone time.

To play a card from your hand, you need to match it to the top card on the discard pile by number, color, or the symbol/action on the card. When a player has only one card left, they must yell “Uno!” The first player to discard all their cards wins the round. [23] X Research source Apples to Apples : Apples to Apples is appropriate for all ages and leads to lots of laughs, so it’s a great option to cheer up a senior who has been feeling sad lately. In each round, one player acts as a judge and picks a green apple card, which features an adjective. Each of the other players puts down a red apple card from their hand that they think matches the adjective. The judge then picks a winner, and that person gets to keep the green card. [24] X Research source Exploding Kittens : Exploding Kittens is an exciting card game to play with friends or family, and it’s sure to keep seniors engaged and entertained. Different cards in the deck do different things, like skipping your turn or forcing other players to draw two in a row. The object of the game is to defuse exploding kitten cards before they blow you up (if you draw an exploding kitten card and don’t have a defuse card to play, you’re eliminated).
