If you want to get a premade scrub, then you should be able to find one with no problem. If you’d rather make your own, then you can use ingredients that you may already have in your kitchen. [2] X Research source To make your own exfoliating sugar scrub, add a tablespoon of sugar to a teaspoon of olive oil or coconut oil (at room temperature). Combine the sugar and oil until it they form a paste. You can keep the scrub in a small jar or other container in your refrigerator for up to a week. If you prefer to make the scrub fresh when you need it, then just take a pinch of sugar and few drops of oil and mix them together whenever you want to exfoliate your lips."

      "content": "Choose a moisturizing lipstick. Look for a lipstick that is moisturizing rather than long lasting. Long lasting lipsticks may dry out or irritate your lips more than other types of lipstick. If you are planning on some serious kissing, then you may want to go with a nude or pale pink shade rather than a bright red or coral. Otherwise your kissing partner may end up with lipstick all over. A lip stain may also be a good choice because stains do not come off your lips as easily. [10] X Research source"

Or, hold an ice cube or a piece of fruit, such as a grape or a strawberry, against your lips for a few seconds before you put it into your mouth. To send a stronger signal, try making eye contact with the person you want to kiss as you touch your lips."

This should help him or her to understand that you want to be kissed. [12] X Research source"
