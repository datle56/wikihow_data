      "title": "Wash your face.",
      "content": "Wash your face. While the water is heating, wash your face to remove makeup and dirt. Use a gentle face cleanser and warm water. Removing makeup and dirt is a must before steaming, because steaming opens up your pores, and anything on your face will be able to get inside and cause irritation or pimples to occur. [2] X Research source If you have especially sensitive or dry skin, it might be prudent to reduce the chance of experiencing irritation by forgoing exfoliation and opting for a gentler technique. After washing your face, pat it dry with a towel. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the water into a bowl. Pour it into a glass or ceramic bowl resting on a folded towel or two. Part of the facial experience is to add some beauty to your day, so if you have a pretty bowl on hand, use that one! If you're in a hurry, you can also just use the pot you boiled the water in."

      "content": "Add herbs or essential oils. You don't have to add anything to your steam, but to make it truly special you can add some fresh or dried herbs or essential oils that will release beneficial aromas. [4] X Research source An herbal teabag will also do the trick! Try the following herbs and oils to enhance your steam: [5] X Research source Use lemongrass or peppermint for an energizing steam. Use chamomile or lavender for a relaxing steam. Use peppermint or eucalyptus for a cold-conquering steam. Use sandalwood or bergamot for a stress-relieving steam."

      "title": "Hold your face over the steaming water.",
      "content": "Hold your face over the steaming water. Drape a towel over your head so that it creates a sort of tent over your face, and hold your face over the water. Keep your face over the steam for about 10 minutes. Close your eyes and breathe deeply, allowing the heat to awaken your face and open your pores. Don't steam your face for too long, or get too close to the hot water. The heat can cause inflammation if exposure is too high. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Smooth a mask over your face.",
      "content": "Smooth a mask over your face. The next step is to use a mask to pull the impurities from your now-open pores. A clay mask works well if you have one on hand. [7] X Research source Mix the clay with some water and smooth it over your face. Let it sit on your face for about 15 minutes before gently rinsing it off with lukewarm water. If you don't wish to do a mask, just rinse your face in fresh water after you're finished steaming it."

      "title": "Use a toner to close your pores.",
      "content": "Use a toner to close your pores. Time to close up your pores again! Do this so that after your facial, dirt doesn't get into your pores. Using a toner after steaming will help your face look toned and fresh. Use a cotton ball to apply the toner of your choice to your nose, forehead, cheeks and chin. [8] X Research source You can also use lemon juice as a toner. Try this on a small area of skin prior to using on your whole face, some individuals may be more sensitive to this than others."

      "title": "Moisturize your face.",
      "content": "Moisturize your face. The final step in your facial is to apply a moisturizer to keep your face hydrated. Steaming it can actually dry it out, so this is an important step. Smooth on your favorite moisturizer, or try a face-softening oil like coconut oil, jojoba oil or argan oil. [10] X Research source Pay attention to the ingredients on oils to verify that they natural and have no harsh chemical additives."

      "content": "Stand with your face in or close to the steam for about 5 minutes. There's no need to use a towel to direct the steam to your face, since you'll be standing a column of steam trapped in by the sides of your shower. Let your face steam for about five minutes, then turn the heat down to a milder temperature to finish your shower."

      "content": "Apply toner and moisturizer. When you finish your shower, pat your skin dry and apply toner, then moisturizer to your face. You might want to apply moisturizer to the rest of your body, too, since the hot steam can cause your skin to dry out."
