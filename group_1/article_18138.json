Make sure you read the submissions page to find out how they want you to format your poem before continuing. [1] X Research source For instance, some publications prefer blind submissions, meaning you won't put your name on the document itself. Others want your information on every page. Find the button marked \"Submit\" or \"Submissions\" on the publication's home page. You might see \"For Authors\" instead."

Click on the bottom of the triangle where the tiny rectangle is so that both triangles move at once. Move it over 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). You can use this option in word processing software such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

To change the margins, look for \"Margins\" tab under \"Page Layout.\" You can also adjust margins by clicking on the tiny triangles at the edges of the page that are set on rulers.

However, you should leave an extra line between stanzas to show where one ends and the next one begins. [6] X Research source To skip a line between stanzas, hit return twice instead of once. If your word processor automatically adds a space between paragraphs, change that setting because it will treat each line like a paragraph. Highlight the text and then right-click on it.
