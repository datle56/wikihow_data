      "content": "A clear head will make it easier for you to stay focused. It’s completely normal to feel hurt and upset after you find out your boyfriend is cheating, no matter if it’s the first time or if he’s done it before. Resist the urge to immediately contact your boyfriend and confront him. Instead, give yourself some time to cool off so you’re a little less stressed and emotional. That way, you’ll be able to have a rational conversation with your soon-to-be ex. [1] X Research source It could take a few hours or a few days, but give yourself the time and space you need to process everything and approach the conversation logically. Avoid giving in to the temptation to attack him in person or online. It could turn into a messy scene that you might regret later."

      "title": "Tell them it’s over face-to-face if you can.",
      "content": "Tell them it’s over face-to-face if you can. Give your boyfriend a call or send him a message saying you need to talk to him. Choose a place that’s neutral and where you both feel at ease such as a coffee shop or a park. Set a time where you can have some privacy and put away distractions like phones so you can talk. [2] X Research source Try to avoid meeting up in places such as your home or his home, which can make it tougher to leave if things get heated. If you can’t meet up in person, try scheduling a video call so you can see each other or a phone call so you can hear their voice, which can give you insight into how they’re feeling."

      "title": "Stick to the facts and try as best you can to keep from getting emotional.",
      "content": "Stick to the facts and try as best you can to keep from getting emotional. Talk about what you know happened between your boyfriend and the other person. Keep a clear head and present the information without getting angry or upset. Focus on the fact that you’re planning to end the relationship and all you need to do is get through the breakup conversation. It can help stop you from getting emotional. [3] X Research source For instance, you could say something like, “I know that you hooked up with someone. My friend saw you two kissing at a party.” You could also try something like, “You said you were working late. I called your office and they said you weren’t there so you lied to me.” If he tries to interrupt or cut you off, hold your ground and say something firm like, “I’m not finished. Let me talk.” If your boyfriend tries to get up and leave when you tell him about his cheating, that’s fine. Let him go! Just let him know that your relationship is over as he leaves."

      "title": "Allow him to try to explain what led him to cheat.",
      "content": "Allow him to try to explain what led him to cheat. Don’t allow him to justify his behavior or blame someone or something else for causing him to cheat. However, you can give him the opportunity to be open about any problems or unhappiness in your relationship that may have contributed to his cheating. But keep in mind that cheating is a choice that he made and you don’t have to feel sorry for him or responsible for his actions. [4] X Research source Sometimes, cheating can happen because the cheater felt mistreated or undervalued in a relationship. It doesn’t excuse it. But it may be helpful to you to know their logic. If he gets defensive or tries to shift the blame, don’t fall for it. At the end of the day, your boyfriend decided to cheat. Alcohol or the influence of another person isn’t a legitimate reason to do it."

Prevent asking yourself questions that can torment you in the future and keep you from moving on. Ask him for specifics, but avoid questions that end with the phrase “than me,” like “Are they better than me?” or “Do you love them more than me?” which won’t actually make you feel any better, whether he lies or tells the truth. [5] X Research source For instance, the “Did you?” questions might help you move on. You could ask things like, “Did you take them to your bed?” or “Did your friends know?” If you don’t want to know the details, that’s totally fine, too. You don’t have to ask him."

      "content": "A healthy discussion can help you end things with a feeling of finality. At a certain point in the conversation, you will have said everything you’ve wanted to say and you may no longer be interested in hearing what he has to say. That’s totally fine and it’s a sign that you can end it there. If you need to talk more about the breakup with them or if you need to figure out details like picking up belongings, tell him you’ll get in touch with him later. Otherwise, you can walk away from the conversation and the relationship. [8] X Research source Say something like, “Well, I’ve said all I needed to say, so I think we’re done here.” You could also try, “I’ll call you sometime next week to come get my stuff and I’ll drop off yours as well.”"
