      "title": "Draw your tattoo design on your skin.",
      "content": "Draw your tattoo design on your skin. Take your sharpie, and draw your tattoo directly onto your skin. [1] X Research source You can use multiple colors of sharpie if you like, but keep in mind that whatever you draw will be the 'permanent' version. It may be easier to have a friend help with this part, to make sure that your drawing is just right. Wait for the sharpie to dry completely."

    {
      "title": "Coat the drawing in baby powder.",
      "content": "Coat the drawing in baby powder. Pour a generous amount of baby powder into your hand, and thoroughly coat the sharpie drawing with the powder. Rub it into the drawing; it shouldn't bleed or smear. Wipe off any excess powder that doesn't stick to your skin. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray the tattoo with hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray the tattoo with hairspray. Hold a can of hairspray 12–16 inches (30.5–40.6 cm) away from your tattoo, and spray over the entire thing. Make sure to thoroughly coat the tattoo and baby powder, although be careful not to get it all over the place. Wait for the hairspray to dry. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe off all of the excess.",
      "content": "Wipe off all of the excess. Use a tissue to carefully wipe away any extra baby powder or hairspray around the tattoo. When the hairspray is dry, the tattoo should be 'permanent' and won't smear when rubbed with a tissue. This method should make the tattoo last for up to a month. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Trace your tattoo onto your tracing paper.",
      "content": "Trace your tattoo onto your tracing paper. If you're copying an image, place your tracing paper over the top of the image and carefully draw the outline. Attempt to place it on as flat of a surface on your arm as possible. Otherwise, draw the tattoo you would like onto tracing paper (even if you don't have to trace). You can use multiple shades of sharpie if you would like, but make sure it is a 'sharpie' and not another type of pen or ink."

    {
      "title": "Coat your skin with gel deodorant.",
      "content": "Coat your skin with gel deodorant. On the place you would like your tattoo, spread a layer of the gel deodorant. Make sure that there is enough that it doesn't dry right away, but avoid putting so much of the gel that it prevents the paper from coming into contact with your skin. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the drawing on top of the gel.",
      "content": "Put the drawing on top of the gel. Place the tattoo drawing face-down onto the gel layer on your skin. Hold it there for a minute with firm pressure, so that the image will transfer. When you're finished, remove the paper and check the results. Fix any mistakes in the drawing by repeating the aforementioned process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the tattoo with baby powder.",
      "content": "Set the tattoo with baby powder. Sprinkle baby powder on top of the tattoo, to absorb any leftover moisture and to help it to set. Doing this will make the tattoo last much longer than without; no baby powder means that your temporary tattoo will only last 2-3 days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe away any excess.",
      "content": "Wipe away any excess. Use a clean tissue to carefully wipe off any gel or powder that might still be on your skin. Be careful not to rub the tattoo too much, until you're sure that it has set and is completely dry. When you're done, you can help protect the tattoo for longer by covering it up with a wrap when you're sleeping. [6] X Research source"
