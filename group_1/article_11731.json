      "title": "Listen to their concerns so you can address them.",
      "content": "Listen to their concerns so you can address them. The only way to convince another person to change their views is by first getting a good understanding of what their views are. You may have heard your parents make homophobic comments before, but maybe you don't understand why they feel the way they do. Start a dialogue with them about their feelings about gay people and use active listening skills to truly hear their side of things. [1] X Research source Avoid interrupting them or defending your views, even if what they say is upsetting. You will get your chance to talk later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask questions so you can better understand how they feel.",
      "content": "Ask questions so you can better understand how they feel. Your parents have reasons for their beliefs, and understanding their views will help you see things from their perspective. Your parents may try to shrug it off when you ask, \"Why are you against gay people?\" by responding, \"Because it's just wrong!\" Press them for more information by asking clarifying questions. You might ask, \"Why do you think it's wrong?\" In some cases, this might pertain to their religious beliefs, but you might also uncover a deeper, or more personal reason that they are against gay people"

      "title": "Give religious parents time to adjust their views.",
      "content": "Give religious parents time to adjust their views. If your parents are religious, they may have learned that homosexual relationships, being transgender, or being nonbinary are wrong. They may struggle to accept that homosexuality is natural and part of who you are. Don’t try to attack their religion, as they’ll likely just push back. Instead, work on educating them with current research. [2] X Research source If you know people in your religious community who are accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals, invite them to talk to your parents to share a different viewpoint."

    {
      "title": "Explain your perspective to your parents.",
      "content": "Explain your perspective to your parents. Tell your parents about your feelings and experiences as an LGBTQ+ individual. Invite them to ask you questions and answer to the best of your abilities. You can also help them find articles, pamphlets, and other educational materials to read. [3] X Research source If you aren't LGBTQ+, but are simply trying to broaden their views, you might share an experience of a friend or watch a video with them that portrays an inside perspective. If your parents aren’t willing to open their minds and learn more, there’s not much you can do to convince them. Don’t push too hard, since that might make them even less inclined to listen to you."

    {
      "title": "Don’t give up on your parents.",
      "content": "Don’t give up on your parents. If you love your parents and want them in your life, you’ll have to accept them as they are. Keep reaching out to them, and they will probably respond eventually. They may even have a change of heart and stop being so homophobic. Even if your parents remain homophobic to some degree, they may soften up over time to maintain a relationship with you."

      "title": "Decide whether coming out is a good idea.",
      "content": "Decide whether coming out is a good idea. You deserve to live your life out and proud, but always put your safety first. Unfortunately, coming out to your parents can have harmful consequences if you’re a minor. For instance, your parents might kick you out or say very harmful things to you. Make sure you’re sure your parents won’t threaten your wellbeing before you tell them you’re LGBTQ+. [4] X Research source To figure out if they might be ready, consider their responses to your questions about their LGBTQ+ beliefs. Always listen to your intuition! If you feel afraid to tell them, wait until the timing feels right."

      "content": "Make a plan for how you’ll handle a bad reaction from your parents. Before you tell your parents that you’re LGBTQ+, arrange for a place to stay and someone to talk to in case things go wrong. Additionally, determine how you’ll support yourself if your parents cut you off. While it’s scary and painful to think about these things, it’ll help you protect yourself if things don’t go well. [5] X Research source For example, you might arrange to stay with a supportive family member who can help cover your costs until you’re ready to be on your own. Alternatively, you might stay with a friend’s family."

      "title": "Find a good time to come out.",
      "content": "Find a good time to come out. Talk to your parents when you and they are calm and in a good mood. Avoid coming out during a busy or emotionally tense time, like a holiday, a big family event, or an argument. You want your parents to be as receptive as possible to what you have to say. [6] X Research source Think about what you’ll say ahead of time, so you don’t get tongue-tied. Ask a trusted friend or adult to help and support you during this conversation."

    {
      "title": "Be kind and compassionate with your parents as they adjust.",
      "content": "Be kind and compassionate with your parents as they adjust. Your coming out may come as a shock to your parents. They might react with sadness, confusion, or denial. Try to understand where they are coming from, and be as gentle as you can during your conversation. Reassure them that you’re happy, and tell them you can still do things like get married and have kids."

      "title": "Give them a chance to respond, but leave if you’re unsafe.",
      "content": "Give them a chance to respond, but leave if you’re unsafe. Your parents might get upset or may try to argue with you about your LGBTQ+ identity. This can be very painful, but it doesn’t mean they won’t eventually accept you. Listen to them if they’re not threatening you, and try to reassure them that what you need from them right now is for them to just love you. Try not to argue with them, as this might escalate the situation. Instead, say something like, “I understand that you feel that way, but I hope you’ll understand that this is who I am,” or “I hear what you’re saying, but I don’t agree with your beliefs. I know you love me, and I just hope you’ll accept me as I am.”"

Live your life like you normally do. Talk about your day, discuss your plans, and invite your parents to do things you’d normally do as a family. [8] X Research source Acting the same as you always have should help your parents feel “normal” about your relationship again."

These fears may make them fight to change who you are. Help them understand that these fears are unfounded. Tell them that what’s most important is that you have their love and support. [9] X Research source You might say, “I can see why you’d be worried about me, but I’ll be okay. I just need you to love me.”"

You don’t deserve this type of treatment, and you must move to safety. Leave the situation and call someone you trust for help. Then, move to a safe location until you feel ready to contact your parents. [10] X Research source It’s best to arrange to stay with a friend or family member before you tell your parents. If you don’t have anywhere to go, contact local LGBTQ+ organizations to get help finding a place to stay. You might also try local shelters if there are any near you. If you’re a member of a faith community, you might find someone there who will allow you to stay with them."

In addition to insults, your parents may threaten you, make jokes about you, or withhold affection from you. If your parents say these types of things to you, try not to take them personally. Until you can move out, remind yourself that your parents are speaking from a place of fear. [11] X Research source Talk to a counselor or friend who can help you deal with your parents’ harmful statements. Verbal abuse is still abuse. It may be best for you to arrange to live somewhere else if your parents continue to treat you this way."

Counseling may help you communicate better with your parents. Additionally, your counselor may help you all understand things from each other’s perspective. Tell your parents that you want to improve your relationship and ask them to make an appointment for counseling. [14] X Research source Even if your parents don’t want to talk to a counselor, consider getting individual counseling for yourself.

If you’re worried about how coming out will affect your day-to-day life, it may be time to step out on your own."
