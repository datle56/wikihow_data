      "content": "If you only notice a stain after it’s dry, that’s okay. Grab a sharp knife and gently scrape at the stain, trying to get up as much of the substance as you can.

      "content": "If the stain is fresh, this may be all you’ll need. In a small bowl, combine 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of dishwashing soap, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of ammonia, and 2 cups (470 mL) of warm water. Dip a clean, white cloth into your cleaning mixture. Gently dab at the stain, trying not to rub or scrub to avoid pushing it deeper into the carpet fibers. Every now and then, dip the cloth back into the cleaning solution to rinse it and wet it again. Keep blotting until you’ve covered the entire stain. Ammonia is a harsh substance, and inhaling it can cause coughing, sneezing, and irritation. Always work in a ventilated area, and use gloves to protect your skin. [4] X Research source Keep ammonia away from children and pets. Dish soap and ammonia are usually strong enough to remove fresh stains that just happened. However, if the stain is old, you might need to use other methods."
