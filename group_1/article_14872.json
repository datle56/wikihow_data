      "content": "Drink juice, coffee, or tea. Many people believe liquids with caffeine will dehydrate you, but this is not true when they are consumed in moderate amounts. Water is best, but if you prefer other beverages, such as fruit juice or caffeinated coffee and tea, continue drinking those to reach your daily liquid requirements. [6] X Research source Limit your daily caffeine intake to 2-4 cups of coffee or tea daily. Beyond that, you may experience insomnia, irritability, headaches, or other side effects. Children should avoid caffeine altogether. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Caffeinated beverages may not be a good source of hydration for those who do not have a developed tolerance to the effects of caffeine. It can be a weak diuretic in the early few days of drinking coffee, but soon tolerance is developed when consumed regularly for 4-5 days, and the diuretic effect disappears.
