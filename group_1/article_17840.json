You may notice that you aren't doing these things because you're embarrassed, or insecure, or unsure of how she will react. If she is your girlfriend, and you've been intimate with each other, and you're attracted to her, then you don't need to hold back. Let your hormones take control from time to time, and show her that she is the object of your animal urges."

[2] X Research source However, it doesn't need to be overtly sexual. A light touch can be enough to signal that you're thinking about her, and it can go a long way toward reestablishing intimacy. Put your arm around her when you're watching a movie, or hug her from behind while she's standing at the counter. Run your fingers through her hair. Touch her arm, gently, when you pass her in the hall. Don't be afraid to get more sexual if you're comfortable being intimate with one another. Grab her butt, or caress her thigh. If you're in a private place: walk up behind her, put your hands around her waist, and grind slowly into her body. Hold her hand! This is a great way to flirt, and it can also break the touch barrier if you're in a new relationship. You don't need to come up with a reason to hold her hand; if you feel it, do it."

I just want to send this quick text to my brother so that I can give you my full attention.\" Reader Poll: We asked 426 wikiHow readers if they thought putting away their phone enhances a date, and 89% of them said Yes.
