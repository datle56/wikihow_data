      "title": "Use an antihistamine to combat the allergic response.",
      "content": "Use an antihistamine to combat the allergic response. Insect bites itch because of the body's autoimmune reaction against the anticoagulants in the insect's saliva. This prevents your blood from clotting as the insect drinks. After the insect is gone, a small amount of the saliva remains in your skin. [1] X Research source Use a pea-sized amount of an antihistamine cream and smear it into the bite until it is fully absorbed. Take a non-sedating oral antihistamine such as 10 mg cetirizine once daily to help with symptoms. Use of both oral and topical antihistamines at the same time is not recommended."

However, some insects like ticks, secrete an anesthetic in their saliva so the animal or person they bite won't feel it, enabling them to feed longer. It is very important to remove ticks as soon as possible, because this reduces the chances of getting a tick borne disease. Use a tweezers to grip the tick as close as possible to your skin. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Pull perpendicular to your skin with a steadily increasing pressure until the tick comes out. Don't twist or jerk the tick because this can cause the tick's body to break off from the head/mouth parts and leave them in your skin. You want to remove the whole tick. If the head or mouth parts do remain in your skin, disinfect the tweezers with rubbing alcohol and remove them. If you cannot remove them yourself, have a doctor do it. Do not apply nail polish, petroleum jelly, or a smouldering match to the tick and then wait for it to detach on its own. To minimize the risks of tick borne diseases, you should remove it yourself as soon as possible."
