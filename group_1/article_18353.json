      "content": "How can you gain followers on Instagram? According to social media influencer and marketer Jenna Jean Davis, you can gain more followers by “being consistent with your postings” and “posting high quality content.” Make sure your posts are clear and visually pleasing, and utilize hashtags and trending music to make it easier for people to find your content. Aim to post at least 3 times per week and upload 2 stories per day. This increases your chances of showing up on the Explore feed and appearing in the top search results for keywords you often use. [2] X Research source Davis also recommends “posting Reels to grow [your account] and get in front of new potential followers.” Post a variety of videos to see what your audience reacts to best, then use that as a guide to inform your content decisions. If you’re active on other platforms, like TikTok or YouTube, be sure to cross-promote your accounts and upload your content onto all of these channels. You can link your account in the bio section of each platform to establish your personal brand."

While there’s no specific formula to create a successful page, it’s important to stay true to yourself and create content that resonates with your followers. Post surprising content and share personal stories to differentiate yourself from other creators, and don’t be afraid to incorporate puns, dad jokes, or anything else that makes you laugh. [3] X Research source Other tips to develop a funny page: Sprinkle emojis in your captions to add more personality and character. Choose a handle that shows off your sense of humor—it could be related to your favorite meme, a childhood memory, or something totally random. Create your own comedy series and post this content on the same day each week. You could upload funny POV or reaction videos, for example, every Friday."
