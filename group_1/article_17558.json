      "content": "Clean and condition your seats with a specialty leather cleaner. Spray or squirt a small amount of cleaner onto a microfiber cloth or soft, lint-free towel and wipe the seats down from top to bottom. The lubricating agents in the cleaner will soften the leather and safeguard it against heat, which is how you’ll be working out the wrinkles. [1] X Research source You can pick up a bottle of quality leather cleaner at your neighborhood auto supply store for around $10-20. There will typically be a wide selection of products available, including cleaners formulated for different styles and colors of leather."

      "title": "Let the cleaner sit on the seats for 1-2 hours.",
      "content": "Let the cleaner sit on the seats for 1-2 hours. This will ensure that it has time to absorb fully while also giving the leather a chance to dry out. In the meantime, hold off on taking any unnecessary trips and avoid handling the leather as much as possible. Too much touching can transfer dirt and oil from your skin. [2] X Research source If for some reason you’re in a hurry to get to work on your seats, make sure that the leather cleaner has had at least 10-20 minutes to soak in. Some cleaners have longer recommended drying times than others. Check the instructions outlined on the label of the specific product you’re using for more detailed guidelines."

      "title": "Plug in your heat gun and set it to low or medium heat.",
      "content": "Plug in your heat gun and set it to low or medium heat . Most heat guns have a switch on the backside of the handle that controls the intensity, airflow, and other key settings. Others have more sophisticated interfaces, with digital display screens and buttons that allow you to adjust the exact temperature in small increments. [3] X Research source You may need to park your car close to an open electrical outlet since you’ll only have about 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) of power cord to work with. For a project like this, you’ll want to keep the temperature relatively low.

      "title": "Wave the heat gun back and forth over the wrinkled section.",
      "content": "Wave the heat gun back and forth over the wrinkled section. Hold the nozzle 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) away from the surface of the seat and keep it moving constantly. As you do, watch the leather closely for any subtle movement. You may be able to actually see it changing shape as it warms up. [5] X Research source Make sure there’s a safe amount of distance between your heat gun and seats at all times. Not only will this spare your leather any unnecessary damage, but it will also prevent the plastic components near the nozzle of the tool from melting. [6] X Research source Try not to let the gun hover over any one spot for too long. Doing so will make burns more likely to occur."

That way, you’ll be able to pause periodically and go over the section you’ve been heating. In addition to cooling the leather, the moisture will create a gentle steaming effect that will help smooth out stubborn inconsistencies.

The whole process might take anywhere from 1-5 minutes in total, depending on the severity of the wrinkles, as well as the thickness and texture of the leather."

After several minutes of patiently heating, wiping, and examining your seats, they should start to look just like they did the day they rolled off the assembly line at the factory. [8] X Research source As long as you’re taking the time to cool and dampen the leather intermittently, heat damage shouldn’t be a danger. When you’re done, hit your seats with a second application of leather conditioner to protect them from future wear and tear. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a nourishing leather cleaner to every part of your seats. Squeeze or spray a conservative amount of your product of choice onto a microfiber cloth or soft towel and go over the entire seat with it. If necessary, use a separate cloth or towel to wipe off any excess cleaner. Allow the product to sit for 1-2 hours before moving on.

      "content": "Place a large hand towel over the problem area. Center the towel over the creased section of leather, flattening it out to make sure it covers as much of the seat as possible. You can move it around later to smooth outlying wrinkles if need be, but for right now you just want to concentrate on the spot where the fold is the deepest. [12] X Research source You also have the option of using a paper bag if you don’t happen to have a towel handy. Paper bags are readily available at any supermarket, usually for only a few cents apiece. [13] X Research source The towel or bag will serve as a protective buffer, transferring the heat of the iron without exposing the leather to it directly."

Keep in mind that severe deformations like dents and divots may be more or less permanent in places where the leather has been stretched beyond its natural elasticity. Remember to reward your seats with another application of leather conditioner to keep it strong, supple, and attractive."
