People want attention the most when they're being ignored and you can see this is an advantage in various ways: You get to be the bigger person in all of this so anyone on the fence on taking sides should now side with you. Being the better person also clears your conscience. You get to rub on her face that you're better than her. You are the better person. She used you in some weird plot of hers but you're better than that. By rising above the situation, you rub on her face how great you are and what she's missing out on You get to show everyone you moved on. This is good because only the people you choose will know you got hurt, everyone else will think she didn't affect you. How else could you move on so fast? It allows you to actually move on. By ignoring her you find new things and people deserving of your attention and soon you'll genuinely move on and can stop faking."
