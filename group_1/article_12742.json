Lift your arms together until they reach about shoulder height. Move your arms back down. Your arms shouldn't be straight out in front of you or straight out to your sides. Rather, they should be in the middle between those two positions, at a forty-five degree angle. Repeat 12 times for one set. Do two sets."

      "content": "Do dumbbell curls. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Your elbows should be in front of your body. Your palms should be facing upward, but slightly away from you as your arms start just below the 90-degree angle. Lift the dumbbells together upward toward your chest.

Start with 5 pounds in each hand if you don't know where to begin. Try to do 3 sets."

      "content": "Use tricep push downs. Hold the same dumbbells out in front of you again with your arms at a 90-degree angle. However, your palms should face the floor. Push your arms down slowly until they reach your thighs, breathing out as you go. Hold the position for a second, then bring your arms back up, breathing in. [1] X Research source You can use a small barbell instead of dumbbells. [2] X Research source Try 3 sets of 10 repetitions. You can also turn this move into tricep pull downs. All you do is flip your hands over so your palms are facing up. You use the same movement, going down towards your thighs."

      "content": "Do close-grip bench presses. Lay on your back on a bench. The bench should have supports to hold a barbell. Add weights, starting small. Put your hands semi-close together on the bar above you, about shoulder-width apart. Lift the bar off, and bring it straight down towards your chest slowly, while you breathe in. Push the bar back up as you breathe out. [3] X Research source The close grip helps work your triceps more, which is important for throwing. [4] X Research source Try repeating the exercise 8 times. Do 4 of these sets. If you've never done this exercise before, it's good to have someone spot you. Reader Poll: We asked 364 wikiHow readers and only 11% said that the best exercise for building arm strength is a bench press .

      "content": "Try throwing a football around. This exercise works particularly well for little league players because it works the arm, as well as the rest of the body, but it can just be a fun activity to do with a friend or a parent. Simply get an appropriately sized football, such as a junior football for little leaguers, and grab a partner. Put the emphasis on targeting the ball. Make sure the ball is going into your partner's chest. Throw at least 15 to 20 times each time you choose this exercise. Throwing over and over is a great way to strengthen your arm for baseball.
