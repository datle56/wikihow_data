Though sugar dating involves money and sex, your dialogue with a prospective sugar daddy doesn’t need to be entirely transactional. Be sure you enjoy talking to them online before agreeing to meet them in person. Sugar dating is still dating, and it’s preferable to get along and get a good sense of whether you’ll like spending time with them in person. It’s a good idea to FaceTime or video call your prospective sugar daddy before meeting them in person to see what he looks like and get a feel for who he is."

If they’re immediately trying to arrange a PPM (“pay per meet”) fee that pays you a set amount of money per time spent together, think about whether you want that. A PPM arrangement can lead to difficulties if you decide you don’t want to spend the pre-set time with the other person who has already “paid for” the number of hours in the PPM agreement. Don’t let yourself be talked into doing anything sex or relationship-wise that you’re not comfortable with or ready for. Step back if necessary and re-assess the situation."

If you want a weekly salary or expect him to pay some of your expenses, like your rent, let him know so that he knows exactly what you need from the beginning. If you only want to meet him once or twice a week, then tell him this so he doesn't expect more. Being clear about your needs will also help establish the terms of the relationship. This will ensure that you're both looking for the same thing. If you want the freedom to see other people while you're dating, you can make this clear from the beginning, too. Don't feel shy about telling him what you want—he'll appreciate your honesty and may even find it refreshing."

Sugar daddies are looking for women of all ages, shapes, and sizes, so don't feel self-conscious if you're over 40 or if your figure doesn't resemble a Barbie doll's. What's important is that you spend time maintaining the looks that you do have by showering daily, styling your hair, and wearing flattering and appealing clothing. [3] X Research source Take the time to style your hair and put on some make-up daily. You could find a sugar daddy at any time and want to look your best when you do. You don't have to look like a porn star to appeal to a sugar daddy. Many sugar daddies prefer the natural look."

He may be feeling shy about being a sugar daddy or unsure about how to proceed, and he'll appreciate it if you know what you're doing and aren't shy about asking for the things you need. Hold your head high, smile proudly, and introduce yourself with pride. [4] X Research source There's a difference between being self-assured and bossy. Let the sugar daddy tell you what he's thinking, what he wants, and how you can help. Don't try to be so self-assured that you ignore his needs completely."

A sugar daddy isn't looking for a life partner or a woman who will do all of his laundry and grocery shopping for him—he probably has a maid for that anyway. He's looking for a woman who is fun and exciting, but who also has her own life, interests, friends, and plans when he isn't around. If you seem clingy, obsessed over his schedule, or like you always want to be around, he'll be turned off fast. [5] X Research source Don't meet with the sugar daddy more than two or three times a week—if you try to see him more than that, he'll think you're getting attached. Avoid sleeping over too much if you can. If you start sleeping over at your sugar daddy's place all the time, it'll start to look like you want to move in and stick around. Be open about your plans. If you're having a night out with your girlfriends, let him know. He'll only want you more if he's a little jealous. If you're both clear about the fact that you're in an open relationship, tell him when you're going out on a date with someone else. This will only make you look more independent."

Be sexy by wearing attractive clothes, staying in shape with regular exercise and a healthy diet, and wearing something sexy in the bedroom. You can act sexy by licking your lips, touching your sugar daddy just enough to turn him on, sending him sexy texts, or even talking dirty over the phone. If you really want a sugar daddy, it’s best to have some sexual experience. Sugar daddies want women who are comfortable in the bedroom. Know what you're doing and also be prepared to give him what he needs. You don't have to wear provocative clothing to be sexy—just wear something that compliments your figure and makes your sugar daddy want you more."

If you don't respond to his calls for a day, don't go into a big explanation about what you were doing—you were just busy living your own life. Don't tell him about every little thing on your mind and don't go into detail about your deepest wishes and needs. You can reveal something about yourself a little bit at a time, but always leave him wanting more. Don't give him a planner with your schedule on it. Let him wonder about all of the things you're up to when you're not with him."

      "content": "Be positive, intelligent, and fun. Sugar daddies are looking for smart, worldly women that they can have a good time with. They're not shelling out cash to be with a woman who is negative or always whining and complaining. If you tend to have negative thoughts, try to keep those to a minimum when you're around your sugar daddy and save them for your real friends. Keep things light and positive by laughing often and talking about the things that make you happy and the things that you're excited about instead of the things that get you down. Whenever you catch yourself saying something negative, counter your statement by making three positive comments. Try to laugh as much as you can. Sugar daddies want women who are having a good time. If you're having an emotional day or feel like crying, don't dump all of your emotions on your sugar daddy. Call up a good friend instead."

Don't do the same thing every weekend, even if you always go out to an expensive restaurant. Instead, mix things up by asking him to take you boating, give you a tennis lesson, or whisk you away on an expensive vacation. If you do the same things together all the time, your sugar daddy may begin to get bored with you. Make sure you do one new thing together at least once every week or two. Keep things exciting in the bedroom too. Use your time with your sugar daddy as an opportunity to try out some of your new moves."

      "content": "Avoid domesticity. The quickest way to turn off your sugar daddy is to make him feel like you're ready to shack up and sign a marriage certificate. He's with you because you're fun, adventurous, and exciting—not because you love making home-cooked meals or ironing his shirts. Avoid sleeping over, spending too much time with him, or taking on any wifely tasks if you can, or a red flag will go up immediately, and he'll want to end the relationship. As soon as you can tell he feels uncomfortable that you're getting too close, just pull back. Don't call him your boyfriend and don't make jokes about your wedding, either. Don't introduce him to your friends or family unless that's really what he wants, or things will begin to feel too serious for him. Avoid talking about anything too far in the future, unless you're just planning your next vacation."

Just plan your once-or-twice-weekly meetings and let him know when you're on your way. Don't ask him about other women in his life or get jealous if he even mentions another woman's name. Remember that he’s not looking for a girlfriend or partner that gets worked up about the relationship. Try not to spend your time apart wondering what he's up to, or when you'll see him again."

He's not your boyfriend or long-term material—he's someone you have a good time with and a man who provides you with the financial benefits that make your life easier and more fun. Don't start planning your wedding, coming up with your kids' names, or scheduling your life around his busy schedule. Remain who you are, keep pursuing your own interests, and you'll avoid getting hurt."

      "content": "Know when to move on. If you've been with your sugar daddy for a long time, you may be wondering if it's time to break it off. There are a few good reasons for doing this: you may see that he's too attached to you, you may worry that you're too attached to him, or you may both just be bored with each other. Another reason for moving on is that either you or your sugar daddy have found someone who you really like, or even love, and want to pursue a relationship with that person. Once it's over, it's over. Be clear and calm about ending the relationship and try to end things on a good note. If all you wanted was a sugar daddy, you'll be able to find another one in no time. If the sugar daddy rejected you, don't get hurt. It happens all the time—sugar daddies tend to get bored and want to move on, and it probably has nothing to do with you."

      "content": "Think about whether you can keep your emotional distance. Many sugar daddies know fully well what they're getting you into. They start with gifts and money, but the ultimate goals are not always on the table. When you give someone that much power over you, you have to have trust in them. But sugar daddies, in general, aren't the most immediately trustworthy people. You have to keep your head, and heart, on a swivel. At the same time, you're just there for the money, so don't feel like you don't have any power in the relationship either. This is, in many ways, a business transaction. Keep it that way. If you're looking for deep or meaningful connections, don't get a sugar daddy. Any relationship built on payment is unlikely to lead to a true and deep connection. Silly as it sounds, sugar daddy relationships are very rarely like the plot of “Pretty Woman.” Don't let the dream of \"free\" money blind you from the realities of cash-for-sex relationships."

You're going to be expected, in some way, to do things for him as well, or else the money will run dry quickly.

This will help you narrow down your search and to be more clear about your demands right from the beginning. You can make a list of the qualities you'd like the sugar daddy to possess and another list of all of the things you'd like him to pay for. There's no shame in that—he is a sugar daddy, after all. Decide what kind of sugar daddy you're looking for. Do you want someone who is under forty, or over fifty? Would you prefer it if he’s divorced, wanting to date multiple people, or even married? Do you want someone who wants to spend a lot of time with you or just a man to whisk you away on the weekends? Decide what you want the sugar daddy to do for you. Some women just require a flat fee, like $1000 or $2000 a week in exchange for their companionship, some fun times, and usually some lovemaking.

Let the men know what kind of relationship you're looking for. Post photographs that are appealing, but not too provocative. You want the men to think you're sexy while taking you seriously.

You can use filters to find the right man, such as looking at his salary bracket or his occupation. You can also browse the profile of a man to see if he fits your needs; if he lists expensive hobbies like boating or vacationing in Europe as his interests, appears to be dressed in very expensive clothing, and has expensive taste, he may be the sugar daddy for you. You can also look into what the man is looking for; see if he wants a woman he sees as his equal, or if he wants to treat a woman to a good time in exchange for her company."

You can even go out of your way to go to a place where rich men are known to be. You can even take a girl trip to the Hamptons, or other places where rich men spend their vacations and see if you find anyone who appeals to you. When you're looking for men, dress up nicely, but not too provocatively. You want the men to take you seriously and not think of you as a one-night stand. Ideally, your relationship with the sugar daddy will last long enough for you to get what you want. Check out cultural places that are likely to be frequented by rich men, like museums, opera houses, or art galleries. If an art gallery or museum is having a special occasion night, like a cocktail party, make sure to be there with bells on."
