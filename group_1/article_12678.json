[7] X Research source You can also stand in front of the mirror with your face centered on the mirror's surface. Mark the edges of your face. You can either draw the whole area of your face now or you can place dots around your face, noting the top and edges of your forehead, the edges of your cheekbones, points on the edges of your jawline, and the bottom of your chin. Once you've placed the dots, move to the side and connect the dots, making a facsimile of your face shape. [8] X Research source You can also do this in the bathroom mirror after you get out of the shower. All you have to do is outline your face in the steam.

After you’ve made all the measurements and written them down, determine which measurements are greatest and which are smallest. Compare the proportions of your face with those typical of the common face shapes. [12] X Research source For example, if your face is about as long as it is wide, it is probably round or square. A square face has a wider, more angular jaw than a round face . If your face is longer than it is wide, it may be oblong, oval, or rectangular. To determine which, look at how your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline measure up. If your measurements get gradually narrower from forehead to jawline, your face is heart-shaped or oval. If they’re similar all the way down, your face may be oblong, square, or rectangular. If your face gets wider from forehead to jawline, it’s triangular. Once you've drawn your face, it's time to analyze the dimensions of your face. Look at the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline as well as the length from your forehead to your chin. Compare each side, judging which area is most prominent, which area is smallest, and how they relate to one another. [13] X Expert Source Cordelia Frost Makeup Artist & Gothic Blogger Expert Interview. 30 July 2021 Keep in mind a few questions. How wide is my forehead compared to my jawline? How wide are my cheekbones compared to my forehead and jawline? How long is my face? These spatial relationships are what determine your face shape. Look at the next section to figure out what shape your face is and understand what each face shape means. If your face seems to be in between two shapes, you can try a more exact method to determine which areas on your face are larger than others. In a mirror, measure the length between the side edges of your forehead, between your cheekbones or temples, between the edges of your jaw, and from your chin to your hairline. Use these exact measurements to determine what the largest and smallest areas of your face are. If you aren't exactly sure about the shape of your face, have a relative or close friend help you decide. Sometimes it's easier for others to decide because they see your face more often than you see your own. [14] X Research source Another option is to look for a face chart online and compare the basic shapes with your face.

Go with a length that balances out the dimensions of your face. [16] X Research source Long, straight hair is an excellent choice for round and square faces, because it adds length and minimizes width. Extremely short cuts with more volume on top, such as a pixie cut , can also lengthen short faces and draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones. Medium to short cuts, such as a chin-length or shoulder-length bob , can make long faces look shorter and add fullness to the face. This is a good choice for oval or oblong faces."

Consider the following when deciding on bangs: [17] X Research source Long, feathery bangs that frame the forehead in an A-shape can help soften the look of a square face. Side-swept bangs are flattering on a variety of face shapes, including round, heart-shaped, and oval or oblong.

      "content": "Pick frames that balance out your face shape if you wear glasses. Glasses can change the appearance of your face quite a bit. If you wear glasses, select frames that complement the shape of your face rather than exaggerating it. For example: [18] X Research source Maintain the balance of an oval face with frames that match the width of your face. If you have a heart-shaped face, minimize the breadth of the upper half of your face with light-colored or rimless frames. You can also choose frames that are wider at the bottom. For long faces, such as oblong or rectangular, choose wide frames with low bridges and decorative temple elements that add width. For faces that are narrower on top, such as triangular faces, pick frames that are wider on top, such as cat-eyes. Choose narrow frames for short, wide face shapes, such as square or oval. Curved frames balance out more angular faces, while angular frames work best with round faces. Soften the look of an angular diamond face shape by choosing oval frames."

For example: [19] X Research source Add width to an oblong face by putting blush on the apples of the cheeks and blending out toward the temples. Reduce length by adding bronzer to the hairline and jawline. Use bronzer to minimize the width of the forehead on a heart-shaped face. Give structure to a round face by applying bronzer around the entire outer perimeter of the face and under the cheekbones. Highlight the central part of the face (middle of the forehead, bridge of the nose, high point of the cheeks, and chin). Soften square faces by contouring the forehead, temples, and jawline, and adding highlighter to the cheeks. For face shapes with narrower foreheads, such as diamonds and triangles, widening the space between your brows a little can give the illusion of greater width at the top of the face."

If your face is oblong but tapers slightly from forehead to jaw, you may have an oval-shaped face. Oval faces tend to be about 1 ½ times longer than they are wide. [21] X Research source You have an oval face if your cheekbones and jawline are pretty much the same width with your forehead just a bit wider, your face is only slightly longer than it is wide, and your chin is slightly rounded and smaller than the width of your forehead. Because the oval face is so proportionate, there are very few hairstyles that do not look good. Bangs, no bangs, long, or short, this face shape can pull off any style and look good while doing it.

Another good rule of thumb is that the round face is typically about as long (measuring from hairline to chin) as it is wide (from cheekbone to cheekbone).
