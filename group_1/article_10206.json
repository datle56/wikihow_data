A good parent doesn't make a child feel bad about their mistakes, unless a child is extremely out of line (e.g. hurting someone). They teach, encourage, and guide the child.

You will probably never get their approval, no matter how much you might deserve it. Even if you won a contest or got a \"perfect\" body or became president, they'd find something new to criticize. Changing yourself wouldn't change their behavior. When winning their approval is impossible, that doesn't mean something is wrong with you. It means something is wrong with them. You're OK."

Remember that just because a behavior of yours triggers meanness doesn't mean that your behavior is wrong.

If your parents tend to be negligent, then you may not have learned how to take care of yourself. Here are some tips you can follow to be your best self: Meals : Eat when you're hungry, and stop when you're full. Try to fill 1/3 of your plate with fruits and vegetables. Limit simple sugars. Eat healthy snacks if you get hungry between meals. Avoid fad diets, or diets that cut out certain food groups altogether; these aren't sustainable and can hurt your metabolism. [30] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source [31] X Research source Sleep : Sleep 8-10 hours each night, if possible. Try to follow a schedule, and establish a consistent bedtime and wake-up time. Turn off screens, or at least use a blue light filter on your devices, before bed. If you have a hard time waking up in the morning, then you probably aren't sleeping enough. Exercise : Try to find a form of exercise you like, from playing sports to taking walks to lifting weights in your bedroom. Exercise for at least 30 minutes, 3 times a week or more. If it hurts, stop and take a break. Skin care: Apply sunscreen daily, or at least if you plan to be outside for long. Wear wide-brimmed hats to protect you from the sun. Sun protection will help your skin look better, especially as you age. Cleanliness : Shower daily. Wash your hair and body. Use a facial soap for your face, to avoid clogging pores. Apply deodorant daily. Brush your teeth thoroughly every day, and try to floss too. Recreation: Set aside at least 30 minutes each day to do something purely fun. Think about what you enjoy most (like drawing or watching cat videos), and get in the habit of doing those things. If you can't do something fun on one day, take extra time the next day. Pay attention: Your body signals are important. If you're hungry, that's meaningful. If something hurts, that's meaningful. Pay attention to what your body is trying to tell you it needs, and work on meeting those needs."
