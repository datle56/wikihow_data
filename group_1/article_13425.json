For best results, try bending your knees to a 90-degree angle, then standing back up. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 22 February 2021. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep your knees behind your toes.",
      "content": "Keep your knees behind your toes. This protects your knees and back and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes.

      "title": "Keep your feet shoulder-width apart.",
      "content": "Keep your feet shoulder-width apart. For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Angle your feet for plié squats.",
      "content": "Angle your feet for plié squats. A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop at the bottom.",
      "content": "Stop at the bottom. After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to \"break 90,\" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90-degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep your core tight and chest upright.",
      "content": "Keep your core tight and chest upright. If not done carefully, squatting can put a lot of strain on your lower back. Protect your back and ensure proper form by keeping your core muscles firmly engaged. Imagine you are contracting your belly button toward the middle of your back. As you keep your tummy tight, this should help you to hold your chest upright. Imagine that you are trying to let sun shine on the top of your clavicle and chest. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid bouncing.",
      "content": "Avoid bouncing. Descend with control and ascend in any manner, however do not ascend without braking at the top. When you see professional or elite athletes doing squatting movements very fast, they are moving with control."

    {
      "title": "Increase your reps over time.",
      "content": "Increase your reps over time. Build your squatting ability over several workouts by adding a repetition or two every workout. Squat as often as twice a week. Begin by doing just one set of 10-13 reps (or repetitions). Add a couple of reps, or a set, each time you work out. Build up strength and increase your reps slowly in order to protect your spine and avoid injury. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Do free squats on the balls of your feet.",
      "content": "Do free squats on the balls of your feet. If you come up to the balls of your feet while squatting (also called relevé) you will work your calf muscles. You try staying up on your toes the whole time, or simply doing a calf-raise at the top of each squat. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Try chair squats.",
      "content": "Try chair squats. Instead of moving up and down in your free squats, try sitting back and doing an isometric hold. That is, hold yourself in the bottom squat position as if you are sitting in a chair. Try holding this for 30 seconds, and adding time as you get stronger. You can also try doing this against a wall.

      "title": "Mix up your workouts.",
      "content": "Mix up your workouts. Doing a variety of squats works more muscles and makes your workout varied and more fun. Additionally, when the leg muscles are strengthened, a person's metabolism becomes more active. Performing a mix of different squat exercises works more muscles and revs up your metabolism to burn more calories. [12] X Research source"
