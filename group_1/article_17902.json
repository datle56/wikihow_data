      "content": "Spray the affected carpet areas with vinegar and water. Mix equal parts of water and vinegar in a spray bottle. Thoroughly spray the dented or flattened area of carpet. Make sure to cover the whole area with liquid, but don't saturate the carpet so that it’s soaking wet. [1] X Research source Make sure the spray bottle is clean and free of other cleaners or chemicals before you use it."

      "title": "Let the cleaner sit on the carpet for 10-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the cleaner sit on the carpet for 10-30 minutes. Give the mixture time to work on the fibers of the carpet. Depending on how deep and flat the dents are, adjust how long you let the mixture work. Give it at least ten minutes, or wait about half an hour for deep impressions. Vinegar is often used as a cleaning solution, so the area you spray may end up cleaner than the rest of your carpet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blot up the liquid with a towel.",
      "content": "Blot up the liquid with a towel. Grab a clean, white towel and gently press it into the wet carpet. Blot at the carpet until the majority of the liquid has been soaked up. Don’t press too hard or you’ll flatten the carpet out again. It’s important to use a white towel so that you don’t bleed any color onto your carpet."

    {
      "title": "Scrape the carpet with the edge of a spoon.",
      "content": "Scrape the carpet with the edge of a spoon. Hold a spoon so the edge is against the area of carpet you’re fluffing. Pressing the spoon into the carpet, scrape it across the carpet in straight lines. This will cause the carpet fibers to spring up straight again. [2] X Research source If a spoon doesn’t give you the results you hope for, try combing the carpet with the tines of a fork. Also try a brush with stiff but non-metal bristles to even the carpet out when the dent is gone. A boar's hair brush works well."

    {
      "title": "Allow the carpet to dry before you walk or put anything on it.",
      "content": "Allow the carpet to dry before you walk or put anything on it. After you’ve fluffed the carpet, make sure you don’t walk on it before it is dry. Also be sure not to put any furniture back on the spot while it is wet. This could take 2-3 hours or more depending on the size of the area."

      "title": "Set ice cubes on the dent.",
      "content": "Set ice cubes on the dent. Grab some ice from your freezer and set it in the dents in your carpet. If you have multiple dents, like from the four feet of a couch, place at least one ice cube in each dent. If the dent is more than two inches (5cm) wide, place more than one piece in the dent.

      "content": "Allow the ice to melt completely. Once the dents are covered with ice cubes, leave them alone long enough for the ice to melt. Depending on the temperature of the room and how much ice you put in each dent, this might take 20 minutes or up to an hour or more. [4] X Research source"

Press the towel gently so you don’t dent the carpet again. Make sure the towel is clean and white, so you don’t transfer color onto the carpet. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fluff the carpet with your fingers, a spoon, or a fork. Rub the previously dented area with your fingers until the carpet stands up as it should. If this doesn’t fluff the carpet enough, try scraping the carpet with the edge of a spoon or combing the carpet with the tines of a fork. [6] X Research source Use a soft brush to even out the carpet once the fibers are fluffed back up."

If you need to fluff up a large area, you may need to use more than one towel or repeat the process a few times. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Steam the towel with an iron on medium heat. Plug in your clothes iron and set it to the medium heat setting. Hold it a few inches above the towel and move it around in a circular motion. Do this for 30 to 60 seconds, then check the carpet. [8] X Research source Do not put the iron directly onto the carpet or the towel as you might damage the carpet fibers."

Remove the cloth from the area, being careful not to burn yourself. Rub the carpet with your fingers so the fibers spring back up. Apply the towel and heat it again if necessary. For more stubborn carpet fibers, scrap the carpet with the edge of a spoon or comb it with a fork to fluff it more. Brush the carpet afterward so it has an even look."
