Lay a long piece of string over the top of the cake and fold the ends down against the sides of the cake. Trim of any excess string that touches the plate. Take the string off and set it aside. You will be using it to measure the size of your fondant. [1] X Research source If you are doing a multi-tiered cake, measure one tier at a time. For any other cake, measure the greatest width across the top (this would be diagonal from corner to corner on a square or rectangle cake) and then add twice the height."

      "content": "Cover the cake with a thin layer of buttercream using a palette knife. The buttercream will help the fondant stick to the cake, so make sure to get the top and sides of the cake. Try to get the surface as smooth as possible, as any bumps will show. If there are any cracks or holes in the cake, be sure to fill them in using buttercream and then smoothing it down. [2] X Research source Consider using a cake decorating turntable to make this step easier and quicker. You can also use light or dark ganache or apricot jam instead of buttercream.

      "content": "Clear a large, smooth work surface and dust it with powdered sugar. The surface must be smooth, as any imperfections will get imprinted in the fondant. Lightly dusting the surface with powdered sugar will prevent the fondant from sticking to your work surface. If it is humid where you live, use a mixture of one part cornstarch and one part powdered sugar. If it is very dry, then consider using a thin layer of vegetable shortening. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow your fondant to reach room temperature. This will make it easier to work with. You can knead it for about five minutes to make it softer and easier to work with; do not let it get too soft and sticky, however. Knead some tylose powder into the fondant if you'd like it to dry and harden more quickly. Consider kneading in some gel or paste icing color. You can also add in some flavoring as well. Do not use a liquid food coloring. [5] X Research source"
