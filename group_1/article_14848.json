      "content": "Choose one of Bacardi's full-bodied rums, such as the Reserva Limitada. Bacardi's Premium Label line of rums have the strongest flavor and are best for drinking Bacardi straight. For a milder flavor, you can choose a lighter Premium label rum, such as the Gran Reserva Diez. Also, if straight rum is too harsh for you, you can choose from a number of sweet, fruit-infused Bacardi labels. Bacardi produces hundreds of rums and several are available in the United States. Experiment and find your favorite! Bacardi offers eight options of fruit-infused rums, including mango, banana, and coconut. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use all your senses to really experience the full profile of your rum. Look at the liquid and smell it. Take note of the colors and the scent. It may just look clear and smell like nothing at first, but the more you do this, the more you will notice differences between your drinks and learn what is pleasing to your palate and what is not. [3] X Research source Similar to other aged alcohols, rum has complexities. The finer and more aged the rum, the more flavors it will hold. And the more you drink it, the more you will notice the flavor of minerals and hints of fruits or vegetables."
