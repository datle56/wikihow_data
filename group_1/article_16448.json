      "content": "Start off your morning by exposing yourself to something positive. You want to begin the day in a good place. When you step out the door for work or school, you will be bombarded with a lot of negativity. To combat this, work on feeling good about yourself the second you wake up. Look for passages from books, lines from movies, articles online, or blog posts about body and appearance positivity. You could try keeping a journal by your bed where you've written down positive messages. You can also write down positive messages on index cards. You can leave them where you're likely to see them early in the morning. For example, write down a line from a poem on body positivity and place it on your coffee pot."

      "content": "Identify what you love about your body. If you're insecure about your body, you probably focus mostly on what you think is wrong with it. Instead of rehearsing those same old ideas, try reframing your attention to focus on what you like about your body. [1] X Research source Are you good at sports or other physical activities? Do you have good hand-eye coordination? Has your body allowed you to pull off certain styles? Do you look really good in certain kinds of clothing? Does your body provide you with pleasure?

      "title": "Take a time out from reading beauty magazines or following celebrities on social media.",
      "content": "Take a time out from reading beauty magazines or following celebrities on social media. You need to connect with your body away from outside influences. This will help to stop comparing yourself with others and appreciate you for you. Un-follow certain celebrities on Twitter, stop checking websites such as weight loss and fashion blogs, and avoid glancing at tabloid covers in the supermarket. All of these things can contribute to negative feelings about the body. If you're having a hard time completely getting away from outside influences, try to set limits rather than completely cut it out. You could, for example, limit yourself to 2 hours of social media time each day. Try to take periodic \"pop culture breaks.\" Turn off your television, computer, and phone a few hours a day. Try to do something that takes you away from outside influences, like reading a book or going for a walk. Body insecurity is often related to the messages that people receive through the media. Young women for example are encouraged through television and beauty publications to achieve a certain weight, skin tone, etcetera. Many of these ideals are unrealistic and harmful, considering the diversity of body types that exist in the world."

      "title": "Identify what makes you feel insecure.",
      "content": "Identify what makes you feel insecure. Do you know why you feel so insecure about your body? Did your parents or friends pressure you into looking a certain way? Have you always idolized pop stars and other people in the media with \"perfect\" bodies? Were you criticized for the way your body looked when you were younger? Figure out situations and reminders that trigger your insecurities. Try to avoid such things in the future. [2] X Research source Do you have friends or acquaintances that are critical of their own bodies? If so, you may want to lessen contact with them, at least until you're feeling better about yourself. You could consider skipping lunch with the coworker that's constantly dieting, or not returning your cousin's self depreciating texts about his physical appearance. Think about times in the day when you're likely to feel insecure. Maybe you tend to feel insecure when you go to the grocery store, as your store has a lot of full length mirrors. You find yourself constantly checking your appearance in these mirrors. You could consider going to a different store."

[3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is one way to direct your attention away from negative thoughts about your body and toward more positive things in your life. [4] X Research source You should consider getting rid of your bathroom scale. If you're worried about tracking your weight, weigh yourself once a week at a gym or a drugstore that has a scale. When you go to the doctor's office, you can ask your doctor not to weigh you unless it's necessary for medical reasons. You can also ask that your doctor not tell you your weight. If you notice yourself checking your body, think about something else instead, like being at the beach or something else that helps you relax. You could also find something to distract yourself right away when you begin to obsess over your body. Take up a relaxing hobby, like knitting."

      "content": "Practice positive self talk. If you feel bad about yourself, you may find yourself putting yourself down a lot. You may engage in negative self-talk, which means you find yourself saying things to yourself like, \"I can't believe how fat you are\" throughout the day. Try to swap negative self talk with positive self talk. It may feel awkward at first, but with time being kind to yourself can help raise your sense of self worth. [5] X Research source Be aware of your thought patterns. If you've felt bad about yourself for awhile, you may put yourself down without thinking. Try to be aware of your thoughts at all times. Catch yourself when you begin thinking things like, \"You're so ugly. You're so weak.\" Then, try replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. For example, say you're insecure because you feel your arms are too bulky looking. If you find yourself thinking, \"I can't wear this top because it makes my arms look fat,\" stop and replace this thought with something more positive. For example, \"I'm really proud of how strong my arms are.\""

      "content": "Try to see insecurity as humility. Despite your best efforts, you may still feel insecure sometimes. Some people beat themselves up for experiencing insecurity at all. Instead of feeling bad that you have body image issues, try to see the insecurity itself in a positive light. Try to think of yourself as modest instead of insecure, as this can help you feel better about yourself overall. Try to think of yourself as humble. Be grateful you're able to acknowledge you have flaws and imperfections. Keep in mind, while it's okay to reframe your thoughts on insecurity, you should still work to feel better about yourself. It's good to have some humility, but intense insecurity can be unhealthy longterm."

Maybe you don't have a flat stomach or muscular biceps. You may not have the hair color or eye color you want. However, stop thinking of your body in terms of how it looks. Instead, be grateful for your body's ability to function. [6] X Research source Admire your body's abilities beyond physical beauty. Admire that your body is able to move, carry you, heal from injury, and endure physical activity. Set goals for yourself that have nothing to do with weight loss. Try to push your body in terms of endurance. For example, strive to be able to do 110 push-ups in a row, or to be able to run 2 miles without stopping."

It is not realistic to expect yourself to love everything about your body at all times. However, learn to accept what you do not like without fixating on it. [7] X Expert Source Chlo√©e Ohayon-Crosby Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 24 July 2020. Be able to compartmentalize to a degree by loving your body overall, even when you know it's imperfect. For example, you may dislike the way your stomach looks in a top. Think to yourself, \"I don't like my stomach right now, but I like my body overall.\" After acknowledging you dislike your stomach, think about everything you love and appreciate about your body. Self love and appreciation are not all or nothing. It is okay to have frustrations without your body and still love the way you look overall."
