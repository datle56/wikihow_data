      "title": "Use your journal for goal setting.",
      "content": "Use your journal for goal setting. You can set goals for improving yourself without expecting perfection in every aspect of your life. Your goals should be clear and specific, but allow some “wiggle room” for imperfection. For example, instead of, “I will always speak against people who are spreading discrimination and hate,” you might make your goal, “I will do my best to calmly oppose the ideas of others who spread discrimination and hate.” Instead of “I will never eat sugar again and will lose 30 pounds,” your goal could be, “I will strive to live a healthier lifestyle with better food choices and more exercise.” Write down all your likes and the things that attract you. Try to find these things so you can put yourself in a zone where you'll feel fulfilled."

      "content": "Forgive yourself for being imperfect. Remember that you, like everyone, are human. You do not have to be perfect to have high self-esteem. [5] X Research source If you can accept yourself as you are, even if you are trying to improve in some areas, you will have much higher self-esteem. Create a mantra for yourself, like “that’s okay, I’m awesome anyway.” For example, if you lost your temper and yelled at your child at the park, you can say to yourself, “I am not perfect, and I will work on keeping my emotions in control. I will apologize to my child for yelling and explain to him why I became upset. It’s okay, I’m an awesome mom anyway.”"

If you feel that you are unable to improve your self-esteem on your own, or if you become very upset when exploring the roots of your low self-esteem, you may want to see a therapist who can help you identify and deal with the roots of your self-esteem problems. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an approach that will address your automatic negative thoughts about yourself and teach you how to deal with your emotions in a healthy way. For more complex self-esteem issues, more in-depth psychodynamic therapy may be a better option for dealing with the roots of your problems."

If there are negative influences in your life that cause you to feel badly about yourself, try to minimize or eliminate the time you spend with them. Include in your life, instead, people who are positive and support your positive self-thoughts. [9] X Research source Making your loved ones aware of your self-esteem building journey will encourage them to act as a support system for you.

      "content": "Recognize unreachable standards. Like Picasso's paintings, perfection changes in the eye of the beholder. Perfection is a state that is subjective and often self-imposed. It's okay to hold yourself to higher standards, but often, those standards are idealistic because life doesn't always go as planned. It is easy to get frustrated when you cannot match our ideal image of yourself. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because this is what motivates people to improve, find better and more efficient ways of doing things, and be the most excellent they can be."

      "content": "Learn self-esteem. Self-esteem, or the way we feel about ourselves, is an important aspect of our emotional well-being. High self-esteem means that we love and accept ourselves for the way we are, and generally feel satisfied most of the time. Low self-esteem means that we are not happy with the way we are. [13] X Research source The Centre for Clinical Interventions describes people with low self-esteem as having “deep-seated, basic, negative beliefs about themselves and the kind of person they are. These beliefs are often taken as facts or truths about their identity.” Untreated low-self esteem can often lead to lifelong problems, such as being the victim of abusive relationships, feeling constantly self-conscious, and being so afraid of failure that you don’t even try to set goals."

      "title": "Listen to your inner voice.",
      "content": "Listen to your inner voice. When you have thoughts about yourself, determine whether they are positive or negative. If you have trouble evaluating this or noticing a pattern, try writing down thoughts you have about yourself every day for a few days or a week. Then look at the statements for patterns or tendencies. [17] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source The inner voice of someone with low self-esteem often manifests in one of the following personas: a nagger, a generalist, a comparer, a catastrophizer, or a mind-reader. Each of these unique inner voices either insults you or assumes the worst about other people’s perception of you. Silencing the negative inner voice is a first step in building your confidence. Replacing it with more positive thoughts will be the next goal. For example, your inner voice may say “I didn’t get the job I just applied for, so I will never have a job again and I am useless.” You want to change that to “I am disappointed about not getting this job, but I have worked hard and the right job is out there waiting for me; I just have to find it.”"

      "title": "Investigate the source of your lowered self-esteem.",
      "content": "Investigate the source of your lowered self-esteem. No one has inherently low self-esteem from birth; it generally builds from childhood due to needs not being met, negative feedback from others, or due to a major negative life event. Knowing the source of your self-esteem problems can help you overcome them. If you noticed a particular pattern when evaluating your inner voice, try to trace those feelings back to your first memory about them. For example, if your negativity is about your weight or appearance, try to remember when you first started feeling uncomfortable with your weight; was it due to a particular comment or group of comments?"

      "content": "Set a goal to improve your self-esteem. The key to developing self-esteem is to turn your inner voice from a negative, critical voice to a positive, encouraging voice. Ultimately, you will have to decide to put in the work of re-framing the way you think about yourself. Setting an initial goal to be more positive about yourself will put you on the path to greater self-confidence and self-efficacy. For example, your goal may be “I will be more positive about myself and talk to myself like a friend rather than an enemy.”"
