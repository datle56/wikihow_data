Loop the yarn over the crochet hook and pull this yarn through the slipknot to make your first chain. Then, yarn over again and pull through again to make another chain. Repeat until you have the desired number of chains. [3] X Research source For a practice swatch, try making a chain of 18. This will allow you to see what the V-stitch looks like, and if you like it you can continue working it and create a V-stitch scarf. If you want to crochet a square of V-stitches, crochet a chain of 4 and connect the ends with a slipstitch. Then, crochet into the center of the circle to work the V-stitch in rounds rather than in rows. [4] X Research source"

Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through 2 stitches. Yarn over 1 more time and pull through the last 2 stitches on the hook to complete 1 double crochet stitch. [5] X Research source If you’re working V-stitches in the round, insert the hook into the center of the chain of 4 circle that you made when you work each double crochet stitch. Crochet 1 chain between each double crochet stitch and make a chain of 3 after each V. [6] X Research source"
