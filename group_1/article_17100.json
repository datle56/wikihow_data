      "content": "A simple Google search can help if you remember a song's exact lyrics. Type in any phrase or lyric you remember from the song. Use quotation marks around specific phrases to narrow your search, e.g., “destiny is calling me” or “wish we could turn back time.” [1] X Research source Avoid excessively searching common words like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"or,\" \"but,\" which will clog up your results. Add context to your search terms if you can. If you heard the song in a specific TV show or movie, for example, you might search for something like “song playing during the credits of Grey's Anatomy season six.” Try alternate spellings of any names or words in your remembered lyrics. For example, try “Zach” instead of “Zack” or “tonite” instead of “tonight.” Narrow down your search with advanced search engine options, such as limiting your search to pages released within a certain year or only showing results that contain all the words included."
