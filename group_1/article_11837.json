      "content": "Understand what makes a person be a control freak. People afflicted with this tendency have a need to control outcomes and often other people. They feel out of control and seek to control someone else. They are terrified of failure, particularly their own and of being unable to fathom the consequences when things go wrong. There is a core of fearfulness or anxiety about their own limitations (often unexplored), a worry about not being respected and a distrust in the ability of others to do what they ask of them. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source People who control others often want their needs met before others. The control freak cannot trust that anyone will do a better job than they will. And in an age when we are constantly told what to do without being fully told why (think of all the rules, regrets and warnings we live by daily), the control freak likes to step into the gap and appear as the sole authority figure around, whether or not they have a proper grasp on the facts (and sadly, they often do not). Core qualities of a controlling or bossy person include a lack of trust in others, a need to criticize, a sense of superiority (arrogance) and a liking for power. They can also feel that they deserve things that other people might not deserve, and feel that they do not need to spend time with or show respect for others. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "See if the controlling person needs professional help. Sometimes, a person is just a control freak, but there are times when the need for control goes beyond being an annoying personality trait. Controlling or bossy people may suffer from a personality disorder (possibly Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Antisocial Personality Disorder) that stems from childhood/early adulthood experiences that they have not been able to resolve with any clarity. If the bossy person has a true personality disorder, then the best way to deal with it is for the person to get help. [4] X Research source Getting professional help can help address control issues through therapy which often involves unraveling the source of the need for control. [5] X Research source If you suspect that this is the case, then the exact disorder would need to be identified by a professional. However, you should be aware that getting someone who likes to be in control to accept that he or she needs such assessment will be difficult. Ultimately, this person has to realize their controlling tendencies and want to do something about them. Most people who are controlling and bossy prefer to blame other people for their issues. Additionally, you may not always be in the position to suggest professional help to the bossy person. If the person, for example, is a boss or an older adult in your family, you may not be in the best position to suggest such a thing."

      "content": "Understand how a controlling person affects others. Bossy or controlling people sound like a perennially uncompromising parent. They might use terms such as \"Do it now!\", \"I am the boss, do what I say\", or \"Get on with it!\", without asking nicely or using any other form of manners. If you always feel childlike around this person, it's a fair bet that this person is seeking to control you and/or the situation. This person may ignore your skills, experiences and rights, preferring to impress their abilities over yours. The controlling type tends to think that they are entitled to boss others around and to be in charge. This helps them to feel better about themselves. [6] X Research source Even in situations where this person does have authority over you (such as a teacher, enforcement officer or boss), controlling tendencies are revealed through the manner of their use of power. If they are disrespectful, arrogant in tone, pushy and dictatorial, this is a good sign that the person is controlling rather than requesting, negotiating and respecting. People in positions of authority make good leaders or managers only if they respect others under their guidance. This includes directing by example or suggestion, trusting you and delegating responsibility to you."

This is the personality type that \"nags\", insisting that \"if you don't do X, the sky will fall down\"; this may be said to you sweetly, with the expectation that you'll be grateful for the nagging reminders. They may present themselves as the voice of reason, letting you know that you are extremely unreasonable. If you find yourself at the receiving end of decisions being made without your input \"for your own good\" and you're expected to be pleased, then you may be at the receiving end of a benign dictator. [7] X Research source Many a controlling person lacks empathy and is often rather unaware (or uncaring) about the impact of their bossy words and actions on others. This may be a result of insecurity (manifesting as superiority and power) and unhappiness. It could also signal outright arrogance."

This is crucial for your well-being. The control freak, especially if he or she is a family member, can really change your self-esteem for the worse. No matter how awful the person may make you feel at times, remind yourself that his or her controlling nature is his problem, not yours.

It is important that the controlling person is aware that you won't tolerate being bossed about; the longer you let it slide, the more it becomes the established pattern and it's assumed you're accepting of it. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Approach the controlling person in private to explain your concerns. Do not make a public affair out of this. Keep the conversation focused on how the controlling behavior is affecting you; do not insult the person by calling him or her bossy. For example, if you felt your boss was always telling you what to do without acknowledging your skills, you might say something like: \"I have worked in this capacity for five years and I am good at this job. However, when you tell me to give you the results so that you can rework everything, I feel as if my qualifications are being overlooked and that my input is not valued. Basically, I don't feel that I am trusted to come up with what I am well trained to do and that I am not respected. I would like to be spoken to and treated with respect.\""

It can also be helpful to give the person a wide berth when it's clear that they are tired, stressed out or unwell. If you start to get aggravated, the bossy person's behavior will only become more intense. It's important to take deep breaths, avoid aggressive language, and to keep your voice steady and even. [10] X Research source If you seem obviously aggravated or upset, then the person will see that he or she has really gotten to you, which will only fuel the behavior. Getting upset or angry will also make the bossy person view you as weak and even more easy to control. You don't want to give off this impression, or it will make you even more of a target."

      "content": "Avoid the person as much as you can. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is just to avoid the behavior. Though talking to the person about the behavior and how it's making you feel can help the person understand his behavior and to move towards a plan that will help you work together and get along more easily, sometimes you may feel that the only thing you have left to do is to remove yourself from the situation. Of course, it depends on the person you're trying to avoid, but here are some things to keep in mind: [11] X Research source If it is someone in your family, just try to stay out of their way. Sometimes it may seem there is just no pleasing the control freak. This person will criticize you on everything and it is very hard not to take it personally. It can make you furious and may hurt your feelings. The worst thing you can do is fight with such a person because it just wastes your time. They will not, and cannot, change without help. Remind yourself that this controlling behavior is their coping mechanism and is not a devaluation of you––it their deep-seated problem, not yours. If a personal relationship becomes abusive as a result of the person's controlling behavior, then you should get out and leave. Tell this person you need a break from him or her for now and move on in your life. People who resort to using violence or abusive tactics will not get better until they seek long term therapy. If you're a teen, try to be agreeable and keep very busy all the time. You can stay away and get out of the house by doing sports or studying and getting really good grades. Tell them you would love to hang out or talk but you are busy with studying, playing, volunteering, etc. Make up good excuses. Then go out and find really nice people who make you feel good about yourself. Set high but realistic goals and achieve them just for you."

[12] X Research source They believe that no one can do as good of a job at something as they will. They will get bogged down because they have taken too much on for themselves and then they strike out. Try to be alert to the mood change and be on your toes. If you're aware of the bossy person's anxiety levels rising, then you'll know that he or she will be more likely to be controlling. Talk about anxiety. Rather than getting caught up in how ridiculous or controlling their behaviors are, ask instead about what they’re worried about. [13] X Research source Actively noticing that this person seems to be spiraling out of control and offering to help take something off their plate may be enough to quell bossiness. For example, you might notice that when your boyfriend is stressed, he gets very snappy and controlling. On a day when he seems stressed to the max about an upcoming work presentation, try giving him a morale boost by acknowledging how tired or stressed he seems and reassure him that he'll do a great job. Don't overplay it and be aware that he may still snap, but do be aware that this small reassurance can help to relieve some of the anxiety pressure."

This may seem impossible but it can be a very useful way for you to regain control, especially where you have no choice but to keep dealing with this person daily. You might think, \"My boss is really controlling and demanding but on the plus side, she is charming with clients and brings in a lot of business. She is also very capable at X, just so long as we manage to keep her away from Y.\" Look for ways to manage around the negative aspects, as well as finding ways that you can get done what you need to do. [14] X Research source Looking on the bright side may require creativity but you'll find that a bossy person who understands you have got their measure and keep trumpeting their positive attributes will cease to see you as a threat in their anxiety-driven mind."

By noticing the good and acknowledging it openly, your controlling nemesis may just feel good enough inside to want to do it again. [15] X Research source For example, say something like: \"Thanks for trusting me with that task.\" This will make the controlling person feel good and may help him or her ease up on the reigns a bit."

      "content": "Understand that your voice may not be heard. If you are an ideas person, a creative person or a solver, working with a controlling person can grind you down. It may seem that you suggest ideas, solutions or warn of possible consequences, only to be openly ignored or even put down. Then lo and behold, your idea or solution is presented as \"his or her\" achievement, weeks or months later. Somehow, what you said did filter in; you just weren't acknowledged. This frustrating behavior is sadly all too common when it comes to control freaks. If this happens to you, here are some ways to cope: [16] X Research source Recognize this for what it is. Sometimes it is better to float the idea or solution than to not have it happen at all. In this case, grin and bear it for the good of your group, organization or company. Be supportive of the outcome and don't take it personally. Call the person out on it. This can be risky and will depend on the context, the group dynamics and the person involved. If it is very important for you to clarify that you thought of it first, you should try to use hard facts, such as \"Oh, that was the idea we discussed back in May 2012 and I still have the prototype drawings on file. My understanding was that our team would be involved in its development and I am pretty sure we noted that. I'm a little disappointed that the first we hear of it is when it's already in the testing phase. But, that said, since it's already here, we're free to help test it.\" Keep very good records. If you really do need to prove that you came up with the idea first, keep sound records that could be used in your defense if it ever comes to that. Stop suggesting new ideas in the workplace if your input continues to be ignored or taken away from you. Just keep agreeing, so as to keep the peace, and try to keep the control freak from getting worried about your end. You may need to reassure them constantly that they are the \"boss\" and that you value your job. If possible, start looking for a new job."

This isn't to excuse any manipulatively controlling behavior. Rather, it's about keeping things in perspective and acknowledging that there may be times when you have exasperated someone! Be honest in your self-assessment if you really want to get to the heart of the bossing. Here are some things to consider: [17] X Research source Have you done anything (or failed to do something) that may have provoked the controlling attitude? For example, if you fail to meet deadlines regularly or you never clean up your room, you shouldn't be surprised if someone responsible either for your upbringing or your pay-check gets a little bossy with you. Bossy people can often ramp up their bossiness in face of what they perceive as unhelpful. In particular, bossy people find passive-aggressive behavior similar to a red rag to a bull — it simply causes them to become even more controlling because they're frustrated at the underhanded response. It is better to be open with your discontent and to assert yourself than to seek the undermine the bossy person."

No one is all-good or all-bad; everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. When you know the truth about yourself (good or bad), you won't be fooled by the control freak's emotional whims and tactics. [19] X Research source Having a better sense of how you come off, whether it's in the workplace or in a relationship, can give you a better sense of how reasonable the bossy person's expectations really are.

They demand perfection from themselves, something both difficult and often impossible to achieve. Their inability to understand that failure is part of the cycle of life harms their ability to grow into fully competent human beings and stunts them emotionally; that's a fairly sad state to get stuck in. Whatever your own situation, you can leave and find happiness for yourself but unless they make a choice to change their thinking habits, they may never find peace in their lives. [21] X Research source Finding happiness does not always mean leaving. You could take up a time-consuming hobby, you could even find religion, to spend less time with the control freak.
