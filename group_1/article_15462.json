      "content": "Grab a small amount of noodles with your chopsticks . Tsukemen uses thick noodles so the broth can easily stick to them. Pinch 5-6 of the noodles between your chopsticks. Twist your chopsticks as you pick your noodles up to wrap them around one of the sticks. Don’t grab too many noodles at a time or else they may slip out of your grip. The noodles will be slippery. Keep practicing with your chopsticks until you can easily pick the noodles up. Keep your bowls only 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) apart so you don’t drop anything on the table."
