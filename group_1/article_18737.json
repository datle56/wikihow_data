You must be at least level 350 to get the Dark Blade V2, so work on completing quests and defeating bosses to level up if necessary. Furthermore, be sure to get the Dark Blade V1 before attempting to get the V2 upgrade. The Dark Blade can be acquired in a few different ways: [1] X Research source Buy it from the in-game store. The simplest way to get the Dark Blade is by purchasing it directly from the Blox Fruit store, although it’ll cost 1,200 Robux. Get it as a gift or trade . Any player with the Dark Blade Game Pass can gift or trade the blade to another player if they wish. Get the Brazil Cube . If you find the developer rip_indra in the game, they may give you a Brazil Cube—which will then reward you with the Dark Blade. Defeat the Mihawk boss . Although challenging, if you defeat the Mihawk boss, you’ll have a small chance to get the Dark Blade as a reward."

Go to the Third Sea and defeat the Sea Beast to get the Fist of Darkness. Have a friend in the game get the Fist of Darkness for themselves. Go to Graveyard Island together and have your friend start the Blackbeard raid. Run up to a pillar with a button after the raid begins and press the button, which will add a new skin (“Chess Yoru”) to your Dark Blade, upgrading it to V3."
