To make strawberry jam, crushed strawberries and sugar are mixed in a 45:55 mass ratio, and the mixture is heated to evaporate water until the residue contains one-third water by mass. Draw and label a flowchart of this process Do the degree-of-freedom analysis and show that the system has zero degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of unknown process variables equals the number of equations relating them). If you have too many unknowns, think about what you might have forgotten to do. Calculate how many pounds of strawberries are needed to make a pound of jam."

The mass fraction of sugar in 1.00lb of jam is 0.667 (lb Suagr)/(lb Jam) and the mass fraction of water is 0.333 (lb water)/(lb Jam) You know this because we are told that the jam is heated until (1/3) of the mass of the jam is water. The mass of strawberry to mass of sugar ratio is 45:55 ratio."
