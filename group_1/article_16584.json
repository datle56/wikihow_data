      "content": "Understand quitclaim deeds. A quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers an interest in property from one party to another. It lists who is transferring their interest in the property (the grantor) and who is receiving it (the grantee).

      "title": "Decide if a warranty deed is more appropriate.",
      "content": "Decide if a warranty deed is more appropriate. With a warranty deed, the seller warrants that the land is free of all liens. If the seller is wrong, then the real estate buyer can sue for compensation. With a quitclaim deed, the grantee has no recourse if someone with a lien shows up. [2] X Research source Accordingly, a warranty deed is probably more appropriate if you are transferring the property outside of the family. [3] X Research source If you need to talk to someone, then try to find a lawyer you can meet with for a short consultation. A qualified lawyer will listen to the facts of your case and advise you about whether a quitclaim deed is appropriate."
