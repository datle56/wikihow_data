Instead it must be disposed through the proper networks to prevent human and environmental harm. [1] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. Look at the four characteristics of hazardous waste: Ignitability means that the waste can easily catch on fire. It is considered flammable if the flash point is less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Corrosive wastes are acids/bases that are capable of corroding metal containers. Reactive wastes are unstable under normal conditions. They can cause explosions, toxic fumes, gases or vapors when heated. Toxic types of wastes are potentially fatal or harmful when absorbed or ingested. They can pollute groundwater if not disposed of properly."

Many industries are looking for ways to reduce the amount of hazardous chemicals they use, which in turn reduces the amount of hazardous waste they generate. The Environmental Protection Agency lists various approaches to do this for businesses: Lean manufacturing is a reduction tactic that emphasizes eliminating wastes that don't add value. Energy recovery is enacted through gasification. Gasification converts materials containing carbon into synthetic gas. This type of gas can be used as fuel to generate electricity and other features. Environmental Management Systems (EMS) is a system for assessing a company's environmental footprint. Green chemistry is a designing outlook that strives to create products and chemicals that reduce or remove hazardous substances."
