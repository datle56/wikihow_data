      "title": "Use a circular saw.",
      "content": "Use a circular saw. A circular saw is a handheld power saw with a circular blade. You can quickly cut through stainless steel with a circular saw if you use the right blade. Make sure you get a circular saw that can cut through sheet metal that’s as thick as yours is. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a diamond saw blade.",
      "content": "Get a diamond saw blade. Diamond saw blades are stronger than other saw blades you can use with a circular saw. Stainless steel is tougher to cut through than other metals, so you’ll want something strong like a diamond saw blade for your saw. Once you get the blade, swap it out with the blade that’s currently in your circular saw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clamp your sheet metal down to a work table.",
      "content": "Clamp your sheet metal down to a work table. Don’t try to cut your stainless steel without clamping it down or it could shift when you’re cutting it. Use clamps you can tighten, like F clamps, to secure the sheet metal to the table. The clamps should be tight enough that the sheet metal doesn't shift at all. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Line up the saw blade with the section you want to cut and turn on the saw.",
      "content": "Line up the saw blade with the section you want to cut and turn on the saw. Rest the flat base of the saw on the top of the sheet metal. Once the saw is on, slowly bring it across the top of the sheet metal, following the line you want to cut with the blade. It may help if you mark the line you want to cut beforehand. [3] X Research source Wear protective eyewear and gloves while you’re operating the circular saw. If you're trying to cut a perfectly straight line, lay a framing square on the sheet metal and press it against the flat base on the circular saw. As you're cutting, keep the base of the saw pressed against the edge of the framing square so the line you cut is straight. [4] X Research source You can also use a slide attachment to help keep your cuts straight."

      "title": "Turn off the saw when you’re done making your cut.",
      "content": "Turn off the saw when you’re done making your cut. Be careful handling the cut edges of your stainless steel. If they're sharp, use a deburring tool to file them down. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy a stainless steel tube cutter.",
      "content": "Buy a stainless steel tube cutter. A stainless steel tube cutter is a handheld device that clamps around a tube of stainless steel and cuts it with a small rotating wheel. Make sure you get a tube cutter designed specifically for stainless steel. Some stainless steel tube cutters can cut through thicker tubes than others, so know the measurement of your tube before you buy one. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert your stainless steel tube into the tube cutter.",
      "content": "Insert your stainless steel tube into the tube cutter. Line up the section you want to cut with the wheel on the cutter. Once your tube is in position, tighten it into place by rotating the knob at the end of the device. Keep rotating the knob until the tube is secure. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rotate the tube cutter around the tube until it cuts through it.",
      "content": "Rotate the tube cutter around the tube until it cuts through it. Hold the exposed end of the tube in one hand and rotate the tube cutter with your other hand. As you rotate the tube cutter around the tube, the small wheel on the cutter will gradually cut through the tube. Eventually, the wheel will cut all the way through the tube and the piece of tube you cut will fall off. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the tube from the tube cutter.",
      "content": "Remove the tube from the tube cutter. Rotate the knob at the end of the tube cutter if the tube is stuck. Be careful handling the cut edges of the tube. If the edges are sharp, file them down with a deburring tool. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy or rent a wet saw.",
      "content": "Buy or rent a wet saw. A wet saw is a table saw that pumps out water onto the saw blade as you’re using it. A wet saw is good for cutting stainless steel tiles because the water it pumps out cools off the stainless steel (which is prone to heating up quickly), making the tiles easier to cut. If you don’t own a wet saw and you don’t want to buy one, rent one from your local home improvement store instead."

    {
      "title": "Use a diamond wet saw blade.",
      "content": "Use a diamond wet saw blade. Diamond wet saw blades are stronger than other metal cutting blades. Because stainless steel is an exceptionally strong and durable metal, a regular wet saw blade won’t be as effective. Once you get the diamond blade, swap it out with the blade currently in the wet saw."

      "title": "Place your stainless steel tile face up on the wet saw table.",
      "content": "Place your stainless steel tile face up on the wet saw table. Make sure the table is pulled back toward you and away from the blade. Line up the section of the tile you want to cut with the blade on the wet saw. [10] X Research source Don't worry about clamping the tile down on the saw table."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn on the wet saw and slowly push the table toward the blade.",
      "content": "Turn on the wet saw and slowly push the table toward the blade. Use both of your hands to push the table, but make sure to keep them away from the blade. Don’t rush and push the tile through the blade too quickly or it may not cut properly. Continue to slowly push the table toward the blade until the blade has cut all the way through the stainless steel tile. [11] X Research source Make sure you’re wearing protective eyewear while you’re operating the wet saw."

      "title": "Turn off the wet saw and remove the cut tile.",
      "content": "Turn off the wet saw and remove the cut tile. Be careful handling the edges of the cut tile as they may be sharp. If you’re cutting multiple tiles, place another tile face up on the wet saw table and repeat the process. [12] X Research source If any edges of the tiles are going to be exposed, use a deburring tool to file them down so they're not sharp. [13] X Research source"
