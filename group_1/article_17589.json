      "content": "Lubricate the zipper with graphite. When your zipper just won’t budge, applying a lubricant can get it moving. Try rubbing graphite on your zipper’s teeth to lubricate them. Purchase a graphite stick used specifically for lubrication. If you don’t have one, use a Number 2 pencil. Run the pencil up and down the zipper’s teeth. If you want, you can just apply it to the area of the teeth where the zipper is stuck. Wiggle the slider up and down until it moves smoothly along the teeth."

      "content": "Apply laundry soap . When graphite doesn’t work, apply a dab of laundry soap to your stuck zipper. The soap may add an extra level of lubrication that will help you get the zipper unstuck. To use laundry soap as lubrication: [1] X Research source Pour a small amount of detergent into a small dish. Pour a small amount of water into the same dish. Dip a cotton ball or swab into the mixture. Use the saturated cotton ball to coat the teeth in the solution. Place the cotton ball down and gently attempt to unzip the zipper. It may only move a little. If this is the case, return the slider to its original position. Repeat until the zipper is unstuck."

      "title": "Wash the item and lubricate it.",
      "content": "Wash the item and lubricate it. If graphite or laundry detergent don’t work, you may want to launder the item and try again. Ultimately, washing the item may help remove dirt, grime, and other objects that hinder your ability to close the zipper. After you wash it, apply more lubricant. Consider washing the item by itself. This way, loose threads, fuzz, or debris from other items won't get stuck in the zipper."

      "content": "Remove buildup from a zipper’s teeth. When substances build up around the teeth of your zipper, it can prevent the zipper from staying closed. As a result, you’ll need to clean the teeth and remove stuff that could be preventing the zipper from closing. Combine water and soap in a small dish, and stir until suds form. Dip a clean rag in the soapy water and wipe down the zipper’s teeth. Grab a fresh rag and run it under the tap. Wipe the soapy mixture off the teeth with the damp rag. Attempt to zip and unzip as normal. [2] X Research source"

To do this, use your tool of choice (perhaps pliers) to pull the tooth straight. Repeat as needed. Be careful not to pull the tooth out of the tape.

Slowly feed the zipper into the slider. You may need to apply a little force. Make sure the side of the zipper moves down all the way into the bottom stopper. You may need to repeat this several times. [3] X Research source"

If you use pliers to gain more leverage, be careful that you don’t clamp down too hard and further damage the zipper.

An uneven gap may prevent the slider from properly engaging the teeth. If the slider is bent or there is a gap, take a pair of pliers and try to straighten it out. If you can’t fix the slider, you will have to replace it. The size should be listed on the back. If the size is not listed, measure the slider. Zipper parts are measured in millimeters. A 5-mm slider is a size 5. Purchase a replacement slider at your local fabric store or online. [5] X Research source"

When replacing the slider, make sure to: Locate the side of the zipper that has the square tab on the bottom. Wedge the top teeth of the zipper into the slider. If necessary, use a flathead screwdriver to wedge the teeth into the gap. Wiggle and pull the slider until it moves down to the bottom of the zipper. [6] X Research source"

There are a number issues that could continue to cause problems for you: If the zipper continues to split and you replaced the slider, you may have purchased the incorrect size. Try a different size slider. If you bent the original slider, the gap may still be uneven. Remove the slider and bend it again. Repeat until the item zips properly. [7] X Research source"

Without securing the stops, your slider will fall off or won’t function correctly. Use a pair of pliers to clench the stop into place. Press down on the stop 4 to 5 times to secure it. Repeat on the other side of the zipper. If you are only replacing 1 top zipper stop, make sure you place it on the side of the zipper with the tab at the bottom. [8] X Research source"

In some cases, you may need pliers to help you gain more leverage pulling the stop off. [9] X Research source"

By removing the tack, you’ll be able to fully access the teeth. This is important, as you’ll need to fix all your zipper’s teeth before your zipper will work correctly. Flip the garment inside out and locate the tack at the bottom of the placket layers of the item (this will be on the inside flap covering the zipper). Remove the tack with a seam ripper.

Thus, your zipper will function normally and won’t get stuck or snagged in the future. Bottom zipper stops are measured in millimeters. Determine the size you will need by measuring the width of the closed zipper. Turn the garment right side out. Push the prongs of the bottom zipper stop into the fabric directly above the old zipper stop—the new zipper stop will cover the missing bottom teeth. Turn the garment inside out and check if the stop is perpendicular to the zipper. Close the prongs with a pair of pliers to secure it in place. [11] X Research source"
