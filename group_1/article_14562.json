This line segment will form one side of your equilateral triangle, which means that you will need to draw two more lines of exactly the same length, each reaching toward a point at a 60° angle from the first line. Make sure that you have plenty of room to draw all three sides! [1] X Research source"

Connect each end of the original line segment to the point at which the arcs cross. Make sure that the lines are straight. To finish the job, erase the arcs that you drew so that only the triangle remains! [5] X Research source Consider tracing this triangle onto another page. This way, you can start fresh with a clean shape. If you need a bigger or a smaller triangle, repeat the process but adjust the length of the original line segment. The longer the sides, the bigger the triangle!"

      "title": "Choose your circular object.",
      "content": "Choose your circular object. Use almost any cylindrical object with a circular base, like a bottle or a soup can. Try using a circular roll of tape or a CD. If you are going to substitute the arc of this object for the arc of a compass tracer, you'll need to choose an object of the right size. In this method, each side of the equilateral triangle will be as long as the radius (half the diameter) of the circular object. If you use a CD as your object: imagine an equilateral triangle that fits into the top-right quadrant of a CD."

If you have a ruler: simply measure the diameter of the object and draw a line that is half as long. If you don't have a ruler: place the circular object onto a sheet of paper, then carefully trace the circumference with your pencil. Remove the object, and you should have a perfect circle. Use a straight edge to draw a line across the exact center of the circle: the point that is completely equidistant from any point around the circumference of the circle."
