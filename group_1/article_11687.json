If you're suffering from constipation, take a tablespoon of all-natural extra virgin olive oil and one tablespoon of lemon juice in the morning on an empty stomach. Olive oil is a common home remedy used to promote digestion and lubricate stool. Similarly, flax oil and orange juice is a common, but unverified, home remedy for constipation. In general, doctors do not recommend using mineral oil or castor oil for constipation remedies. Mineral oil can cause problems such as vitamin deficiencies, and castor oil can lead to long-term constipation."

All-natural yoghurt, fermented kombucha drinks, and naturally-fermented sauerkraut are all excellent sources of probiotic bacteria, which are commonly used to treat digestive issues, including constipation and diarrhea. If you've been constipation as a result of viral infection or other illnesses, foods containing probiotics can be a solution. While the research regarding probiotic cultures and constipation is somewhat mixed [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source , and probiotics are typically used to treat diarrhea, it's true that intestinal flora is an essential part of overall digestive health. Some favor the prebiotic approach over the probiotic approach because if you feed your existing probiotics, you encourage growth of the good bacteria—as opposed to ingesting good bacteria from another source (typically cows). With prebiotics you are establishing your own stable healthy gut, and don’t have to rely on feeding it new bacteria. You create a situation of competitive exclusion whereby the bad bacteria is less able to find food to eat because the good bacteria is growing faster, outnumbering the bad bacteria and out-eating the bad bacteria."

But chronic constipation can happen for a variety of reasons, including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease, and other problems. It can also be the result of medicine you're taking. In that case, stopping the medicine or treating the problem should relieve your constipation. [10] X Research source Ask your doctor about using laxatives. There are a variety of types, including lubricant laxatives, osmotic laxatives, and stimulants. Laxatives can offer short-term relief, but might worsen the situation in the long run. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor before taking osmotic laxatives because they can cause electrolyte imbalances and other problems. Stool softeners such as Colace and Surfak make stools easier to pass by adding fluid to them. Having softer stool can prevent you from having to strain during bowel movements. Your doctor may recommend one of these products if your constipation is due to childbirth or surgery. A naturopath can give dietary and lifestyle advice, and look at any underlying health concerns."
