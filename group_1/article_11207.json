      "title": "Measure the new coil spring.",
      "content": "Measure the new coil spring. Locate the dead coils on the spring. The dead coils are the coils on one end of the spring that touch each other. These coils do not move with the spring as it tenses and flexes. Measure out the distance of the old compressed coil spring from the other end of the spring. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to that number. If your old compressed coil spring measured 12 inches (30.5 cm), the new length will be 13 inches (33 cm). This measurement is the shortest possible length to which the new coil spring can be cut. If you cut the coil spring shorter than this total measurement, you will not be able to use the new coil spring in your car. Mark the place where you will cut the new coil spring with a bright-colored marker."
