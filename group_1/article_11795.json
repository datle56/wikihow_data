    {
      "title": "Remain calm.",
      "content": "Remain calm. When dealing with this person, you might feel tempted to cry or scream. However, doing so will only make the bullying worse. Once you show emotion, they'll know they got to you so don't give them the satisfaction! Take a few deep breaths, keep your voice lowered, and do your best not to cry. If you can't keep calm, step away until you feel more relaxed. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tell the person that what they said hurt you.",
      "content": "Tell the person that what they said hurt you. People sometimes say things without knowing that what they said was hurtful. They may do this out of ignorance or carelessness. Make sure to call attention to what was said if it was hurtful to you. Tell them how it made you feel and allow them a chance to change their behavior. For example, you might say something like: “You hurt my feelings when you made fun of my dress. It made me feel bad about my appearance.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use humor to throw them off their game.",
      "content": "Use humor to throw them off their game. The bully probably expects you to get upset, cry, or lower your head. But show them a different side of you. Make fun of their insult! They'll know that they have little power over you if can laugh at them. [2] X Research source You might say “So...Karen, are you just noticing that I have glasses? Cause I've had them for eight years. Maybe you need glasses, girl!” Avoid making a joke or laughing if it's your boss or parents who are insulting you. Instead, say “What makes you say that?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Change the subject.",
      "content": "Change the subject. When they begin insulting you, switch the topic of conversation. Talk about a book you're reading, celebrity gossip, or the good lunch you had. If you're around others, they'll likely join in on the new topic, too. [3] X Research source Say something like “Oh, did you all see the big Instagram fight Rob and Blac Chyna had? It was so crazy!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Compliment them.",
      "content": "Compliment them. Another way to throw off the insulter is to pay them a compliment. This will surprise them and shut down their bullying. If you can, make the compliment related to the insult they gave you. For instance, if they insult your shirt, you can say “I like your shirt. It's pretty. Where'd you buy it?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look confident.",
      "content": "Look confident. A bully is more likely to approach someone who looks like they have low self-esteem. Instead of looking down at your feet, hold your head up! Sit straight up in your chair and stand tall when walking. Let that bully know you're not the one to mess with. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get some distance from the bully.",
      "content": "Get some distance from the bully. Removing yourself from the possibility of running into the bully can help avoid their insults altogether. Take a new route when leaving class, increase your privacy online and make sure you're never alone with the bully unless necessary. If you're in a class together, ask if your teacher can sit you away from them. You can also ask to leave a few minutes early so you can avoid them when walking out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid being alone.",
      "content": "Avoid being alone. If the bullying occurs in the breakroom or on your walk to class, go with a friend. The bully is less likely to be mean to you in the presence of someone else. [5] X Research source If you want, you can tell your friend what's going on with the bully or you can just simply ask them to walk with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put in headphones.",
      "content": "Put in headphones. Tune that bully out by listening to that new album you like or watching videos on YouTube. This will drown out any insults they might be hurling at you while allowing you to do something fun. Killing two birds with one stone!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Find something else to do.",
      "content": "Find something else to do. Maybe you're in your room or at work when the bully begins going off. Do something else! Fold up clothes when your big sister is being mean or tidy up your desk if your coworker is at it again. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ignore them and walk away.",
      "content": "Ignore them and walk away. Sometimes, the best policy is to simply get away from them completely. Don't let them give you more insults than you can handle. Simply stand up, walk away, and go do something fun. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk with them.",
      "content": "Talk with them. Perhaps you've never told the bully how you feel or asked them to stop. Pull them aside and tell them you don't appreciate them speaking to you that way and you won't put up with it anymore. Ask a friend to come with you if you don't feel comfortable doing it alone. [8] X Research source You might say, “Josh, this whole insulting me thing is getting old. I have been patient with you, but I'm not going to take it anymore. I need you to stop.” You can practice this speech in the mirror at home a few times before doing it in person."

      "content": "Ask your friends to step in. If you have to be around the bully, find a friend who'll be with you. Talk to them about what's going on and ask them to support you in case they start being mean. [9] X Research source Say “Do you remember Eric? Well, he'll be there tonight and I'm so worried. Can you come with me and have my back? I don't want to be alone.”"

      "title": "Tell a parent or family member.",
      "content": "Tell a parent or family member. If you're in school or if the person bullying you is in your family, talk to your parents about it. They'll be able to talk you through it or even end the bullying altogether. You might say, “Hey Mom, I wanna talk to you about something. There's this kid Bob in my class, and he's mean to me. I've tried a few things, but he won't stop. I don't know what to do.” If the bully is your parent, talk to another relative like a grandfather/mother or aunt/uncle."

      "content": "Report them to the proper authorities. If this person is disrupting you at work, affecting your academics, or harming your self-esteem, report them!

For instance, you might look yourself in the mirror and say: “Brittany, you are an awesome chick. You are so smart, funny, and beautiful. Today is going to be the best day you've ever had.”"
