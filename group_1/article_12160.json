      "title": "Let the cake cool before you decorate it.",
      "content": "Let the cake cool before you decorate it. Before you do any decorating, you need to let your cake cool fully. Leave your cake at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or put it in the fridge uncovered for at least 30 minutes. [1] X Research source If you start decorating while your cake is hot, your frosting will melt and slide off of the cake. Speed up the cooling process by placing the cake on top of a cooling rack."

      "title": "Stick the layers together with frosting.",
      "content": "Stick the layers together with frosting. If you are making a layered cake, put your layers together with a thin spread of frosting. It doesn’t matter how many layers you have, but they should be stuck together with frosting so that they don’t fall off of each other while you are decorating. [2] X Research source The layers of frosting you use to stick your cake together will be visible when you cut into the cake. Use a bright color if you want to surprise your guests with multi-colored cake."

      "content": "Coat the sides of your cake with a thin layer of frosting to prevent crumbs. If you don’t want to get crumbs from your cake in the decorations that you use, put a thin layer of frosting on the sides of your cake. This layer will stick to all of the crumbs and hold them in place as you decorate later on. [3] X Research source You can chill your cake with a thin layer of frosting on it in the fridge for 30 minutes for added protection against crumbs."

Use small, even strokes to write in cursive or block letters on your cake. [6] X Research source Write messages like, “Happy Birthday,” “Congratulations,” or “It’s a Boy!” If you don’t have a piping bag, put your frosting in a zipper-top bag and cut off the end of one of the bottom corners."

Then, sprinkle the pieces onto the top and sides of your cake. It will be covered in pieces of candy, almost like sprinkles.

[11] X Research source To make a basic drizzle, combine 2 cups (116 g) of powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons (14.19 g) of butter, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vanilla extract, and 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of milk until your mixture is smooth.
