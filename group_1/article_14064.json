      "content": "These avocado-based chips were one of the most iconic Doritos flavors of the early ‘00s. You can’t really think about tortilla chips without thinking about guacamole, so it’s pretty clever that Doritos paired the flavor of the Mexican avocado dip with their classic chip. However, Guacamole Doritos were discontinued in 2006 (three years after their debut). Many customers expressed their shock over the guac being removed from shelves, even launching a Change.org petition to beg the company to bring back the flavor. [1] X Research source Doritos actually did bring the Guacamole chips back on April 28th, 2025. The brand was clear, however, that this was a limited release and did not specify how long the chips would be available…but we’re secretly hoping that they’ll stick around."

      "content": "This spicy and cheesy chip was discontinued in the ‘90s and again in 2013. As a classic ‘90s Doritos flavor, the Jumpin’ Jack Cheese chips were lightly cheesy with a mix of black pepper and hot pepper. The flavor was a fan favorite in the ‘90s, but was—for some unknown reason—discontinued during that same decade. Then, Jumpin’ Jack Cheese Doritos appeared once again in 2012-2013 before disappearing from shelves. [2] X Research source While you can occasionally find a rare bag at specialty snack shops, most diehard fans of the flavor say the taste is not like the original."

      "content": "This ‘90s Doritos flavor paired the iconic chip with a beloved Cheeto. In 1995, Cheetos and Doritos partnered up to create the holy grail of Franken-snacks—the Chester’s Cheese Dorito. This flavor was an instant hit when it first debuted, giving an extra boost of cheese to the already cheesy chip. While the flavor was discontinued in the ‘90s, some customers believe that the 2019 release of Ultimate Cheddar Doritos was a re-release of the Chester’s chip. However, the Ultimate Cheddar flavor was a bit of a flop, leaving cheese-loving Doritos fans still wanting for more. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "The Collisions line offered the best of both worlds…chips and chicken wings in a bag. Between 2007 and 2008, Doritos released a line of Collisions chips, which mixed two complementary chip flavors in a bag. One of the fan favorites was the Hot Wings and Blue Cheese Dorito flavors, which mixed together a spicy chicken chip and a blue cheese chip. The flavor was supposed to emulate the taste of eating spicy chicken wings that were dipped in blue cheese, and, according to reports, it made for a pretty delicious combo! [4] X Research source Collisions were never formally discontinued by the Doritos brand. However, they seemed to come off of shelves sometime around 2010-2011—just a few years after they first came out."

Honey-Glazed Ribs & Lemon Blast was another popular flavor in the Doritos Collisions lineup, alongside Hot Wings & Blue Cheese, Zesty Taco & Chipotle Ranch, and Pizza Cravers & Ranch. The Honey Glazed Ribs & Lemon Blast flavor aimed to give off the sensation of eating honey-marinated ribs with a squeeze of lemon—a Dorito-approved and delicious flavor combo that’s since been discontinued.

      "content": "Instead of a chip, the Crunch Mix was a scrumptiously flavored snack blend. Hopping on the popularity of other snack mixes like Chex Mix , Doritos decided to launch their very own crunchy concoction in 2017. The Doritos Crunch Mix contained a mixture of different snacks, including a crunch nut (a peanut with a crunchy coating), pretzels, corn sticks, puff balls, and puffed corn chips. Each piece was coated in a nacho cheese or cool ranch coating before being mixed together in an on-the-go-sized pouch. [6] X Research source While it’s not clear exactly when the Crunch Mix was discontinued, it appears that it was only sold for a few years, until about 2020."

      "content": "This mix of buffalo-inspired flavors was part of Doritos’ “Mix” lineup. During the 2010s, Doritos launched a line of chip mixes that were packed in large, family-sized bags. One of the most popular flavors (likely for frequenters of Buffalo Wild Wings and similar establishments) was the Blazin’ Buffalo Explosion. This Mix featured a Blazin’ Buffalo & Ranch corn chip, a chipotle corn stick, a Cool Ranch puffed triangle, and a blue cheese spiral corn stick. After its debut in 2017, this flavor mix disappeared soon after, and Doritos has done away with its snack mixes in general."

Another entry in the 2010s Doritos Mix lineup, the Cheese Explosion flavor featured a combo of different cheddar-infused chips and snacks. The standard bag included mini nacho cheese tortilla chips, a Jumpin’ Jack Cheese rolled chip, a four cheese corn spiral, and a spicy nacho puffed triangle. The Doritos Mix Cheese Explosion was seemingly added to the list of discontinued snacks sometime between 2017 and 2022. There was also a Taco Explosion flavor in the Mix line, which featured spicy nacho-, sour cream-, taco-, and salsa-flavored snacks."

      "content": "This super spicy Dorito was discontinued just a few years after its 2005 launch. The eye-catching Habanero flavor came with a big flame on the outside of the package…to match the big flavor inside the bag. After its introduction in 2005, fans were devastated when the Fiery Habanero Doritos were taken off the shelves just a few years later. Some individuals even emailed the company directly (and started a Change.org petition in 2017), but Doritos’ spokespeople simply said that they didn’t have enough shelf space and some flavors couldn’t be sold continuously.

The fiery Doritos Blaze were sold in bright purple bags adorned with flames and thermal handprints, showcasing the spicy heat of the chips inside. The flavor was well-received, especially as it was one of the only vegan Doritos flavors available. The chip disappeared from shelves in 2020 (after its 2018 release), prompting outcry from disappointed fans (and Twitter users )."

      "content": "These were touted as the hottest chip ever made…but not hot enough to stick around. In 2010, Doritos released a line of “Degree Burn” chips with three different flavor varieties. The most popular was the Fiery Buffalo flavor, which was apparently super spicy but subtly sweet. Some consumers even claimed that these were far beyond the hottest tortilla chips they’d ever eaten, making this flavor a shoo-in favorite for spice-loving Doritos eaters. [8] X Research source While the Degree Burn line was discontinued, Doritos still sells their Flamin’ Hot line (although these aren’t thought to be as spicy)."

      "content": "This nostalgic ‘90s Doritos flavor lasted from 1998-2001. The chip had a classic barbecue flavor with hits of smoky, spicy, and sweet flavor notes that made it impossible not to reach back in the bag for just one more . Smokey Red BBQ Doritos were also heavily marketed, premiering in a Super Bowl ad that starred ‘90s model Ali Landry (who later became known as “the Doritos girl”). The chips were also paired with holographic Star Wars game cards to promote the release of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace (1999). [9] X Research source It’s unclear exactly when or why the Smokey Red BBQ Doritos were discontinued. Doritos does currently sell a regular BBQ flavor , but customers claim that they don’t have the same flavor as the iconic ‘90s chip."

The Doritos Hot Mustard chips made their debut in 2023, but they were discontinued within just a couple of years. Their disappearance from shelves came after positive reviews from customers, including notes from Redditors that the flavor had a kick similar to wasabi—definitely putting the hot in hot mustard. While Hot Mustard Doritos are nowhere to be found, the Doritos Dinamita Sticks do come in a Hot Honey Mustard flavor, which is as close as you can get to the spicier chip’s taste."

These chips were well-received among customers, who claimed that the Doritos had a delicious beef flavor as well as hints of pickle, cheese, and lettuce. Despite its seeming success, the flavor only lasted for a year before being discontinued in 2010. [10] X Research source In March 2024, however, Doritos sold a Kroger-exclusive flavor that was extremely similar to the OG burger variety: the Late Night Sizzlin’ Cheese Burger. This chip was also a limited edition and is no longer available to purchase in stores."

      "content": "This taco-inspired chip was one of the most iconic Doritos flavors of the ‘90s. The Taco Supreme! Dorito was a result of a 1990s collab between Taco Bell and Frito-Lay (the company behind the Dorito). [11] X Research source The collab also debuted with a commercial that featured three teens snacking on Doritos while watching TV on the couch. After finishing their taco-inspired chips, they say of the snack mash-up, “That was a good idea. That was a real good idea.” [12] X Research source The Taco Supreme! flavor was always meant to be a limited release, so it’s no surprise that Doritos has never revived the chip. However, Taco Bell does have the Doritos Locos Taco on its menu, which may at least recapture the chip’s flavor profile."

So, they came up with the 3D Dorito line, which featured puffed triangles that were a slightly smaller but three-dimensional version of the classic chip. They didn’t last very long, but the 3D Jalapeno Cheddar Doritos are particularly missed (along with other varieties like 3D Spicy Ranch and Chili Cheese Nacho)."

In the late 1970s, Sour Cream & Onion Doritos debuted with the catch phrase “they taste as good as they crunch.” They were popular with customers, but they were discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s. However, they made a comeback in 2013 before being discontinued again. Since then, a 2019 petition has been started up to revive the flavor, but we haven’t seen it return to shelves yet. [14] X Research source Some countries outside the U.S. still have access to the Sour Cream & Onion flavor, like Japan, for instance."

      "content": "This mystery flavor was released in 2007 as a scavenger hunt for customers. In a clever marketing move—and a fun experience for Doritos fans—the snack brand released a bagged chip without a clear flavor. Instead, the bags were labeled as “Doritos X-13D Flavor Experiment,” with an Area 51-esque note that read “Objective: Taste and name Doritos flavor X-13 D. Tasting Notes: All-American Classic.” [15] X Research source As expected, the “tasters” turned to the internet to discuss which flavor they thought the X-13D chips were—some thought cheeseburger or hot dog, but multiple sources claim that the secret flavor was actually barbecue. Despite the hubbub around the secretive launch, Doritos has never actually said what the X-13D flavor was. So, it remains a mystery!"

In 2008, one year after the success of the (still mysterious) Doritos X-13D, Doritos launched another mystery flavor with a puzzle-esque quest behind it. These chips came in a black bag labeled simply as “The Quest.” The bag also featured the tagline “Guessing the flavor is just the beginning,” along with a website where customers would embark on a “quest” with a series of puzzles to guess the mysterious flavor and earn a $100,000 prize. [16] X Research source The chip itself was very tangy, so fans guessed flavors like lemon-lime, Girl Scout Cookies, margarita, and key lime pie. Eventually, Frito-Lay revealed that the mystery flavor was Mountain Dew."
