      "title": "Pray and practice talking to God.",
      "content": "Pray and practice talking to God. Holy Bible expert, Olivia Woodford, says that \"prayer is the foundation for any religious practice [and] any relationship with the divine.\" Consider how all the other relationships in your life started (aside from your parents and family members who knew you when you were a baby). Didn't they all begin by having a conversation. Think of starting a relationship with God in the same way, and pray to Him . Talk to God whenever you feel like it by speaking silently in your head, whispering under your breath, or speaking out loud (though you might want to try the latter when you're completely alone). Treat him like a trusted friend or family member, and tell Him whatever is on your mind, even if you think it's boring. He's always happy to hear from you, even if you're just talking about how your day at work went or the project you're working on from school. Use some of your prayer time to ask God to help you see His hand in your daily life and feel His love even in dark times. Tell Him how much you long to be close to Him and ask Him to make that happen. [1] X Research source If you don't feel comfortable speaking freely to God, say a pre-written prayer out loud instead. It can be one you wrote yourself, something you heard a person of faith say once, a passage from the Bible (like one of the Psalms), or a prayer out of a prayer book from any religion that you think is meaningful or beautiful."

      "title": "Read the Bible and other religious texts.",
      "content": "Read the Bible and other religious texts. In the Bible, God is kind of like the main character, so it makes sense to start your journey to finding him there. Don't restrict yourself to the New Testament or the Old Testament — instead, read both so you can learn as much as possible about God, His impact on the world, and His commandments as possible. This is one of the best and easiest ways to experience Him. [2] X Research source Read other religious texts, too, not just the Bible. For example, you can read the Quran, which is sort of like the Muslim Bible. You can also read collections of Buddhist scriptures like the Tripitaka and the Mahayana Sutras. Broaden your scope so you can get an idea of how many cultures around the world think about God. If you don't have a Bible, Christian theology expert Mark Russell recommends downloading the Bible App on your phone or going online to a website like Bible Gateway . He also suggests the Blue Letter Bible , a website which has \"a little bit more commentary on resources or… Bible passages.\""

      "title": "Listen to religious leaders and scholars talk about God.",
      "content": "Listen to religious leaders and scholars talk about God. Search on your preferred video or podcast platform (like YouTube or Spotify) for queries like \"finding God as a Christian\" or \"finding God as a Jew,\" and see what comes up. Once again, avoid limiting yourself to a single person or religious group's perspective. Listen to multiple sources so you can hear a variety of opinions. Along the way, you might discover just how many ways there are to draw close to God in this world. For example, if you search for \"finding God as a Christian\" on YouTube, you'll find videos about getting closer to God , finding Him in darkness , and other enlightening topics."

      "title": "Talk to people you know who say they found God.",
      "content": "Talk to people you know who say they found God. Most people know at least one or two people who strongly believe in God. Ask the religious people in your life how they found God or why they have such great faith in Him. As long as you approach them with an open mind and heart, they will probably be more than willing to have that conversation with you. Avoid arguing with them about points about God or their religion that you might disagree with. Remember, you're the one who asked them about their relationship with God, not the other way around! Ask questions to learn more if you feel so inclined, but respect their beliefs . You can always have your own opinion without making them feel like theirs isn't valid."

    {
      "title": "Research and investigate claims about God.",
      "content": "Research and investigate claims about God. Once you've read religious texts and listened to different perspectives on God and faith, make a list of claims about God you've heard that you're curious to learn about. For example, most Christians believe that Jesus is God or at least a part of Him. Do you believe that? If you're not sure but you want to find out, study the Bible more and get more points of view on the matter. [3] X Research source Research other claims with the same scrutiny so you can develop your own unique thoughts and beliefs about God. Don't be afraid to ask questions about God and how different religions and individuals conceptualize Him. While it's impossible to understand God, it's still okay to be curious and seek to know Him better."

      "title": "Question seemingly random miracles you've witnessed.",
      "content": "Question seemingly random miracles you've witnessed. Finding God isn't just about studying texts and hearing testimonials. It's also about looking around you to see His influence in real life. One area to look at is seemingly random miracles that you've witnessed. Such a miracle can be something dramatic, like surviving a horrific car crash, or something mundane, like finding a $20 bill on the ground just when you needed it. Consider if these events were really random or if there was a supernatural power behind them. Maybe God has been trying to alert you to His presence for a long time, and you just haven't noticed yet. Sometimes, it's hard to recognize a signal from God since we can't hear His voice with our ears or see Him with our eyes. But when you've heard from God, you'll get a good feeling about it. As Woodford says, \"[At] the moment… that God is speaking to you, it's not a question. It's no longer a question — you just know it.\""

      "title": "Reflect on the events that led you to try to find God.",
      "content": "Reflect on the events that led you to try to find God. What brought you here to this moment and inspired you to try to find God? Did you experience an event that made you rethink the importance of having faith in something bigger than yourself? Sometimes, retracing your steps and figuring out where you started on your journey can give you a fresh perspective on how far you've come. You'll probably find that it's no coincidence that you've made it to where you are now — it's divine guidance. God has been leading you to Him this whole time."

    {
      "title": "Journal your thoughts and feelings about God.",
      "content": "Journal your thoughts and feelings about God. As you begin to develop your opinions about God, write them down in a journal . This is a good way to get your thoughts out of your head so you can process them. It also helps you see how much progress you've made since the start of your search. You can even use your journal as a form of prayer and write directly to God. For example, you can start each new journal entry with the greeting \"Dear God\" or \"Dear Heavenly Father.\""

      "title": "Go outside and connect with God in nature.",
      "content": "Go outside and connect with God in nature. Even if you're not religious, spending quality time in nature can be a spiritual experience. By disconnecting from screens and surrounding ourselves with organic life, we automatically feel more at peace. When we're at peace, that's when we can hear God speaking to us and sense His presence. So, go for a stroll in the park, go hiking, or ramble about the countryside, and pray or at least reflect on God's wondrous Creation. [4] X Research source Take your journal with you and write down any thoughts or observations you make. Keep your phone in your pocket as much as possible. Resist the urge to turn your spiritual walk in nature into a photo opportunity for Instagram (although you can certainly take a picture of anything you see that moves you or you want to remember later)."

      "title": "Visit a religious study group or worship center.",
      "content": "Visit a religious study group or worship center. If you feel ready for it, choose a church, a synagogue, a mosque, or another religious center to visit. This isn't essential to finding God, but you may discover it's easier to find Him when you're surrounded by people who already believe in Him. You may also connect with other people who are (or were) searching, too, which may help you feel less alone. If you're unable to go to a center or you don't identify with any one particular religion or doctrine, Christian theology expert Liz Cooledge Jenkins suggests connecting with like-minded people online. \"There are… online communities, like Evolving Faith,\" she says, which provide \"resources and connections for people looking to reconnect with faith in a more open-minded way.\""

      "content": "Plan time for growing and developing your faith. When you've learned more about God and found a religion, a doctrine, or a frame of mind to think about Him, make a plan of action to grow your faith. [5] X Research source You can do this by continuing all the steps we already laid out, including praying, reading religious texts (like the Bible), listening to religious scholars, talking to people of faith, investigating claims about God, and journaling. Don't overwhelm yourself by trying to follow all the steps every day or for hours at a time (unless you just want to). Instead, set aside at least 15-30 minutes for focused prayer and study throughout the week and 1-2 hours on your days off work or school. Schedule more time for growing your faith by praying or listening to podcasts or videos about God when you're doing other things. For example, talk to God while you're finishing your chores, running errands, commuting, or exercising."

      "title": "In yourself.",
      "content": "In yourself. You may not think you're one of God's greatest Creations, but you are! Remember that you are \"fearfully and wonderfully made,\" despite all your flaws and past mistakes (Psalm 139:14). And if you believe He created you, then believe He's close beside you, leading your steps and helping you search for deeper meaning. Look for the good points in your character to see God working in your heart. Sure, you have flaws, you've made mistakes, and you may have even done some bad things intentionally. But just the fact that you're trying to improve shows integrity and a moral compass, qualities that ultimately come from God. Consider once again how you got to this point where you're actively searching for God. Reflect on the good — and bad — choices, events, and seemingly random happenstances you've experienced. If it seems like a miracle you've come as far as you have, that's because it is! God planned everything perfectly so you would be where you are now, longing for connection with Him."

      "title": "In your relationships.",
      "content": "In your relationships. God brings people into our lives and takes them away for reasons that aren't always apparent to us. While you can, it's a good idea to stop and view your relationships with your friends, family, romantic partners, and even co-workers objectively and try to hear God speaking to you through them. For example, if you have to deal with a narcissistic parent , God may be using them to show you behavior He wants you not to emulate. In another example, you may have a friend who believes deeply in God and is extremely religious. This friend may be in your life to show you what a good relationship with God can look like."

      "title": "At work or school.",
      "content": "At work or school. God is always present wherever we go, including work and school. In these places where we spend so many of our waking hours during the week, we can find an opportunity to see and learn from God everywhere. For example, you might find Him when you get the chance to be kind to someone who's been bullied or when you're faced with the choice to lie to your boss or be honest about a mistake you made. Experiencing God isn't just about observation but action. The warm feeling we get when we've behaved in a manner that pleases Him is a great way to connect with Him."

      "title": "In nature.",
      "content": "In nature. Sometimes, it's easier to feel God's presence when we're exploring and contemplating the world He created for us. Even if you can only travel as far as a park in your local city or walk out to your backyard, set aside time for experiencing nature. Take your time, try to keep your phone in your pocket, and give yourself permission to just think about God and the teeming life around you instead of your mundane, day-to-day worries.

      "title": "In a place of worship.",
      "content": "In a place of worship. A church, synagogue, mosque, or another place of worship is often where believers feel most connected to God. In these hallowed places, dozens or even hundreds of people lift their hearts and minds to a higher purpose: praying to and praising their Creator. When you're surrounded by that kind of positive energy, you may feel God pulling on your heartstrings, too."

In Jeremiah 29:13, we read, \"You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.\" Then, in Proverbs 8:17, we find the same sentiment: \"I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.\" One more example is Matthew 7:8, which says, \"For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.\" If you ever feel discouraged when you're trying to find God, know from the above verses that you will succeed.

The more you pray, study religious texts, listen to others talk about Him, and observe His impact on your life, the closer you'll feel to Him. Remember this verse when you feel discouraged: \"You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart\" (Jeremiah 29:13)."
