      "title": "Ask someone for a pad if you don’t have one.",
      "content": "Ask someone for a pad if you don’t have one. Perhaps you were prepared and have a pad stashed in your locker, but maybe this isn’t the case for you. Not to worry! Go see your school nurse to ask for a pad, or ask any person in school who you think might have their period. No need to be embarrassed! People sharing menstrual products is a practice as old as time. It is part of the code of having a period. [1] X Research source Your bathrooms at school may have a coin-operated dispenser that sells pads. If your school has a nurse’s office, the nurse will likely have pads or other period products on hand."

      "title": "Pull your underwear down to your knees.",
      "content": "Pull your underwear down to your knees. Go into the bathroom and pull down your pants or skirt and underwear. Sit down on the toilet so any blood will drip into the toilet bowl and not onto the floor or your clothing. Wipe yourself with toilet paper to clean away any excess blood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unwrap the pad and remove the backing.",
      "content": "Unwrap the pad and remove the backing. Carefully open the packaging around your pad and remove it. You may want to save the wrapper for later. It is perfect for disposing of your pad when it’s time to change, although you'll likely have another pad wrapper at that time. [2] X Research source Then, remove the backing to expose the adhesive. Usually, you will find a long piece of wax-like paper covering the sticky side on the bottom of the pad. In some brands, the outer wrapper may also double as backing, so the adhesive may already be exposed when you remove the wrapper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Center the pad in the crotch of your underwear.",
      "content": "Center the pad in the crotch of your underwear. On most underwear, there is a cotton panel in the crotch area that you can use as a guide. Basically, you want the pad to cover the part that goes between your legs. If your pad has one wider or bigger side, it should go toward the back of your underwear (toward your butt). Make sure the adhesive is stuck firmly to the fabric of your underwear. [3] X Research source If your pad has wings, remove the backing and fold them around the middle part of your underwear, so it looks like the pad is hugging your underwear. The wings should be like “arms” wrapped around the crotch of the underwear. Make sure the pad isn't too far forward or too far back. It should be centered so you don’t get leaks at the front or back of the pad. For reusable pads, there is usually a popper button on the wings to hold it in place."

    {
      "title": "Pull your underwear up.",
      "content": "Pull your underwear up. Make sure that your underwear and the pad fit snugly against your body. It might be a little uncomfortable at first (kind of like wearing a diaper), but you will get used to it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change your pad every 3-4 hours.",
      "content": "Change your pad every 3-4 hours. If you have a heavy flow, you might have to change your pad more often. This will help reduce the risk of leaks, bad odors, or irritation. [4] X Research source When you change your pad, wrap up the old pad in some toilet paper, the new pad’s wrapper or place in a small plastic disposal bag and throw it in the garbage. Never toss used pads or wrappers in the toilet—you’ll clog up the pipes! It is also bad for the environment."

    {
      "title": "Create a make-shift pad with toilet paper.",
      "content": "Create a make-shift pad with toilet paper. If you are not able to locate a period product, don’t worry. You can use toilet paper to create a make-shift pad until you go home or can get to the nurse's office. Simply take a long piece of toilet paper and fold it into a rectangle. Place the toilet paper rectangle in the crotch of your underwear. Then take another long piece of toilet paper and wrap it around both the rectangle and your underpants, holding the make-shift pad in place. You will want to check this more often that you would check a traditional pad, but it should do the trick in a pinch! [5] X Research source If you have a heavy flow, you might soak through this type of 'pad' pretty quickly. Just use it as a temporary fix until you can get something better."

      "title": "Go see the nurse to ask for supplies.",
      "content": "Go see the nurse to ask for supplies. If you have just gotten your first period, a visit to the school nurse might be a good idea. The nurse can provide you with period products if you need them, and you can probably sit or lie down for a little while to feel better and gain your composure. The nurse may also have a hot water bottle or heating pad you can place on your belly (for cramps), or some over-the-counter pain medication (like ibuprofen). [6] X Research source While you’re in the nurse’s office, you can also ask to call your parents or guardians so they can bring you more supplies."

      "title": "Wrap a sweater around your waist if you want to hide stains.",
      "content": "Wrap a sweater around your waist if you want to hide stains. Although first periods are usually very light, especially at the start, there is still a chance that you might get some blood on your pants. If this happens to you, simply wrap a long-sleeved shirt around your waist to cover it up. If you don’t have one, you may be able to borrow one from a friend. If possible, change into clean pants as soon as you can. For example, you might ask to be excused and go change into your gym pants. [7] X Research source The school nurse may also have extra clothes on hand for you to borrow."

      "title": "Don’t be embarrassed.",
      "content": "Don’t be embarrassed. The most important thing is to keep a good attitude. It’s true that you might not feel very well when you have your period, and it can be a lot to handle, but it is a natural and important part of life! It means that you are a growing and changing. Having your period is totally normal, and not something you should ever feel ashamed of. [8] X Research source Remind yourself that a lot of people go through this! Lots of the people around you have probably had a period before. Try to have a sense of humor about it. Read about period jokes online and share them with your friends. Such as, \"Jokes about menstrual cycles are funny. Period.\""

      "title": "Read about what to expect.",
      "content": "Read about what to expect. The more educated you are on the subject, the easier it will be to stay calm when it happens. Check out a book about periods or do some research online. Your first period will probably be very light, and may not even look like blood. You may notice your period as bright red drops in your underwear, but it could also be any shade from maroon to brown. [9] X Research source Also, don't worry that you will be losing a lot of blood. The average person loses only about 1–6 tablespoons (15–89 mL) of blood during a period. When your period comes, you may notice a feeling of wetness in your underwear. You may even feel liquid flowing out of your vagina, or you may not notice anything at all. You may be more likely to feel the blood coming out of your vagina when you laugh, cough or sneeze. If you are scared of blood or bleeding, try looking at it this way: your period isn’t blood from a wound or injury. The blood from your period is actually a sign that you're healthy. If your school offers sex ed classes, pay special attention to any information about periods. Don’t be afraid to ask your teacher questions if you don’t understand something."

      "title": "Talk to someone you trust.",
      "content": "Talk to someone you trust. One of the best ways to learn about what to expect is to talk to your mom, older sibling, aunt, cousin, or friend who has already gotten their period. This way you can have an open, back and forth conversation, and ask any questions you may have. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Kids often begin their periods around the same age as their close biological relatives did. So if talking to your parent or sibling is an option, find out when they started and what is was like. You can simply say, \"I'm nervous about getting my first period.\" (Or, if you have already started, \"I just started my first period.\") Then you can say, \"What was it like when you started yours?\" If you’re not comfortable talking to anyone in your family, ask another adult, like your doctor, your school nurse, or a trusted teacher."

      "title": "Buy supplies before your period starts.",
      "content": "Buy supplies before your period starts. Your local drugstore or grocery store will probably have an entire aisle dedicated to menstrual products. There are a lot of choices, and eventually you’ll figure which products you like best. To start out, look for pads that aren't too bulky. You will probably want light or medium absorbency. [11] X Research source . Pads are probably the easiest thing to start out with. You will have enough to think about without worrying about how to properly insert a tampon . However, if you would prefer to use a tampon or a menstrual cup during your first period, that is okay too. It is most important for you to feel comfortable. If you feel embarrassed about buying pads or tampons, just remember that the cashier really doesn't care what you are buying and it's nothing new or shocking to them. You can also get reusable products, such as reusable pads, panty liners and period underwear. These have many benefits, such as comfort, being eco-friendly, saving money in the long run and knowing they'll always be there."

      "title": "Store some supplies at school.",
      "content": "Store some supplies at school. It is a good idea to store some pads in your backpack, purse, gym bag, and/or locker at school (just one or two in each place is fine). If you have the supplies with you at school, you do not need to worry about your first period catching you by surprise. [12] X Research source You may want to get a makeup bag or pencil case to store your period supplies. You may also want to keep a pair of underwear in your locker just in case. If your school allows it, keep a little bottle of ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain medication in your locker to help with cramps. Keep a bar of dark chocolate on hand, as it has been proven to help with PMS and give your mood a boost."

      "content": "Watch for signs that your period is coming . There is no surefire way to know that your period is approaching, but there are some signs that might give you a clue. If you experience a stomach or backache, cramps in your abdomen, or sore breasts, it may mean that your first period is approaching. [13] X Research source People can get their first period as early as 8 years old and as late as 16. The average age is 12. You may notice a white discharge in your underpants up to six months before getting your first period. Your period usually comes after you have reached 100 pounds (45 kg)."
