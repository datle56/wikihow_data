      "content": "Cut the stem off of a hibiscus flower. Leave a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) stub at the bottom of the blossom so that it will be easier to handle. Make sure that the flower you are using is completely dry and does not have any holes, tears, or bruising. Do not use this method if you wish to use the flowers for food, drink, or cosmetics. Silica gel will render the petals inedible."

      "content": "Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of silica gel into a glass or plastic container. Choose a container that is wider and deeper than your flower. If you want to dry more than 1 hibiscus flower, make sure that the container is wide enough to fit all of the flowers with space between them. Fill the container with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of silica gel. [2] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source You can find silica gel in the floral section of a craft store. Contrary to its name, it is actually a white, powdery substance. The amount of space you leave between multiple flowers does not have to be exact. As long as the petals are not touching, you will be fine."

      "content": "Cover the flower with more silica gel. Pour the silica gel slowly over and around the flower so that you don't crush the petals. Keep adding the gel until the flower is completely covered. Ideally, you should have a 1 in (2.5 cm) thick layer of silica gel on top of the flower.

      "content": "Cover the container with a lid and leave it alone for 2 to 6 days. Make sure that the lid is on tightly, as any moisture could prevent the silica gel from working properly. Place the container some place where it won't get accidentally bumped or moved, as this can ruin the flower. The place should be dry and dark, not humid. A cabinet would be ideal. [4] X Research source Check the flower after 2 days. If it is not dry and papery, cover it back up with silica gel, and wait longer."

Use the brush to delicately wipe off any excess silica that may be clinging to the petals. [6] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source If you are worried about the flower falling apart, you can place a drop of clear-drying glue into its center. The glue will help hold the petals together once it dries."

If you aren't happy with the flower's shape, you can add it to a bowl of potpourri. Do not use these flowers in soaps, teas, or makeup. The silica gel would render them unsafe for consumption and cosmetic use."

Once the container is full, go through the flowers, and pull off the yellow stamens in the center. Leave the stems on the flower, as this will make them easier to dry.

Keep the wire taut enough so that it keeps the flowers secure, but loose enough so that it doesn't crush the flowers. [10] X Research source Keep the flowers at an angle under the wire, so that the wire goes between the petals. You can use any type of thin wire, such as jewelry wire or floral wire.

How long this takes depends on how dry or humid it is, as well as how sunny it is. Expect to wait at least 3 days. [11] X Research source It is very important that you bring the flowers indoors for the evening, as any morning dew will reverse the drying process. Keep the flowers in the driest, sunniest spot in your garden, patio, or balcony. Check on the flowers once or twice daily until they dry. If you notice that the flowers are only drying on 1 side, rotate them."

Let the tea steep for 20 minutes, then strain it. Sweeten the tea with honey, if desired, then serve it hot or cold. For a warm, sweet flavor, add a pinch of cinnamon and a slice of prance peel. If you want something refreshing, try a mint leaf and a slice of orange peel. For a more tart flavor, add a squeeze of lime just before serving the tea."

The calyx is the green, trumpet-shaped part at the base of the flower, which will eventually turn red and brittle. [14] X Research source The hibiscus must be pesticide-free if you are using it for tea. It does not have to be pesticide-free if you are using it for general crafts. You can try using this method for the actual flowers too, but you will need to adjust the drying time."

Locate the red calyx, then pick it after 24 to 48 hours. This will ensure that it is ripe. [15] X Research source The calyx should pop off of its stem easily.

Alternatively, you can string whole calyxes onto thread and make a pretty garland for your room."
