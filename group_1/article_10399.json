      "content": "Place a sign or screen in front of the window for a temporary option. One of the fastest ways to cover your window is simply to prop something in front of it. You can use pretty much anything, from a sign or artwork to a privacy screen for larger windows. Just choose something that reflects your personal style! [1] X Research source If your style is farmhouse-chic, prop up a pretty hand-painted sign with a cheery message like \"There's no place like home.\" To cover a large bay window or sliding doors, try using a folding room divider that matches the rest of your decor. Propping something in front of the window is a great option if you want to be able to easily change the look of the window. In addition, you don't have to worry about putting any holes in the wall if you're renting."

      "content": "Put colorful glass bottles in the windowsill for a pretty display. A collection of glass bottles will catch the light beautifully. It will also help provide some privacy since anyone looking in will see the colorful glass, rather than the inside of your home. Search secondhand shops for cool glass pieces in a variety of shapes and sizes, or repurpose bottles you might already have on hand. [2] X Research source For a sleek look, stick to 1 or 2 colors for the bottles in your window. If your style is more eclectic, pick an array of bright shades. If you can't find any colorful bottles, try painting some yourself !"

      "content": "Mount a shelf in front of a window for partial coverage. A shelf is a great way to partially cover a window without blocking out natural light. Measure the width of your window, and buy a shelf that’s about 4 inches (10 cm) wider at a local home-improvement store. Mount the shelf as directed in the instructions—typically, you'll need to drill holes and screw in the brackets, and the shelf will sit on those brackets. Then, you can decorate the shelf however you'd like. [3] X Research source For instance, you might fill the shelf with a houseplant, a couple of books, and a decorative vase. Try using glass shelves to make the most of the natural lighting. As an added bonus, you'll get a little extra storage space!"

      "content": "Hang a DIY valence made of draped fabric in front of the window. Drive 2 nails or push pins into the wall, 1 on either side of the top of your window. Tie a piece of twine or string between the nails, then hang 15–20 pieces of fabric over it. Each strip should be between 20–25 inches (51–64 cm) long. Use bandanas, scarves, or a leftover fabric garland. [4] X Research source The valence will fully cover the top portion of your window but still allow some visibility and natural light. For a more refined-looking valence, hang a curtain rod over your window, and drape pieces of fabric over the rod."

      "content": "Place 3–5 tall potted plants in front of a window. While plants aren’t technically a window covering, they’re effective at partially blocking visibility while allowing in natural light. Try setting a few leafy houseplants on the windowsill of a kitchen window, for instance. Or, if you want to cover a tall, narrow window, like in a hall or entryway, set a single tall houseplant directly in front of it. [5] X Research source For a low-maintenance option, use artificial plants, birch or willow branches, or dried pampas grass."

      "content": "Layer gallery glass over your windows to create an opaque surface. Gallery glass is a liquid that you can apply directly to your windows—just brush it on and let it dry. You can buy gallery glass in a huge variety of colors. It dries opaque but still lets in some natural light. [8] X Research source If you want your window to have a textured look, run a toothpick through the gallery glass before it dries. To create a border on your window, or to define shapes on the glass, trace the outline with liquid leading first. Then, brush on the gallery glass after the leading has dried.

      "content": "Apply window insulation film to the windows to keep in warm air. Window insulation film adds an insulating layer over your windows and will trap warm air in your home during chilly winter months. To apply it, stick the adhesive side of the insulation film directly onto the surface of the window. Then, blow hot air onto the film using a hair dryer. After 3-5 minutes, the film will shrink and fully adhere to the window. [10] X Research source Many of these films are transparent, so be sure you choose a tinted film if you want the extra privacy. Purchase window insulation film at a local hardware store or any major home-improvement store. The package should clearly state how much glass the insulation film will cover."

      "content": "Etch the glass for a frosted look. Pick up some glass etching cream and an artist's paintbrush from your local craft store, along with a stencil, if you'd like to use one. Clean the glass thoroughly and let it dry, then brush the etching cream onto the window and let it sit according to the directions. Then, rinse away the cream with a sponge and clean water. When you're finished, the window will have an opaque, frosted look—so you'll have all the privacy you need, with no curtains required! [11] X Research source Be sure to wear gloves, since the etching cream can irritate your skin. Keep in mind that this effect is permanent, so if you're renting, you may need to ask your landlord's permission to do this."

If you'd like to try blinds, you'll first need to measure the width and height of your window. Then, purchase blinds at a local home-improvement store. Begin the installation by hanging the brackets at the top corners of each window. Then, hang the head rail and attach the valence over it once the rail is in place. Basic horizontal vinyl blinds are a great option if you're shopping on a budget. However, there are more sophisticated options if you want to spend a little more! Blinds are a great option to cover your windows when you still want plenty of natural light. Just open them in the morning, then close them at night for more privacy. [12] X Expert Source Cindy Hofen Professional Organizer & Home Staging Specialist Expert Interview. 13 February 2020. Wood blinds are perfect when you want a warm, rustic look.

      "content": "Opt for vertical blinds in a window that’s wider than it is tall. Vertical blinds have a classy, chic look. They work especially well in tall, narrow hallway or entranceway windows that are less than 1 foot (30 cm) wide. They can't be raised or lowered, but you can still adjust the slats to let in more or less light depending on the time of day. [14] X Research source Installing traditional horizontal blinds in a tall, narrow window would be impractical and look odd."

      "content": "Use shades for a soft covering that allows ambient light. Choose shades if you need privacy but you still want some light throughout the day. Shades are typically made of soft cloth and can be raised or lowered anytime you want to adjust them. They also allow more ambient light than blinds and come in a larger variety of styles. Purchase shades at any home-improvement store. [15] X Research source Install honeycomb shades if you live in a cold climate. Honeycomb shades contain many small tubes of air that hold warm air to help keep your home warm overnight. Try woven wood shades in rooms that receive overly bright sunlight. Woven shades are typically made from bamboo. They block a great deal of light, but can still be raised and lowered depending on how bright the room needs to be."

You can raise or lower to let in more or less light, or to block the inside of your home from view at night. They’re considered a sleek option and are typically custom-ordered for individual windows. Also order blackout Roman shades if you’d like the option to shut out all light from a room. [16] X Research source If you like the idea of fabric shades but don’t have a formal room, choose a shade made of tightly woven opaque twill."

The horizontal slats allow partial visibility, but you can open or close them when you need to. They come in a variety of colors, sizes, and materials, so choose an option that suits the size of your windows. Typically, you'll mount the shutters directly onto the exterior of your home, although some can be installed indoors, depending on the look you're going for. [17] X Research source You can purchase shutters at any home improvement store. The shutters will come with directions for how to install them. However, if you’d rather not install the shutters yourself, the home-improvement store can send professionals to install them for you."

All you have to do is raise or lower a bar that controls the shutter slats. This allows you to make slight adjustments to the amount of natural light that enters your home as the position of the sun changes. Plantation shutters also fully reduce visibility in at night.
