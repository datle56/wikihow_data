Your doctor will observe the nodule for a 6-18-month period to see if it grows or changes. If not, then the doctor will probably leave the nodule alone with no further treatment.

Whenever your doctor examines a nodule, they will probably want to do a biopsy to confirm that the growth isn’t cancerous. During a biopsy, the doctor will take a small sample from the nodule and test it for cancer cells. In most cases, this comes back negative and confirms that the nodule is benign.

For a thyroid nodule, the doctor may insert a small needle into your neck. [6] X Research source For a lung nodule, they may insert a small tube down your throat.
