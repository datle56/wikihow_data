      "title": "Choose a large, round helmet to serve as your baby bump.",
      "content": "Choose a large, round helmet to serve as your baby bump. A bicycle helmet works best for this method, but try out a few different shapes and sizes to see which helmet looks the most convincing. [1] X Research source Pick a helmet without a face mask so your belly doesn’t appear bumpy or misshapen. If you have a smaller frame, choose a kid’s helmet so your bump is proportional to your body."

      "title": "Apply masking tape over the top of the helmet to hide any ridges.",
      "content": "Apply masking tape over the top of the helmet to hide any ridges. To create a realistic looking bump, start by placing the masking tape at the front of the helmet, then carefully press it down until you reach the back. Add layers of tape until your helmet is completely smooth. If you notice any bumps or air bubbles in the tape, simply tape over those areas, and use shorter strips of tape across the helmet (instead of using one long strip from front to back)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure any hanging straps with masking tape.",
      "content": "Secure any hanging straps with masking tape. Tuck the loose straps inside the helmet, then attach them to the dome with some masking tape. Be sure to use enough tape so the straps stay in place and don’t hang out of your fake bump. If you’re not planning on using the helmet for anything else, cut the straps off with a sharp pair of scissors. Alternatively, leave the straps loose and wrap them around your torso to attach your bump. You can simply tie the straps into a knot or use a safety pin to hold it in place."

      "title": "Attach the helmet to your torso with elastic bandage wrap, bandeaus, or tape.",
      "content": "Attach the helmet to your torso with elastic bandage wrap, bandeaus, or tape. There are a few different ways to keep your bump in place, and you might even try a combination of these ideas. You don’t want your belly sliding around or falling off! Tightly wrap an elastic bandage wrap around the helmet and your back. Use as many layers as you need to secure the helmet and make the bump look smooth underneath a shirt. Layer a few tight bandeaus over the helmet to keep it in place. Secure the helmet with some heavy-duty duct tape ."

      "title": "Wear loose, flowy clothes that complement your fake pregnancy belly.",
      "content": "Wear loose, flowy clothes that complement your fake pregnancy belly. To embrace the pregnant life, choose clothing that flatters your larger figure. Button down shirts and empire waist dresses are complementary and stylish, and they help conceal any misshapen areas on the helmet. [2] X Research source If your top is too tight, it might look obvious that you’re wearing a fake pregnancy belly."

      "title": "Grab 2 blankets that are medium in thickness and size.",
      "content": "Grab 2 blankets that are medium in thickness and size. They will make up the bulk of your baby bump, so choose ones that are about the size and weight of a regular throw blanket. Avoid blankets that have fringe on them, since they might make your belly look misshapen."

      "title": "Fold Blanket 1 into a diamond to create the outer layer of your belly.",
      "content": "Fold Blanket 1 into a diamond to create the outer layer of your belly. Lay the blanket on a flat surface, then carefully fold each of the 4 corners toward the center of the blanket until they touch. Depending on the shape of the blanket, you should end up with an uneven diamond or square shape, but don’t worry if the blanket isn’t a perfect diamond—you’re only using it to add dimension to your bump and create a smooth surface!"

      "title": "Roll up Blanket 2 into a ball to make the bulk of your fake belly.",
      "content": "Roll up Blanket 2 into a ball to make the bulk of your fake belly. To imitate the shape of a pregnant belly, ball up the blanket into an oval shape (instead of a perfect circle). Try to hide all the edges of the blanket on one side so the other side remains smooth. When you attach the blanket to your torso, face the smooth side outwards so it looks like a realistic pregnancy bump."

      "title": "Wrap Blanket 1 around the Blanket 2 to create a fuller looker belly.",
      "content": "Wrap Blanket 1 around the Blanket 2 to create a fuller looker belly. Place Blanket 2 in the center of Blanket 1. Take the 4 outer corners of Blanket 1 (not the 4 that are already touching in the center) and fold them over the bulk of Blanket 2, creating a small cover around it. Secure the ends together with enough masking tape so your belly doesn’t unravel quickly. By combining both blankets, you’re adding dimension to your belly, without making it look too cartoonish. If you want to appear like you’re carrying twins or triplets, wrap a towel around both blankets to add extra volume. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach the blanket bump to your torso with elastic bandage wrap or bandeaus. Keep your fake belly in place by wrapping an elastic bandage wrap around your bump and torso, or layer a few tight bandeaus over your bump. To keep any parts of the blanket from falling down, secure the edges of your bump with heavy-duty duct tape, or try out some of these other ideas: Wrap the blanket inside an apron and place it in front of your belly. Then, tightly tie the strings of the apron behind your back to keep the blanket from falling down. Place the blanket inside a drawstring bag, then tie a scarf around the bag and your back to hold everything in place. Wear several tight tank tops over the bump to secure it to your body.

      "content": "Toss on a shirt and flaunt your fake bump. While you don’t have to worry about covering up any hard ridges like you would with a helmet, your blanket bump can still look lumpy if you choose tight fitting clothes. Wear a loose top or dress to conceal any imperfections on your bump, or get into character by buying actual maternity clothes."

      "content": "Choose a beach ball that suits your frame. Beach balls come in various sizes, so place a few different sizes underneath your shirt to see which one looks the most realistic on your body. In general, a standard 20 inch (50.8 cm) beach ball looks like a proportional pregnancy belly for the average sized person. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Inflate the beach ball about half-way.",
      "content": "Inflate the beach ball about half-way. To create a realistic pregnancy bump, blow air into the beach ball until it’s about half to three-quarters of the way inflated. You can add more air to make your belly bigger, depending on the pregnancy stage or look you want to achieve. [6] X Research source If you want a huge belly, go ahead and inflate the ball all the way. It might look cartoonishly large for a pregnancy, but it makes for a fun costume or prank!"

      "title": "Secure the beach ball to your torso with a tight bandeau or singlet.",
      "content": "Secure the beach ball to your torso with a tight bandeau or singlet. Since a beach ball is lightweight, you can get away with wearing a tight bandeau or singlet over the belly to keep it in place. Alternatively, use any of the previous methods to attach the belly to your body, such as elastic bandage wraps, duct tape, a scarf, or an apron. Before you attach your fake bump, make sure the nozzle of the beach ball is facing the ground. If it points up or out, it will be noticeable through your shirt, and it will irritate your skin if it points toward you."

      "content": "Cover your fake belly with loose clothing, then get into character. Have fun experimenting with different tops and dresses until you find the perfect pregnancy fit. To dress gracefully with your fake bump, go for wrap dresses, high-waisted tunics, or anything with an empire waist. [7] X Research source To convince everyone that you’re pregnant, observe how pregnant people walk, sit, and bend down. Breathe loudly after walking to look like you’re winded, or place your hands on your lower back to act like you have back pain. And don’t forget to rub your belly often!"
