      "title": "Wash your hair with shampoo to remove any product residue.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with shampoo to remove any product residue. Before you start, make sure your extensions are clean and free of product buildup. Gently wash them with shampoo and lukewarm water, then use a towel to dry off the excess water. Leave the hair slightly damp before you dye it. This will cause the hair cuticle to open, speeding up the dyeing process. [1] X Research source If the hair is brand new, you don’t need to wash it. Just spray it with some clean water to dampen the strands."

    {
      "title": "Measure out where you want the dye to start.",
      "content": "Measure out where you want the dye to start. If you want to leave a section of roots, measure out about 1.5 to 2.5 inches (3.8 to 6.4 cm) of hair at the top of the extensions. Use a ruler as a reference while dyeing to keep the line fairly consistent. For an ombre effect, where the hair color gradually lightens partway down the head, measure out where you want the hair to start getting lighter. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider the color of your weave before you choose a dye color.",
      "content": "Consider the color of your weave before you choose a dye color. Think about whether or not you’ll need to bleach hair first or multiple times in order to achieve the color you want. If you want to dye your weave a bright color like blue or pink, you’ll need to bleach it first. This will help the colors show up and have more brilliance. If you want to dye your hair darker, such as a jet black color, you won’t need a pre-bleaching step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put on latex gloves and open a window before you start dyeing.",
      "content": "Put on latex gloves and open a window before you start dyeing. The products used to dye and bleach hair can be extremely harsh, so make sure to take some safety precautions before you get started. Wearing a pair of latex or rubber gloves will protect your hands from being dyed or bleached. Opening up some windows in the room will help ventilate the strong fumes. [3] X Research source If the room you’re in doesn’t have proper ventilation, you should wear a mask over your mouth and nose to keep from inhaling the fumes. While dyeing, you should also wear some old clothes that you don’t care about, such as an old T-shirt and sweatpants, in case the products get on them."

    {
      "title": "Lay the extensions out on a sheet of hairdressing foil.",
      "content": "Lay the extensions out on a sheet of hairdressing foil. Spread the damp strands out slightly so none of the hair is bunched up. If your wefts come packed in spirals, loosen the spiral and spread the hair out to make it easier to dye. [4] X Research source Use a sheet that’s large enough to leave some extra foil on the sides, which you’ll use to wrap around the hair later. You can find hairdressing foil at a beauty supply store."

      "title": "Use bundles of virgin hair for the best dye results.",
      "content": "Use bundles of virgin hair for the best dye results. Synthetic hair doesn’t react to hair dye chemicals well, so make sure to invest in real hair that hasn’t been dyed or chemically treated. Quality human hair extensions generally come in a natural brown (1B) color, so dyeing it is the perfect way to customize your high-quality hair. [5] X Research source It can be more expensive, with prices ranging from $80-$500, but natural hair will look more natural, last much longer, and be easier to style."

      "content": "Cover the hair with plastic wrap, then let it develop. The sheet of plastic wrap layer will help keep the dye from drying out while it develops. Generally, dark dye takes about 25 minutes to develop, but make sure to follow the instructions on the back of the box. While the color processes, check on the hair every 5 minutes or so, until it reaches the shade you want. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Lightly towel-dry and lay the weave on an old towel to air-dry. The hair may still contain a bit of excess color, so make sure to use an old towel. Gently squeeze out the excess water, leaving the strands lightly damp. Lay the extensions out to fully air-dry. Once the hair is completely dry, it’s ready to be worn! [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix 2 scoops of bleach powder with 2 scoops of developer in a bowl.",
      "content": "Mix 2 scoops of bleach powder with 2 scoops of developer in a bowl. Use the plastic scoop that comes with the bleach powder to measure out each ingredient. Mix the bleach and cream developer in a plastic bowl with a brush applicator until they’re completely combined. The cream developer will activate the bleach. Adjust the amounts depending on how much hair you want to dye, keeping a 1:1 ratio of bleach powder and developer. Check the directions on the bleach powder for the required strength of cream developer. Generally, you’ll be using 20V or 30V strength, which will bleach your hair quickly without being too harsh. You can also use a 40V cream developer if you need to speed up the bleaching process. However, be careful with this strength—because 40V is much harsher, it could damage your hair cuticle."

Run your fingers through the hair, making sure to rub and rinse out any chemical residue. Towel-dry the hair lightly. At this point, the hair will probably look a little brassy. If that’s the look you’re going for, you’re all done with bleaching. Lay out the hair on an old towel and let it fully air-dry before wearing it."

You can bleach the hair again by repeating the same process. This time, let the hair soak in the bleach mixture for up to 40 minutes, checking the color every 5 minutes. [12] X Research source Once the hair reaches the color you like, unwrap the hair and wash out the bleach with some lukewarm water and shampoo.

Applying the color a little higher than before will create a more natural gradient, blending together the natural hair color and the bleached hair.

Brush your fingers through the hair to get rid of all the product residue. Towel-dry the hair with an old towel, then lay it out on a towel to air-dry completely before you wear and style it. Alternatively, you can use a sew-in lace front wig. It lasts for a few months. It is not advisable to keep it on longer than six to eight weeks, ten weeks maximum. Get your hair taken back down, comb through, condition properly, then put it back up."
