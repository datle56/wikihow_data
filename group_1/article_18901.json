Once you get to level 51, you'll get 150 gold for every level you beat. [2] X Research source To give you even more chances to earn gold, there are now 350 bonus levels instead of 150, and each level requires fewer XP.

      "content": "Do daily quests for XP. When you open the game after making your way through the tutorial, you will be presented with three daily quests. These quests will be refreshed every day up to the amount you completed the previous day. Although quests won't grant you gold upon completion, they'll give you lots of XP, which is what you'll need to advance to higher levels. Now that you'll get more gold after beating higher levels, you'll want all of the XP you can get! Focus on the quests that overlap first. You might receive a quest to play the Druid three times and a quest to win three matches. If you play the Druid while you are working on winning three matches, you'll get more done in fewer games. After you have completed the objectives of any quests that overlap, finish up any remaining Daily Quests. This method will ensure that you get as many quests done in the least amount of time."

      "content": "Get 7 wins in the arena. After 7 wins in the arena, you get 150 gold back. You will also have the ability to unlock new booster packs and legendary cards, and even gain cards from expansions you might not own. It is a great way to earn gold and expand your collection while you are at it. Use the gold you have earned to play in the arena again. Odds are that as you do this you will get better and better at winning in the arena. The better you are at winning, the higher your loot value will be at the end of an Arena session. This will ultimately mean more gold from your wins."

These achievements can give you anything from a special card back, mounts or in-game items for other Blizzard games, or Gold! The achievements can be associated with a recent expansion or with a real time event like the E3 conference, or even just a part of the core game. Some known achievements that earn gold are: Level every hero to level 10, collect all cards in the basic sets, collect every expert card, win 1000 games in Play mode, and defeat all the expert heroes in Practice mode."
