If you were born on the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland, before January 1, 2005, you are automatically a citizen of Ireland in most cases. All you have to do is contact the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to apply for a passport. [2] X Research source There are a few exceptions to this automatic citizenship. For example, if your parents were not citizens or legal residents of Ireland, or if your parents were foreign diplomats, you typically wouldn't be eligible for automatic citizenship. To apply for a passport, go to https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/ and click on \"Apply now.\" If you were born on the island of Ireland on or after January 1, 2005, you can also claim automatic citizenship if one of your parents is an Irish citizen, a British citizen entitled to live in Northern Ireland or elsewhere on the island without restriction, or is a legal resident who was legally present on the island of Ireland for 3 out of the 4 years before you were born."
