      "content": "Decide where you want to use the pumice stone. Though it is possible to use pumice anywhere on your body, that doesn't mean you should . Areas with delicate skin and coarse hair (like your bikini area or face) should be avoided if possible. Removing the coarse hair would require too much pressure and damage your skin. [2] X Research source Maybe you'd get the hair off your upper lip with time, but you'd have a very red, irritated, possibly cut upper lip instead. Not a great trade-off. The pumice method works best on legs, arms, scalps (if you're bald and looking to get that shine), and shoulders. The pumice method is a good way to perform upkeep between waxing sessions. If you do plan to use the pumice on your face or bikini area, be extremely gentle . Consider other methods first, like waxing, tweezing, hair removal creams, or shaving. Do not use the pumice on skin that is already irritated, red, sunburned, broken, or peeling. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use soap or shower gel to clean the area you plan to use the pumice stone. Any time you use an abrasive on your skin (pumice, hair removal mitts, sandpaper), you risk scratching the skin, which makes you susceptible to infection. Cleaning the skin beforehand will minimize the chance of contaminating a scratch with bacteria."

      "content": "Gently rub the pumice stone against your skin using small, circular motions. Alternate between clockwise and counter-clockwise. Your strokes should be brisk, but you should apply very little pressure to the skin. If your skin begins to feel irritated, or the process is painful in any way, stop immediately. Do not use an up-and-down or sawing motion, as this is more likely to cut your skin. Start at the edge of the area where you are removing hair. If you are using it on your arm, begin at your wrist. That way, if you stop partway through, you won't have random patches of missing hair."

The pumice will exfoliate your skin, so you shouldn't have to worry about ingrown hairs. Your skin should also be very soft, since the stone removed the top layer of dead skin. Clean the pumice after each use with soap and a brush. Let it dry before storing the stone to keep bacteria from growing."

      "content": "Be patient. You may not see results immediately. Removing hair by this method is gradual, and it may be days or weeks before you see a difference, depending on your skin and the type of hair you are removing. Wait 1-3 days before using the pumice stone again. Using this method too often can cause severe irritation or over-exfoliate your skin."
