      "content": "Sketch the torso and the head. Start by drawing a big circle . Then add two connected ovals on top of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Now draw four ovals at the sides of the big circle.",
      "content": "Now draw four ovals at the sides of the big circle. These are the arms and legs. Since Patrick is a starfish, each one should be slightly tapered at the end, resembling the shape of a star (although the limbs will all still have curved ends)."
    },
    {
      "title": "For the mouth, draw a half-bow shape.",
      "content": "For the mouth, draw a half-bow shape. For the pants, sketch two curved lines for the top and two curved lines on each foot for the end of the shorts. His eyebrows are thin zigzag lines. Patrick’s emotions are conveyed mostly by his mouth and eyebrows, so edit those in accordance with the way you want him to look."
    },
    {
      "title": "For the eyes, draw two ovals next to one another above the mouth.",
      "content": "For the eyes, draw two ovals next to one another above the mouth. Then add two dots for the iris and two curved lines for the eyelids. For a tired Patrick, have his eyelids fall down to cover part of his eye. If you want him to look surprised or in awe, widen his pupils (and make his mouth into more of an O shape)."

      "title": "Outline the drawing.",
      "content": "Outline the drawing. Erase the sketch lines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add details.",
      "content": "Add details. Include his belly button and the flowers on the shorts. Remember, Patrick has no nose--in fact, his lack of the feature is one of his defining characteristics in SpongeBob SquarePants . So if your drawing doesn’t look quite right, check and make sure you didn’t accidentally give him one."

      "title": "Color in Patrick.",
      "content": "Color in Patrick. On the show his shorts are green with purple flowers, and he himself is a lively pink, but the colors in your drawing are your decision."
