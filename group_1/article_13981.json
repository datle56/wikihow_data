Position your torso directly over the cushions, then slide down into the “splits.” Since you have the cushions underneath you, you won’t get into a full split position—instead, you’ll feel the stretch in your hamstring as you hold the splits.

Once you feel comfortable with a couple cushions beneath you, take 2 or 3 away and hold the splits over 1 cushion for 30 seconds at a time. This will give you a deeper stretch and train your body to get into the splits position. [10] X Research source As you stretch, you’ll notice yourself getting lower to the ground each time.

[11] X Expert Source Adam Shuty Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 26 August 2020. Practice doing a right split, a left split, and a center split , and hold it for 1 to 2 minutes at a time. Practice doing each type of splits slowly, gently easing your legs as far down as possible. When you've reached your limit, try to hold that position for 30 seconds. Then give yourself a break before trying again. Attempt to push yourself a little further down each time. You can also wear socks while you stretch (rather than stretching barefoot or in shoes) to help your feet to slide easier, especially on wooden or linoleum covered floors."

      "content": "Stop stretching if you feel pain. When practicing for the splits, you should feel a good, intense stretch in your leg muscles, but you should never feel any pain. If that happens, slowly back out of the stretch and give your muscles a rest before trying again. [13] X Research source Feeling pain can indicate that you are pulling or straining your muscles. Getting a pulled or strained muscle means they need rest, which can set you back in your journey to getting the splits."
