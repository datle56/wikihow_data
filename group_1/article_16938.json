      "content": "Water main shut-off valves come in a few styles. In older homes, the valve will usually be a round, spigot-style valve. You’ll see this style of valve on some newer homes too, but it’s pretty rare. Newer homes typically use a lever-style valve that won’t turn more than 90 degrees. For round valves, turn the valve all the way clockwise to shut your water off, and all the way counterclockwise to open your water supply. With lever valves, the water is off when it’s perpendicular to the pipe. Turn the lever so that it’s parallel to the pipe to turn the water back on."

      "content": "Search for a pipe coming in from the front of your home. Stroll down to the basement and orient yourself so that you’re facing whichever interior wall is closest to the street. Look at the bottom 1/3 of the wall for a pipe that feeds into your home. If it’s not there, look at the other adjacent walls. The valve will almost certainly be on top of this water supply pipe near the wall. If your home hasn’t been worked on in a long time, this pipe is very likely going to look older than a lot of the piping in your basement. This pipe will probably be copper or cast iron. In a newer home (or a home that has been recently renovated), this pipe may be rigid plastic or PVC."

      "content": "If the pipe isn’t in the front of your home, follow the heater’s pipes. If you don’t see a pipe coming into your home, work in reverse. Look at your water heater and follow each individual pipe. If you find a pipe that feeds into the wall, it’s near the floor, and there is a valve on top of the pipe, you’ve found the main shut-off valve. [1] X Research source If you live in a slab home with no basement, the shut-off valve should be in the closet next to your heater."

      "title": "In some older homes, the valve sits right next to your water meter.",
      "content": "In some older homes, the valve sits right next to your water meter. If your home is super old and the pipe layout feeds into the ceiling or you can’t follow what’s going on, look for your water meter instead. The meter looks like a round, metal container in the middle of a pipe with a dial on top. If there is a valve right before or after the meter, that’s your shut-off valve. The meter is normally in your basement, but it may be outdoors if you live in a warmer climate. When your city started installing water meters, they would have put it right next to the shut-off valve on the supply pipe."

      "title": "In warmer climates, the shut-off valve is often outside.",
      "content": "In warmer climates, the shut-off valve is often outside. If the temperature never drops below freezing where you live, your building’s shut-off valve may be outdoors. Take a walk around the exterior of your building and look for a pipe that feeds into the ground. It will almost certainly be near your water meter. If you find a pipe with a valve on top, that’s your shut-off valve. Water meters typically look like round metal containers with a little dial on top."

      "title": "In some cities, the valve is buried outdoors.",
      "content": "In some cities, the valve is buried outdoors. Are you totally stumped here? If you can’t find a shut-off valve anywhere, walk out to your front yard or sidewalk. Look on the ground for a panel that’s flush with the ground. You may need a wrench or meter key to open this panel, but your shut-off valve is almost certainly inside this compartment. In extremely rare cases, the valve will be buried underground. Unfortunately, you’ll need to contact your city or the water department to find out where your valve is located."

      "title": "If you can’t find the valve, you may not have one!",
      "content": "If you can’t find the valve, you may not have one! Depending on how old your home is or where you live, there may not be a shut-off valve you have access to. In this case, contact your water department and ask them to shut your water off. If it’s an emergency, explain what’s going on and ask them to shut the water off ASAP."
