Unfortunately, Follow Cop requires your Instagram login information in order to determine whether or not you're losing followers. Follow Cop also doesn't let you see which followers you've lost in the past; it only tracks lost followers starting from the time that you log into Follow Cop. While Follow Cop doesn't use your Instagram data to post or edit your profile, it will automatically cause your profile to follow the Follow Cop Instagram page. If you want to use this method on a computer, you can download and install the BlueStacks Android emulator in order to run the app on a computer."
