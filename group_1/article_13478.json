Bend your legs and draw up your knees until they’re directly over your pelvis. Bend your knees at a 90-degree angle so that your feet are sticking straight out. [1] X Research source This style of elbow-to-knee crunches are great to use if you’re a beginner to fitness and exercising. They’ll build up your abdominal muscles but aren’t particularly challenging to learn."

Keep your abs activated the whole time while you're doing the exercise. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 22 January 2021. To do a crunch, keep your elbows in place and lift your knees upward until your elbows and knees touch. You should feel a slight burn in your lower abs as you touch your elbows and knees together. [4] X Research source Make sure that you’re engaging your stomach muscles and not just pulling on your head with your hands. You can damage your neck if you pull your head up rather than using your abdominal muscles."

Complete 9 more crunches in a row to do a set of 10. If you’re just starting out and don’t have very strong abdominal muscles, 1 full set might be as much as you can do. As you gain muscle, try completing 2, 3, or even 4 sets. [6] X Research source Take a 60-second break between each set of crunches to allow blood and oxygen to return to your abs."
