      "content": "Demonstrate automatic termination of guardianship. One of the simplest ways to terminate a guardianship of a child is to show that they meet one of the requirements for automatic termination of guardianship. While each state has its own laws regarding termination of guardianship, generally guardianship will terminate automatically for one of the following reasons: Death of the ward. While the guardian may be legally required to provide a final accounting of the ward’s finances at a court hearing, the guardian’s obligations terminate with the death of the ward (the child for whom the guardian was responsible). The ward turns 18. Once a ward turns 18 and is considered an adult, a guardianship will be terminated. The ward is adopted, marries or enters the military service. In most states, any one of these circumstances is grounds for termination of the guardianship. The court emancipates the ward. If the child applies for emancipation, which means he or she petitions the court to be ruled an adult, and the court grants the petition, a guardianship will be terminated."

In order to show the court that the resignation is in the best interest of the child, a guardian may argue the following: One or both of the parents are able to resume their parental responsibilities. The guardian can no longer serve because of age, illness or infirmity. There was an increase in the burden of the guardianship that should have been discussed or planned for during the original appointment. The guardian and the minor disagree with respect to the care of the minor and the conflict is detrimental to the minor. The resignation will permit financial gain for the minor. The resignation will not disadvantage the minor. [2] X Research source"
