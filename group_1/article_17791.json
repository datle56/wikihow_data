Rinse your hair of the shampoo and follow it with a deep conditioner, allowing this to remain in your hair for the time recommended on the label, and then rinse once more."

      "title": "Divide your hair into layers.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into layers. For short hair, you might only have one or two layers, depending on your hair thickness. Layering your hair is important because it creates even sections of hair, which will be easier for you to manage while ironing. This can also prevent you from accidentally going over a section you've already ironed, which can cause heat damage. [11] X Research source Collect the hair you are sectioning off for later atop your head and clip it out of the way while you work on lower layers."

      "content": "Heat your iron. There should be a few different settings available on your iron. While there is no hard-and-fast rule for temperature, as each persons' hair will respond to the heat of your flat iron differently, the following generally applies: 250–300° for fine or damaged hair. 300–350° for medium/average hair. 350–400° for thick or coarse hair.

Most heat protectants should be applied to wet hair that has already been deep conditioned, so the a good time to administer this product is after washing your hair."

Work your way from the root to the tip of your hair. [15] X Research source Depending on the curliness or waviness of your hair, you may have to run your hair through the iron a few times. If your hair is long enough, consider running a comb through your hair and following it with your straightener. [16] X Research source"

Take your bottom layer in segments and work these from the root of the hair to its end, slowly sliding your flat iron down each length of hair. Repeat this process a few times until you achieve the desired result. [17] X Research source Exercise caution when ironing close to your scalp or ears. The heated ends of your flat iron will burn you if you are not careful."

      "content": "Straighten the sides of your head. You'll likely need to clip the top layers of the hair on the sides of your head out of the way, if you haven't already done so. Start with the bottom layer and in smooth motions, draw your iron steadily through segments of your bottom layer until you are satisfied. Gather finished hair together out of the way and then release the next layer of hair from the unfinished top layer that you clipped aside earlier. Ironing at an angle in front of a mirror can give you a better view of the hair you are working on, allowing you to be more precise when straightening."

Now you can stand at an angle to a mirror and have a decent view of the hair you are straightening."
