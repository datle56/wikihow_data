      "title": "Sharp teeth-like soles.",
      "content": "Sharp teeth-like soles. Authentic Yeezy slides have sharp teeth-like soles, similar to a serrated knife. Most fakes cannot replicate this distinct feature, so the “teeth” are often less pronounced and even shorter in some cases. The teeth on authentic pairs should be evenly spaced and close together. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wide, rounded toe box.",
      "content": "Wide, rounded toe box. This feature is more challenging to analyze, but genuine Yeezy slides have a wide, rounded opening near the toe box. In fakes, this opening is taller and/or narrow. Fake Yeezys often have unfinished, string-like pieces protruding from the edge of the toe box since counterfeit manufacturers tend to overlook details. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Smooth texture and flawless finish.",
      "content": "Smooth texture and flawless finish. Due to low-quality materials, fake Yeezys are easily prone to damage – including scratches and creases. Authentic slides shouldn’t have any defects, especially on the upper and exterior parts of the shoe. [3] X Research source Make sure your slides exhibit a smooth texture and flawless finish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rigid with little flexibility.",
      "content": "Rigid with little flexibility. If you’re able to easily twist and fold your slides, you most likely have fake Yeezys. Fakes are made from cheaper materials that are not as sturdy as their authentic counterparts. Genuine Yeezy slides are made out of EVA foam that is fairly rigid in structure, with little flexibility. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Deeply engraved Adidas logo.",
      "content": "Deeply engraved Adidas logo. On a genuine Yeezy slide, the footbed includes an Adidas logo of three stripes shaped in a triangle. This logo is engraved fairly deep, while fake slides have a shallow logo, with less distinction. [5] X Research source If the iconic three-stripes logo is absent on your slides, it’s definitely a sign of a fake pair."
    },
    {
      "title": "3 engraved logos inside the shoe strap.",
      "content": "3 engraved logos inside the shoe strap. The interior part of the shoe strap should contain “YEEZY”, “MADE IN CHINA”, and a numeric size engraving. For all three components, the lettering should be clearly engraved, with a font that appears 3-D in nature. [6] X Research source Most fakes either exclude the “YEEZY” or “MADE IN CHINA” engraving."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bold, symmetrical font on the size tag.",
      "content": "Bold, symmetrical font on the size tag. In genuine Yeezy slides, the font on the interior size tag should be quite bold and symmetrical. Fakes often use a font that is more narrow and pale, and some of the letters are not aligned (i.e. the “C” in “CHINA” is placed slightly lower). [7] X Research source This sticker should be glued on the underside of the slide strap."

      "title": "Enter the SKU number on a search engine.",
      "content": "Enter the SKU number on a search engine. The stock-keeping unit (SKU) is an alphanumeric code that merchants assign to every unique product. [8] X Research source It’s usually 8-10 characters long and located above the product’s barcode. To verify product authenticity, type the SKU number on a platform such as Barcode Lookup . The model, size, and colorway of the box barcode should match your Yeezy slides. If one of the factors isn’t identical, your slides are likely fakes. Keep in mind that your box could be authentic, but the slides inside could be fake."

    {
      "title": "Inspect the quality of the box.",
      "content": "Inspect the quality of the box. Your slides should arrive in a smooth box with little to no damage. Due to low-quality cardboard, most fake Yeezy boxes are unable to withstand the shipping and handling process. Fake boxes are typically thinner and grainier in texture. [9] X Research source Your slides should arrive wrapped in tissue paper if they are brand new."

    {
      "title": "Analyze the font on the size label.",
      "content": "Analyze the font on the size label. Compare your Yeezy box with an authentic photo online. Fake Yeezy boxes usually exhibit product labels with fuzzy or inconsistent text. On authentic boxes, each character in the product label is fully printed, and the text itself is a dark, saturated ink. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine the box with a UV light.",
      "content": "Examine the box with a UV light. In a dark room, carefully shine an ultraviolet light over the slides and their packaging. Many counterfeit manufacturers add a stamp to their boxes, which cannot be observed with the naked eye. UV light can show hidden details such as marks and excess liquid/glue stains, which should not appear on authentic pairs. [11] X Research source"
