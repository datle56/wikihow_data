As long as you know how to find the area of a regular rectangle , which is simply the length times the height, you can find each side and add them together. However, there is also a simplified formula that will do this for you if you know the measurements of the box: [1] X Research source S u r f a c e A r e a = 2 l w + 2 l h + 2 w h {\\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2lw+2lh+2wh} l is the length of the box, or the longest side. h is the height of the box. w is the width of the box."

Find the surface area of both, then add them together to get the total surface area. [7] X Research source For example, if you have a U shaped box: Say the bottom has a surface area of 12 units squared. Say both sides have a surface area of 15 units squared. The total area would be 42 units squared , since 12 + 15 + 15 = 42 {\\displaystyle 12+15+15=42} ."
