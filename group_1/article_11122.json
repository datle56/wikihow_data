If you don’t want to wash your hair, use a spray bottle with water to get your locks fairly damp before you start the curling process. [1] X Research source If your hair doesn’t hold curls well, you may want to spray a texturizing spray on your wet hair before moving on. That added texture in your hair can help it curl more easily."

      "content": "Braid your hair or create buns. Braids and buns are quick, easy hairstyles, but the way that they twist your hair also means that they can add curls and waves to your locks. For looser waves, pull your hair back into a single braid or tie it up in a single bun. However, if you want tighter, more defined curls, divide your hair into sections and create several braids or buns all over your head. [2] X Research source . You can curl your hair with traditional, French, or fishtail braids. Use whatever style is your favorite or the easiest for you to do. If you want the simplest style to create curls, divide your hair into two sections on either side of your head. Create one bun on each side and secure them in place with elastics for a Princess Leia-inspired look. You’ll get loose, natural curls all over your hair without much effort. If you want an even easier way to create some curls or waves in your hair, gather it up as you would for a ponytail, twist it tightly, and use a shark clip to pin it to the back of your head. You’ll get looser, less defined curls, but your hair will still have some texture when it dries."
