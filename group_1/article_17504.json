      "content": "Shampoo your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove minor staining. If the purple residue in your hair is pretty light, a clarifying shampoo may do the trick! Apply the clarifying shampoo to your hair just like regular shampoo, lather it up for a few seconds with your fingertips, and rinse it out. [1] X Expert Source Steven Waldman Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. Repeat this 2-3 times to make sure you get rid of the tint. [2] X Research source Clarifying shampoo penetrates deeply to remove oil, residue, and buildup. It's a lot stronger than a regular shampoo, which is why it’s so effective. Since clarifying shampoo strips everything out of your hair, it can make your hair dry. Follow it up with a deeply hydrating conditioner or do a deep-conditioning treatment to replace the lost moisture."

      "content": "Use dish soap and lemon juice if clarifying shampoo doesn’t work. Wet your hair and apply 2-3 pumps of Dawn dish soap to your scalp. Massage it in like shampoo, working from the roots to the ends, and rinse it out. [3] X Expert Source Steven Waldman Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. Then, squeeze the juice from half a lemon onto your scalp, squeeze the other half on the lengths of your hair, and gently massage it in with your fingers. Let the juice sit for 1 minute and then rinse your hair thoroughly with warm water. Stylists recommend Dawn because it’s known to be gentle. This process is known as chelating and it strips everything out of your hair—products, buildup, toner, and so on. It’s even stronger than clarifying shampoo, so it’s important to follow with a hydrating hair mask to replenish the moisture. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply a commercial color remover to get rid of heavy purple staining.",
      "content": "Apply a commercial color remover to get rid of heavy purple staining. If clarifying shampoo and chelating don’t work, a commercial color remover product is the way to go. Buy a color remover kit and apply it to your hair according to the package’s instructions. Stop applying the mixture once your hair is saturated from root to tip. Keep in mind that color remover is pretty strong and does have mild bleaching agents in it, so it can be somewhat damaging to hair. [5] X Research source Application is similar to boxed hair dye—mix the 2 chemical agents together, saturate your hair with the mixture, let it process for a specific amount of time, and rinse it out thoroughly. [6] X Research source If you have short hair, you probably won't need to apply all of the product in the kit. If you have really long hair, you may need 2 kits to saturate your hair. You can buy a color remover kit at drug stores and beauty supply stores. If your hair is severely over-toned, you may want to skip clarifying shampoo and chelating and start with the color remover."

      "content": "Perform a bleach wash to correct extreme cases of over-toning. Mix 10 volume developer with bleach powder in a large bowl. Pour some regular shampoo into your palm and add an equal amount of the bleach mixture to the shampoo. Massage the mixture into your hair and let it sit for 1-2 minutes before rinsing it out really thoroughly [7] X Research source Bleach washes aren't precise, so don't worry about exact measurements. The more bleach mixture you mix into your shampoo, the stronger it will be. [8] X Research source Bleach washing is the most extreme and damaging technique, so only resort to it in severe cases. On the upside, a bleach wash will definitely get that purple tint out of your hair! Don’t leave the mixture on your hair for more than a couple of minutes since it’s really strong."

      "content": "Avoid letting purple toners sit on your hair too long. Purple shampoos and conditioners come in a range of strengths, so be sure to read and follow the product instructions exactly. It can be tempting to dump a ton of purple shampoo and conditioner on your hair and let it sit for a while, but applying too much and letting it sit too long are the most common causes of over-toning. Always give your hair a good rinse after using purple shampoo and conditioner. Even if you follow the instructions exactly when it comes to application and timing, not rinsing thoroughly is another quick path to lilac-tinted hair. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit how often you use purple shampoo/conditioner. Be sure to read the product instructions about frequency. In most cases, toning shampoos/conditioners should not replace your normal shampoo/conditioners because they’re too strong. Most toner products suggest application every other wash, once a week, or once every few weeks, depending on the strength of the product."

If you just had your blonde hair dyed and toned, you don’t need to start using purple shampoo/conditioner right away. Your original toner will naturally start to fade after 2-3 weeks. Once you see the yellow tones creeping into your hair, it’s time to start using your purple shampoo and conditioner. [10] X Research source If you aren’t sure when to start using purple shampoo, mixing a little bit in with your regular shampoo is a good way to avoid overuse."

If you try to cancel out orange or red tones with purple shampoo, you may end up making the warm orange tones even warmer. [11] X Research source If you have orange undertones in your hair, use blue shampoo/conditioner to color correct. Red undertones can be corrected with a green shampoo/conditioner. If you have yellow and orange tones in your hair, look for a purple shampoo that has blue pigment added to it. [12] X Research source"
