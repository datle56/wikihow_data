      "content": "Find lists of potential anime. It can be daunting to sort through thousands of anime that you are considering. To combat this, the use of lists of anime helps narrow down potential choices. For reference, MyAnimeList.net is a great resource to find lists by genre, age group, and other categories. Visit your local library and view their anime/manga sections. Many libraries have some Anime DVDs/Blu-rays, and a selection of manga.

In a practical setting, your peers are ones who know you the best, and know what you would like. Often times, suggestions can be beneficial when seeing how well you will enjoy an anime. Don't skip out entirely on a show just because someone said so; you never know if you'll like it unless you watch it! Don't be scared to watch anime that is not \"hot\" or \"popular\" or \"new\". Likewise, do not be ashamed of picking popular anime that \"everyone has seen\". As long as you are comfortable with what you are watching and enjoying it, don't worry about what is popular and not. Often times people watched anime in their youth and never realized it. If you remember watching a specific anime in the past and enjoyed it, maybe start off by watching that anime again."

      "content": "Take notes. If a friend mentions an anime to you that you think you would enjoy, make sure to write it down or make note of it. Often times the suggestions you hear can easily be forgotten, so keeping it written down will help you remember the anime and let you research it further. After you have started watching anime, it may be beneficial to write down what you liked and disliked. Giving anime a score after you watched will help define what genres you enjoy, and will ultimately help you enjoy anime more. You can do this using MyAnimeList.net"

      "content": "Learn where Anime comes from. Anime refers to animated series and features from Japan. It's an incredibly diverse form of art, with unique stories and styles. Anime is popular in Japan and worldwide, creating animation like Pok√©mon, Princess Mononoke, Sailor Moon, and Fullmetal Alchemist. Anime can be serious and adult, or cartoonish and childlike. There's something for everyone. Many great Anime series started out as Manga, which are generally the 'Japanese version' of comic books. Sometimes manga are better, typically faster to get through."

Within Anime, there are fantasy stories, love stories, space-gangster operas, and any number of different types of stories that you can get involved with. So, one of the most important questions you have to ask yourself is, \"What do I like?\" Common Anime subgenres include: kodomo (for children), usually light-hearted comedy action, or sometimes \"battle shounen\" slice of life mahou shoujo (magical girl) harem sports martial arts literary medieval"

      "content": "Start with a classic feature. Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli are sort of like the Disney Studios or the Steven Spielberg of anime. They're very well-known. Anything from either one of these names is bound to be pretty spectacular. More often than not, Studio Ghibli comes up with deep, profound works for older audiences, but still make stories children love. It's a good place to start, if you're looking to dip a toe in. Some of the classics of the Anime canon include: Princess Mononoke Graves of the Fireflies The Girl Who Leapt Through Time My Neighbour Totoro Whisper of the Heart Paprika"

      "content": "Embrace the subtitles. Anime comes in two varieties, subbed and dubbed. Most people find that the original Japanese voice actors are better to listen to than the dubbed Anime voices, which can sound cartoonish and silly. If you don't mind doing a little reading, try to go for the subtitled option. There's good and bad on both sides. It comes down to personal preference, not what others say after all. If you don't mind that the mouths and the sounds don't match up, go for the dubbed anime."

      "title": "Get past the first couple of episodes.",
      "content": "Get past the first couple of episodes. Anime is long-form story telling. That means you need to have some patience and wait a while before you make up your mind about a show. If you're trying out a new series, watch a couple of episodes at least before you pass judgment. The first episode for some series can be deceiving. The first episode of Elfen Lied has a naked woman and tons of gore but as it progresses there's far more to the story than just that. Don't worry: the characters eventually find their clothes. On the other hand, a series can deceive you by drawing you in, only to end up being dull. Sometimes, really popular series start to suffer later in the series."

      "title": "Appreciate the artwork and the style.",
      "content": "Appreciate the artwork and the style. Anime is just as diverse as any other medium. Some of it looks hyper-realistic, while other styles are cartoonish and over-the-top, featuring talking Pandas and people with giant eyeballs. That's part of the fun. Most anime features very angular people, and a hand-drawn approach, with a very light touch. Others feature eye-popping color. While a particular anime might be your genre, the art style might turn you off. 80s Anime looks different from newer Anime thanks to unique and changing styles."

      "title": "Get ready for the slowed down pace.",
      "content": "Get ready for the slowed down pace. Some anime series seem to drag on for quite some time, before suddenly getting violent or fast-paced. Anime is like that. A single fight in Dragon Ball Z can take about half a season, and feature a whole lot of build up before anything actually happens. It's a different sort of drama, and one that can seem strange to a Western audience. But that's part of the fun, and it's part of what people like about it. Don't expect to watch a version of what you're used to, but with different art."

      "content": "Decide what service you will use. There is an abundant amount of services to view anime on. There are anime only services such as Crunchyroll and Funimation. These services have a monthly subscription with a free trial period to determine if you like the service or not. Many other popular services such as Netflix and Hulu carry anime. However, as they are not solely an anime subscription service, the episodes are not updated as frequent, they tend to be missing seasons, and their libraries of anime are smaller compared to anime based subscriptions. Whichever service you decide to pick, make sure you are comfortable with the costs."

      "content": "Determine between sub or dub. Nowadays in the anime community, there is a huge argument about whether sub or dub anime is better. Sub anime is subtitled anime, in the native Japanese language. Dub anime is anime dubbed into another language, such as English, French, German, etc.. Both have their merits, so try both sub and dub and make your decision on which voice actors you prefer, or if reading subtitles is too much of a hassle. No matter which you decide, there is no right answer. Just make sure you are comfortable and enjoy anime the way you wish to watch it."

They will be able to give you pointers and tips to watching anime, as well as filling in gaps where you might have trouble. If you do not have a friend that watches anime, no worries! Many schools have anime clubs, where they are welcoming to all levels of anime watchers, and would love to include you."

If you are watching an action anime, consider watching with your friends in a large setting so you can all enjoy the action together. If you are watching a sad anime, consider watching it alone on a rainy day to match the mood. Having the appropriate setting will allow you to enjoy anime to the fullest, and the way that it was meant to be."

      "content": "Do your own research. Just because your best friend swears by Fullmetal Alchemist doesn't mean it's the best. Not everyone likes fighting, so don't watch Naruto if you're not a fan. Same goes for anything. Price doesn't equal quality. Great anime and manga can sometimes be found in bargain bins because they're not well known. If Anime is pricey, that could mean it's new or popular."

It can seem overwhelming to the beginner, but once you've got a knowledgeable guide, it can be a whole lot easier. Share what you learn, as well. Lend out DVD's to friends, invite people over for Anime night. The point should be to have fun, so share what you've grown to love."

      "content": "Explore your online options. There are lots of websites to stream anime on. This is especially true when one doesn't have an Anime channel in their area, or a channel that plays more than just Pok√©mon. Netflix and Google Play and other streaming services regularly have a wide variety of anime that you can watch for a monthly fee, although Netflix often doesn't put the entire anime on their service. Regardless, it's a good option if you're curious, but don't want to invest in buying a series outright. If after the first 3 episodes, a show seems like something you'd enjoy, go and buy the series, or explore other options for watching it via a streaming service."

      "content": "Branch out and explore different styles. If you like an art style, check out an anime similar, by finding something that looks like it appeals to you. Or look at what else that particular director or artist has been involved with. You'll find, for example, that The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is similar to Angel Beats. If you know you like Witch Hunter Robin, then try Ghost in the Shell since they're the same genre."
