Examine the actual beliefs behind your assumptions. If someone is crying at work and your unconscious tells you they’re weak, ask if they’re okay . Maybe they’re in a difficult situation and are showing incredible strength just coming into the office! Consider how you react to people from different backgrounds and if you hold any stereotypes about certain racial or social groups. Let others challenge your beliefs and give you feedback. Accept this constructive criticism with an open mind. Keep a list of unconscious biases to return to and examine."

To ease any guilt, they may try to find research or experts that negate the result of greenhouse gases on global warming. [15] X Research source"
