You can buy between 20 and 100 lbs of watermelon and then try to eat it throughout the day, while regularly emptying your bladder. If you have chronic kidney problems you should avoid this method due to the high levels of potassium in watermelon. You should not have more than a cup of watermelon a day if you have chronic kidney disease. [10] X Research source Watermelons are around 92% water, so this fast is similar to just drinking a lot of water. Too much watermelon can cause health problems, so talk to your doctor first.

Look on food labels for phrases like “sodium free,” “salt free,” “no salt added,” or “lightly salted.” Use herbs for flavour, rather than salt. Be sure to thoroughly rinse all canned beans, meats, vegetables and fish before you eat them."
