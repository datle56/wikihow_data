      "content": "The formula to find the spring constant is k = F x {\\displaystyle k={\\frac {F}{x}}} . When you push or pull a spring, it bounces back to its original rest position or equilibrium. The spring constant, measured in N / m {\\displaystyle N/m} (Newton/meters or Newtons per meter), tells you the proportional force exerted by the spring that causes it to bounce back. These variables have a linear relationship: [1] X Research source k {\\displaystyle k} : Spring constant F {\\displaystyle F} : Force (the force applied to the spring) x {\\displaystyle x} : Distance the spring is compressed or stretched away from its equilibrium or rest position"

      "content": "Hooke's law states that when a force compresses or stretches a spring, it will bounce back to its rest position with an equal and opposite force. That bounce-back or restoring force is known as the spring constant because it's always the same for a given spring. You can express this law mathematically with the equation F = − k x {\\displaystyle F=-kx} . The negative symbol indicates that the force of the spring constant is in the opposite direction of the force applied to the spring. It does not indicate that the value is negative. Hooke's law is actually pretty limited. It only applies to perfectly elastic materials within their elastic limit—stretch something too far and it'll break or stay stretched out. Hooke's law is based on Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The spring constant is inversely related to the spring's equilibrium length.",
      "content": "The spring constant is inversely related to the spring's equilibrium length. This means that the longer your spring is, the less force it will need to bounce back to its rest position or equilibrium. A shorter spring, on the other hand, requires more force to bounce back. This makes sense if you think of springs you've encountered—the spring constant measures the stiffness of a spring, and short springs tend to be stiffer than long springs. [3] X Research source For example, if you cut a spring in half, its spring constant will double. If you doubled the length of the spring, on the other hand, its spring constant would be half what it was. This also means that when you apply the same force to a longer spring as a shorter spring, the longer spring will stretch further than the shorter spring. [4] X Research source"

You aren't given the distance the spring is stretched when the first 0.1 N {\\displaystyle 0.1N} is added to it, but that doesn't matter because the spring constant is always the same. Plug the values for the second weight into the formula to find the spring constant: [7] X Research source The formula to find the spring constant is k = F x {\\displaystyle k={\\frac {F}{x}}} . Here, the force is 0.1 N {\\displaystyle 0.1N} and the distance the spring stretches when that force is added is 0.035 m {\\displaystyle 0.035m} , so your equation is k = 0.1 0.035 {\\displaystyle k={\\frac {0.1}{0.035}}} .
