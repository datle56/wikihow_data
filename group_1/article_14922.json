On average, healthcare professionals recommend that women drink 11.5 cups (2.7 L or 92 oz) of water per day, and men drink 15.5 cups (3.7 L or 124 oz). [1] X Research source While there’s nothing officially wrong with drinking 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in 1 day, your body probably doesn’t need that much to stay hydrated. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some medical professionals even suggest aiming for 64 oz (1.9 L) of water a day, which is far less than the 1 gallon (3.8 L) threshold. Everyone’s hydration needs are a little bit different—it depends on multiple factors, like your weight, location, and metabolism. For instance, someone who goes for an hour-long run would likely need more water than someone who doesn’t exercise.

Let’s say you drink an 8 oz (0.2 L) glass of water when you wake up, brush your teeth, go the bathroom, eat lunch, stretch your legs, go to the bathroom again, eat dinner, and brush your teeth again. By drinking water with each of these simple tasks, you’ve already reached 50% of your 1 gallon (3.8 L) goal! According to some research, drinking water before meals helps you to eat less, which can potentially help with weight loss.
