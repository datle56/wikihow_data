      "title": "Reflect on your reasons for drinking.",
      "content": "Reflect on your reasons for drinking. You might be thinking, \"I don't need a reason to get drunk! Now, where's my bottle opener?\" But drunkenness is best experienced on a rare basis and mainly for celebratory reasons. Perhaps you just got accepted into your top-choice grad program or earned a great promotion at work. If you have worked hard for something, then go ahead and celebrate (just don't make it a nightly or even weekly habit). Don't drink to drown your sorrows. If you have just gotten dumped or are going through a major loss in life, alcohol will only make things worse as it is a depressant."

      "content": "Dress for the occasion. If you are planning to get roaring drunk, you should wear comfortable clothes that will be easy to navigate. If you are very drunk, you might find it hard to walk, so don't make this even harder with tall heels. Wear clothes that will be easy to navigate when you go to the bathroom (which alcohol will make you frequently do). Consider donning an easy, one piece dress or a comfortable pair of jeans and a cute top. This is not the time to try out that complicated, one piece jumper. Dark clothes will also be preferable because they won't show stains from spills as easily."

      "content": "Get your team ready. Do not get drunk at home alone in the dark. That's just sad. And research has shown that people who drink in groups generally make less risky decisions than when they drink individually. [1] X Research source You should have supportive friends with you who are up for having a good time. Tell them ahead of time you plan to drink a little more than normal. Don't bring that friend who always starts a fight when you're drinking or the one who talks at 10 decibels louder than normal. Most importantly, don't be that person yourself. If you are drinking in public, make sure you have a safe way of getting home. One of your friends might be a designated driver, or you should plan to get a taxi/Uber ride home."

      "title": "Pick a good drinking spot.",
      "content": "Pick a good drinking spot. Drinking at home has its advantages as it is generally cheaper and you won't have to worry about getting home after a long night out. Try to drink in a place you are familiar with or in an area of town that you know well. This will help minimize any disorientation you might feel when you get drunk. Organize a special night out. Is there a new bar or cocktail place you've been wanting to try? Don't just stumble into the first watering hole you come across. If you're going to get drunk, it should be at a place you enjoy."

      "title": "Set your limits ahead of time.",
      "content": "Set your limits ahead of time. The number of drinks you can consume before experiencing the dangerous effects of alcohol depends on a number of factors, such as your height, weight, and gender. Even if you are drinking with the aim of getting tipsy, try not to exceed more than one drink per hour (especially if you will be drinking for more than a few hours). Women generally shouldn't exceed more than 4 drinks in any single evening; men should not exceed more than 5 drinks. If you consume more than this, you are heading into dangerous \"binge\" territory and are likely to suffer unpleasant hangover consequences the next morning. Keep in mind the following measurements for a drink. One beer = 12 oz; one glass of wine = 5oz; one drink of hard liquor = 1.5 oz."

      "title": "Raise your glass.",
      "content": "Raise your glass. Your first drink should be something you can really enjoy and savor. Don't start off with a shot as this will throw off your pace for the night (one drink per hour). Instead, pick a beer you really love or try a new cocktail. Enjoy your drink. Alcoholic drinks can have wonderful, complex flavors. If you drink them too quickly, you might miss out on this."

      "content": "Eat something. It's never a good idea to drink on an empty stomach as this can prompt you to get too drunk too quickly (so you skip over that slightly buzzed phase and go straight to puking on the bathroom floor). [2] X Research source Any food in the stomach will help mitigate the potential of a hangover, but there are a few things that can especially help. Alcohol depletes your body's store of Vitamin B-12, so you might want to eat foods that are rich in this, like hummus. Alcohol also diminishes the amount of salt and potassium, so consider eating a broth-based soup at dinner.

      "content": "Drink non-alcoholic beverages, too. If you know you will be drinking over the course of hours (for example, at dinner and then going out to a bar afterwards), be sure to also constantly drink water. This will help you keep a good pace with your drinking and lessen your risk of a hangover."

    {
      "title": "Evaluate your symptoms.",
      "content": "Evaluate your symptoms. A good, moderate level of drunkenness is when you generally feel carefree and relaxed, but still have a normal grasp on your surroundings. If the room starts to spin or if you find you are having a hard time walking without bumping into things, sit down and stop drinking alcohol. Switch to water, eat a snack, and sit until you feel the effects of your last drink wear off. If nothing changes after an hour, you need to ask someone to help you get home."

      "title": "Do things that you enjoy.",
      "content": "Do things that you enjoy. Alcohol is most enjoyable when you can associate it with other things you love. Maybe you really like to go dancing or listening to live music. Perhaps you love watching cheesy horror movies with your friends or playing party games. Do something so you're not just solely preoccupied with the next drink."

Never drive when you have been drinking; if you get behind the wheel of a car, you could kill yourself or others. Drinking while you are pregnant can also cause harmful birth defects in the fetus. Excessive drinking over a short period of time can also lead to alcohol poisoning. It can make the drinker fall into a coma or even lead to death.

If alcoholism runs in your family, be careful about drinking in any excessive way as you do not want to form a dependency on it. [5] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 308 wikiHow readers how they approached setting boundaries with an alcoholic parent, and 60% of them said that they limited the parentâ€™s involvement in their life.
