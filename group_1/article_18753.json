      "content": "Spin in a circle and look down. The easiest and most common way to get dizzy? Spin in a circle. [1] X Research source Look down at your feet and spin, as quick as you can, for about 7-10 times. You won't need to spin much to get dizzy. Advanced method: Grab a baseball bat, or another stick a few feet long. Put one end on the ground and your forehead against the other. Spin while your forehead touches the bat. Don't try to run or do anything complicated after this. You probably won't be able to, and you might hurt yourself."

      "content": "Crouch and stand up quickly. Another simple way to get dizzy is just to crouch for a long period of time, your legs bent like you're in a huddle. Then, stand up abruptly. This is sometimes called getting a \"head rush,\" but it's basically the same as getting dizzy. [2] X Research source If you're hungry, or if it's very hot out, this will be more intense. Dizziness can result in fainting if you're not careful."

      "title": "Put your feet higher than your head.",
      "content": "Put your feet higher than your head. When your bottom is higher than your top, the blood rushes to your head and you can start to feel quite dizzy. Try to move as little as possible while you do this, and you'll notice the effects more. Hang upside down from a swing-set, or from a fence, or from a pull-up bar. Make sure you turn around before you let go. Ride a roller coaster that goes upside down, or a ride one of the fair rides that you can control the spinning. The Tilt-a-Whirl is a great way to get dizzy."

      "content": "Exercise. Often, if you start doing some exercise, like jogging , doing jumping jacks, or even something like jumping rope, you'll get a little dizzy. Pick something that will have you moving around, go outside, and do it. You get dizzy sometimes when your blood sugar is low and you need to eat something, or you get overheated. If you get dizzy when you do this, it's important to sit down, drink some water, and get something to eat quickly. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Look at an optical illusion. Whether in a book or a picture online, optical illusions can get your head spinning even if you're sitting still. It's a great way to give yourself the illusion that you're moving without actually going anywhere. Lots of moving optical illusions are available on YouTube. They're pretty trippy. If you don't like the optical illusions you find, try watching the iTunes or Windows Media Player visualizer while you're listening to some music you like. Wild stuff."

      "content": "Make sure the area is clear of obstacles. If you spin around too much and get dizzy, there's a good chance you'll lose your balance and maybe even fall down. Never try to get dizzy in the kitchen, or anywhere indoors. The best place to get dizzy is outside, where there's plenty of grass and room to move around. Falling on the grass is ideal. If you have to be indoors, make sure there are no objects or toys on the ground, and that you're far enough away from furniture and walls that you won't get hurt."

      "content": "Don't over-do the spinning. Don't spin so much that you'll fall down and you won't have to worry about getting hurt. Usually 7-8 spins will be enough to get you dizzy. You don't need much more than that. It's very hard to control your fall when you're super-dizzy, so it's easy to break a wrist or an arm, or hurt yourself worse."

Don't do it."

      "content": "Never hold your breath or choke yourself to get dizzy. Dozens of kids in schools all around the world die each year from self-choking to get a \"high.\" Cutting off the oxygen to your brain is extremely dangerous, and can result in serious long-term brain damage, heart problems, and even death. It's not a \"high\" that you feel, it's your brain dying from lack of oxygen. [5] X Research source Don't let any kids at school try to talk you into it, or tell you that \"it's not a big deal\" or \"it's a totally legal high.\" It's a really easy way to kill yourself accidentally."
