      "content": "Soak your feet in warm water and Epsom salt for at least 10 minutes. Fill a foot spa or basin with warm water and about 1 cup (236.6 g) of Epsom salt . Soaking your feet is an important part of a pedicure as the warm water can help soften your skin and get rid of dead skin cells. Try not to soak them for longer than 20 minutes (you don’t want to be working with wrinkly feet). [1] X Research source Test the water’s temperature by dipping a toe in before putting your entire foot in the bath. Epsom salt is an excellent addition to your foot bath because it helps reduce inflammation and soothe aching muscles. Try adding a few drops of essential oils to your bath for a spa-like touch. Peppermint , lemon , or tea tree oils are great choices. If you don’t have Epsom salt, no worries! A bubble bath or moisturizing soap can soften and clean your feet just as well. Don’t have a foot bath or large basin? Fill your bathtub with enough water to cover your feet."

      "title": "Use a pumice stone",
      "content": "Use a pumice stone to scrub your feet while they’re wet. A pumice stone is a light, porous volcanic rock used to remove dead skin cells and calluses. Simply hold the stone up to your foot and quickly move it back and forth. Work in 1 in (2.5 cm) large areas at a time for the best results. Apply steady pressure, but don’t push so hard that it hurts. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a pumice stone, try using a foot file to get the same benefits. Most foot files have 2 sides, coarse and fine. Use the coarse side to loosen dead skin, and then use the fine side to smooth over the filed area."

      "content": "Apply a foot scrub to the top and bottom of your feet. Squeeze or scoop a quarter-size amount of foot scrub into your palm, press it between both hands, and then rub your hands over your feet. Use small, circular motions to exfoliate and remove any leftover dead skin cells. [3] X Research source Foot scrubs come in all types of fragrances, so pick one that helps you relax the most. If you don’t have a foot scrub, try making your own out of ingredients in your pantry."

      "content": "Rinse and wipe the scrub off your feet, and then dry them. After you’ve massaged and scrubbed your feet, dunk them back into your basin. Use a washcloth to wipe off the scrub. When the scrub is completely gone, dry your feet with a towel and wash your hands with soap and water. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut and shape your toenails with nail clippers and a nail file . Snip your toenails straight across using the clippers and try not to cut them too short, as this helps prevents hangnails and ingrown toenails.

      "content": "Apply a cuticle oil and push your cuticles back with a cuticle tool . Cuticle oil helps soften the skin around your nail, so it’s easier to press back. Rub the oil around the base of your nail, and then press your cuticles back gently, following the angle of the tool. [7] X Research source Read the instructions on your cuticle oil to see how much product to use on each nail. Typically, it’s about 1 drop. If you don’t have cuticle oil or balm, try using honey as an alternative."

      "content": "Place your toes in toe separators so it’s easier to paint them. Toe separators are pieces of plastic or foam that space out your toes. Wearing them isn’t necessary, but it can help you get a clean and even coat of nail polish on each toe. It’s also especially helpful if your toes naturally curl in. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Paint your nails with a clear base coat to protect your natural nail. A base coat can help your polish last longer and prevents your nail from staining. Apply a thin layer of polish to each nail. Start at the cuticle, and work your way up the nail with even, vertical brush strokes. Let dry for about 2 minutes. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Paint your nails",
      "content": "Paint your nails with at least 2 coats of nail polish. Pick out your favorite color or something that matches what you’re wearing. Paint your toes as you did with the base coat using thin layers, but wait at least 15 minutes for each coat to dry. [11] X Research source The more coats of nail polish you have, the more saturated the color will be. If you don’t let the polish dry between coats, your pedicure could become clumpy or streaky. Try painting each nail a different bright color for a bold, playful look. Consider only painting the tips of your toenails to do a classic French pedicure . Opt for a natural shade of pink or brown if you don’t want to draw attention to your feet."

      "content": "Apply a top coat for a beautiful shine. Once your base color is completely dry (wait at least 30 minutes after the final coat), finish off your pedicure with a top coat . This final layer locks in your hard work and protects the polish from chipping. Use the same technique as before, and wait around 15 minutes for it to dry. [12] X Research source Fast drying top coats are great when you’re in a pinch and don’t have time to wait for your pedicure to dry. Holographic top coats add a layer of sparkle to your polish and look best over solid colors. Matte top coats cancel out a nail polish’s shine for a more natural look."
