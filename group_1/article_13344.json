This way you'll also be prepared when it's time to reapply acrylic after your nails grow out. Go to a beauty supply store and buy the following supplies: Acrylic nail tips and nail tip glue.

Regular clippers and files aren't as effective on acrylic nails.180, 240, 1000 & 4000 grit should be enough. You might need an even coarser file than the 180 grit if the end result is very clumpy. Acrylic liquid and acrylic powder. These substances are mixed together to create acrylic nails. As said before, stay away from MMA monomers, go for the EMA (always read what ingredients is used!). Acrylic bowl and acrylic brush. You need these supplies to mix up the acrylic and apply it. Somewhere between size #8-12 might be a good choice. Training fingers or a training hand. You may be very eager to make your first acrylic nails on your own hands - or on someone else. But before that you should, and probably need, to practice on something that won't harm you or anyone else. Remember these are strong chemicals which may cause allergies if you aren't careful. Do your first (at least) 10 tries on a training finger or hand. When you are good enough so the material does not go outside of the practice nail, do a few more and then you can start to think about doing it on a real hand. Allergies are for life, if you are unsure, don't do it on anyone else than on yourself."
