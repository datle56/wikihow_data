      "title": "Keep good form.",
      "content": "Keep good form. Fingerspell only with your dominant hand near your shoulder. Always sign letters with your palm facing your listener, away from you, unless specifically stated (in letters G and H, and optionally but commonly C and O). Don't rush to allow beginners to catch up and ensure your letters aren't sloppy. Don't bounce your hand between letters, unless there are two letters, in which case the bounce indicates the repetition of the signed letter. Dragging the letter slightly to the side can also indicate repetition."
