      "title": "Stick to no more than one to two energy drinks per day.",
      "content": "Stick to no more than one to two energy drinks per day. The term “energy drink” refers broadly to beverages that contain a mix of ingredients (almost always including caffeine) that are intended to provide a burst of energy, alertness, and focus. Beyond that, there exists a wide range of products that fit into the category, from soda-like canned drinks to small liquid “shots” to powdered mixes. Setting a blanket limit on how many energy drinks you should have per day is therefore quite difficult. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For the most popular, mass-marketed energy drinks out there, a limit of two servings per day seems reasonably safe for most healthy adults. For non-concentrated liquid energy drinks (like Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, etc.), this equates to about 16 ounces (500 ml) per day. Consider this to be an upper limit, though, and use energy drinks as little as possible as your safest choice."

      "content": "Don’t use energy drinks before or during vigorous physical activity. In cases where episodes of cardiac arrest or other dangerous health events have occurred, energy drink consumption has often been paired with athletic practice or games or similar vigorous exercise. Some athletes like the “boost” of energy and focus the drinks seem to provide, but the caffeine and other ingredients compound many of the physical changes (increased heart rate, for instance) that already take place when you exert yourself. Especially for people with existing cardiac conditions, either diagnosed or undiagnosed (as is often the case with children or young adults), the pairing of energy drinks and vigorous physical activity may possibly cause irregular cardiac activity, such as atrial fibrillation or even sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS). [2] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Such negative events are quite rare, but the risk is probably still much greater than the reward, especially since simply exercising will supply you with an ample dose of energy and focus."

      "title": "Don’t mix energy drinks with alcohol.",
      "content": "Don’t mix energy drinks with alcohol. It should perhaps come as no surprise that the increasing popularity of energy drinks has led to the development of mixed alcoholic drinks that use Red Bull, etc. Some people contend that the energy drinks help counteract the intoxicating effects of the alcohol, allowing them to drink (and party) longer. Unfortunately, this mix may also make you less aware of just how many energy drinks (or how much alcohol) you’ve consumed, and mask potentially dangerous health impacts. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Perhaps most dangerously, some people down energy drinks after alcohol consumption so that they can drive home “safely;” however, driving drunk while being slightly more alert is every bit as dangerous as simply driving drunk, maybe even more so if it gives you unfounded confidence to drive when you shouldn’t.

      "title": "Seek out brands that provide ingredient and nutritional information.",
      "content": "Seek out brands that provide ingredient and nutritional information. In the U.S., some energy drinks are marketed as “dietary supplements,” which places them beyond the regulatory purview of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means, among other things, that the manufacturers do not have to disclose an ingredient list or nutrition facts on the beverage packaging. If you drink one of these beverages, then, you really have no idea what exactly you are putting into your body. [5] X Research source Fortunately for consumers, about 95% of energy drinks (including the most popular brands) are now marketed as beverages and not dietary supplements, which places them under the purview of the FDA and requires ingredient and nutritional labeling. Of course, it is up to you to actually read the labeling, decipher what exactly is in your drink (and how much), and keep track of how much caffeine and other ingredients you are consuming per day.

      "content": "Consult (but don't blindly accept) the drink manufacturer's recommendations. According to the website of the world's best known energy drink, practically any time is a good time to use their beverage. You could / should use it while driving, studying, working, playing sports, playing video games, and partying day or night. [7] X Research source Buried a bit deeper within the website, however, you will find some more practical recommendations, such as keeping your daily caffeine intake to no more than 400 mg (or five cans of this particular drink) per day as a healthy adult. It also advises against consumption by the caffeine-sensitive, and limited intake by pregnant or nursing women and children. It additionally provides a complete ingredient list. Find out as much information about the drink you wish to consume, and consult the manufacturer's recommendations, but use third-party, scientifically-grounded advice to determine if you should consume the drink (and if so, how much)."

      "content": "Keep tabs on your daily caffeine intake. Despite popular perception, caffeine is not technically an addictive substance, although you may experience some minor withdrawal symptoms for a day or two if you go “cold turkey” on a heavy caffeine habit. In moderation, caffeine is safe for most people, but in high doses it can cause cardiac irregularities and other medical issues (and, in extreme cases, death). [8] X Research source Recommendations vary because the effects of higher caffeine intake are not entirely clear, but 300-400 mg of caffeine per day is a good daily maximum to keep in mind. For reference, a typical cup of coffee (8 oz.) has about 100 mg of caffeine; a soda (12 oz), about 40 mg; and energy drinks (250 ml), typically somewhere between 50 mg and 160 mg. [9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Under normal circumstances, pregnant or nursing women should limit themselves to 200 mg or fewer of caffeine per day; children, 50-100 mg per day maximum.

      "title": "Watch for sugar content and other ingredients.",
      "content": "Watch for sugar content and other ingredients. Choosing energy drinks with adequate labeling lets you keep track of more than your caffeine intake. Many of these drinks, for instance, have high doses of sugar per serving. The health dangers of excessive daily sugar consumption have been well demonstrated, and avoiding added sugars is a specific recommendation in the newest U.S. dietary guidelines. Energy drinks also commonly contain ingredients like taurine, an amino acid found naturally in animal products; guarana, a South American plant that naturally contains caffeine (and is in addition to the caffeine specifically added to the drink); and assorted B vitamins. Again, in moderation, these ingredients are generally safe to consume; excessive consumption may be another story.

      "content": "Talk to your doctor if you have underlying health conditions. One or two energy drinks per day is probably safe for the average healthy adult, but those with certain medical conditions should take additional precautions before using them. In particular, if you have heart disease, another cardiac condition, or high blood pressure, you should consult your doctor first. If you experience irritability, nervousness, insomnia, a rapid heartbeat, or elevated blood pressure after a single energy drink, you may have a heightened caffeine sensitivity or another condition worthy of your concern. Talk to your doctor before trying energy drinks again. If you are using energy drinks regularly because of persistent problems with low energy, you may have a sleep disorder or one of many potentially harmful medical conditions. Contact your physician for a check-up."

      "content": "Don't use energy drinks to replace adequate sleep or proper nutrition. Always remember that you will get more consistent, lasting, healthier energy by getting enough sleep and eating properly than by chugging down energy drinks. Energy drinks give you a short burst of energy that will not last, while proper rest and nutrition will keep you going through the day without \"crashing out.\" This wikiHow article offers some useful information on the importance of sufficient sleep (seven to nine hours per night for the typical adult) and how to make sure you get it. According to the most recent dietary guidelines, you should avoid added sugars and derive steady energy from a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats."

Anyone who is or has recently been pregnant knows that there are a host of nutritional precautions that need to be taken in order to protect your health and that of the fetus. Excessive caffeine intake, for example, can cause cardiac irregularities in the fetus directly, or in the mother (at the risk of both her and the fetus). [12] X Trustworthy Source National Institutes of Health U.S. government agency for biomedical and public health research Go to source [13] X Research source Some experts and mothers-to-be still believe in swearing off caffeine completely during pregnancy, but studies indicate that a reduced daily caffeine intake is generally of no concern for both mother and child. Stick to less than 200 mg of caffeine per day, or the amount recommended by your OBGYN."

      "content": "Limit or eliminate consumption by kids and teens. Teenagers make up a sizable percentage of the energy drink market, likely due to the “coolness” factor as much as the energy boost. Caffeine and the other ingredients common to energy drinks are not inherently dangerous to children, but should be ingested in lesser amounts than the maximums recommended for grown adults. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Because energy drinks have no nutritional or therapeutic benefit, can contain unknown ingredients, and have not been subjected to long-term studies regarding their effect on children, the safest measure is to have children entirely avoid consuming them. Most children and teens should not lack for energy anyway, unless they are not getting enough sleep or are suffering from a medical condition that requires attention.

      "content": "Think twice about using caffeine powder. Some people choose to skip the pre-mixed energy drinks and try to make their own. Powdered caffeine can be purchased as a dietary supplement and is in theory just as safe in that form as it is when pre-mixed in beverages. However, there is no guarantee that only caffeine is in the powder, and a slight measuring error can move your caffeine intake into dangerous territory. [16] X Research source The FDA has in fact issued warnings about using caffeine powder, because of the ease by which an inaccurate home measurement can lead to a dangerous overdose. Unless you are confident about the quality of the product and very precise in your dosing, it is probably best to avoid using caffeine powder. For their own safety, it is advisable to prevent teens from using caffeine powder."

      "content": "Use energy drinks wisely, but don’t overreact to unsubstantiated fears. As with most foods, drugs, and supplements, moderation is the operative word when dealing with energy drinks. If you can do without them, that is probably your safest, healthiest choice; however, if you do choose to consume them in moderation and don’t have existing risk factors, you don’t need to feel as though you are risking your health by drinking one. [17] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Ideally, you should rely on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep to provide you with the energy you need to get through the day. Black coffee is probably your next best option, because it is low in calories and ingredients. More oversight to ensure that energy drinks contain what they claim to contain may be warranted, but calls for them to be banned or heavily regulated because they are a serious health hazard are excessive based on current evidence. If you make smart, informed choices, you can drink energy drinks safely."
