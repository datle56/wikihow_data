      "title": "Apologize and say that you don't have any money for a basic excuse.",
      "content": "Apologize and say that you don't have any money for a basic excuse. If a panhandler begins to ask you for money, simply say, “Sorry, I don't have anything” and keep walking. If the panhandler's goal is to get a couple of dollars, they're likely to leave you alone as soon as they know you aren't going to give them anything. If they ask you again or try to negotiate, simply state that you don't have anything a second time. [1] X Research source Apologize first to calm the panhandler, but maintain a firm tone . If they think that they can intimidate you into giving up a couple dollars, they may become more aggressive. Make eye contact when talking to a panhandler. This will let them know that you aren't scared of them and will also make them feel respected."

      "title": "Explain that you are running late for something if the panhandler is stationary.",
      "content": "Explain that you are running late for something if the panhandler is stationary. Pick up your pace and walk a little faster as soon as you see a panhandler. If they address you and ask you for money, just keep walking and say, “Sorry, I am running late for a meeting.” The panhandler isn't likely to chase you down if they think you don't have any time to stop and talk. [3] X Research source If the panhandler does follow after you, look for a local business or crowd where you can take refuge before calling the police. In most countries and states, it is illegal for a panhandler to follow someone, and you should call the police immediately."

      "title": "Say that you only have a credit card if they ask for money.",
      "content": "Say that you only have a credit card if they ask for money. If a panhandler asks you for money, you can always say that you're only a carrying a credit card. This is a particularly good response if you're walking into a store or restaurant and the panhandler is hanging out near the entrance. [4] X Research source If the panhandler asks for a water or small snack, consider getting it for them. Don't be compelled to do something that you're uncomfortable with though."

      "title": "Avoid making eye contact and keep walking if you don't want to interact.",
      "content": "Avoid making eye contact and keep walking if you don't want to interact. One method to dealing with aggressive panhandlers is to pretend that they aren't there. If the panhandler is behaving erratically, they may simply be looking for attention. Put your head down and keep walking as if nothing is going on. If you're being yelled at or followed, ignoring the panhandler may only be making them angrier. Acknowledge them by apologizing and saying that you can't help them out right now."

    {
      "title": "Use your body language to signal you can't talk to at least acknowledge the panhandler.",
      "content": "Use your body language to signal you can't talk to at least acknowledge the panhandler. When the panhandler asks you for money, raise your hand up with the palm facing the panhandler and shake your head to signal that you aren't interested in talking. Sticking to body language won't give a panhandler much to respond to, and they may simply move on as soon as you signal that you won't be giving them anything. Using body language to signal “no” is a good middle ground between acknowledging and ignoring the panhandler. It is enough of a communication to prevent them from feeling like you think they aren't even there, but it isn't a meaningful engagement or invitation for conversation."

    {
      "title": "Pull out your phone and pretend to have a conversation for an easy way out.",
      "content": "Pull out your phone and pretend to have a conversation for an easy way out. Even the most aggressive panhandlers are unlikely to approach you while you're talking on the phone. As soon as you see a panhandler approaching you, pull out your phone and study it for a second like it's vibrating. Look concerned and furrow your eyebrows. Open it and say “Hello?” before proceeding to have a fake conversation. If you're not the greatest when it comes to improvising, come up with a scenario for your phone call ahead of time. Results from a doctor's office, problems with your boss, and bad news from your mother are all excellent topics that you can pretend to discuss on the phone. Pick a topic that requires intense concentration and engagement. If it sounds like you're having a relaxed conversation about the local sports team, the panhandler may still engage you."

      "title": "Leave space between your car and the next car if you're stopping at a red light.",
      "content": "Leave space between your car and the next car if you're stopping at a red light. If the panhandler is hanging out near a red light, slow down as you approach the intersection and leave 15–20 feet (4.6–6.1 m) between you and the car in front of you. When the panhandler starts walking through the street, wait for them to get past the car in front of you and then pull up past them. The odds are good that the panhandler won't turn around to approach you. Pretend to be messing with a radio knob before you move up. This will make it seem like you aren't passing the panhandler on purpose."

      "title": "Take the least disrespectful route whenever possible.",
      "content": "Take the least disrespectful route whenever possible. Begging for money from strangers can be a humiliating experience. If you add to a panhandler's sense of helplessness by being rude or disrespectful, you risk initiating a conflict. [5] X Research source It is best to practice responding in a non-confrontational way, which you can do by actively imagining, or journaling through, or the blind-siding the insult. If a panhandler approaches you and politely asks for change, you may aggravate them by jumping right to ignoring them or calling the police."

      "title": "Contact law enforcement if the panhandler won't leave you alone.",
      "content": "Contact law enforcement if the panhandler won't leave you alone. Aggressive panhandling is illegal in almost every country and state. If a panhandler won't leave you alone, contact emergency services and request police assistance. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source If you are ever threatened, followed, or yelled at by a panhandler, don't hesitate to call the police."

      "title": "Inform a nearby business owner of the problem if they're outside of a business.",
      "content": "Inform a nearby business owner of the problem if they're outside of a business. If a panhandler is operating near a store, go inside when they bother you and ask to speak to a manager. The foot traffic in the area will be negatively impacted by the panhandler, and this will mean that the business has an incentive to deal with the issue. They may also be able to offer advice or insight into how to deal with a specific panhandler. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Placate the panhandler by offering to help them out later if you don't want to really say, “No.”",
      "content": "Placate the panhandler by offering to help them out later if you don't want to really say, “No.” If you really want to avoid a confrontation, tell the panhandler that you will get them something later. Say, “I don't have it right now, but I can give you a few dollars next time,” or, “Sorry, I don't have any money. I will tomorrow though.” The possibility of getting a couple dollars in the future will keep most panhandlers from bothering you further. [9] X Research source The risk that you run doing this is that the panhandler may remember you. If you run into them again, you may cause a conflict if you don't give them anything."
