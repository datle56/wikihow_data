      "content": "Take stock of your normal breathing. Before you practice abdominal breathing, pay attention to your normal patterns of breathing. Abdominal breathing should work to alter the normal pace and size of your breaths to promote relaxation. Close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing. Try to focus on your breaths and block out other stimulants like noises or smells. If possible, do this in a closed-off room away from distractions. Do you breathe into your chest or abdomen? Does your breathing feel slow? Fast? Are your breaths too shallow? See if there's anything about your breathing that feels abnormal. Doing occasional abdominal breathing exercises can help regulate normal breathing."
