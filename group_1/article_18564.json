      "title": "Start with clean, wet hair.",
      "content": "Start with clean, wet hair. Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Apply a heat protectant spray to damp hair to shield your locks from heat if you’ll be styling with a blow dryer, curling wand or hot rollers. Freshly washed and dried hair is the main ingredient for lasting 80s-style curls. If your hair is very damaged, tangled or textured, you may want to detangle your hair in the shower using conditioner and your fingers or a wide-tooth comb."

      "title": "Detangle",
      "content": "Detangle your hair. Comb all of the tangles out of your locks. Start at the bottom and work your way up in small sections. Hold your hair above the tangle as you comb to protect your roots from pulling. Try using a wide-tooth comb. Detangling from the bottom up and holding the hair above the tangle helps prevent breakage."

      "title": "Dry your hair.",
      "content": "Dry your hair. Attach a diffuser to your blow drier for extra volume at the roots. Switch your hair dryer to a low speed. Run the diffuser through your locks as you dry your hair. If you plan to wear foam rollers or twists in your hair overnight, use the diffuser to completely dry your roots only. Or skip the blowdrying and tease your hair the next day when it’s dried naturally. Always use a heat protectant product before applying heat to your hair."

    {
      "title": "Tease your hair.",
      "content": "Tease your hair. Make sure the sections of hair you’re going to tease are dry. Use a fine-toothed teasing comb in one- to two-inch sections or smaller. Begin with your hair’s lower layer and work upwards. Hold up each section and backcomb towards your head. Move a little further up and repeat the backcombing. Spray each finished section with hairspray as you go. Clip up the top sections while you’re working on the bottom layer. By clipping the extra hair out of the way, you can more easily focus on each layer. The smaller the sections you tease, the more volume you’ll achieve. Teasing damp locks can be damaging to your hair. Make sure to shield your eyes when you’re using hairspray near your face."

      "title": "Choose a curling method.",
      "content": "Choose a curling method. Choose Velcro rollers or a curling iron for the fastest but not as long-lasting curl. Use heated rollers for more longevity. Opt for foam rollers or twists overnight for the longest-lasting and most defined curls, and to avoid using extra heat on your tresses. [1] X Research source The thinner the wand or roller, the tighter and springier the curls will be. The exception is foam rollers. Foam rollers can give you a variety of curl sizes, depending on how tight you wind your hair around them. If you’re using a curling wand, opt for a tapered barrel, if possible. This will give you the 80s look of more volume in the body of your hair, with the curls tighter at the ends. If you choose a curling wand, be very careful not to burn yourself. Velcro rollers will give you more volume than curl."

Put a dollop of mousse on the top of your hair. Comb it completely through. Separate your hair into four sections, clipping up the top two. [2] X Research source"

For rollers, start at the ends of your hair and roll the curlers away from your face, making sure your ends wrap around the roller. [3] X Research source For a curling wand, start near your head, roll the curl towards your face, around the barrel of the wand. [4] X Research source If you’re making twists, twist your hair away from your face. If you’re using a curling wand, hold the end of each section while your hair is wrapped around the barrel. Keep your hair around the barrel for 10-15 seconds, counting out each second. This should produce tight, springy curls. Secure twists with pins or fabric elastic ties into four to eight mini buns on each side of your head. Be careful not to touch your hand or face with a hot curling tool."

Alternately, you can spit your bangs into two layers, curling one backwards and the other under. If you don’t have bangs, you can create the appearance of bangs for your 80s style hair! Take the front section of your hair where your bangs would be and pin it to the crown of your head so that your ends hang down like bangs."
