      "content": "It might be challenging at first, but it’s not as tough as you hear. Depending on where you’re moving to Dubai from, you may have quite the culture shock at first. People in Dubai don’t show much affection in public, and it can be hard to try and flirt when you meet someone. With that said, plenty of people find success in the dating scene, and there’s no reason you can’t find a girlfriend in Dubai. [1] X Research source Men outnumber women 3 to 1 in Dubai, and this is one of the bigger barriers according to many single folks in the UAE. There’s just a lot of competition. It may take longer to find a partner, but it’s doable. [2] X Research source While roughly 75% of the population speaks English, you may run into language barriers with some of the women you approach. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "It shouldn’t be too hard to find other expats to date. More than 85% of Dubai’s population are foreigners. While many of those foreigners are from nearby countries with similar cultures, many of them are not. If you’re looking for other single expats, there are plenty of fish in that sea! [4] X Research source Expats outnumber Emirati nationals by a fair bit, and most of those expats speak English, so you won’t be alone if you’re moving from an English-speaking country. It may take a bit of time to find your tribe, but making friends and finding dates won’t be impossible."

      "content": "It might be hard to date an Emirati woman if you aren’t Muslim. It’s not impossible to approach Emirati women, but there can be some cultural obstacles if you aren’t Muslim. Dating in traditional UAE culture is very formal, and you may need her family’s approval before you can take her out. [5] X Research source It’s also illegal for a non-Muslim man to marry a Muslim woman in the United Arab Emirates, so the family may not be fond of you dating their daughter. [6] X Research source Dowries are still common in Dubai, so many families are weary of certain foreign nationals dating their daughter, since they may not abide by the dowry system.

      "content": "Try clubs and bars. If you want to make friends, meet expats, or talk up a cute girl, hit the town every Friday and Saturday night. You can’t drink alcohol in Dubai if you aren’t at a club or bar (it’s even illegal to have it at home), so most party-loving young folks hit the bars and clubs on the weekends. Jumeirah Lake Towers, Palm Jumeirah, and Barsha Heights are all popular areas if you’re looking to meet expats and explore Dubai’s vibrant nightlife. Many bars and nightclubs have ladies night for single women! It’s illegal to dance or be drunk in public, so keep that in mind when you leave a bar or club. [8] X Research source"

Some are designed around a mutual hobby, like horse riding or board games, while others are general events, like “single expats meetup.” Don’t be shy! These meetups can be a great way to meet single women. At bare minimum, you’ll make a few friends. [9] X Research source These meetups are typically going to be very welcoming to newcomers, especially since everyone remembers what it’s like to be new in Dubai. The site, Meetups, is among one of the most popular options for these groups. InterNations and Facebook are also great sites to check."

Dating in Dubai is probably a bit more formal than you’re used to, and expats often rely on mutual friends to set them up with reliable partners. Just let your friends, coworkers, or classmates know that you’re on the market and looking to date. [10] X Research source"

It’s free, and easy to use, but you may catch some attitude if people see you using it in public. [11] X Research source Remember, casual hookups are not all that common in Dubai, so don’t get on Tinder expecting to have a one-night stand. Many Tinder users in Dubai have mentioned that there are a lot of scammers, so be careful before you share any personal information and always meet up in public."

All you need to do is upload a photo, create a profile, and you’re ready to go. You can browse profiles and message women on the site. [13] X Research source Love Habibi is another popular option for religious people in Dubai. It’s not exclusively for Muslims, but most users are religious."

      "content": "Ask women you talk to on a formal date. Many women in Dubai won’t be into “hitting the town” or “grabbing a drink.” In fact, they may not even know what you’re talking about. Be forward and upfront about what you’re doing when you ask women out. Aside from the fact that expats may not know the terms you’re using if you beat around the bush too much, the formal request is important in Dubai. You might say, “You seem like an interesting person. Would you be interested in going on a date sometime?” or, “I’d love to get to know you more. Do you want to go on a date with me next weekend?” Offer to take women to dinner or grab a cup of chai. Chai cafes are extremely popular for a reason! Don’t suggest grabbing a drink if you don’t know a girl drinks or not. Many women in Dubai don’t consume alcohol at all, even if they aren’t Muslim."

People in Dubai rarely dress down, especially for dates. Even if the date is laid back, iron your clothes and overdress just a bit to send the right message. You may notice a lot of wealth flashing in Dubai. Avoid overdoing it with the fancy designer brands and gold jewelry. It’s considered bad form for a date."

If you ask a woman for her number or you try talking to her and she doesn’t seem interested, move on. If you even give a dash of an impression that you’re not taking “no” for answer, you may be kicked out of the bar or club. Don’t push it. You can even be arrested for being too forward with a woman in Dubai, so keep it subtle, go slow, and don’t be too pushy."

In Dubai, your date may want you to meet her family after 2-3 dates! You may even need formal approval to make your date your girlfriend, so be on your best behavior and you’ll be fine."

[14] X Research source While it isn’t explicitly illegal as of 2020, it’s still extremely frowned upon. Try not to hold someone’s hand, hug, or kiss in public if things go well on a date. [15] X Research source Dubai does have a reputation for being less strict than the rest of the UAE, but you never know when someone will take offense."

While this may not get you in trouble (especially in Dubai), you probably shouldn’t play it up with your friends or mention it to co-workers if you do have sex. [16] X Research source The same goes for one-night stands at hotels or your home. It used to be illegal for unmarried couples to cohabitate—even at hotels. It’s not illegal anymore, but you may catch some side eye from your neighbors if they see you."

While Dubai is probably the most accepting city in the country when it comes to LGBTQ+ people, it’s still probably best to not share how you feel with a woman unless you’re alone and confident that you won’t be in harm’s way. [17] X Research source Nobody should be isolated because of their sexuality. While it can be risky, if you do want to use an LGBTQ dating app, use a VPN so that you can’t be tracked.
