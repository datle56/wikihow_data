Many website management tools and CMS panels (including Drupal) make it easy to create short aliases (also known as \"friendly URLs\") for longer URLs on your own site without using HTTP redirects . For example, if the URL to the Lipstick section of your web store looks like yourdomain.com/store/categories/2320935/cosmetics/22344 , you can create a URL alias that points yourdomain.com/lipstick to the same URL.

      "content": "Register a second domain name that's short and similar to your current domain name. If your domain name is really long, you can register a shorter one that you can use as an alias for sharing links. This is a great way to create small URLs without using a third-party URL shortener. For example, whitehouse.gov also has the domain alias wh.gov , and both addresses go to the same place. The wh.gov domain is just an alias to whitehouse.gov . For example, if wikiHow also had the domain wkhw.us , a visitor could click https://www.wkhw.us/Create-Small-URL-Links in a tweet or post, which would take them to https://www.wikihow.com/Create-Small-URL-Links. Once you have a shorter domain, your hosting provider can link it to your current website so clicks to the shorter links go to the regular long links. Alternatively, you can point your new domain to a service like Cutt.ly to create custom small URLs at your own domain. If you host with GoDaddy, you can use their custom URL shortener at https://shortener.godaddy.com . [13] X Research source"
