      "title": "Light the shot with a lighter or match.",
      "content": "Light the shot with a lighter or match. If you’re at a bar, have the bartender do this for you. Otherwise, use a lighter or match and watch your fingers. Once lit, enjoy the light show! To be safe, make sure the area isn’t too crowded. Count how many seconds the alcohol's been burning. Aim for no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, so the shot glass isn’t too hot to hold. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Press your hand over the shot glass to put out smaller fires.",
      "content": "Press your hand over the shot glass to put out smaller fires. If the flame is contained and tiny, you can flatten your palm across the mouth of the shot glass. This creates a seal that will remove all the oxygen from inside the glass. Once the air’s gone, the flame goes out and the glass should stick to your hand. Give the shot glass a few shakes to make sure the fire’s out. [2] X Research source Some shots have their own rituals, including how to suppress the blaze, so this method might not apply depending on your drink. Alternatively, gently blow the flame out, but be careful not to spill your drink."

      "title": "Cover the shot with a mug or shaker tin to contain bigger flames.",
      "content": "Cover the shot with a mug or shaker tin to contain bigger flames. This is a great option for protecting yourself and others if the fire has more kick to it. Place the makeshift cover over the shot glass for 5 to 10 seconds to smother it. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Douse the shot with beer or water to put out the fire with a splash.",
      "content": "Douse the shot with beer or water to put out the fire with a splash. While blowing out flaming shots isn’t recommended, anything with high water content should work just fine. That could be water, or even a beer or mixed drink. Depending on your shot, pour liquid over the flames, or drop the shot into your water or beer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drink your shot in one gulp.",
      "content": "Drink your shot in one gulp. Since shots tend to be strong, especially shots ablaze, the best way to drink them is all at once. While some heat in the mouth and throat is to be expected, note any unusual or intense sensations or pain. Follow up your shot with water or beer so nothing lingers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Light the shot with a lighter or match.",
      "content": "Light the shot with a lighter or match. If a bartender’s present, let them do the honors. If you’re lighting the shot, use a match or lighter to set things off, and keep your fingers out of the fire. Give the shot some breathing room and relish in the flicker and flame. Be mindful of the fire near your face and hands as you prepare to drink."

    {
      "title": "Place a straw between your lips.",
      "content": "Place a straw between your lips. Using a straw protects your hands from needing to touch the hot glass. Drinking your shot this way might also offer more time to admire the aesthetics of your drink. Plastic straws will likely be the easiest to find, but you’ll need to drink quickly. The fire could melt the straw within seconds. [4] X Research source Aim for a longer straw to guard your face further. [5] X Research source You can try metal straws, which are harder to melt, but the heated straw could be a safety hazard. They’ll also be harder to find when you’re out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip the straw into the shot glass.",
      "content": "Dip the straw into the shot glass. Come at the shot from an angle to prevent the flames from hitting you directly in the face. Be sure the straw reaches into the depths of the shot glass, if possible. As most modern flaming drinks are only lit on the surface, fully submerging the straw keeps you from directly swallowing the fire, protecting your mouth and throat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swallow the shot quickly.",
      "content": "Swallow the shot quickly. The high alcohol content means this will probably burn going down, so don’t sip. Anticipate some lingering flames in the shot glass; there will be leftover alcohol present, which can keep the fire going. Keep an eye on the end of your straw, as it might have caught fire when placed in the shot. Follow up with water or beer to be sure you’re in the clear."
