      "title": "Go shell collecting.",
      "content": "Go shell collecting. Shell collecting is another way for people to enjoy the outdoors without overexerting themselves. If you want to have a nice day at the beach but surfing or tanning just isn't for you, take a long walk on the beach, picking up any shells that interest you. You can even get a shell collecting guidebook or go online and try to identify the kind of shells that you found. You can also take along a child or a good friend that you want to talk to. It's a great way to enjoy the beach, pay attention to detail, and pass the time. Check the laws first, as shell collecting is illegal in some places, such as the UK. If collecting natural produce is prohibited, you can still collect things from the beach that aren't naturally there, such as seaglass and china pieces."

      "content": "See the green flash. Some people say that the green flash is a just an invention of Jules Verne, while others insist it's a real phenomenon. In any event, it's certainly worth trying to see the green flash at least once in your life. Find a good spot to watch the sunset. Keep your eyes on the sun and wait for it to dip as low as it can to the horizon, when just the tiniest sliver of light remains. There, right before the sun disappears, you'll see a flash of green that signals that another day is over. This can be a truly romantic and breathtaking experience."

      "title": "Skip rocks",
      "content": "Skip rocks . Skipping rocks is a fun way to hang out near a body of water and it can also be a real skill that you develop. All you need is some water and a place where you can pick up some flat stones that are at least the size of a half dollar. Just hold the stone in between your index finger and thumb, so it's parallel to the ground, and snap your wrist so you launch the rock toward the water, making it hit the water's surface at a slight angle so it skips further away from you. Once you become an expert, you can have rock skipping contests with your friends, or try to go for a record for how many times you can make one rock skip."

      "title": "Write a poem about nature.",
      "content": "Write a poem about nature. Go outside and find a comfortable seat. All you need is a notebook, a pen, and an open mind. Start writing about what you see -- the beauty, the mystery, and the magic of the nature in front of you, even if you're just looking at a few trees or an open field. There is always magic in the pureness of nature, and soon, you'll be writing up a storm. The nature may even conjure a memory from your childhood or your past, and you can find yourself writing a poem about the nature and how it relates to your own life. You don't have to be Emily Dickinson to write something meaningful about the outdoors. The best part is, you don't have to show what you write to a soul. Writing poems about nature can be a transcendent experience."

      "title": "Go bird watching.",
      "content": "Go bird watching. Bird-watching is a fun activity that is perfect for enjoying the outdoors for people who have patience and a real love for nature. To go bird-watching, you'll need to find a wooded area, get some binoculars and a notebook for taking notes, and a guidebook that can help you identify the birds you're looking for. People who are serious birdwatchers can spend hours in one place, in search of a certain rare bird. However, this doesn't have to be you. You can take a more casual approach and have fun exploring a new area, searching for birds at the same time. This is also a great thing to with kids, to help them develop a love for nature. You could also learn some common bird calls --some birds are small and not so easily spotted."

      "title": "Go biking.",
      "content": "Go biking. Biking is a perfect way to get in touch with the outdoors. You can take a long bike ride in an outdoorsy area by yourself, join a biking club, or even enter a biking race. You'll really enjoy nature when you feel the wind whipping at your face and see the greenery flashing by as you pedal your feet. Biking is also a great way to get some exercise and to get your heart rate up -- just make sure to wear a helmet. The best part about biking is that it's also a form of transportation, so if you want to make enjoyment of the outdoors a more regular part of your life, then you can start biking to work or to run errands, if you can."

      "title": "Go running.",
      "content": "Go running. Running is the perfect way to enjoy the outdoors. If you get into the zone, soon you'll only feel your feet hitting the pavement while you connect with nature. Pick a path surrounded by greenery, or even venture into trodden paths in the woods (as long as you know where you're going), and soon you'll be feeling at one with the trees. If you really want to enjoy nature, ditch the iPod and enjoy your surroundings; in spite of what you may think, you'll still be able to enjoy your surroundings, even if you're in the middle of an intense workout. Step outside to run while the sun is out to commune with nature even more, and to get a little bit of sun in the process. Many people believe that being out in the sunshine can actually make you feel happier, so take advantage of this whenever you can."

      "content": "Go swimming . Whether you're swimming in a lake, the ocean, or an outdoor pool, swimming outside is another great way to enjoy the outdoors. Take a swimming buddy, or go by yourself to enjoy the water for half an hour or more. It can also be fun just to swim in place while talking to a good friend, playing water volleyball, or even doing handstands instead of swimming. If you're in the ocean, try body surfing on a wave and see how far you can go. Swimming also happens to be an amazing full body workout -- what have you got to lose?"

      "content": "Spend a day at the beach. Just being at the beach is another amazing way to enjoy the outdoors. You can set up a picnic, have some beers and listen to some good music, play beach volleyball, or throw around a Frisbee. You can also just read some magazines and get a great tan. Get creative and create makeshift goals in between coolers and play some fun beach volleyball. You can also bury someone in sand, or make a sandcastle or sand sculpture. It can feel like a hassle to organize a group of people to go to the beach, but you won't regret it once you're all there enjoying the sunshine."

      "content": "Go camping. Camping is another great way to enjoy the outdoors. You'll need to get your gear together, such as your tent, sleeping bags, bug spray, food, water, and a bunch of other equipment, but it'll be worth it once you pitch your tent and feel at one with nature. Obviously, it's best to go with someone who knows what he or she is doing, so you're able to pitch your tent, cook food, and avoid danger. Many people think \"going rugged\" is not for them, but you'll see that this is a wonderful way to feel close to nature! Sleeping in a tent really not your thing? You can go \"glamping,\" checking into a very rural hotel in the evenings and spending the days outdoors."

      "content": "Go white water rafting. Depending on where you live, going white water rafting down a river is one of the most fun and exhilarating experiences you can have, and it's a wonderful way to really enjoy the outdoors. You'll need a strong raft, oars, life vests, and a knowledgeable guide who can help you traverse the choppy terrain. You can choose your level of difficulty, so if you're nervous, you can go through pretty mild waters, at first. The more adventurous can go rafting through more treacherous territory once they have some experience."

      "content": "Go skiing or snowboarding. More of a snow bunny? Then, if weather permits -- or if you can go to a snowy place like Lake Tahoe at the right time -- then you should go skiing or snowboarding as a way to enjoy the outdoors. If you're an absolute beginner, don't worry. There will be classes for you, and lots of help. You'll feel at one with nature when you feel your skis hitting the fresh, crisp snow. If you're not into winter athletics and would rather just enjoy the beautiful snow, then you can skip the sporty stuff and go straight for the hot chocolate and hot tub, or make a snow man or snow angel instead. You can also try snow tubing. You'll still get the exhilarating feeling of going down a snowy hill without any of the work. You'll just have to get into the tube safely and then sit back and enjoy the ride."

      "content": "Go horseback riding. Horseback riding is another great way to enjoy nature, and anyone can do it with enough help and practice. Find someone who knows what he's doing and sign up for a horseback riding tour. You'll get the equipment you need and will be told how to steer and control the horse to get it to do what you want. Beginners won't be taken too far out of their comfort zones, and you won't have to steer a galloping horse down a mountain on your first go-around. Being with a beautiful, powerful animal like a horse in the outdoors is an amazing way to enjoy nature in its purest form."

      "content": "Have a picnic. Picnics are so underrated. There's something to be said for packing a basket of tasty and simple food, a blanket, and sitting in the great outdoors to enjoy it. You can have a picnic in the middle of a park or venture further out into the woods. Just pack some simple sandwiches, strawberries, cheese and crackers, or even a bottle of wine and plastic glasses, and have at it. This can be a romantic surprise to plan for your partner, or just a great way for you and your friends to enjoy yourselves and maybe do some people watching in the process."

      "title": "Go for a walk.",
      "content": "Go for a walk. People don't go on enough walks anymore. People tend to hide in their cars or just to avoid this most basic form of human movement because they think that if they're going from one place to another, they might as well be driving or running. In fact, walking is one of the most basic ways to enjoy the outdoors and to really notice the nature around you. Don't bring your phone or your iPod, and just enjoy being alone with your own thoughts and noticing the world around you. It can be a truly meditative experience. Make a goal to make walking a bigger part of your life. Ask yourself when you can substitute walking for driving or taking the bus or public transportation. Reader Poll: We asked 605 wikiHow readers to tell us what activity they would suggest to someone who's stressed, and 59% agreed on going for a walk. [Take Poll] So in short, not only is this option a great way to enjoy the outdoors, it's also an awesome way to reduce stress!"

Stop playing sports on your Wii and get some friends together to play an organized game outdoors. You don't have to worry about being great at it or making thing super competitive. Just make it all about having fun with your friends and enjoying being outdoors."

      "content": "Go fishing. Who says fishing has to only be for old men? Anyone can enjoy a nice long morning of fishing, or even some afternoon fishing, if they know what they're doing. It's really quite simple: you hook your bait, cast your line, and wait for a fish to bite. Then all you've got to do is reel him in. The hardest part can be waiting for a fish to bite, which can take a while, but it's all part of the fun. Fishing is great with friends, because you can just sit back and have long, philosophical conversations. If you catch the right fish, you can even have it for dinner (and we don't mean as a guest). Just make sure to look into local laws, wherever you are -- it's likely that you'll need a fishing license to go fishing. It's best to be with someone who knows what they're doing. One of the tricky parts is knowing how to untangle your line, or to remove the hook from the fish after you get it out of the water -- this can get a bit messy."

      "content": "Have an outdoor barbecue . Want to enjoy the outdoors without exerting yourself? One of the best ways to do it is to have an outdoor barbecue. Tell each of your friends to bring something, and all you'll have to worry about is finding a comfortable place to do it (ideally, your own backyard or a park), and grilling those burgers, hot dogs, and vegetarian what-have-yous. This can be a great way to be outside with friends without having to do a lick of exercise."

      "content": "Perform a play. This may sound silly, but it's so much fun! Get a few of your friends out to a nice, sunny spot, and give each of them a copy of a play -- or just a scene from one. Cast your characters, and have fun performing the lines, whether you're channeling Shakespeare or Eugene O'Neill. And heck, if you're really feeling creative, you can write a play of your own and have your friends perform it. You can even memorize the play and then perform it for others, even if you're just performing for a small group of friends and family. The important thing is that you're outside, breathing the fresh air!"

      "content": "Play in the rain. Who says you have to stay cooped up indoors when it's raining? If you're adventurous, go running outside in the rain, play soccer in the rain, or just go outside and spin around, feeling at one with it all -- as long as there's no lightning, of course. If you don't want to go out in the rain, you can also sit on a porch and enjoy a cup of tea and a good book, listening to the patter of the rain hitting the roads, washing everything anew. Some people find the rain to be sad and depressing, but that doesn't have to be you. You should look at is a beautiful, replenishing phenomenon."

      "content": "Go stargazing. Stargazing can be a magical, not to mention a very romantic, way to spend your time. All you need is a good spot where you can see the sky, away from all the light pollution, a telescope, and a book or guide that can help you recognize some of the constellations, such as the Big Dipper, Cassiopeia, or Orion. You can even ditch the telescope or guidebook and find a beautiful place where you can see the sky, away from the cities and all of the noise that comes with them. If you're with a romantic partner, a bottle of red wine can help you see the stars with even more clarity."
