      "content": "Kill flies you see with a fly swatter . Get a stiff plastic swatter and keep it within reach. Whenever you see a fly, aim your swatter about 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) behind it and quickly strike down. Pick up the dead fly and clean up the mess left behind with an all-purpose cleaner. [1] X Research source If you want to avoid wiping up after swatting a fly, then get an electric swatter . Swing at flies in the air to kill them on contact so they drop onto the floor without getting squashed. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Set out a vinegar trap for a natural DIY solution. Put some distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar in a container, and cover the opening with plastic wrap. Use a rubber band to hold the plastic wrap in place. Poke a small hole in the plastic wrap so that flies can smell the vinegar and crawl inside the container. Once they’re inside, the flies will be unable to escape and drown in the vinegar. Leave out multiple traps and replace the vinegar every few days. [3] X Research source Add in a few drops of fruit-scented dish soap to disrupt the surface tension of the vinegar. When the smell attracts the flies and they land on the liquid, they’ll get stuck and drown. Alternatively, leave out an open bottle of red wine with a tiny amount of wine left in it. The flies will be able to enter the bottle easily, but have a difficult time getting out again."

      "content": "Create a funnel trap with sugar water and an old soda bottle. Cut the top third of a large soda bottle off with a utility knife just above the label. Then, fill the bottom section of the bottle with a little bit of sugar water. Set the bottle top upside-down on the bottom section so it creates a funnel. Set the trap in areas where you see the most flies, and change the liquid out at least once a week.

      "title": "Use light traps to catch larger flies.",
      "content": "Use light traps to catch larger flies. Plug your light traps in approximately 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) above the floor and every 30 feet (9.1 m). Flies are lured in by the UV light, and then they get stuck on a glue board or killed by an electric shock. [5] X Research source Position the traps around your home so they’re not visible from outside, or else the light could lure new flies inside. Avoid placing traps within 5 feet (1.5 m) of any areas where you prepare food so flies don’t spread bacteria over utensils or groceries. Set up outdoor light traps near entrances to your home to kill the flies before they have a chance to get inside."

      "title": "Hang fly tape to catch flies.",
      "content": "Hang fly tape to catch flies. Put up fly tape wherever you’ve noticed flies gathering inside of your home, like near windows or entrances. When the flies land on the tape, they’ll get caught on the adhesive and won’t be able to get away. Once the strip of fly tape fills up, throw it in the trash and hang up a new one. [6] X Research source Avoid hanging fly tape directly above areas where you cook or eat since flies could fall off and land in your food."

      "title": "Use essential oils to kill and repel flies.",
      "content": "Use essential oils to kill and repel flies. Try essential oils of thyme, clove, geranium, basil, lavender, lemongrass, vanilla, sunflower, and peppermint all have fly repellant or insecticidal properties. Spread the essential oils near entryways or in rooms where you’ve seen flies gather to help kill them and keep them away. [7] X Research source Mix an essential oil spray with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of witch hazel, 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of apple cider vinegar, and 30–50 drops of essential oil to treat areas where flies gather. Alternatively, put a few drops of fly-repellant oil in an essential oil diffuser and place it in a room where flies are a problem. All of the essential oils listed above may be harmful to pets if they’re undiluted. If you notice your furry friend has behavioral changes, muscle weakness, vomiting, or diarrhea, stop using essential oils and tell your vet that your pet has been exposed. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Dust diatomaceous earth on flies to kill them on contact. Diatomaceous earth is a non-toxic insecticide dust that simply works by damaging the flies’ exoskeletons of insects. Load the diatomaceous earth into a small pesticide duster and puff a little onto your houseplants, into garbage cans, and onto other surfaces where flies congregate. [9] X Research source Diatomaceous earth has low toxicity, but avoid applying it on areas where you prepare or eat food. Use diatomaceous earth every 1–2 weeks until the fly infestation goes away."

      "title": "Grow fly-repellant herbs in your house.",
      "content": "Grow fly-repellant herbs in your house. Basil, bay leaf, mint, rosemary, and lavender all have strong scents that flies will avoid. Grow herbs in your kitchen or outside on your patio or garden to keep the flies away. Plus, you’ll have fresh herbs and spices to add to your cooking for fresh flavors. [10] X Research source Leaving sachets with dried spices also works as a repellent. Try filling them with dried cloves, lavender, or basil leaves and hanging them around your home. Try growing Venus flytraps indoors or outside. When a fly lands inside of the flytrap, its jaws close and kill the fly. Flytraps take 5–10 days to fully break down a fly after they close, so they may not be the best to quickly get rid of flies. Cut a lemon in half and push about 20–25 cloves into the fruit to make a strong-scented repellent. Set the lemon near a window or anywhere else you see flies to deter them."

      "title": "Kill flies directly with pyrethrin spray.",
      "content": "Kill flies directly with pyrethrin spray . Only spray flies that are away from areas where you eat and prepare food so it doesn’t get contaminated. Follow manufacturer safety instructions carefully. Typically, all you have to do is shake the can and spray the insecticide directly at the flies to immediately kill them. [11] X Research source Point the spray away from you when you’re applying it. You don’t need to wear a mask or respirator, but avoid directly inhaling the spray since it can cause irritation in your nose and lungs. Try not to use insecticides unless you’re struggling to deal with an infestation so you avoid exposure to chemicals. Natural traps and repellents that we’ve listed above are just as effective for flies"

      "content": "Use insecticide fly bait . Baits either come as pre-baited traps, pellets, or liquid solutions that can be applied to areas where flies like to gather. Any of the baits are effective, so just set them out where you see flies congregating the most in your home. The flies will eat the bait and quickly die from the insecticides inside. [14] X Research source A popular form of fly bait is the Ortho Home Defense Fly Killer Window Decal . Affix the decal to a window away from where you prepare food. Flies eat the pesticide coating on the decal and die, typically on or near the windowsill. Fly baits can be dangerous to pets and children, so be sure to follow manufacturer safety instructions and use them in places that your kids and pets can’t easily reach."

      "content": "Clean up food and food waste immediately. Flies are attracted to moist organic material, which acts as both a source of food and a place to lay eggs. Store food in the fridge or in tightly-sealed containers rather than leaving them on the counter. If you spilled any food or drinks, clean them up as soon as you notice them with a damp paper towel.

      "content": "Clean under and around appliances. Flies like to breed in warm dark areas, like underneath your fridge or oven. Move your stove and fridge so you can sweep the area. Then, mop your floors with warm, soapy water. Check under and around your appliances every few weeks to ensure no flies have called it home. [19] X Research source After cleaning up these areas, thoroughly rinse and wring out any mops, sponges, or cleaning rags that you used, and hang them to dry since flies could breed there as well."

Use a drain snake to clear out organic material, then scrub the drain with a stiff brush. Alternatively, pour boiling water down the drain to help loosen debris and kill any flies that are in your drain. [20] X Research source Chlorine bleach and commercial drain cleaners like Drano are not typically effective for eliminating fly infestations in drains, so avoid using them. If scrubbing doesn’t clean out your drain enough, try an antibacterial drain cleaner like Bio-Clean . If you have a septic system, make sure that the package says that it’s safe to use for your drains."
