      "content": "Exfoliate the area. If your hands got stained while you were applying your self-tanner , Dr. Tareen says that there’s no need to panic. “If the self-tanner was recently applied, one of the best ways to remove the tanner is by gently exfoliating the skin using a hand mitt or glove,” she explains. Place the glove on one hand and use it to rub some body scrub onto your other hand in circular motions, then switch sides. Ritzman adds that you should pay extra attention to the areas where self-tanner usually accumulates, such as your palms and between your fingers. If you don’t have an exfoliating mitt or glove , Ritzman recommends soaking your hands in warm water for 10-15 minutes to soften your skin, then using a washcloth to scrub the tan off gradually."

      "content": "Apply a product that contains glycolic acid. If you don’t want to use a physically exfoliating mitt or body scrub, try using a product that contains a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid. The glycolic acid will gently exfoliate the top layer of your skin and break down the extra self-tanner without any harsh scrubbing. [1] X Research source Products like glycolic acid pads or glycolic acid serums that you may already use in your skincare routine work well for this."

      "content": "Use white vinegar. A mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water is another good option for fading self-tanner from your skin. “Rub the vinegar on, let it sit for 10 minutes or so, and then rinse it off,” says Dr. Tareen. The acidity of the vinegar should break down the extra layers of self-tanner, leaving your skin stain-free. [2] X Research source Apple cider vinegar works as well, if it’s all you have on hand."

      "content": "Apply a paste of lemon juice and baking soda. “Take lemon juice and mix it with baking soda to create a paste, and then apply it to your hands and gently scrub,” says Ritzman. “The acidity of the lemon juice and baking soda’s abrasiveness can help lift the tan.” You don’t need to use precise measurements here; just add enough of each ingredient to create a paste-like consistency. If you’re looking for an easy fix using ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen, this may be the perfect option for you!"

      "content": "Try out some toothpaste. Toothpaste is another household item that can do wonders for removing self-tanner stains. Grab a whitening toothpaste and use an old toothbrush to scrub it into any areas on your hands that got too dark from the self-tanner, then rinse it off with warm water. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub your hands with baby oil.",
      "content": "Rub your hands with baby oil. If the self-tanner stained your hands pretty deeply, Dr. Tareen recommends trying some baby oil. “Lather up the baby oil and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then, get in the shower or bath with warm (not hot) water, and rinse away the self-tanner.” An added benefit of this method? “It will also leave your skin feeling soft and supple,” says Dr. Tareen."

      "content": "Wipe the self-tanner off with a washcloth, not soap and water. If you’ve just applied a self-tanner, you’ll want to remove the product from your palms but leave it on the backs of your hands. This mimics the appearance of a natural tan while also preventing you from ending up with hands that are way lighter than the rest of your body. Simply use a washcloth or paper towel to wipe the tanner off both palms, the spaces between your fingers, your fingernails, and your cuticles to make sure these areas don’t get stained too dark. [7] X Research source Let the self-tanner on the other side of your hands develop for a few minutes before washing it off."

      "content": "Use a tanning mitt to apply your self-tanner. “The key to avoiding tan stains on your hands is to be proactive and use preventative measures before applying the tan,” explains Ritzman. A surefire way to do this would be using a tanning mitt to apply the product onto your body, rather than using your bare hands to rub it in. This eliminates the risk of staining your palms too dark, and it also helps you apply the self-tanner on your body in a super smooth, even layer."

      "title": "Moisturize your hands before applying your self-tanner.",
      "content": "Moisturize your hands before applying your self-tanner. If you don’t have a tanning mitt, you can also create a barrier between the self-tanner and your hands with a thick cream or moisturizer. “Apply a heavy moisturizer or petroleum jelly to your hands before applying the tan,” says Ritzman. “This creates a protective layer that helps prevent the tan from absorbing into the skin. After the tan, carefully wipe it off.”"
