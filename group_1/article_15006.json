      "content": "Dry brushing is the practice of brushing the skin to stimulate and exfoliate it. With roots in ancient India, dry brushing was referred to as “gharshana” in Ayurvedic texts, which used raw silk gloves instead of a brush. The process has evolved quite a bit since then, honoring traditional practices with modern tools. The two main purposes of dry brushing are to stimulate and exfoliate. The brushing motion stimulates blood flow, while the brush’s bristles help to shed dead skin cells, leading to relaxation, improved circulation, and a smooth complexion. [1] X Research source"

Begin at the bottom of your soles, brushing the thin skin in small circles, and applying light pressure. The thinner the skin, the lighter the pressure you should apply. [3] X Research source"

There are about 600 lymph nodes in the average person, although every body is slightly different. You can press more firmly in these areas where the skin is bit thicker.

This will help soothe any potentially sensitive spots, while giving you with a hydrating glow. A scent-free lotion or oil would work best, as any added chemicals could irritate the skin. Aloe vera or shea butter-based body creams are particularly helpful in sealing in moisture and nutrients."

However, exfoliating too often (or too harshly) can irritate your skin, so start slow. There are two types of exfoliation: physical and chemical. Dry brushing is physical exfoliation since you’re literally scrubbing away the dead skin cells. It's a great option to unclog pores and fight dull skin. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source How often your exfoliate mainly depends on the kind of skin you have: If you have normal skin, you can begin by exfoliating 2-3 times a week and see how your skin reacts. If you have oily skin, exfoliating daily is likely to reap many benefits. If you have sensitive skin, try exfoliating once a week and continue if there is no irritation. If your skin is red or tender, exfoliating with a dry brush may not be for you."

      "content": "Cellulite reduction Some people believe that dry brushing can reduce the appearance of cellulite, although there’s no scientific basis for this. It’s more likely that the skin plumps up in response to the dry brush and fills in the “cottage cheese\" dimples created by cellulite. Although this doesn’t provide a long-term fix, dry brushing problem areas prior to an event could temporarily provide the desired tight-and-toned look.

Applying a dry brush to red, blotchy areas of the skin will only result in skin that's even more irritated, adding insult to injury. It’s important to remember that dry brushing should feel pleasurable, not painful. If it hurts, you shouldn’t continue dry brushing that part of your body.

      "content": "Start once a week and go from there. Some people can dry brush every day without the risk of irritating or damaging their skin, while others are not so lucky. As a general rule of thumb, you should start by dry brushing once a week and seeing how that goes. If you experience no adverse effects, like pain or inflamed skin, up your dry brushing routine to two times a week. You can continue from there if you start to really notice and enjoy the intended benefits. If you know your skin is sensitive but you still want to try your hand at dry brushing, don’t invest in a firm brush just yet. Instead, begin by using a washcloth and monitor how your skin reacts. It’s important not to overdo it. Dry brushing aggressively or too frequently can seriously damage your skin. [15] X Research source"

Let your brush soak for about 30 minutes. Rinse and repeat weekly. You may notice the bristles of your brush begin to soften over time, which is normal. [17] X Research source These tools typically have a lifespan of 6-12 months, and if the bristles are falling out, that’s a good sign that it’s time for a new brush. However, some of the more expensive dry brushes can last a lifetime if properly cared for."
