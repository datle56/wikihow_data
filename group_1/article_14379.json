      "content": "Outline and color your wing. To create a set, if your character is being viewed from the front rather than the side, simply mirror the drawing you've already done on the other side. And remember, when detailing/coloring, use your imagination!"

      "title": "Sketch the base line.",
      "content": "Sketch the base line. This is the base of your wing which will determine its length. In this example, we'll be drawing an eagle's wing. Make sure to lightly sketch the base with a pencil, as you'll want to erase it later. Birds with longer wings generally have longer arms and shorter hands, like wandering albatrosses or seagulls. Smaller birds have shorter arms and longer hands, like sparrows or hummingbirds."

      "title": "Draw the first layer of feathers.",
      "content": "Draw the first layer of feathers. Do this by sketching a general shape that vaguely follows the wing's base and then fill it in with feathers. Don't forget the skin flap between the forearm and the upper arm."

      "title": "Draw the second layer of feathers.",
      "content": "Draw the second layer of feathers. It's similar to drawing the first layer of feathers, but further out."

    {
      "title": "Draw the outer feathers on the wing.",
      "content": "Draw the outer feathers on the wing. This is a tricky step, because the line of feathers isn't consistent as in the other rows of feathers. You can make it easier for yourself to sketch out lines for the feathers before drawing them. Eagle wing feathers look like \"fingers\" but this doesn't apply to all birds, for example budgerigars."

      "content": "Finish! Clean up the sketch, erase the base, and use however you want! You can use these exact tips for drawing other kinds of wings too, like vultures, crows, parrots, doves, anything."
