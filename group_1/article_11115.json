      "title": "Make an appointment with your doctor.",
      "content": "Make an appointment with your doctor. During the first 2 weeks of pertussis you will likely think you have a cold or the flu. Therefore it can be hard to determine if you should see your doctor at this point. However, if you know for a fact that you've been in contact with someone else who has been diagnosed with pertussis, see a doctor immediately when symptoms begin. Otherwise the timing of a doctor's appointment will need to be based on how you feel. If the cough gets worse, and turns into coughing fits, that may be a good time to consider seeing your doctor."

    {
      "title": "Quarantine yourself.",
      "content": "Quarantine yourself. Pertussis is extremely contagious, and can be fatal to infants. To be safe, not just for yourself but for everyone around you, expose yourself to as few people as possible. This means you should stay home from work and school, you should not attend events outside of your home, you should not have friends over just for socializing, etc. If you have children at home, make sure you stay away from them as much as possible, and that they're washing their hands often."

    {
      "title": "Ask your doctor for an antibiotic.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor for an antibiotic. Pertussis is caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis . This bacteria can be spread from person to person via liquid droplets in the air caused by coughing or sneezing. People who have not been vaccinated, and infants, are more susceptible to the disease. In the case of infants the disease could be fatal. The bacteria is normally in your system for the first 3 weeks after you've been infected, and it is during this time that you can also be contagious. Your doctor may decide that an oral antibiotic may help prevent you from passing the disease onto someone else. It will also help clear up the infection faster."

      "title": "Consult your doctor about cough suppressants.",
      "content": "Consult your doctor about cough suppressants. In general, over-the-counter cough suppressants don't help the cough caused by pertussis, but there are alternatives your doctor may consider. Both corticosteroids and albuterol have been known to reduce coughing fits, but must be prescribed by a doctor."

      "title": "Make sure you're up-to-date with your vaccinations.",
      "content": "Make sure you're up-to-date with your vaccinations. Vaccines in and of themselves do not offer a cure, but they help your body build the proper immunities to very serious diseases. This then helps to prevent you from getting those diseases in the future. Whether you got vaccinations as a child or not, it is still important to stay up-to-date with vaccinations as an adult. Consult your doctor to determine which vaccinations you may require."

      "content": "Drink a lot of fluids. In general, adults should consume between 11 and 15 cups (2.7-3.7 litres) of liquid every day. This amount, however, includes the liquid (including water) that you receive from ALL sources, including food. The general guideline to ensure you're drinking enough liquids is to not allow yourself to stay thirsty, and to have a drink with every meal. Any type of liquid can be included in this daily consumption (i.e. soup, milk, tea, coffee, soda, juice, etc.).

      "title": "Take your required vitamins.",
      "content": "Take your required vitamins. Ideally you should try to consume 400-1000 mg of vitamin C, 20-30 mg of zinc, and 20,000 to 50,000 IU of beta carotene per day. You can sometimes obtain these amounts based on the foods you eat, but it is not always possible. To be sure you receive enough of these vitamins and minerals every day, you can take a multi-vitamin or individual vitamins. Multi-vitamins don't always contain enough of each type of vitamin and mineral your body requires. Make sure to check the ingredient label to ensure a multi-vitamin has enough of what you need. If not, purchase the individual vitamins you require. Always check with your doctor when taking vitamins and minerals, especially if you're on other medications, to ensure there are no side effects or interactions."

      "content": "Check with your doctor before using herbs. Some, but not all, herbs can interact with medications. If you are currently taking one or more medications, check with your doctor or pharmacist before using a herbal remedy. They will be able to provide you with advice on what herbs to avoid while you're taking that specific medication. There are no herbs that have been researched specifically for pertussis. But many herbs have been found to help strengthen the immune system and reduce coughing, which might be helpful if you have pertussis."

      "content": "Sip tea made with echinacea. Echinacea is used to help strengthen the immune system. You may be familiar with it as a supplement you can purchase at the drug store and take if you feel the onset of a cold. But you can also make tea using dried echinacea. Add 1 teaspoon of echinacea to 1 cup of boiling water and letting it steep for 5-10 minutes. Once steeped you can drink 2-4 cups of the tea per day. If using the supplement version, follow the instructions on the bottle."

If you don't like black liquorice or the associated liqueurs, then this is probably not an option you should try. Anise is considered an expectorant, which means it helps to get rid of mucus. Many over-the-counter cough medicines use anise in their formula. Add 1 teaspoon of anise to 1 cup of boiling water and allow to steep for 5-10 minutes. You can drink 2-4 mugs of anise tea per day to help your cough."

Do you know that feeling of complete relief you get when you have a nice hot shower while you have a cold, and for those few brief moments you can actually breathe? This method is similar, but adds some soothing ingredients to help alleviate your cough as well. Put boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let it cool down for about a minute. Add 3 drops of tea tree oil and 1-2 drops of eucalyptus oil and stir. Lean you face over the bowl, set yourself in a comfortable position, and just breathe! Put a towel over your head and around the bowl to help keep the vapours close to your face. You can do this for 5-10 minutes at a time, up to 2-3 times a day.

For this chest paste you'll need ½ cup of cold-pressed castor oil, 1-2 cloves of garlic (crushed), 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger, 3-4 drops of eucalyptus oil, and ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Add all the ingredients together in one bowl and mix thoroughly. Apply the finished mixture to your chest - ideally under an old t-shirt that you won't mind getting messy. Alternatively, you can just use castor oil without any other ingredients. Put the castor oil directly onto a soft cloth on your chest, and then put plastic wrap over top of the cloth. Then you can you place a heat source over the plastic wrap for 30-60 minutes. Castor oil is an anti-inflammatory, and, according to some research, an immune booster."
