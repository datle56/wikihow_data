      "content": "Keep your dirty laundry in hampers according to your preference. Buy hampers or baskets to keep piles separated as you use your items, or use one main hamper and separate your laundry right before you wash it. How you choose to store your unwashed laundry will likely depend on how much space you have and if you have to leave your home in order to do your laundry. Hampers come in various styles. Some have wheels or handles to make transportation easier; consider one of these if you will be moving yours around. Hampers are also made from different materials. Choose a cloth one that folds up to save on storage space. Plastic ones often have handles that make them easy to carry; while wicker ones are often kept stationary and are more decorative."
