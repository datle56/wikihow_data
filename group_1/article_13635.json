    {
      "title": "Research the agency.",
      "content": "Research the agency. Yes, it's flattering to get offered an interview, but you want to find out in advance if the agency would be a good fit for you. Look them up online or ask friends in the industry to share their experience or knowledge about the agency. Find out what kind of models they represent, their requirements, and what body types they look for. [1] X Research source For example, you might be hoping to get on with a fitness modeling agency that showcases activewear as opposed to a high fashion modeling agency that highlights designer fashion."

    {
      "title": "Create and print out a comp card.",
      "content": "Create and print out a comp card. A comp or composite card is essentially a model's business card. It should have several great photos of you with your contact information and modeling details. You can print this off to take to the interview or send it to them electronically. Either way, a comp card shows the agency that you're serious about modeling. Here's some of the information your comp card should include: [2] X Research source Height Weight Suit or dress size Waist measurement Bust measurement Eye and hair color"

    {
      "title": "Choose an outfit that's similar to what you wore in your portfolio.",
      "content": "Choose an outfit that's similar to what you wore in your portfolio. Some agencies might specify what to wear, but if you're not sure, go for a cool, casual look. You don't want to be too dressy, but you want to show off your body shape. [3] X Research source You might choose a fitted shirt with a simple pattern or a light sweater over skinny jeans. Wear stylish leather shoes or heels and keep accessories to a minimum. It's totally fine to mix vintage and designer pieces. You might reach for designer slacks and a vintage turtleneck, for instance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your makeup and hair simple.",
      "content": "Keep your makeup and hair simple. Showcase your natural beauty so the agency can see what you have to offer. Instead of covering up with bold colors and dramatic makeup, try to keep your hair and skin as natural as possible. It's fine to use a little foundation, but limit your makeup to mascara, light eye shadow, and a simple lip gloss. [4] X Research source Try to follow a great skincare routine in the weeks leading up to your interview to minimize blemishes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice modeling!",
      "content": "Practice modeling! You'll probably be asked to walk and pose a little bit at the interview so you should practice. Even if you can get it perfect, practice will at least make you more confident which can really help in the interview. If you're not sure where to begin, watch catwalk videos online and then practice in front of the mirror. [5] X Research source Don't have a lot of experience? Just be upfront when you interview and tell them that you don't have a lot of formal experience. Some agencies might even prefer this since they can train you themselves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run through a mock interview so you feel prepared.",
      "content": "Run through a mock interview so you feel prepared. Ask a friend or family member to do a practice interview. You can go over just the questions or the whole appointment depending on what's concerning you. For instance, they may go through the entire interview from the moment you walk in and introduce yourself to the end when you thank them for their time. [6] X Research source Give them a list of questions you want them to ask you. When you give your answers, practice making eye contact and try to appear confident. Your friend or family member should give you feedback when you're done."
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Tell me about yourself.\"",
      "content": "\"Tell me about yourself.\" This is one of the most common interview requests so you need to prep your response. Keep it short and sweet but do tell them where you're from, something that makes you unique, and what you're passionate about. [7] X Research source For instance, you could say, \"I'm from Kansas City, but I've lived here for the last 5 years. I speak Spanish and French which is helpful because I love to travel. I also love to kayak and do photography.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Why do you want to sign with our agency?\"",
      "content": "\"Why do you want to sign with our agency?\" Use your response to demonstrate that you've researched the agency. Prove that you really want to work for them and not just any modeling agency. [8] X Research source For example, say, \"I love how diverse your models are and I think I'd be a really good fit,\" or, \"I've always been impressed with your agency's reputation and I'd love to build a solid career.\" Researching also prevents you from giving a poor answer. For instance, don't say you like the agency's work in the fitness area of modeling if they've never worked in that line."
    },
    {
      "title": "\"How long have you been modeling?\"",
      "content": "\"How long have you been modeling?\" They might also ask what got you into modeling. Either way, use these questions as opportunities to tell them about yourselfâ€”you want them to see why you're a better model than all the other people they're interviewing. To answer, be honest and personable. For instance, you might say, \"Friends of mine were always photographing me and I thought I should try modeling. I've been doing this for the past few years.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Why do you want to be a model?\"",
      "content": "\"Why do you want to be a model?\" While it might be tempting to say you were inspired by a famous model, they may be more impressed if you show that you have a real understanding of the industry. Most people who are hired as models do it as a hobby or part-time job. Being open to all opportunities makes you more approachable and easy to work with. [9] X Research source You might say, \"I'd love to learn about the modeling industry and modeling would be a great opportunity to meet interesting people. If things work out, I think it could be a fantastic career.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "\"What sort of clothes or brands do you prefer to shoot or wear?\"",
      "content": "\"What sort of clothes or brands do you prefer to shoot or wear?\" There are lots of ways you can answer this. If you don't have any preferences, tell them you love variety and modeling new things. If you do have favorites, check the agency to see if they use those designers. Try to answer with brands or designers that the agency uses. Whatever you do, give unique but honest answers. [10] X Research source Depending on the agency, you might bring up something that they're known for. For instance, if the agency favors sustainable fashion, definitely bring that up. For instance, say, \"I'm really drawn to environmental fashion. I love that your agency is trying to highlight safe working conditions for clothing laborers.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "\"What's your greatest weakness as a model?\"",
      "content": "\"What's your greatest weakness as a model?\" Be honest, but choose something that's not a core modeling skill. When you bring up your weakness, mention something you're doing to correct it. This way they see that you're aware of an issue and taking steps to improve. [11] X Research source For example, you could say, \"My greatest weakness is my lack of modeling experience. I really need to build my portfolio, but I have been making calls to make this happen.\" You could also say, \"My biggest weakness is my critical nature. Sometimes, I get stuck on problems that I see in a photo that other people are fine with. I'm trying to be more open to other opinions and to go with the flow.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Are you working or currently in school?\"",
      "content": "\"Are you working or currently in school?\" They're trying to figure out if you'll be available for casting calls which are often last minute. Be honest and tell them if you have a job or you're in school, but don't make it sound like you're really busy. Play up the fact that your schedule is flexible and that you'll make time for modeling. [12] X Research source For example, say, \"I'm taking a few courses, but they're only a few days a week. I also have a part-time job, but my boss is great about adjusting my schedule,\" or, \"I'm not taking classes, but I do have a job. Fortunately, a lot of it is from home so I can set my own schedule.\""

    {
      "title": "Show up a few minutes early.",
      "content": "Show up a few minutes early. You might be really excited about the interview and want to get there with plenty of time to spare, but plan on showing up 2 to 3 minutes before your appointment. This is because modeling agencies are very busy places. They won't be able to see you early and you'll just be waiting in the lobby. If you do get there early, wait in a nearby cafe until your appointment. [13] X Research source Keep the address, telephone number, and the name of your contact person in your phone so you can get in touch with them if you have questions before the appointment."

      "title": "Relax and let your personality shine!",
      "content": "Relax and let your personality shine! The agency is looking for a model who's outgoing, confident, and friendly. After all, modeling is a business so they want someone who's easy to work with. Skip the drama and be kind to everyone you encounter during your interview. This is a good way to make a great impression. [14] X Expert Source Traci Halvorson Modeling Agent Expert Interview. 28 May 2021. They want to see that you're a real person so don't be afraid to laugh at your mistakes or be sincere in your interactions. Sure, some models have a cold, dramatic look, but you should smile throughout your interview. You want to look friendly and approachable."

    {
      "title": "Read any paperwork you get very carefully.",
      "content": "Read any paperwork you get very carefully. If the interviewer asks you to read the agency's contract, ask to take it home to read or read it thoroughly at the interview. It's really important to learn what the agency expects of you and what they're willing to offer in return. Only sign if you feel completely comfortable with the terms and conditions. [15] X Research source Don't understand something in the paperwork? It probably is a little confusing so don't be afraid to ask for clarification."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask the interviewer questions to show you're interested.",
      "content": "Ask the interviewer questions to show you're interested. It's common at the end of the interview for them to ask if you have any questions. Instead of saying \"no\" and wrapping things up, ask a thoughtful question that shows you've researched the agency. This lets them know you're serious about landing a job. For example, instead of asking, \"How much does each job pay?\" ask something like, \"How much crossover do your fashion models have with runway modeling?\""
