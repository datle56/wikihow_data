      "content": "Get the boil surgically removed. If you have chronic gum boils, or gum boils that are cosmetically embarrassing, you may want to consider getting them surgically removed. This can greatly increase the chance of the boil not returning again. You’ll need to speak with a gum specialist, such as a periodontist, about this option to see what they recommend. [2] X Research source Your dentist or gum specialist may recommend simply draining the boil instead of surgically removing it, depending on the location of the boil and how complicated it would be to remove it.

If this is the case for you, it may be important to get a deep cleaning from your dentist in order to remove any active bacteria from the inside of your mouth that could be contributing to the gum boil.

      "content": "Consider root canal therapy. [5] X Expert Source Pradeep Adatrow, DDS, MS Board Certified Dentist & Oral Surgeon Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Some gum boils are caused by dental abscesses. In these cases, root canal therapy would be required to remove the bacteria and decayed enamel from the area. Once the root canal is performed, a crown or filling is inserted and sealed to protect the tooth and the mouth from further infection. Root canals can be quite expensive and require multiple visits to perform, so make sure you look into the cost before you agree to the surgery."

This will help reduce swelling and dry up or draw out any infection that might be present in the gum boil. Fill half a tumbler or glass with lukewarm water and add half a teaspoon of standard table salt. Mix until the salt is dissolved. It doesn't matter if some remains in the bottom of the glass. Use the saltwater as you would your usual mouthwash, but be careful to keep a special emphasis on the infected site when you're rinsing. Do not swallow the saltwater. [7] X Research source Continue washing with the salt washes once or twice a day for a week to help heal the boil. This will reduce chances of it coming back. At the same time, be sure to maintain a good dental hygiene routine. This method is recommended by oral health professionals and is clinically proven to be effective, but is not a replacement for a visit to your dentist."

      "title": "Eat raw onions.",
      "content": "Eat raw onions. Consuming raw onions can be a very effective home remedy for treating gum boils. Onions contain relatively high levels of sulfur, which can help heat up and dry up existing boils in your mouth. This is a home remedy and may be less effective than other solutions that have been verified by medical professionals. If you don’t like the taste of raw onions, try eating them on other things — like in salads or on sandwiches where the flavor is masked. Don’t cook the onions as this can reduce the amount of sulfur present in the vegetable."

A good way to do this is to incorporate an antibacterial mouth rinse into your daily oral care regimen. Use it after flossing and before going to bed. When choosing your mouthwash, the brand doesn’t really matter.
