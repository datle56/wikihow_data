      "title": "Get some over-the-counter dramamine.",
      "content": "Get some over-the-counter dramamine. Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, but brand names vary) is an antihistamine drug that can be purchased at most grocery stores and pharmacies. These drugs block receptors in the brain associated with nausea and vomiting. You can purchase dramamine in two tablet forms â€” drowsy and non-drowsy. Non-drowsy is best for amusement parks. If you are taking a train or a plane long distance and can sleep, the drowsy kind will work well. [1] X Research source To prevent motion sickness, the first dose should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before you go to the amusement park. Adults and children older than age 12 can usually take dimenhydrinate every four to six hours as needed to prevent or treat motion sickness. Children under 12 can usually be given dimenhydrinate every six to eight hours or as needed to prevent or treat motion sickness, but talk to your child's doctor before using medications on young children.

      "title": "Sit in the most stable part of the ride.",
      "content": "Sit in the most stable part of the ride. Depending on the vehicle, this will change. Generally, the most stable part of a roller coaster is the middle. The back and front of the ride tend to whip around more than the middle. In cars, the most stable part is the front seat. On boats and planes, the most stable part is the middle again.

      "title": "Keep your head and neck straight.",
      "content": "Keep your head and neck straight. Since motion sickness is often caused by conflicting signals from various parts of your body, try to keep your head and neck straight at all times. By keeping your body in a straight line, you'll keep your head from bouncing around more. On roller coasters, this is especially important if you want to avoid head and neck injuries.

      "content": "Keep your eyes on a fixed point. You are more likely to get dizzy if your eyes are swirling around in front of you. Keep your eyes on a fixed point wherever you are. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source If you are on a roller coaster, it helps to stare at the car in front of you or simply to close your eyes. If you are on a boat, stare at the horizon. This will reduce sea-sickness. [10] X Research source Tal D, et al. Artificial Horizon Effects on Motion Sickness and Performance.

      "title": "Reduce your activity.",
      "content": "Reduce your activity. Simplicity is best for motion sickness. Obviously, this doesn't really apply to amusement park rides, where multitasking is nearly impossible. But on planes, trains, boats, or in cars, try to do less. Stop reading your book or watching a movie. Just sit back and relax to cure motion sickness.

      "title": "Apply pressure to your P6 point.",
      "content": "Apply pressure to your P6 point. The acupuncture point known as Pericardium 6 is said to relieve general nausea. It is on the inside of the wrist, a little more than an inch up the arm from the center of the wrist crease. [12] X Research source Many travel stores sell wristbands with built in buttons that apply pressure to this point. Scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of this method on motion sickness. [13] X Research source Stern RM, et al. Acupressure relieves the symptoms of motion sickness and reduces abnormal gastric activity. Alternative therapies in health and medicine. 2001 Jul-Aug;7(4):91-4. There is still some debate as to whether the pressure point or the act of pressing the point helps reduce nausea. [14] X Research source Miller KE, Muth ER. Efficacy of acupressure and acustimulation bands for the prevention of motion sickness. Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine. 2004 Mar;75(3):227-34. Either way, give it a try."
