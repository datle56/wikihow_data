Extend your feet out behind you so you’re on your toes, and position your head so you’re looking straight down. Push up with your arms to raise your body off the floor, then slowly lower yourself back down. Repeat as many times as desired. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Pushups work many muscles, including your upper arms, shoulders, and chest. Do a modified pushup by having your knees on the floor instead of your toes, or do a standing pushup against the wall. Arana says pushups are one of the “most effective” ways to work out your arms without weights: “[Pushups are] one of the most ‘big bang for your buck’ exercises you can do using just your body weight. You can also do variations of planks that work the upper arms. If you have access to a pull-up bar or parallel bars, you could do inverted rows or pull-ups, so you can use your own body weight as resistance.”"

Pull your shoulder blades together as you slowly begin to pull your weight up toward the bar. Pull with your entire upper body and clear the bar with your chin before slowly lowering yourself back down. [2] X Research source Pull-ups help strengthen many muscles in your upper body, including your arms. Arana says there are many exercise options for those who can’t do pull-ups: “The number one exercise you can do is a lat pulldown, which mimics the exact movement of the pull-up, but instead of pulling up, you’re pulling down. You’re using the same muscles. Then, do other pulling exercises such as rows.” Shuty recommends strengthening your abs to learn how to do pull-ups: “Pull ups, oftentimes, are as much about your abdominal strength as they are about your back and bicep strength. Get a pull-up bar that can be adjusted in height so that you [can] do a row or an inverted row. Set the rings up so they’re about 3 or 4 feet off the ground so you can straighten your arms and pull. Once you can do a set of 10 or 15 of those, start to put your feet up higher so that more of your body weight goes to your hands.”"
