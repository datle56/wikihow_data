      "content": "Discount each component by 50-75% depending on its quality. Used PC components do not fetch the same price tags as new components. Take the prices for each of your components and discount them based on how well they’ve held up. [3] X Research source Here are the variables to take into account: Age of each specific component: The older a part is, the deeper your discount should be. New computer components are coming out all the time, so your components are losing a lot of value over time. Rarity and demand of your component: Basically every PC enthusiast today would love to have a 4090 Founder’s Edition GPU, so if you’re selling one, congrats! Boost that estimate. Moving a 1080 card? Drop that price a bit. Condition of each component: Got a GPU with a busted fan from the time you hit it with too it with too much canned air? Your PSU have a bad SATA cable? Discount the item even further."

      "content": "Deeply discount the fans, PSU, and any HDDs. Your computer’s fans aren’t worth much to begin with most of the time and they experience a lot of wear and tear. As a result, they aren’t normally worth much used. The same goes for PSUs, which often need to be replaced in used computers if the new owner wants to make any upgrades (which is likely). [4] X Research source Hard disk drives are basically worthless when it comes to resale unless you’re selling an HDD with a lot of storage (at least 1 terabyte), and even then, they just don’t fetch a premium used. PC users vastly prefer SSDs for their speed, and HDDs fail with consistent regularity over time."

You still may not want to sell the PC as a single piece, but you’ll have a better sense of the overall value you want to shoot for by knowing your bottom line. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Piece the components out if your build is outdated or deficient somehow. If you’ve got a higher-end graphics card in a PC with an outdated CPU, only 8 GB of RAM, and an odd fan setup, you’re probably better off just listing your PC components separately to move them in a reasonable time frame. You may also want to piece your PC out if your build is especially outdated (i.e. you’re running an old version of Windows, or you can’t run modern games or programs). This is also the way to go if you plan on potentially reusing some of your components in a future build. Nobody will want to buy a full PC that’s missing 1-2 key pieces."
