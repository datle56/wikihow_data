Run your nectarine under tap water, and turn it around in your hands until the full surface has been rinsed. If there is there is any dirt or debris on your nectarine, make sure to wipe that off while you wash it. [1] X Research source You should also wash your hands prior to washing a nectarine."

      "content": "Make an incision around the pit. To cut a nectarine into neat slices to eat, you will want to make a series of incisions. Do not attempt to separate the nectarine. Just slice into it gently with a knife, leaving the fruit intact. You will separate the sections when you get done cutting your nectarine. To start, cut the nectarine in half around the pit. [2] X Research source Start your incision slicing the nectarine on the end where the stem is located. Move your knife inward until you feel it hit the pit. Allowing the pit to guide your knife, bend your knife around the nectarine. Make an incision circling the full nectarine that cuts around the pit."

      "content": "Cut several small sections in the nectarine. Hold your nectarine so the pit is facing upwards. On either side of the nectarine, make three small cuts. [3] X Research source Make the first cut about half an inch from the line wrapping around the center of the tangerine. Proceed to cut the sides of the tangerine into three even sections of about half an inch each."

Again, cut into the nectarine until you feel the pit. Then, use the pit to guide your knife around the nectarine. [4] X Research source"

The other should hold the bottom of the nectarine. [5] X Research source Twist the nectarine in your hands. It should begin to come apart. Pick apart the sections of the nectarine. You should be left with a nice pile of evenly sized pieces of nectarine."

If you would prefer to peel the nectarine first, doing so is simple. [9] X Research source Place the nectarine in a pot of boiling water. Leave it there for a minute. Remove the nectarine from the water. Place it in ice water. Once the nectarine is cool, you can easily remove the skin. It should slip off."

[11] X Research source A nectarine that is underripe will be hard to the touch. You will need to leave a nectarine that is hard out until it softens."
