      "title": "Climb a ladder next to your sagging gutter.",
      "content": "Climb a ladder next to your sagging gutter. Divide the height of the ladder you’re using by 4 and set the base that far away from the wall. Place your ladder so both of the feet are firmly planted on the ground and lean it against your home carefully. Climb your ladder and always maintain 3 points of contact. [1] X Research source For example, if your ladder is 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, you would calculate 12/4 = 3 feet (0.91 m) away from the side of your home. Wear a tool belt so you can have both hands free while you’re using your ladder. Ask someone to support the bottom of the ladder for you so it doesn’t slip or fall. Never stand on the top step of a ladder since you’re more likely to fall."

      "content": "Pry out the old gutter spike with a hammer if it’s still stuck inside. Look for the end of the gutter spike sticking out from the front side of your gutter. Place the claw of your hammer on the end of the spike and pull it straight out from the gutter. Rock the hammer back and forth to help work the spike out from the fascia board if it doesn’t pull out easily. Throw the spike away when you remove it. If the gutter spike has a screw head, then use a screwdriver instead of a hammer to remove it."

      "title": "Feed a threaded gutter spike through the hole in the front of your gutter.",
      "content": "Feed a threaded gutter spike through the hole in the front of your gutter. Look for a 7–8 in (18–20 cm) gutter spike or screw that has at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of threading on the end. Align the end of the threaded spike with the hole in the front of your gutter and push the end through by about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Don’t push the spike all the way through, or else you could bend or deform your gutters. You can get threaded gutter spikes from your local home improvement or hardware store. Avoid using gutter spikes that don’t have threading since they can easily pull out from your fascia board and cause the gutters to sag again."

      "title": "Slide the metal ferrule over the end of the new spike.",
      "content": "Slide the metal ferrule over the end of the new spike. The metal ferrule is a tube that helps support the shape of the gutter so it doesn’t bend or deform when you fasten it to your home. Place the ferrule inside the gutter and slide one end of it over the end of the threaded spike. Position the other end of the ferrule so it lines up with the hole on the back of your gutter so you can push the spike through it completely. [2] X Research source New gutter spikes come with metal ferrules, but you can also buy them at a hardware store if you don’t have them."

      "title": "Screw the gutter spike through the back hole in your gutter to secure it.",
      "content": "Screw the gutter spike through the back hole in your gutter to secure it. Use a regular screwdriver or a drill with a screwdriver bit to turn the spike clockwise from the front of the gutter. Make sure the spike holds the gutters tight against the fascia board so it doesn’t dip or sag. Be careful not to overtighten the spike, or else you could cause the gutter to crack from the pressure.

      "title": "Fill any gaps in the hole with wooden shims and epoxy.",
      "content": "Fill any gaps in the hole with wooden shims and epoxy. If the hole in the back of the gutter still feels loose, measure the size of the gap with a tape measure. Use a handsaw to cut a wood shim so it’s about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long and the same width as the gap. Cover the wood shim with a coat of clear epoxy before you push it into the gap. Tap the shim in with your hammer so it’s flush with the gutter and holds the spike firmly in place. If you don’t have wooden shims, you can also use golf tees or pieces of scrap wood instead."

      "title": "Climb your ladder so you can easily reach your gutters.",
      "content": "Climb your ladder so you can easily reach your gutters. Set your ladder on flat, solid ground so the base doesn't move around while you’re climbing it. Carefully lean the ladder against the side of your home so you’re within reach of the bracket that’s loose or broken. Maintain 3 points of contact on your ladder when you’re climbing it so you don’t fall down. [4] X Research source Have a helper hold the base of the ladder sturdy so it doesn’t slip or fall while you’re climbing it. Don’t stand on the top step of your ladder."

      "content": "Pull the top of the brackets free from the edge of your gutter. Grab the top lip of the bracket that clips over the front edge of the gutter. Pull the top of the bracket toward you until it snaps out of place and the gutter comes loose. Continue unclipping the brackets along the section of your gutter that’s sagging. [5] X Research source Some brackets may screw into the front of your gutter. Use a screwdriver to undo the screws before unclipping the brackets."

      "content": "Remove the section of gutter that’s sagging from your roof. Have a helper climb another ladder at the opposite end of the gutter section to help support it. Grab the front lip of your gutter and pull it straight up to take out the section that’s sagging. Guide the back edge of your gutter underneath the lip of your roof so you don’t bend or break it accidentally. Carefully climb down the ladder at the same time as your helper to lower the gutter down. [6] X Research source If you don’t feel comfortable or you have trouble removing the gutter yourself, call a professional service to replace the bracket for you."

      "title": "Unscrew the old bracket from where the gutter was sagging.",
      "content": "Unscrew the old bracket from where the gutter was sagging. The old bracket will usually have 2–3 screws attaching it to your fascia board. Use a screwdriver to rotate the screws counterclockwise to loosen them. Keep the screws in your pocket or set them aside where you won’t forget them since you can use them for installing your new bracket. Pull the bracket off of your home once you remove the screws. Continue removing any other brackets that are loose. [7] X Research source If the bracket was attached with nails originally, use the back of a claw hammer to pry them out of the wood."

Slide the screws through the holes on the replacement bracket and push them into the old holes. Turn the screws clockwise with a screwdriver to secure them to the fascia board until they’re held tightly in place. [8] X Research source You can buy gutter brackets from home improvement or hardware stores. If the screws feel loose in the old holes, then drill holes in your fascia board 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) to the left or right and install the brackets there instead."

First, position the back lip of the gutter so it goes underneath the lip of your roof. Push the front edge of the gutter straight down until you hear the tops of the brackets snap onto it. [9] X Research source Only push the gutter down as hard as you need to so you don’t damage or bend the brackets while you’re working."

Place the top of the ladder against the side of your home so you can reach your sagging gutters without having to lean to the side. Climb up the ladder slowly so you’re less likely to slip and fall.

Use a screwdriver or a drill to turn the screw counterclockwise so you can remove it. Pull the screw straight out from the hanger once it’s loose.
