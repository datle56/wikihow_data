      "content": "Look through your records online. Most cell phone companies allow you to access the same information online that you would get in along with any physical billing statement, but you must have an online account to see your records . [1] X Research source Register for an account on your cell phone provider's website if you have not already done so. You may have to create a unique username (some will allow you to use your telephone number or an email address) and password. The process may go faster if you have your account information at hand. After logging in, look for options such as anything labelled \"Call Details\" or \"Call Records.\" If such options are not available on the opening screen, you may need to look for headings that include words such as \"Usage.\" Understand, however, that certain proxies will only inform you of outgoing calls. If you need a full phone record--including the incoming calls for which many plans no longer charge--then your usage record may not do."

      "content": "Set up a \"trap\". If you are trying to identify who is responsible for the harassing robocalls or calls of a stalker but the caller's number only appears as \"unknown,\" they are actively blocking your caller ID. The actual number won't even show up on most phone records. In this case, contact the phone company and ask that \"trap\" be put on your phone. This will identify all numbers that call you and unblock your caller ID. The number will no longer appear on your phone records as \"unknown,\" and the people responsible can be identified."

If a person is making harassing phone calls or you suspect someone who shares your cell phone plan of making inappropriate calls, you should have a record on your cell phone bill. Frequently, the records you receive will be divided by the phone used to place or receive the calls. Less organized records will jumble them all together, but will still list the number of the sending and receiving phones."
