      "content": "“Delulu” can describe a person with unrealistic expectations. It’s not strange to see the word “delulu” used in a romantic/dating vein, often as a way to poke fun at people who believe they have a deep romantic connection with someone for a mundane reason. [1] X Research source According to Lizarraga, \"Being ‘delulu’ over another person in a romantic sense, means that someone is foolishly optimistic about a love interest, especially when the infatuation is clearly one sided. It is a play on the word delusional to poke fun at someone who is clearly aiming for someone out of their league.\" \"He totally ghosted me, but I’m going to remain delulu until he comes crawling back. “I came home after our first date and told my roommates that they were going to be my future spouse. I'm so delulu.” “He totally ghosted me, and yet I still think he's going to come crawling back and ask me to be his girlfriend. Delulu behavior!” “He literally told me that he cheated on all of his ex girlfriends, and I thought he'd be loyal to me. I was really in my peak delulu era!” “He asked her what the homework was last night, and now she thinks they’re dating. She’s so delulu…” “This is getting pretty delulu, dude. You triple-texted him a week ago and he left you on read…” “Whack me over the head if I ever start acting this delulu LOL”"

      "content": "“Delulu” often describes delusional fan behavior. You’ve probably seen it before: a fan who thinks they have a special connection with a celebrity for a nonsensical reason (like making eye contact during a concert), or someone who goes off the handle whenever someone criticizes their favorite star. The word “delulu” is a handy way to describe these unrealistic mindsets. [2] X Research source Lizarraga says, \"It's not uncommon for fans to trick themselves into thinking that their relationship to these public figures is more personal than it actually is. So to poke fun at this ‘fan behavior,’ the term mocks those who believe they have a closer relationship to these public figures than they actually do.\" “Call me delulu, but when Harry Styles blew a kiss into the crowd, I swear it was for me!” “I saw the most delulu comment on Taylor Swift’s Instagram yesterday…” “I swear, some K-Pop stans are so delulu… imagine harassing other people over a guy who doesn’t know you exist 😭” “That one celeb had to break up with his partner because his fans were too delulu 😓”"

      "content": "“Delulu” can also be a mentality of self-positivity and self-confidence. For some people, being “delulu” is a fun, cheeky way to believe in themselves, even if the odds aren’t necessarily in their favor. [3] X Research source The start of delulu being used as a positive affirmation can arguably be credited to TikTok user biancaxb08, who coined the now famous phrase “being delulu is the solulu” (being delusional is the solution). [4] X Research source Lizarrago explains, \"As high achievers with ambitious goals may seem 'delusional' at the beginning about where their life is headed, many persist in the vision and 'delusion' until their goals manifest. When a person refers to themselves as delulu, it describes their unwavering faith in themselves and their potential, but also signals a level of self-awareness that they may come across as overly ambitious.\" For example, “My goal in life is to be a singer, and I will remain delulu until I’m selling out arenas.”"

      "content": "Call out bizarre behavior with the word “delulu.” Chances are, you’ll stumble across your fair share of delulu behavior, both in your real life and your digital one. Feel free to text a friend if you witness someone being delulu, or leave a comment calling out delulu behavior. [5] X Research source “Stop being so delulu, bro. You know she’s married and has kids, right? 💀” “They’re delulu. They seriously need to touch some grass…” “Look at this tweet I found. Some people are seriously delulu it’s actually insane…” Note: It might be better to comment on/criticize “delulu” behavior in a private setting, rather than engaging with someone publicly."

      "content": "Embrace the “delulu” mentality to reach greater heights in your own life. Applying for a school that feels a little out of your league, or angling for that promotion? Channel some “delulu” energy as you dare to believe in yourself and what you’re capable of. [6] X Research source Being “delulu” and putting yourself out there more can open the door for new opportunities. It can also be a helpful way to silence your unproductive doubts and concerns. Embracing a more “delulu” attitude can make it easier to view your future through a more positive lens, along with other productive habits like practicing gratitude and saying positive affirmations ."

      "content": "“Delulu” was first used by a critical fan on a K-Pop forum in 2014. On April 6, 2014, a OneHallyu (a now-defunct K-Pop forum) user coined the term “delulu” to refer to K-Pop fans speculating on the relationship status of 2 K-Pop figures. From there, the word “delulu” spread to other corners of the internet and social media, like TikTok. [7] X Research source"
