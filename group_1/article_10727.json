      "content": "Measure to figure out the dimensions of your paint booth. Your project needs and the size of your garage will determine how big your booth needs to be. An 8-foot (2.43m) wide paint booth is suitable for garage or a large patio, for instance, and it will typically fit a full car inside it. However, an 8 by 4 feet (2.4 by 1.2 m) will be big enough for most other projects, which will be the example used below. A single-car garage is typically 9 to 10 feet (2.7 to 3.0 m) across, as an example, though they can be as big as 12 or 14 feet (3.7 or 4.3 m) across."

      "content": "Sketch out a frame to determine how much pipe you'll need. The frame will need vertical pipe in each corner, as well as vertical supports in the back wall and both side walls. It will also need horizontal pieces all around the top, as well as around the middle in the back and on the sides. [1] X Research source For instance, for the example project, you'll need 9 10 feet (3.0 m) sections of PVC pipe with a diameter of 1.25 inches (3.2 cm). This diameter is sturdy enough for most projects. PVC pipe is typically sold in sections that are 10 feet (3.0 m) long."

      "title": "Determine the lengths of pipe you need to make your booth.",
      "content": "Determine the lengths of pipe you need to make your booth. Divide the sides into 2 sections at the top for the extra support. Also, divide the middle pole across the top of the booth into 2 sections for the extra vertical support in the middle. Decide what you want the height of your booth to be, taking into account the height of your garage. Keep in mind, the poles for height will be divided into 2 sections as well. Mark on your sketch how long you want each section to be. The most important thing is that all the parallel pipes are equal across the booth. For the example design, the sections you need are as follows: 3 8-foot (2.43 m) sections 1 5-foot, 11 3 / 4 -inch (1.82 m) section 2 4-foot (1.22 m) sections 2 3-foot, 11 7 / 8 -inch (1.22) sections 6 3-foot (0.91 m) sections 2 2-foot, 7 3 / 4 -inch (0.806 m) sections 2 26 3 / 8 -inch (0.67 m) sections 2 20-inch (0.51 m) sections 8 2 1 / 2 -inch (6.35 cm) sections"

      "content": "Cut the pieces to length according to the marks you made. Secure the pipe in a small workbench with 2 planks on each side acting as a vise or with a table-mounted vise. Use a PVC saw or clamp-style pipe cutter to saw through the pipe by slicing right through the marks you made on the pipe. Slide the saw back and forth while applying light pressure downward to cut through it. [3] X Research source To clean up the ends of the pipe, rub them down with a sanding block. A simple hacksaw can also cut through PVC pipe. [4] X Research source"

You'll also need small sections to attach the T connectors to the elbows at the corners. Check the 3-foot (0.91 m) pipes and choose the ones that have most even ends. These will form the 4 posts at the corners that touch the floor. Lay out 2 more in the front on each side to form the top of these posts, then the 2 2-foot, 7 3 / 4 -inch (0.806 m) sections in the back for the top of these posts. The 3 8-foot (2.43 m) sections go along the top horizontally in front and back and along the middle of the wall in back, while the 5-foot, 11 3 / 4 -inch (1.82 m) section goes vertically in the middle On the sides, the 4-foot (1.22 m) sections form the middle horizontal poles, while the 26 3 / 8 -inch (0.67 m) will make the front half the horizontal section at the top and the 2 20-inch (0.51 m) will make the back part of this section."

Attach an elbow connector with this small piece of pipe. That will be the support for the front pole along the top. Do the same for the smaller 2-foot, 7 3 / 4 -inch (0.806 m) sections that will form the top of the poles in the back, except the elbow connector will extend along the back.

Tape the edge of the plastic around the corner pole with duct tape. [8] X Research source If you're having trouble with tape sticking properly, place the tape over the plastic and pole.

[10] X Research source Leave the opening between the 2 sheets in the front, except seal it a little at the top and bottom. When you get in the booth to paint, close this seam tightly with clamps.

Each time the filter is changed, either pull up the existing duct tape holding it in place or cut it out with a blade. If you're using a blade, be careful not to cut the plastic! It may be helpful to add the new filter with a different color duct tape each time so you know which tape to remove or cut without touching the wrong tape."
