      "content": "Determine the type of function you’re working with. The domain of the function is all of the x-values (horizontal axis) that will give you a valid y-value output. The function equation may be quadratic, a fraction, or contain roots. To calculate the domain of the function , you must first evaluate the terms within the equation. [2] X Research source A quadratic function has the form ax 2 + bx + c: f(x) = 2x 2 + 3x + 4 Examples of functions with fractions include: f(x) = ( 1 / x ), f(x) = (x + 1) / (x - 1) , etc. Functions with a root include: f(x) = √x, f(x) = √(x 2 + 1), f(x) = √-x, etc."

      "content": "Write the domain with proper notation. Writing the domain of a function involves the use of both brackets [,] and parentheses (,) . You use a bracket when the number is included in the domain and use a parenthesis when the domain does not include the number. The letter U indicates a union that connects parts of a domain that may be separated by a gap. [3] X Research source For example, a domain of [-2, 10) U (10, 2] includes -2 and 2, but does not include number 10. Always use parentheses if you are a using the infinity symbol, ∞. This is because infinity is a concept and not a number."

      "content": "Draw a graph of the quadratic equation . Quadratic equations make a parabolic graph that either points up or down. Given that the parabola will continue infinitely outward on the x-axis, the domain of most quadratic function is all real numbers. Stated another way, a quadratic equation encompasses all of the x-values on the number line, making its domain R (the symbol for all real numbers). [4] X Research source To get an idea of the function choose any x-value and plug it into the function. Solving the function with this x-value will output a y-value. These x- and y-values are a coordinate (x, y) of the graph of the function. Plot this coordinate and repeat the process with another x-value. Plotting a few values in this fashion should give you a general idea of shape of the quadratic function."

      "title": "Set the denominator equal to zero, if it’s a fraction.",
      "content": "Set the denominator equal to zero, if it’s a fraction. When working with a fraction, you can never divide by zero. By setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for x, you can calculate the values that will be excluded in the function. [5] X Research source For example: Identify the domain of the function f(x) = (x + 1) / (x - 1) . The denominator of this function is (x - 1). Set it equal to zero and solve for x: x – 1 = 0, x = 1. Write the domain: The domain of this function cannot include 1, but includes all real numbers except 1; therefore, the domain is (-∞, 1) U (1, ∞). (-∞, 1) U (1, ∞) can be read as the set of all real numbers excluding 1.The infinity symbol, ∞, represents all real numbers. In this case, all real numbers greater than 1 and less than one are included in the domain."

You cannot take the square root of a negative number; therefore, any x-value that leads to a negative number must be excluded from the domain of that function. [6] X Research source For example: Identify the domain of the function f(x) = √(x + 3). The terms within the radical are (x + 3). Set them greater than or equal to zero: (x + 3) ≥ 0. Solve for x: x ≥ -3. The domain of this function includes all real numbers greater than or equal to -3; therefore, the domain is [-3, ∞)."

The shape of a quadratic function on a graph is parabola pointing up or down. There are different methods to calculating the range of a function depending on the type you are working with. [7] X Research source The easiest way to identify the range of other functions, such as root and fraction functions, is to draw the graph of the function using a graphing calculator."

To find the x-coordinate use the equation x = -b/2a. This equation is a derivative of the basic quadratic function which represents the equation with a zero slope (at the vertex of the graph, the slope of the function is zero). [8] X Research source For example, find the range of 3x 2 + 6x -2. Calculate x-coordinate of vertex: x = -b/2a = -6/(2*3) = -1"

If the y-value is above the vertex, the parabola continues to +∞. If the y-value is below the vertex, the parabola continues to -∞. [10] X Research source Use the x-value -2: y = 3x 2 + 6x – 2 = y = 3(-2) 2 + 6(-2) – 2 = 12 -12 -2 = -2. This yields the coordinate (-2, -2). This coordinate tells you that the parabola continues above the vertex (-1, -5); therefore, the range encompasses all y-values above -5. The range of this function is [-5, ∞)"

      "title": "Graph the function.",
      "content": "Graph the function. Oftentimes, it is easiest to determine the range of a function by simply graphing it. Many root functions have a range of (-∞, 0] or [0, +∞) because the vertex of the sideways parabola is on the horizontal, x-axis. In this case, the function encompasses all of the positive y-values if the parabola goes up, or all of the negative y-values if the parabola goes down. Fraction functions will have asymptotes that define the range. [12] X Research source Some root functions will start above or below the x-axis. In this case, the range is determined by the point the root function starts. If the parabola starts at y = -4 and goes up, then the range is [-4, +∞). The easiest way to graph a function is to use a graphing program or a graphing calculator. If you do not have a graphing calculator, you can draw a rough sketch of a graph by plugging x-values into the function and getting the corresponding y-values. Plot these coordinates on the graph to get an idea of the shape of the graph."

They often have ranges such as (-∞, 6) U (6, ∞)."
