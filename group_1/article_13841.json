Go online and search for the kind of quiff you want, then show the person who cuts your hair so that they have a good idea of what you want. There are a lot of different quiffs out there, so it helps to know what you want ahead of time: Classic Quiff: Short on the sides and back, high in the front, this classic hairstyle has been famous since Elvis. Short Quiff: This short, clean cut has become popular with businessmen and executive types. It is short on the sides and tops with 1-2 inches of coiffed hair at most. The Pompadour: This is a big, wavy quiff, similar to James Dean or Johnny Cash's haircuts. Undercut: This modern cut is when you buzz the sides of your head almost completely, fading into light hair on top and a small, short quiff, like Adam Levine."

Pretty much anyone can carry off a quiff with the right products and tools, though it’s probably best to avoid this style if you have thin, very curly, or ferociously frizzy hair. Straighter hair is easier to manipulate into the quiff and requires less product to style."

Use a blow dryer to blow the quiff up and over, into shape. Finish your style with hairspray, pomade, or additional wax."

The best product for you will depend on your hair type: Sea salt spray gives a dry, matte hold which is good for soft, thick hair types. Wax gives a very firm, strong hold for difficult, unruly hair. Gel gives a lightweight yet firm hold which is good for fine hair. [1] X Research source Use mousse for lightweight hold that will give you a lot of volume.

Set your dryer to the highest temperature setting and the lowest speed – you can always increase the speed when you feel more confident. Using a vented brush, sweep the hair on the top part of your head (roughly 2cm above your temples) across to one side. At the same time follow the brush with your dryer. Direct the airflow through the vents in the brush and onto the hair, keeping the dryer approximately 3cm from the brush to avoid over-baking your hair. When your hair is 50% dry repeat the method on the other side, working in the opposite direction [3] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. . As you dry, use your fingers to work the hair upwards and backwards, from the roots to the tips, in the direction you want the quiff to go (right or left). You can also use a denman or vent brush. The type of brush you use will make a difference in the finished style. Use a Denman brush if you want more of a rockabilly style, or a round brush if you want the style to be more rounded at the top.

If you have wax, you can use it to give you quiff a classic shine reminiscent of the movie O Brother, Where art Thou? Take some strong-hold hairspray and give the quiff a good spritz all over — this will help to maintain the volume and structure. For a more tousled, contemporary look, use wax to gently break up the ends of your hair. Twist each section just a little to add some definition. Depending on the look you're going for, you can take a small amount of gel or wax and use it to either pull out or slick back the shorter hair at the sides of your head. [6] X Research source"

Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner in the shower — this will help to give your hair more texture and volume once dry. Blot your hair dry with a towel.

If you plan on leaving the rest of your hair down, slick back the sides with gel or pin them back with bobby pins.

Once the front section of your hair is separated and secured, use a soft brush to smooth the rest of your hair back into a low ponytail (around the occipital bone) and tie tightly with an elastic. At this point you can decide whether you want the ponytail to look sleek or wispy. If you want the wispy look, pull out some feathery pieces of hair from around your ears and temples. If you want a sleeker effect, use some firm-hold hairspray to slick back the hair at the sides of your head and beneath the ponytail. Don't spray the top of your head just yet."

Working from the back to the front, take small sections of hair and start backcombing , using a fine-toothed comb. This is the most important step in achieving a perfect quiff. To backcomb the hair, hold a section of hair at the ends and lift it straight into the air, above your head. Place the comb at the halfway point between your head and your hand and tease the hair downwards, towards the scalp.

Don't worry if your hair looks like a bird's nest at this point — this is how it's supposed to look! Take a soft-bristled brush and lightly brush the surface of the hair back towards the ponytail. Try to get the hair on the outside of the quiff nice and smooth, but leave the backcombed hair underneath as undisturbed as possible — you don't want to undo all of your hard work! Gather the ends of the backcombed hair at the crown of your head and twist them once. To get more height in your quiff, push this twisted piece of hair forwards. Use your hands to ensure that the quiff looks even at the front. If you left the rest of your hair down, secure the twisted end of the quiff with a couple of bobby pins. If you put your hair in a ponytail, secure the twisted end to the existing ponytail using a second hair tie."

Secure this section of hair with a small pin on the underside of the hair. Now take another section of hair from the left of the bobby pins and cross it over to the right. [8] X Research source If your hair is in a ponytail, take a small section of hair from the underside of the ponytail and wrap it around the hair ties until they are no longer visible. Secure the end of the hair with a bobby pin, underneath the ponytail. Take your strong-hold hairspray and give the quiff a good spritz. Use your hand to smooth back any flyaway hairs from around the hairline. Finish with a little shine spray, and your quiff is good to go!"
