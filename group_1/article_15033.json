      "title": "Make your fondant several days before you plan to serve it.",
      "content": "Make your fondant several days before you plan to serve it. Air-drying fondant is a reliable way to avoid overdrying, but it is time-consuming. Make your fondant far enough in advance so it can be dry by the time you're ready to serve the cake. Air-drying fondant can take up to 36 hours, depending on thickness. Make your fondant 3-5 days before you plan on serving your cake to allow for adequate drying time. Set aside more drying time for homemade fondant. Homemade fondant takes several days to fully harden but can be solid enough to build on within 24 hours. If you need quicker results, consider using store-bought fondant. Store-bought fondant is typically dry within 5-24 hours, depending on thickness and on the brand, as each brand has its own pros and cons. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Line a baking sheet or wire baking rack with a piece of wax paper. Dip a paper towel in shortening and apply a thin layer to the wax paper. This keeps your fondant from sticking to the paper. Avoid drying fondant on silicone mats or paper towels, as these surfaces can leave marks on your fondant."

      "title": "Place your fondant pieces in rows on the wax paper.",
      "content": "Place your fondant pieces in rows on the wax paper. Leave some space between each piece so they don't stick together. A good rule of thumb is to leave about a finger's width of space between each piece."

      "title": "Work in a cool, dry room.",
      "content": "Work in a cool, dry room. Too much humidity can slow down drying time and cause the fondant to sweat and to become sticky. If you live in a humid climate, use an air conditioner or dehumidifier to control the climate of the room you’re working in."

      "title": "Add CMC powder to your fondant.",
      "content": "Add CMC powder to your fondant. CMC, or Carboxymethyl cellulose powder (also known as Tylose powder), is a cellulose gum that thickens and strengthens fondant. It also helps it harden more quickly. Use approximately 1-2 teaspoons of CMC powder per 450 g (16 oz) of fondant. You can find CMC powder in the baking section of most craft stores. Most bakers add this powder to help their fondant to dry quicker and harder. This saves time and is usually a necessity when dealing with bigger projects."

      "title": "Use a drying rack and a fan.",
      "content": "Use a drying rack and a fan. Increasing air circulation is one of the best ways to decrease fondant drying time. Place your baking sheet or wire rack on a flat counter or baking rack with a fan a few feet away pointing at the fondant. Depending on how thick or wet the fondant is, drying time could take between 30 and 60 minutes. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry fondant with your oven light.",
      "content": "Dry fondant with your oven light. The light inside your oven radiates a small amount of heat. It's warm enough to dry fondant, but not so warm that the fondant will melt. Place your baking sheet or wire rack on the top rack of your oven with the light on. Leave the oven door open slightly for air circulation Larger pieces may need to dry for a few hours or possibly overnight, and smaller pieces may be done within an hour or two."

      "title": "Combine CMC powder with fan drying or oven light drying for faster results.",
      "content": "Combine CMC powder with fan drying or oven light drying for faster results. Combining drying methods will greatly decrease drying time, but be sure to check your fondant frequently to make sure it doesn’t dry out too quickly. Overdrying can cause cracks to form in your fondant. If cracks form, they can be smoothed out with a little bit of shortening. [3] X Research source"
