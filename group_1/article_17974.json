Pick up one corner of the cloth and bring it to the opposite end to form a triangle with 3 points. [1] X Research source If the diaper is rectangular, fold in a longer side so the diaper is more of a square before forming the triangle."

Situate the cloth diaper so the long flat edge is at the top with the 3 points on the left, bottom, and right. Set the baby down on the diaper so the long edge is up behind the baby’s back and the opposite point is between the baby's legs. [2] X Research source"

Take the point of the diaper that’s facing directly downwards and bring it up between the baby’s legs so it’s nice and snug. Keep this point held on the baby’s stomach using your hand.

      "content": "Bring the left and right points to the center and fasten them. Pull the left side to the center and hold it over the baby’s belly before pulling the right side to the center too. Use a safety pin to secure the cloth in place by pushing the pin through each layer of fabric, except the one touching the baby's legs. Cloth diaper clips work well too, as they have 3 attachments that simply clip right on to each section of the cloth. [4] X Research source When it's time to remove the pins, do so carefully so you don't accidentally poke the child."
