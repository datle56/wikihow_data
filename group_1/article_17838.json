      "content": "Whisper to him. It doesn't need to be anything eloquent; just leaning in and saying something for his ears only creates a sphere of intimacy and can help bring you out of routine conversations. It can be a simple \"I love you,\" a compliment, or a question you were going to ask him anyway, like, \"Want to go for a walk with me?\" You can even do this when there's no one else around - even better!"

I love you!\"), slip a hand-written card into his backpack or briefcase, or, if you're digitally inclined, post an e-card on his Facebook wall. Remember restraint is a key element in flirtation: rather than gushing on and on, try to express your feelings in just a few words or sentences. [5] X Research source"

He might get a kick out of the interest you show, and if no one else knows you're together, he gets the benefit of having a beautiful girl batting eyes at him in front of his pals. [6] X Research source Use your judgement, however: sometimes it's not appropriate for there to be onlookers, in which case you might be an unwelcome distraction.
