      "content": "Black, green, or white growth If the mold has been growing for a while, it may appear as black, green, or white spots. It’s rare to see visible mold spots, but if you do, it likely means mold has been growing under the carpet for a while. If your carpet has visible mold, it usually can’t be cleaned and must be replaced. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Mold or mildew may also make your carpet look dusty or fluffy like snow. If mold is present on the surface of your carpet, it’s probably growing beneath the carpet and/or the carpet padding, as well. This is why it’s important to replace moldy carpet so you can get to the root of the problem."

Discoloration is a result of a chemical reaction to the dampness of the carpet. If there is no other explanation for why the carpet is stained, you may have a mold problem.

      "content": "Steam clean small areas with water and detergent. In most cases, it won’t be possible to clean a carpet if there is a large area of mold growth, but it is sometimes possible to clean small areas. Use a detergent or rug cleaner to steam clean the carpet , making sure that it dries completely to prevent regrowth. Cleaning expert Susan Stocker says, after steam cleaning, “Be sure to spray baking soda to make sure all moisture stays gone!” If the detergent does not work, substitute it with a stronger cleaning agent, like an acidic mold remover. Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first. Wait 24 hours to make sure it doesn’t discolor or damage your carpet before cleaning the rest of it. [9] X Research source Do not use bleach while using these cleaning agents, as the combination could be harmful. Stocker says to get rid of mold, “Spray baking soda liberally over the affected areas in the evening and let it sit overnight (at least 8 hours). Vacuum it up in the morning, then spray the area generously with white vinegar and scrub it well with a tile brush or similar brush. Dry with a fan or hair dryer. Then, when it is dry, vacuum it up again.”"

      "content": "Fully replace carpets with visible mold or water damage. If mold is visible on your carpet, it’s likely growing underneath the carpet, too. Even if it isn’t yet visible, mold spores grow within 24 to 48 hours after a carpet has been water-damaged. If you haven’t thoroughly cleaned your carpet 24 hours after it was water damaged, there's a high probability that mold is already growing and it needs to be replaced entirely. If it's an area rug, roll it up and dispose of it. If it's wall-to-wall carpeting, consider hiring professionals to remove the carpet for you.

Carpets that are located in humid climates, below ground level, or in areas where there’s lots of water—like in a bathroom or basement—are more susceptible to growing mold. The best way to prevent mold from growing is to avoid carpeting these rooms. If you do have a carpet in one of these areas, try to keep it as dry as possible and frequently check it for signs of mold.
