      "title": "This rhyme may be about Bloody Mary and her prosecution of Protestants.",
      "content": "This rhyme may be about Bloody Mary and her prosecution of Protestants. Bloody Mary, or Queen Mary I of England, was a devout Catholic who tried to reverse the English Reformation begun by her father, King Henry VIII. Protestants named her “Bloody” Mary because of her cruel torture and murder of religious dissenters. In the nursery rhyme, her “garden” may refer to a graveyard full of Protestant martyrs, while “silver bells” refer to thumbscrews and “cockleshells” are believed to be a torture device attached to a man’s genitals. [2] X Research source “Pretty maids all in a row” could also allude to lines of victims waiting to be hanged or tortured. Mary, Mary, quite contrary How does your garden grow? With silver bells and cockleshells And pretty maids all in a row. [3] X Research source Before you ask, yes—this is the same Mary that inspired the urban legend and game, Bloody Mary ."

      "title": "“Three Blind Mice” might also represent Queen Mary I’s bloodlust.",
      "content": "“Three Blind Mice” might also represent Queen Mary I’s bloodlust. There’s speculation that Bloody Mary blinded and then executed 3 Protestant bishops (the “Oxford Martyrs”) in 1555. However, records indicate that these bishops were burned at the stake and not blinded, leading some to think the “blindness” is philosophical (they’re “blind” to the truth of God since they aren’t Catholic). [4] X Research source Out of all the rhymes on this list, this one’s origins may be the most mysterious. Three blind mice. Three blind mice. See how they run. See how they run. They all ran after the farmer’s wife, Who cut off their tails with a carving knife, Did you ever see such a sight in your life, As three blind mice?"

      "title": "This rhyme might allude to a decaying bride or a violent Viking invasion.",
      "content": "This rhyme might allude to a decaying bride or a violent Viking invasion. The original London Bridge was a narrow crossing over the Thames with 19 narrow arches that greatly impeded river traffic. The bridge was severely damaged and nearly destroyed by fires in 1633 and 1666. Even as the bridge was widened in later centuries, it had a reputation for needing constant repairs. A more sinister explanation is that the rhyme is about the destruction of the bridge in 1014 by the Viking Olaf II, although scholars debate whether this attack truly even happened. The “fair lady” may refer to Matilda of Scotland (1080–1118), who built many bridges, or Eleanor of Provence, who had custody of bridge revenues from 1269–1291. [5] X Research source The most well-known verse: London Bridge is falling down, Falling down, falling down. London Bridge is falling down, My fair lady. A Viking poem that may be related to the attack of 1014: London Bridge is broken down. Gold is won, and bright renown. Shields resounding, War-horns sounding, Hild is shouting in the din! Arrows singing, Mail-coats ringing, Odin makes our Olaf win! Bodies found in the foundations of the bridge also fueled theories that human sacrifices were used to keep the bridge standing."

      "title": "There are multiple sinister theories about the true meaning of this British rhyme.",
      "content": "There are multiple sinister theories about the true meaning of this British rhyme. What’s certain is that the “bells” throughout refer to the chimes of specific church bells in London, many of which survive to this day. [6] X Research source “Old Bailey” was a medieval courthouse without bells, indicating that the subject of the song may be in legal trouble for their debt (and perhaps leading to their execution by beheading). However, some theories suggest the final, gruesome lines refer to Henry VIII’s habit of executing his wives. These final lines aren’t always included in modern versions of the rhyme, hinting at their dark past. Oranges and lemons, Say the bells of St. Clement's. You owe me five farthings, Say the bells of St. Martin's. When will you pay me? Say the bells at Old Bailey. When I grow rich, Say the bells at Shoreditch. When will that be? Say the bells of Stepney. I do not know, Says the great bell at Bow. Here comes a candle to light you to bed, And here comes a chopper to chop off your head! Chip, chop, chip, chop, The last man is dead. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "A “rosie” might actually be a symptom of the bubonic plague.",
      "content": "A “rosie” might actually be a symptom of the bubonic plague. One popular theory claims “Ring Around the Rosie” (or “Ring a Ring o’ Roses”) is about the Great Plague of London in 1665, which killed 15% of Britain’s population. A “ring around the rosie” may be the foul-smelling rash that forms on your skin when you contract the plague. What could you use to cover up the smell? “A pocket full of posies,” according to scholars. The final line, ““atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down” could mean sneezing and dying (“falling down” dead). [8] X Research source Original text: Ring-a-ring-a-roses, A pocket full of posies, A-tishoo! A-tishoo! We all fall down. [9] X Research source More widely known text: Ring around the rosy, Pocket full of posy, Ashes! Ashes! We all fall down! [10] X Research source In this version, “Ashes! Ashes!” may refer to the burning of dead bodies infected with the plague. There are many versions and alterations of this rhyme that incorporate circular dancing and a fall or swoop at the end, maybe indicating a kind of courtship dance or curtsey/bow movement.

      "title": "This iconic nursery rhyme is actually about a medieval wool tax.",
      "content": "This iconic nursery rhyme is actually about a medieval wool tax. In the 1200s, King Edward I of England imposed a new tax law stating ⅓ of a sack of wool went to him, ⅓ went to the church, and the remaining ⅓ was left for the farmer. Some superstitions also claimed that black sheep were bad luck—possibly because their dark fur was unable to be dyed and was therefore less lucrative. [12] X Research source This might not be the darkest nursery rhyme of all time, but it sure shows that taxes are frustrating no matter what time you live in! Baa, baa, black sheep Have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. One for the master, And one for the dame, And one for the little boy Who lives down the lane. [13] X Research source In the original version of the rhyme above, no wool is left for the shepherd—it’s all given away."

      "title": "“Jack and Jill” might allude to the dangers of childbirth.",
      "content": "“Jack and Jill” might allude to the dangers of childbirth. One popular theory suggests that when Jill went into labor, Jack ran to “fetch a pail of water” to aid in the childbirth. He may have had an accident on the hill and died, after which Jill came “tumbling after” and may have died during or after birthing their child. Supposedly, the “hill” is in Kilmersdon, Somerset where Gilson is a common last name (“Gill” (the original spelling of Jill) plus “son”). [14] X Research source Jack and Jill Went up the hill To fetch a pail of water Jack fell down and broke his crown And Jill came tumbling after."

      "title": "“Humpty Dumpty” might actually be a cannon from the English Civil War.",
      "content": "“Humpty Dumpty” might actually be a cannon from the English Civil War. Supposedly, the Royalist faction mounted a cannon known as a “humpty dumpty” on a wall (perhaps St. Mary at the Walls or another wall during the Siege of Gloucester) to fire upon the Parliamentarians. When the Parliamentarians returned fire and damaged the wall, the cannon fell and was unable to be repaired and replaced by the Royalist army (“the King’s men”). [15] X Research source Most common lyrics: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the king’s horses and all the king’s men, Couldn’t put Humpty together again. Original lyrics: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. Four-score Men and Four-score more, Could not make Humpty Dumpty where he was before. Because the rhyme sounds like a riddle hinting at Humpty Dumpty’s identity, many assume he is a fragile egg. This was never clarified in any version of the rhyme, but the idea caught on and led to many classic illustrations showing an anthropomorphized egg sitting atop a wall."

      "title": "These lyrics refer to Catholic priests hiding from prosecution.",
      "content": "These lyrics refer to Catholic priests hiding from prosecution. We once again return to the religious tumult of 16th-century Britain. The “old man” likely refers to a priest hiding in a “priest hole,” or a secret location to speak their prayers in Latin and evade the persecution of King Henry VIII and his children. When these priests were discovered, they were punished by being thrown down the stairs—or worse. [16] X Research source Goosey goosey gander, Whither shall I wander? Upstairs and downstairs And in my lady's chamber. There I met an old man Who wouldn't say his prayers, So I took him by his left leg And threw him down the stairs. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Rock-a-bye Baby",
      "content": "Rock-a-bye Baby may describe the overthrowing of King James II. The (mostly) peaceful Glorious Revolution of 1688 saw James II’s daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange oust the King to prevent a Catholic dynasty from taking power. The baby in the rhyme is supposed to be King James II’s son, but it’s thought that it’s actually another man’s child (perhaps smuggled into the birthing room to guarantee a Catholic heir). The “cradle” may refer to the baby’s literal cradle or the royal House of Stuart, and being “on the tree top” indicates being next in the line of succession. However, the “Wind” may be Protestant forces gaining power in England, causing the “cradle” to fall (out of power). [18] X Research source Rock a bye baby, on the tree top, When the wind blows the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks the cradle will fall, And down will come baby, cradle and all. [19] X Research source The earliest written version also contains an eerie footnote saying “This may serve as a warning to the Proud and Ambitious, who climb so high that they generally fall at last.”"

      "title": "The lyrics here may actually describe the conditions of a women’s prison.",
      "content": "The lyrics here may actually describe the conditions of a women’s prison. It’s unknown what exactly this rhyme truly means, but one leading theory states that the mulberry bush in question stood at HMP Wakefield, a women’s prison in West Yorkshire. The female prisoners (and often their children) would walk around the tree for exercise. [20] X Research source Here we go round the mulberry bush, The mulberry bush, The mulberry bush. Here we go round the mulberry bush On a cold and frosty morning. Additional verses swap other activities (like washing your face or combing your hair) for going “round the mulberry bush” and end on “On a cold and frosty morning.” Fun fact: The original mulberry bush thought to inspire the rhyme died at Wakefield in 2017. However, plans to replant it were made after a tree grown from a cutting of the original was tracked down. [21] X Research source"

      "title": "The old man’s fate is a reminder not to go to bed after a head injury.",
      "content": "The old man’s fate is a reminder not to go to bed after a head injury. The lyrics “It’s raining, it’s pouring” could refer to the old man drinking too much alcohol and getting clumsy, causing him to hit his head (although some theories suggest literal rain caused him to slip). In either case, the old man suffered a head injury before or as he was getting into bed. “Couldn’t get up in the morning” implies that he was either very hungover or, more sinisterly, that his concussion killed him. [22] X Research source It’s raining, it’s pouring, The old man’s snoring. He got into bed And bumped his head And couldn’t get up in the morning. [23] X Research source"

      "title": "The old lady’s fate underscores the importance of asking for help.",
      "content": "The old lady’s fate underscores the importance of asking for help. When the old lady swallows a fly by mistake, she then swallows a spider to catch the fly, creating a bigger problem. The situation escalates as she swallows more and bigger animals to solve the issue until she bites off more than she can chew (literally) and dies when swallowing a horse. The moral of the story: sometimes, it’s better to ask for help than to make your problem worse by trying to tackle it alone. [24] X Research source There was an old lady who swallowed a fly I don’t know why she swallowed a fly. Perhaps she’ll die! … There was an old lady who swallowed a horse. She’s dead of course!

      "title": "This charming rhyme actually depicts the hardship of living in poverty.",
      "content": "This charming rhyme actually depicts the hardship of living in poverty. In 19th-century England, “popping” was slang for pawning off your belongings and “weasel” meant coat. In this interpretation, the rhyme shows working-class people struggling to make ends meet and selling their belongings to get by. [25] X Research source A similar interpretation says that a “weasel” is a fabric-weaving machine that makes a popping sound, also reflecting the lives of ordinary working people. [26] X Research source Half a pound of tuppenny rice, Half a pound of treacle. That's the way the money goes, Pop! Goes the weasel. Additional and less common verses describe other ways “the money goes” and end with the same “Pop! Goes the weasel” lyric."

      "title": "It turns out that Peter just might be a murderer.",
      "content": "It turns out that Peter just might be a murderer. Two theories exist that give “Peter, Peter” a dark meaning. The first suggests that Peter’s wife was unfaithful and the “pumpkin shell” is actually a chastity belt she was forced to wear. However, others say that Peter’s wife was a prostitute (he “couldn’t keep her”), and because he couldn’t handle it, he killed her and stored her remains in a pumpkin. [27] X Research source Peter, Peter pumpkin eater, Had a wife but couldn't keep her; He put her in a pumpkin shell And there he kept her well."

      "title": "“Rub-A-Dub-Dub” hints at some salacious and improper behavior.",
      "content": "“Rub-A-Dub-Dub” hints at some salacious and improper behavior. In the 14th century, a “tub” was a carnival attraction similar to a peep show where men could watch women do things like undress or (as you might've guessed) bathe. In the original version of this rhyme, the butcher, baker, and candlestick maker are watching “three maids in a tub” and are not in the tub themselves (this detail was changed later to cleanse the rhyme of its sordid meaning). [28] X Research source Most widely known version: Rub-a-dub-dub, Three men in a tub, And who do you think they be? The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, And all of them out to sea. Original version: Hey! rub-a-dub, ho! rub-a-dub, three maids in a tub, And who do you think were there? The butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker, And all of them gone to the fair."

      "title": "This familiar counting song may have sacrificial and racist origins.",
      "content": "This familiar counting song may have sacrificial and racist origins. Variations of this rhyme exist all over the world in various languages. It’s suspected that the nonsense words actually come from an ancient Celtic counting ritual used to select someone to die as a sacrifice (kind of like how children say the rhyme as a game and choose a player on “moe,” except more…gruesome). However, one dark fact is certain—prior to the 1950s in the US, a racist slur for African-Americans was used in place of “tiger.” [29] X Research source Eenie, meenie, miney, moe, Catch a tiger by the toe, If he hollers, let him go, Eenie, meenie, miney, moe."

      "title": "This seemingly uplifting tune might inspire an existential crisis.",
      "content": "This seemingly uplifting tune might inspire an existential crisis. On the surface, this nursery rhyme seems filled with optimism. “Row, row, row your boat” implies determination and focus, the stream (your life path) is gentle, and life seems to be full of merriment. [30] X Research source However, the last line (“Life is but a dream”) could imply that life is fleeting and your time on Earth is short—row and be merry now, because you never know when it could end. Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream."
