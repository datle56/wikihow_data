[2] X Research source Remember, Roblox folds up the net of patterns so it is essential that you arrange the designs in the correct position. Make your design look both great and unique. You can find inspiration on sites such as Pinterest if you need it. Some drawing apps have a materials library with clothing patterns and textures you can use. You can copy, paste and resize images into the boxes. Be accurate and careful. Do not spend little time on the design, as the result may either look ridiculous or not work. Save your design before exiting! Make sure your design is 585 pixels by 559 pixels. Any larger or smaller, even if the image has the same aspect ratio, and your template will not upload.
