Clean it thoroughly to help the adhesive cement stick better to your wall."

      "content": "Choose stucco or textured paint from a hardware or paint store. If you hope to cover up a lot of blemishes with the stucco finish, then you will need to buy a larger quantity of thick stucco paint. For a thick stucco coat, it will only cover approximately 25 square feet (2.3 square m) per gallon (3.8 l). Ask the paint associate what they recommend for your particular job specifications. They may be able to recommend the best options for your stucco needs and help to supply you with the tools needed to complete the job, since stucco requires more tools than traditional painting. When purchasing stucco paint for outdoor surfaces, you can choose fine, medium or coarse sand stucco. Consult the paint specialists about which option would be best for your building."

      "content": "If you want, mix the stucco yourself. Stucco is usually made out of Portland cement, sand, hydrated lime, and water. [5] X Research source Although some stucco recipes will differ, you can do pretty well by mixing up a simple ratio of 4:12:1 (cement to sand to lime), and then adding enough water, slowly, to get the stucco to the consistency of wet peanut butter. [6] X Research source If you want to, add some mortar color to the mixed stucco to approximate the color of the surrounding stucco. This will make it easier to color the newly-patched stucco and blend it in to the existing stucco, although you want still need to color the whole wall later on if the colors don't match seamlessly."

The following are common kinds of stucco finishes, each of you may want to try before deciding: Use only a roller to create a stippled effect. This is not the best option if you need to cover uneven or blemished walls. Use a trowel to spread on the stucco paint in a thick, uneven pattern. This is commonly used for outside walls. This is the best option if you are trying to cover up a heavily marred surface. [8] X Research source Use a sponge to create a square pattern. You can dip the sponge in the paint and apply it directly to a surface, then repeat in a geometrical or random pattern. Use a stiff brush or a comb to create \"draw\" onto the stucco or textured paint once it has been applied. You can draw waves, stripes, cross hatches or circles."

Give your stucco the best chance to adhere to your wall by prepping your surface first. Of course, how you prep your surface depends on what kind of wall you have: For concrete, brick, or block walls: Apply a coat of concrete bonding agent onto the wall. Allow it to dry completely before moving on to the next step. For wood walls: Nail roofing felt over the wall, also called \"building wraps\" or \"stucco wraps.\" Then, cover with 17-gauge metal netting, which comes in 150-foot (45 m) rolls. Nail the netting to the felt using galvanized roofing nails. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the scratch coat of stucco using a trowel and a hawk, if necessary. The scratch coat is the first layer of stucco, usually applied to a wire mesh lath, which is then scraped. These scrapes provide teeth for the next coat of stucco to hold onto. Whether you decide on a scratch coat depends largely on how much wall you want to stucco: Doing a whole wall probably requires a scratch coat, while intermittent patches probably don't. [11] X Research source Shoot for the scratch coat to be about 3/8-inch thick. Score the scratch coat horizontally with a Â½-inch notched trowel when the stucco is firm, but not yet dry. This scoring is what gives the scratch coat its distinctive name, and allows it to bite and hold the next layer of stucco properly."

Next, get your darbie true and plumb to an even point on the wall (use your drip-screen, perhaps), and then use the darbie to smooth out the surface of the brown coat. [12] X Research source Once your brown coat is true and plumb, wait 7 to 10 days for the coat to dry. Any cracks, shrinkage, or imperfections should manifest during this time, giving you the opportunity to correct them before applying the last coat of stucco."

      "content": "Apply the finish coat, texturing or \"floating\" the stucco as desired. [13] X Research source The finish coat of a stucco wall should be pretty thin, about 1/8-inch thickness. This is where you blend in the texture of the new stucco to the old stucco, if necessary, or create a whole new texture if you're starting from scratch. You have some options about how you want to apply the finish coat: Mix your finish coat with a little extra water to get it soupy. Then use a \"dash\" brush to spray or flick the watery finishing coat onto the brown coat. This is called a dash finish, \"Float\" the finish coat with a hard rubber float. Move the float in a circular motion, pressing hard against the stucco. Give the stucco finish a style of your choosing by using a sponge, a towel, a brush, etc., imbuing the coat with your own pattern."
