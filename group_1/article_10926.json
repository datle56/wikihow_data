Go through your hair with both clarifying shampoo and moisturizing shampoo , followed by a round of moisturizing conditioner . Once your hair is squeaky clean, use a moisturizing product like mousse or leave-in conditioner to nourish your hair. [1] X Research source Although it’s totally optional, some people like to do a pre-shampoo treatment with olive or coconut oil before washing their hair."

      "content": "Part your hair into 2 front sections and 1 larger back section. Grab the end of a rat-tail comb and split your hair vertically along your part. Using the same comb, part your hair again, guiding it in a horizontal line from one ear to the other. Clip up the front 2 sections of your hair so you can focus on the larger, back section of hair first. [2] X Research source If you have a widow’s peak along your hairline, it could be worth parting your hair slightly unevenly. That way, your widow’s peak looks a little more polished. It might help to stretch your natural hair before you start braiding."

      "content": "Cornrow the back section of your hair in horizontal lines. Starting along the very bottom of your neck, braid your hair in a horizontal line that’s parallel with your shoulders. Once you braid all the way across your neck, braid the hair into a curve and continue working your way to the other side of your head. Keep snaking this braid up along the back of your head until you’ve used up all the hair in the back section. [3] X Research source It helps to part the back portion of your hair into smaller sections before you start making your horizontal cornrows."

Slide the braid tail through the latch hook, using the hook to “thread” the tail through the base braid. Continue weaving this tail until it’s completely tucked in; this way, your horizontal braids are completely flat against your head. [4] X Research source"

Ideally, try to make about 15-18 braids along the front of your head that trail all the way to the back (already braided) portion of your hair.

[6] X Research source Make sure that you’re threading each braid tail into different sections of your hair; otherwise, you’ll create a disproportionately large lump of hair along the back of your head.

[14] X Research source If you’re crocheting with braid extensions, insert the crochet latch hook into your natural braid and slide the looped end of the braid extension down the base of the crochet latch hook.
