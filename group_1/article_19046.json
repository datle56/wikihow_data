You'll need to sweeten the pot, so ensure that you have a good selection and be prepared to part with multiple top-tier Pokémon to get it. Any of the Legendaries make for good trade stock. This includes Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. Also, if you have some of the event Legendaries, such as Lugia and Ho-oh, these will make your trade much easier. Mewtwo will most likely need to be traded in order for your Mew trade to happen. EV-train your trade stock . A group of Pokémon that have been expertly EV-trained will command a much better trade value than freshly-caught Pokémon. Invest some time to build up your team before you start the trade."
