You want these to be as strong as possible! {Note: the rings on the above pants are actually turned the wrong way... this is so you can see their placement. The rings should be horizontal and the webbing holding them on going down the leg.}"

For every strap you'll need 3 feet (0.91 m) 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) webbing, and 2 clasps. These can be found at fabric stores, hardware stores, camping supply and military surplus stores, and in many hardware sections of discount stores like Walmart. Loop the webbing around the loop on the clasp, and do the square/X stitch as above. Do this on both ends."
