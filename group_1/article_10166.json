      "title": "Identify controlling behaviors",
      "content": "Identify controlling behaviors . Some parents are demanding of their children, but this does not always mean that they are controlling. People who are controlling use certain tactics to control others. The tactics can be obvious or subtle. The behaviors can vary from outright criticisms to making veiled threats. Some signs your parent may be controlling include: [1] X Research source Isolating you from other family members and/or friends, such as by never allowing you to spend time with friends or other family members. Criticizing you constantly about trivial things, such as your appearance, your manners, or your choices. Threatening to hurt you or threatening to hurt him or herself, such as by saying, “I will kill myself if you don’t come home right now!” Giving conditional love and acceptance, such as saying, “I only love you when you keep your room clean.” Keeping score of your past mistakes, such as by listing off mistakes you made in the past as a way to make you feel bad or to get you to do something. Using guilt to get you to do things, such as by saying, “I spent 18 hours in labor to bring you into this world and you can’t even spend a few hours with me?” Spying on you or otherwise not respecting your privacy, such as by searching your room or reading the text messages on your phone when you leave the room."

      "title": "Accept responsibility for your actions.",
      "content": "Accept responsibility for your actions. Though your parent(s) may be controlling, you are responsible for how you respond to them. You decide whether to let them dictate your decisions, or stand up to them. You are also in control of whether you react respectfully or allow yourself to get overly angry and escalate the situation. [2] X Research source Some ways that you can begin to think about your actions are to look in the mirror and talk to yourself. Play out different scenarios that are likely to happen with your parents and practice responding the way you have decided that you will respond. This makes it easier to be in control when the time comes."

      "content": "Do not obsess about pleasing your parent(s). It is a parent’s job to make sure that you grow up into a happy, healthy, decent human being. It is your job to be a happy , healthy, and decent human being. If what makes you happy isn’t what your parent(s) envision for you, you have to please yourself , not them. It is your life to live.

      "title": "Make an objective action plan.",
      "content": "Make an objective action plan. It isn’t likely that you’ll be able to totally break away from a controlling situation in one swift move. You will need an action plan that is subtle and realistic to start making your own decisions. The plan could start with something as simple as telling yourself everyday that you are in control to start building your confidence . Ideally, it will move you slowly forward into making more and more decisions for yourself. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Accept that you cannot change your parent(s).",
      "content": "Accept that you cannot change your parent(s). Just as your parent(s) are not able to control how you think or feel, you cannot change the way that they think or feel. You can change how you respond to them, and sometimes this will change how they treat you. It is up to your parent(s) when and if they will change their personality. [5] X Research source To force your parents to change would be similar to the control that they are trying to assert over you. If you remind yourself of this, you will be forced to accept that they can make their own decisions about changing."

      "title": "Distance yourself physically from your parent(s).",
      "content": "Distance yourself physically from your parent(s). Most of the time, people use emotions to assert control over each other. This can take place in the form of anger, guilt, or withholding approval. If you want to break the grip of a controlling person (parent or otherwise), you may have to distance yourself from him or her, such as by spending less time together and calling less often. If you still live at home (especially if you are a minor), then building distance might be hard. However, you can set boundaries between you and your parent. Seek help from a school counselor or teacher."

      "title": "Try not to get defensive.",
      "content": "Try not to get defensive. Cutting down on the time you spend with your parent may cause him or her to get upset and lash out at you. If your parent complains that you are not spending enough time with him or her or accuses you of not loving him or her, then try not to get defensive. [6] X Research source Try saying something like, “I am sorry that you are upset. I understand how that might be upsetting.” Keep in mind that things may get worse with your parents before you start to see any improvement. However, it is important to maintain your distance and avoid being drawn in by threats. For example, if your mother threatens to kill herself if you do not come over, then tell her you are calling 911, hang up the phone, and follow through. Do not rush over to her house or give in to her demands."

      "title": "Cut financial ties with your parent(s).",
      "content": "Cut financial ties with your parent(s). Another form leverage often used to control a child is money. If you have the ability to make your own money, separate your finances from your parents. It might be difficult, but you need to pay your own bills, buy your own things, and budget for yourself. Not only will this make you more responsible, it will also lessen the grip of a controlling parent. [7] X Research source This can be hard for minors also, but not impossible to do in small steps. Even if you don’t pay your own rent and utilities, try to earn your own money for extra outings that you would like to do. This doesn’t mean your parents have to say yes, but having earned the money to go to the movies eliminates one more barrier that a controlling parent can use."

      "content": "Refrain from asking for favors from your parents. Asking a favor of your parent puts them in the position to bargain. If you want them to fulfill your need, you’ll have to do something in return. While this isn’t inherently bad, it can quickly lead to you giving up your decision making power to them. Ask friends or other family members if you need help. [8] X Research source"

Abuse may take many forms, so if you are unsure about whether or not you are being abused, then try talking to a school counselor. Some of the different types of abuse include: Physical abuse, which includes slapping, punching, restraining, burning, or injuring you in other ways. Emotional abuse, which includes name-calling, humiliation, blaming, and making unreasonable demands. Sexual abuse, which includes fondling or touching in inappropriate ways, sexual intercourse, and other sexual acts."

      "content": "Resolve the past . Holding grudges against your parent(s) or yourself is not a healthy way to repair a relationship. Therefore, it is helpful to forgive your parent(s) for any mistakes they made. You may also want to forgive yourself for how you reacted to those mistakes. Keep in mind that forgiveness is not about the other person. It is important for your own emotional well-being. By forgiving your parent, you are choosing to let go of the anger you feel towards him or her, but you are not saying that what your parent has said or done to you is okay. [9] X Research source To forgive someone, you will need to make a conscious choice to let go of the anger that you feel. One way to do this is by writing a letter to your parent that you do not send. In the letter, express your feelings honestly about what happened, why it angered you, and why you think that your parent did these things. [10] X Research source Then, close your letter by writing something to the effect of, “I am not okay with what happened, but I am choosing to release my anger about it. I forgive you.” You can also say this out loud to yourself."

      "content": "Confront your parent(s) respectfully. You need to tell your parent(s) how you feel and why you became distant in the first place. There is no way for them to work on a problem that they are unaware exists. Do not be accusatory or disrespectful. Tell them how you feel, not what they’ve done. Rather than saying “You took away my rights as a person,” a more constructive thing to say might be “I felt as though I had no right to be my own person.”"

      "content": "Set firm boundaries for both you and your parent(s). Once you begin to repair the relationship, you want to avoid backsliding into old habits. Decide ahead of time which decisions your parent(s) can weigh in on, and which ones they cannot. Also, boundaries should be set for which decisions you can weigh in on for your parent(s), or what things you can ask of them. [11] X Research source For example, you might decide that you might consult your parents about major career decisions, such as what college to attend or whether or not to take a job offer. However, you might leave them out of more personal decisions, such as who to date and whether or not to marry someone. You could also refuse to weigh in on certain issues that your parents bring up to you, such as love life issues. However, you might decide to offer your support if a parent is dealing with a major medical issue, such as cancer or heart problems."

You cannot expect your parent(s) to respect your space and boundaries if you cannot do the same for them. If you are having trouble with the boundaries set, discuss it openly with your parents and seek a resolution. [12] X Research source When a problem arises in your relationship with your parents, using team-building speech may be helpful. [13] X Research source Try saying something like, “I respect your boundaries, but I feel like you might not always respect mine. What can we do to ensure that both of our needs are being met?”"

      "content": "Address any infringements on your personal choices. If your parent(s) are violating your boundaries, you have to let them know. This does not mean you need to be angry or upset. Calmly and respectfully inform your parent(s) that they are crossing the line and ask that it stop. If they are serious about respecting you, they will give you your space. Using humorous language can also be an effective way to deal with controlling people. [14] X Research source For example, if your parent is constantly criticizing your career choice, then try making a joke about it by saying something like, “Note to self. Career does not please mother. Got it. Anything else?”"

      "content": "Take a break if problems continue. If things begin to go “right back to normal,” you may need to cut down on your time with your parents again. This does not have to mean cutting off all ties to your parent(s). It often just means that things have gotten too close for them (or you) to follow through with the boundaries that both sides agreed to. Spend a little more time apart, and try again later.

In some situations, the problems might be so severe that you will need to see a counselor with your parents to see any improvement. If you have tried to maintain boundaries and it is just not working, then talk to your parents about the possibility of seeing a therapist together. Try saying something like, “Our relationship is important to me, but I think we might need some help to have the best relationship possible. Would you be willing to see a therapist with me?”"
