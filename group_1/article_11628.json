      "content": "Turn your heat and defroster on high. Start your vehicle and crank the heat up. If your vehicle has a \"defrost\" setting on the temperature gauge, put it on as well. Keep your heat on full power so your windshield warms up and melts the ice. It takes about 15 minutes to completely defrost your windshield, so keep your heat running while you try another one of the strategies below to get rid of ice faster. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Turn your A/C on and shut off the recirculating setting to help draw moisture out of your vehicle and defog the windshield as well. While your vehicle is warming up, make sure no ice, snow, or other materials are blocking the vehicle's tailpipe to prevent the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning. Avoid leaving your vehicle unattended while it’s running so it’s not a target for thieves."

      "content": "Apply rubbing alcohol mixed with water. Combine 2 parts 70% rubbing alcohol with 1 part water in a spray bottle. Then, just spray the solution onto your windshield to deice your vehicle. Alcohol has a higher freezing point than water, so it helps melt the ice. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray your windshield with a saltwater solution.",
      "content": "Spray your windshield with a saltwater solution. Mix 1 tablespoon (19 g) of salt with 2 cups (470 ml) of warm water, and pour it into a spray bottle. Spray a thin layer over your icy windshield and let it sit for a few minutes. When the ice breaks apart and starts melting, use your windshield wipers to clean your windshield off. [3] X Research source Salt lowers the freezing point of water so it’s less likely to refreeze. Apply the saltwater sparingly to your windshield since too much salt exposure may cause damage to the glass or cause metal parts to corrode."

      "title": "Use an ice scraper to break apart the ice.",
      "content": "Use an ice scraper to break apart the ice. Brush off any excess snow on your windshield before using a scraper. Place the edge of the scraper against your windshield and use short, powerful strokes to remove the ice. Your windshield glass is harder than the plastic scraper, so you don’t have to worry about leaving behind any scratches. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a scraper, an old credit card works well in a pinch. Hold the middle of the credit card and scrape the ice with one of the edges. Product Recommendation: One top-rated scraper is the Mallory 532 Snow Brush that has a comfortable grip with a brush for removing snow and a plastic ice scraper on the other end."

      "content": "Use a commercial de-icer if the homemade solutions fail. Commercial deicers contain chemicals that help the ice melt faster off your windshield. The instructions may vary between different brands and products, so follow the directions listed on the package. [5] X Research source Most times, all you have to do is spray the deicer onto your windshield and let it sit for a few minutes so the ice has a chance to melt. Product Recommendation: Some of the best rated products to use include Prestone Windshield De-Icer because it comes with a scraper and Penray Windshield De-Icer because it’s safe on car paint."

When it’s time to drive, just take the cover or tarp off and stow it in your trunk. Product Recommendation: One of the top-rated covers is the AstroAI Windshield Cover . This product covers your windshield, front windows, and sideview mirrors so you don’t have to wait for your windshield to defrost. In a pinch, a large towel or blanket works well for covering your windshield. Just make sure to weigh down the corners to keep it from blowing away."

Even in cold temperatures, garages provide more insulation so your car will stay warmer. If you’re parking outside, try to point your windshield toward the direction of the sun. If you’re worried about ice forming overnight, park your car so it points east."

Apply the solution directly to your windshield before there’s a risk of snow or ice. [11] X Research source The acidity in the vinegar will help prevent ice from forming or sticking to your windshield. Or, try rubbing half a raw potato over your windshield . The sugars from the potato form a protective layer that keeps ice off of the glass. [12] X Research source"
