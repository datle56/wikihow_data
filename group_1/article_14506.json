      "title": "Sketch the outline of the eye using a pencil.",
      "content": "Sketch the outline of the eye using a pencil. Take your sharp pencil and draw an oval or seed shape that's as large as you want the eye to be. You'll need to draw a small half-circle that extends near the inner eye. This will be the tear duct. [1] X Research source If you can, try to draw from real life or have a reference photo handy to look at."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the outline of the iris and pupil.",
      "content": "Draw the outline of the iris and pupil. Lightly draw a circle that takes up about 1/2 of the eyeball to create the iris. The circle should be slightly hidden by the eyelid, which will give the eye a sense of depth. Then, draw a much smaller circle near the center of the eye to make the pupil. If you have a hard time drawing circles, you can use a compass or trace something round to make the circle. [2] X Research source The size of the pupil will depend on the lighting, so if you're drawing someone who's outside where there's lots of light, the pupil will be small. If you're drawing a woman's eye in low lighting, make the pupil larger. Press lightly so you can easily erase the pencil if you need to make corrections."

    {
      "title": "Use curved lines to create long eyelashes above and below the eye.",
      "content": "Use curved lines to create long eyelashes above and below the eye. Make a flicking motion with your wrist as you quickly make lots of small strokes along the upper eyelid. If the woman is wearing mascara, you can make the eyelashes thicker or darker. Leave a small gap below the bottom eyelid and the eyelashes. [3] X Research source Lower eyelashes usually aren't as full or as long as the upper eyelashes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a curved upper eyelid to give the eye depth.",
      "content": "Draw a curved upper eyelid to give the eye depth. You can make the curved lid as close or as far from the eyelash line as you like. Keep in mind that some women don't have noticeable curves along the upper eyelid, so you may want to position it close to the eyelash line. [4] X Research source There's no need to shade or fill in the upper eyelid at this point."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch a faint outline of the eyebrow.",
      "content": "Sketch a faint outline of the eyebrow. Lightly outline the general shape of the woman's eyebrow so it's along the brow bone. It may be thick or narrow, arched, wispy, or defined, for instance. You can fill it in once you've finished drawing the rest of the eye. [5] X Research source The brow bone is directly above the eye socket. The hairs at the fullest part of the eyebrow should be pointing up while the hairs at the middle of the brow should be drawn horizontally. Then, draw the hairs near the outer edge pointing down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline areas you'd like to leave light.",
      "content": "Outline areas you'd like to leave light. If the woman's eye is reflecting light from a window or lamp, lightly outline the shape that's reflected. For example, you might draw a small square near one side of the iris if light is being reflected from a window. [6] X Research source You can also make the highlighted shape a circle or oval."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch around the middle ring of the iris.",
      "content": "Sketch around the middle ring of the iris. The eye will probably have an iris that is darker around the pupil and the outer edge. Take your pencil and lightly sketch around the middle of the iris's ring so you can leave this lighter than the edges. [7] X Research source Don't sketch over the reflection you blocked off earlier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill in the pupil and darken the outline of the iris.",
      "content": "Fill in the pupil and darken the outline of the iris. Completely darken the pupil so it's black. Then, press firmly as you draw along the outline and around the reflection you blocked off. You may want to use a darker pencil or go over the outline several times to make it appear dark. [8] X Research source Remember not to draw or fill in the area of the iris that you're going to highlight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch spokes that radiate from the pupil across the highlighted part of the iris.",
      "content": "Sketch spokes that radiate from the pupil across the highlighted part of the iris. Now you can fill in the lighter portion of the iris that you blocked off. Use your pencil to draw lines coming from the pupil out towards the edge of the iris. Try to use shorter, darker strokes right next to the pupil to make the iris look realistic. [9] X Research source Leave a few bold strokes to make the iris appear defined. It shouldn't be a uniform smooth texture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an eraser or blending stump to lighten the iris.",
      "content": "Use an eraser or blending stump to lighten the iris. If you find that you made the iris too dark, use the eraser on your pencil or a paper blending stump and lightly smudge the excess graphite off of the paper. Keep erasing or blending until you've lightened the iris as much as you like. [10] X Research source If you're drawing a very dark iris, you may not need to go back and lighten any part of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Darken the upper eyelash line.",
      "content": "Darken the upper eyelash line. Create even more depth by drawing over the eyelash line where it meets the hairs. This is especially important if you want the eye to have eyeliner or heavy mascara. [11] X Research source If you want the eye to have eyeliner on the lower eyelash line, darken that line as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go back and fill in the eyebrow with lots of short hairs.",
      "content": "Go back and fill in the eyebrow with lots of short hairs. Instead of drawing rows of hairs that start in neat lines, make hairs that overlap each other. To make the eyebrow look natural, sketch the hairs closest to the inner eye so they're pointing straight up. As you fill in the middle of the eyebrow, draw the hairs so they're curving from right to left or left to right, depending on which eye you're drawing. When you reach the narrow end of the eyebrow, make the small hairs point down. [12] X Research source Keep adding hairs until you've filled in the brow and overlap them so they look natural."

    {
      "title": "Add light shading around the white of the eye.",
      "content": "Add light shading around the white of the eye. At this point, the white of the eye probably stands out. To make it look more realistic, use a blending stump that has a little graphite on it or take a pencil and lightly shade around the corners of the eye. You'll also need to blend a little where the white meets the iris. [13] X Research source You can also go back and shade or darken the tear duct near the inner corner of the eye."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shade the skin around the eye.",
      "content": "Shade the skin around the eye. Use a pencil or blending stump that has graphite to add depth to the skin under the eye. You'll also want to darken and blend the skin near the upper eyelid's crease. [14] X Research source If you want to highlight the browbone, erase lightly or smudge it with a clean blending stump."
