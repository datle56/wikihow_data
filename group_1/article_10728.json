      "content": "Cut open your brown paper shopping bag along one seam. Choose either side, rather than the bottom. Be sure you don’t cut both sides, only one. Remove the handles if it has any."

      "content": "Cut off the flaps formed by the bottom of the bag. Don’t cut more than 1 to 2 in (2 to 5 cm). You want one large sheet of paper."

Again, feel free to use tape to hold the fold in place. Then, remove the book from the paper. Measure the folds. They should be at least 1.6 in (4 cm) in length. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the paper up at the bottom crease and down at the top crease.",
      "content": "Fold the paper up at the bottom crease and down at the top crease. You should have a strip of paper big enough to cover the book from top to bottom. Try not to create new folds on top of preexisting folds in the paper. This will cause your book cover to tear more easily. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Stop if the cover fits snugly. If it seems a little loose or the top and bottom folds are not lying flat, you can use small pieces of tape to pull the front and the inside flap together a little more securely. Do not tape the paper cover to the actual cover of the book; the paper cover will move a little when the book opens, and you could damage the book cover. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Decorate your book cover, if you like.",
      "content": "Decorate your book cover, if you like. Remove the book and add stickers, drawings, or designs to the paper. You can add a name tag, or use fancy fonts or scripts to write the title of the book. You can make designs out of paper and attach them with rubber cement or double-sided tape. When you are finished, put the cover back on the book."
