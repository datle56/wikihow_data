      "content": "Cut the flower spike 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the healthiest node. After all of the flowers fall off your orchid, find a node on the orchid’s stem. The node looks like a small green bulge and the healthiest node is typically the one closest to the last blooming flower. [2] X Research source Then, grab a pair of clean, sharp gardening shears or scissors and snip off the stalk 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the node. [3] X Research source Sterilize your gardening shears or scissors by wiping them with rubbing alcohol. This kills any potentially harmful bacteria. [4] X Research source If all of the nodes look brown and unhealthy, cut the stalk to the base of the plant just above a node. Most orchid varieties enter a period of dormancy after they bloom and drop their flowers. They have to rest because they use up so much energy blooming. [5] X Research source New flower spikes usually grow from the orchid’s nodes. Cutting away dead or unhealthy parts of the stalk helps prepare the plant to rebloom by concentrating its nutrients in the healthiest node."

Monique Capanelli, another plant specialist, agrees and recommends placing orchids on an “Eastern facing windowsill.” [8] X Expert Source Monique Capanelli Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 22 September 2020. Monitor your orchid's leaves to ensure it’s getting enough sunlight. Dark green leaves typically indicate an orchid isn't getting enough light while lighter, grass-colored leaves indicate that your orchid is getting enough light."

When you water your orchid, plant specialist Rachel Guffey recommends “taking it to the sink and flushing the pot with water, allowing all of the roots a few seconds to rinse down. Avoid getting water in the crooks of the green leaves.” [11] X Expert Source Rachel Guffey Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 5 August 2021. Ensure your orchid gets a lot of humidity, too.

Or, set it outside at night. If temperatures drop below 50°F (10°C), move the orchid back indoors or to its warm spot. Note : Some orchid species have different temperature needs. Check out your orchid’s temperature needs using this list from the BBC’s Gardeners’ World Magazine or search for your orchid variety online. Note : It can take several months for your orchid to grow a new leaf. Many orchid varieties stay in their dormant period for 6 to 9 months.

Plant specialist Harmony Corelitz explains that orchids “are epiphytic,” which means their “roots need a lot of aeration and drainage.” You don’t plant orchids in regular potting soil because it can “cause [their] aerial roots to rot” and damage the plant.
