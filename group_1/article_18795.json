Beyond that, monounsaturated fat is proven to aid heart health and weight management and lower bad cholesterol levels in your blood. Monounsaturated fats can be found in foods and oils such as: [1] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Avocados Peanut butter Some nuts and seeds Olive oil Canola oil Peanut oil Sesame oil Safflower oil"

Foods and oils with polyunsaturated fat include: [2] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Fatty fish Some nuts and seeds Tofu and soybeans Canola, corn, soybean, and sunflower oil There are two categories of polyunsaturated fat: Omega-6s and Omega-3s.

      "content": "Saturated fat Saturated fat is fat molecules that have been “saturated” with hydrogen bonds. Saturated fat is somewhat controversial; overconsuming it was linked with heart disease, but some studies in recent years have suggested this may not be the case (though American health organizations still recommend limiting saturated fats in your diet). So, in terms of the keto diet, eating saturated fats in moderation is the key. This includes: [3] X Research source Cheese Milk and butter Dairy desserts Meats"

      "content": "Eat plenty of whole eggs. Eggs are nutritious and contain healthy fats, so they’re ideal for a Keto diet! Just aim to eat the whole egg (rather than just part) since the yolks contain vitamin B and antioxidants that aid eye health. According to the USDA, one egg contains roughly 5 grams of fat, 7 grams of protein, and 80 calories.

Salmon also contains vitamin D, which is great for your immune system and bone health. [5] X Research source When you opt for fatty meats (like ribeye, pork belly, and lamb chops), opt for fresh and grass-fed rather than processed meat. How to use fish and meats: Bake or grill your fish , then serve it with roasted veggies or a salad Add canned fish to mayonnaise, herbs, and spices to use as a dip, or add to a lettuce wrap Fatty meats can be a main course; just remember to eat them in moderation."

Fat bombs are basically tasty little balls made from a high-fat base, a binding agent, other ingredients (like cacao nibs or nuts) for flavor, and natural or zero-calorie sweeteners (like monk fruit or Stevia). They can be an excellent dessert substitute while on the keto diet, and they’re super customizable—so you can make them according to your personal tastes.

      "title": "Trans fat",
      "content": "Trans fat Trans fat is notoriously unhealthy, and consuming it has been linked to numerous health conditions, including heart disease and cancer. Trans fats often come from hydrogenation—the process of turning oils into solids to stop them from going bad. Manufacturers used to add trans fats to processed foods before the FDA banned the practice in 2018. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Artificial trans fats have been banned, but you may still find small amounts in certain processed foods. It’s also important to avoid processed meats like deli meat, sausages, salami, hot dogs, and cured and smoked meats. Even though they’re technically keto-friendly, minimally processed meat is healthier. Finally, avoid fried foods. Highly refined oil (like corn oil) used to make deep-fried food sometimes contains trans fat—-and trans fat can be produced when the oil is heated to high temperatures."

      "title": "Fat provides energy in place of carbs in the keto diet.",
      "content": "Fat provides energy in place of carbs in the keto diet. According to nutritionist Lyssandra Guerra, the keto diet “will allow your body to burn more energy from fat than as opposed to glucose, which is sugar”---namely, sugar in fruits, starchy vegetables, and grains. “Eating a ketogenic diet high in healthy fats…will create ketones in the body that will help you burn energy and calories and weight.” Essentially, the keto diet keeps your carbs low, thus keeping your blood sugar and insulin levels low. This tells your liver to start burning fat and making ketones."

      "title": "Without enough fat, you’ll feel hungrier throughout the day.",
      "content": "Without enough fat, you’ll feel hungrier throughout the day. Since fats replace carbs and glucose on the keto diet, they’re what help you feel full—which in turn lets you regulate what you eat and maintain a nutritious diet. When you don’t eat enough fats, you won’t feel full, and that’ll make you more likely to snack or eat foods you should be avoiding while on the keto diet. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As Guerra explains, “Eating a ketogenic diet that's high in healthy fats, such as avocados, olive oil, almonds, that's going to create ketones in the body that will burn energy, calories, and weight, and that's why most people decide to choose to do a ketogenic diet.” Your body still needs to produce energy, and for that, it needs food. If healthy fats represent the majority of your diet while on keto, you need to give your body enough for it to keep making energy!"

      "title": "You should get roughly 60-70% of calories from fat on the keto diet.",
      "content": "You should get roughly 60-70% of calories from fat on the keto diet. On the keto diet, you get energy from fat rather than carbs, so you need lots of it. The keto diet consists of 60-70% calories from fat, 25-30% calories from protein, and 5-10% calories from carbohydrates. If you’re worried about numbers, try planning out your meals to ensure you stick to those guidelines. [16] X Research source Because of how much fat you eat on the keto diet (as opposed to carbohydrates and sugar), Guerra says it can “help people break away from sugar cravings, or even carbohydrate cravings like grains, breads, crackers, and starchy vegetables.”"

      "title": "Keto can be a healthy temporary diet choice for some people.",
      "content": "Keto can be a healthy temporary diet choice for some people. It’s not for everyone, but studies have shown that the low-carb keto diet can help people with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or obesity because it’s associated with weight loss, as well as improvements in glucose levels, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Nonetheless, there are some considerations. The keto diet can lead to an increase in cholesterol, so it’s important to lower your cholesterol while on keto if that’s an issue for you. The diet puts people with type 1 diabetes at risk of ketoacidosis, which is why it’s not recommended for them to go on keto. Keto may cause short-term fatigue, nausea, and dizziness to people just starting the diet, although those symptoms usually resolve on their own. It’s recommended for people on keto to use the diet for 6 to 12 months at most. Longer-term use of the keto diet can lead to symptoms like fatty liver disease, low protein levels, kidney stones, and vitamin deficiencies."

Unsaturated fats like oily fish, avocado, nuts, and seeds are the way to go, so make sure you’re working them into your meals and snacks as much as possible. On the keto diet, you need roughly 60-70% of the calories you consume to come from fat; planning will help you put together nutritious (and low-carb, high-fat) dishes to eat. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also eat fatty foods like whole eggs, coconut, olives, and even cacao nibs! To get more fat in your diet, you do creative things like cook foods in butter or olive oil or spike your drinks and smoothies with healthy oils or seeds. Just keep in mind that there isn’t as much evidence on the long-term effects of keto, so it’s best to follow the diet for 6-12 months before transitioning off it."
