      "content": "One of the legs might be a little shorter than the others. On some wobbly chairs, 3 legs are actually longer than 1 of the others, which causes your chair to rock back and forth. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Your chair joints could be overworked. Unlike other pieces of furniture, chairs are designed to hold a lot of weight. After weeks, months, and years of being used, your chair’s joints might be looking a little worse for wear. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Temperature, humidity, and longevity can play a part.",
      "content": "Temperature, humidity, and longevity can play a part. As temperature and humidity change around your home, your wooden chair starts to expand and screws may loosen. Plus, wood glue tends to wear down over time, which causes problems. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Parts might be broken or missing. On swivel-style seats, like office or gaming chairs, there might be an issue with the seat’s hardware, like a busted wheel, missing screw, or damaged seat plate. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Install a furniture tack.",
      "content": "Install a furniture tack. Furniture tacks add a tiny bit of height to 1 of your chair legs and can help balance things out. Measure the bottom of the shortest leg to see how far it is from the floor. Then, hammer a furniture tack into the bottom of the chair leg. For reference, furniture tacks come in small sizes, like 1 ⁄ 8 to 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32 to 0.64 cm) thick. [5] X Research source For example, if your chair leg is 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) off the floor, you’d hammer a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) furniture tack into the bottom. You can find furniture tacks online or at your local home improvement store. You could also sand down the legs that are longer, if that's easier.

[7] X Research source This is a good fix if your chair’s joints are loose. For reference, label the chair legs and bottom with masking tape, so you remember which chair legs go where.

      "content": "Chisel away any old glue and sand down the open joints. Inspect the 4 circular, open wood joints along the bottom of your chair seat. Grab a chisel and work away any dried pieces of glue from these joints. Then, sand away any old glue residue with a small piece of 120-grit sandpaper. Lightly sand the exposed ends of your chair legs as well, so there isn’t any leftover paint or glue stuck to them. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Reinstall the chair legs and weigh down the seat. Center the chair legs over the open joints on the chair seat. Then, grab a rubber mallet and hammer each leg into its respective joint several times. [11] X Research source Flip your chair back to an upright position and place a heavy item on top of the seat, so the glue dries properly. Leave this weight on your chair until the wood glue is completely dried and cured. [12] X Research source You could use a heavy toolbox as a weight."

Then, push and remove the cushion off the top of the seat. [13] X Research source These screws might be along the bottom sides or corners of the seat. Temperature and humidity might make your upholstered chair wobbly over time. [14] X Research source"

At this point, you should see 2 wooden dowels connecting the central seat to each back chair leg. [15] X Research source If you don’t have a rubber mallet, tie a thin, soft piece of wood to the side of your back chair legs. Then, tap along the wood with a traditional hammer."

Apply the glue all around these dowels, if you can. [16] X Research source You can buy a glue dispenser online, or from specialty stores."

[17] X Research source Then, arrange a clamp vertically over the frame of the seat and tighten it. Leave this clamp on the chair for 30 minutes before taking it off. Let your chair dry and cure for several days before reinstalling the screws and upholstery. [18] X Research source When you start tapping the chair legs, excess wood glue may start dripping. If that happens, wipe off the glue as soon as possible with a damp cloth."

      "content": "Check the chair legs for any missing screws. If your chair just started wobbling, there’s a chance that a screw popped out and landed on the floor nearby. If you can’t find the missing screw, buy a replacement screw from your local hardware store. [20] X Research source When you head to the store, remove an extra screw from your chair to use as a reference. Then, reinstall both screws after purchasing a replacement."

      "content": "Tighten the seat plate. Along the bottom of the actual seat, look for a metal plate—this should be attached to the chair with bolts and screws, and also be connected to the hydraulic lift and adjustment lever. Tighten any loose screws or bolts as you notice them, and replace any missing parts. [21] X Research source If the plate looks damaged or defective, order a new one from the chair manufacturer using your chair’s make and model number."
