If the shape that you want to find the perimeter of is not a closed shape, the perimeter cannot be taken.

      "content": "Find the length of one side of your rectangle. You can do this with a ruler, measuring tape, or by making up your own example. Write down this number by the side it represents so you don't forget its length. As a guided example, imagine that the length of one side of your rectangle is 3 feet. [3] X Research source For small shapes you may want to use centimeters or inches, while feet, meters or miles will work better for larger perimeters. Since the opposite sides of rectangles are equal, you will only have to measure one of each set of opposing sides. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 January 2021. So, for the guided example, you would add 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 to get a perimeter of 16 feet (4.9 m). [6] X Research source You can also use the formula 2(length + width) for rectangles, since the length and width values are doubled. In our example you would multiply 2 by 8 to get 16 feet (4.9 m)."

In real life examples, you can measure the outside boundary of any closed geometric shape to find its perimeter measurement. But you can also use the following formulas to find the perimeters of other common shapes: [7] X Research source Square: length of any side x 4 Triangle: side 1 + side 2 + side 3 Irregular polygon: add all sides Circle: 2 x π x radius OR π x diameter. [8] X Research source The π symbol stands for Pi (pronounced like pie). If you have a π key on your calculator, you can use it to be more accurate when using this formula. If not, you can approximate the value of π as 3.14. [9] X Research source The term \"radius\" refers to the distance between the center of a circle and its outside boundary (perimeter), while \"diameter\" refers to the length between any two opposite points on the perimeter of a circle that pass through the circle's center.

Some mathematicians use the notation: A=½bh. Circle: π x radius² The term \"radius\" refers to the distance between the center of a circle and its outside boundary (perimeter), and the raised two (referred to as the \"squared\" notation) indicates that the value being squared must be multiplied by itself.
