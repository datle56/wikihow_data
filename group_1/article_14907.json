      "content": "Choose Schnapps flavors that complement the time of year or the occasion. While you can enjoy any flavor of Schnapps at any given time, certain flavors may work better in different settings. For example, peppermint might be the perfect flavor for winter drinks. Enjoy the sweet flavors from peach Schnapps during the spring and summer months. During the autumn months, consider trying Schnapps flavors like butterscotch, or ones that are heavily infused with herbs or other spices."

      "content": "Drink a neat, unchilled shot of Schnapps after a heavy meal. In Germany, it is custom to throw back a warm shot of Schnapps to help the stomach digest food.

If you are suffering from an unsettled stomach, or just ate a large dinner, take a shot of your favorite Schnapps flavor. [2] X Research source After eating a dinner primarily consisted of meat or carbs, pour yourself a shot of Schnapps that is subtly flavored like pear, plum, or cherry."

      "content": "Chill the Schnapps in the freezer for a drink that tastes like a dessert. Pour your favorite flavor into a shot glass and enjoy the cool sensation. Consider pairing the Schnapps with different foods or desserts to heighten the experience. Sip on some chilled peach or butterscotch Schnapps as you eat a bowl of ice cream. If you are feeling really adventurous, drizzle it over the ice cream and let the flavors meld. Pour some Schnapps over ice to make the drink last longer. Use a rock glass to limit the amount you pour — either a single or a double shot. Then allow the Schnapps to chill for a few moments over the ice."

      "content": "Drink a Fuzzy Bellini for a cocktail with prominent almond and peach flavors. The Fuzzy Bellini is one of the most common cocktails to make with peach Schnapps. It is traditionally served in a champagne flute, but if you do not have a champagne flute, you can use a glass of your own choosing. [3] X Research source Add 3 ⁄ 4 fluid ounce (22 mL) of peach Schnapps, and 1 ⁄ 4 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of orgeat into a champagne flute. Orgeat, if you are unfamiliar with it, has a strong almond flavoring, and will pair nicely with the peach flavored Schnapps. Then stir mixture together, and top the champagne flute with prosecco. To cut the sweetness of the drink, add 2 dashes of orange bitters, and stir everything together before serving."

      "content": "Drink hot chocolate with peppermint Schnapps during the holiday season. This festive drink can be made with a chocolate of your choosing and has a minty aftertaste with a kick. You can serve the warm drink plain, or dress it up with whipped cream, marshmallows, and peppermint crumbles. [7] X Research source Heat 1 cup (240 mL) of skim, 2 percent, or whole milk in a medium saucepan over low heat. If you do not want to use milk, you can use half-and-half instead. Stir the milk constantly and add 1 cup (150 g) of bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips. Instead of using traditional milk chocolate, you can use white chocolate instead. Continue stirring the milk until all of the chocolate has melted. Increase the temperature to a medium heat, and whisk in 3 cups (710 mL) more of your selected milk. Lower the heat if the mixture begins to boil as the chocolate will burn easily. Then pour the hot chocolate into a small, heat-resistant glass, and stir in 1 and 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounce (30 and 15 mL) of peppermint Schnapps. If you find that the hot chocolate drink is too sweet, you can cut the sweetness with Green Chartreuse. This is a French liqueur that has bitter-sweet earthy and herb flavors. Simply add 3 ⁄ 4 fluid ounce (22 mL) of the green liqueur to your cup of hot chocolate and stir it together. [8] X Research source"
