      "title": "Use a black fabric dye made for the fabric of your shirt.",
      "content": "Use a black fabric dye made for the fabric of your shirt. When you’re choosing a black dye for your shirt, check the packaging to make sure it’s compatible for the material that your shirt is made of. Some fabrics need certain types of dyes in order to absorb and retain the color. [1] X Research source Check the tag on your shirt to find out what materials it’s made out of. Cotton, nylon, silk, linen, and wool are generally easy to dye. You may need to get a special fabric dye for polyester and acetate fabrics. You can find black fabric dye at department stores, craft stores, and online."

      "content": "Lay down a plastic tarp over a flat surface to create a workspace. Use a flat surface like a table, counter, or even the ground and clear it of any obstacles. Place a plastic tarp, sheet, or newspapers on top to protect the surface and to keep the black fabric dye from getting onto it. [2] X Research source You can find plastic tarps or dropcloths at department stores, home improvement stores, and online."

      "title": "Put on rubber gloves and wear clothes you don’t mind staining.",
      "content": "Put on rubber gloves and wear clothes you don’t mind staining. Black dye is really powerful and can stain almost anything it touches, including skin and clothing. Put on a pair of rubber gloves before you start mixing your dye. Wear older clothes that you don’t mind getting stained just in case you spill or splash some dye on you. [3] X Research source Many dye kits include gloves. You can find rubber gloves at department stores, pharmacies, and online."

      "title": "Fill a medium-sized bucket with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water.",
      "content": "Fill a medium-sized bucket with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Add the water to a large pot and place it on the stove. Turn the heat setting to high and allow the water to come to a rolling boil. Turn off the heat and carefully pour the water into the bucket. [4] X Research source Use cloths or potholders to hold the pot so you don’t burn your hands. Pour the water slowly so it doesn’t splash and potentially burn your skin."

    {
      "title": "Mix the dye with the hot water.",
      "content": "Mix the dye with the hot water. Read the directions on the packaging to see how much dye you need to use. Pour the dye into the bucket and stir it well with a wooden spoon or a metal utensil. [5] X Research source The amount of dye you need to add is dependent on how many shirts you plan to dye and how much they weigh."

      "title": "Add 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) of salt to the mixture for a richer color.",
      "content": "Add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of salt to the mixture for a richer color. Adding a little bit of table salt to the dye mixture will make the shirt a deeper and richer shade of black. Pour the salt into the bucket and stir the mixture well. [6] X Research source Use standard table salt to add to the mixture. Adding salt isn’t mandatory, but it will make your shirt a darker and richer shade of black."

      "title": "Machine wash and dry the shirt so the fibers hold the dye better.",
      "content": "Machine wash and dry the shirt so the fibers hold the dye better. Before you add your shirt to the dye bath, run it through a standard wash and dry cycle. This will clean off any dirt and debris on the shirt that could affect the quality of the dying and will open up the fibers to allow them to absorb the black fabric dye better. [7] X Research source Make sure the shirt is dry so you can be sure the detergent has evaporated off of it."

      "title": "Submerge the clean shirt into the dye mixture.",
      "content": "Submerge the clean shirt into the dye mixture. Place the shirt into the bucket of dye mixture and use a spoon or utensil to fully submerge it beneath the surface. Move the shirt around the bucket to soak it completely and release any air bubbles that may be trapped in the material. [8] X Research source Air bubbles can cause the shirt to dye unevenly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow the shirt to soak for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the shirt to soak for 30 minutes. Keep the shirt beneath the surface of the mixture in the bucket. Let it soak for at least half an hour to allow the fibers to absorb and lock in the black dye. [9] X Research source After 30 minutes, lift the shirt out of the mixture with a utensil to check it. If it’s not quite as black as you want it to be, let it soak for another 30 minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the shirt around occasionally.",
      "content": "Stir the shirt around occasionally. While the shirt is soaking in the dye, use a spoon or a utensil to stir it around every now and then. The dye needs to saturate all of the shirt in order to have an even color when it’s finished. [10] X Research source Stir the mixture every 5 minutes or so."

    {
      "title": "Pour out the dye mixture into a sink.",
      "content": "Pour out the dye mixture into a sink. The black dye mixture can stain almost anything it touches so dump it out in your sink so it washes away. Keep the shirt in the bucket so you can rinse it under the faucet. [11] X Research source Run the faucet to wash the black dye mixture down the sink. The black dye will not damage your plumbing."

      "content": "Wring out the excess water. Turn off the faucet and crumple up the shirt in your hands. Squeeze as hard as you can a few times to force out the water in the fibers as well as excess dye. [13] X Research source Twist the shirt to help push out the water."

      "title": "Rinse the shirt under cold water until the water runs clear.",
      "content": "Rinse the shirt under cold water until the water runs clear. Turn the faucet back on, but set the water temperature so it’s cold. The cold water will tighten the fibers and lock in the black dye. Run the water through the shirt until the water turns clear and there isn’t any more dye. [14] X Research source You can periodically squeeze and wring out the water from the shirt to help push out any of the remaining excess dye."

      "content": "Machine wash and dry the shirt before you wear it. Before you wear the shirt, run it through a normal wash cycle in your washing machine. Then, dry it thoroughly by machine-drying it. When it’s finished, enjoy your newly dyed black shirt! [15] X Research source Avoid washing the shirt with any of your other clothes during the first wash so you don’t risk staining anything."
