      "content": "Remove the handset from the cradle. Notice the two prongs that rise from the cradle of the phone when the handset is removed. This is called the switch hook. Sometimes you will find a rotary phone that still works, but has a missing or broken dial. Pressing the switch hook is what will allow you to dial the phone despite the damage. The reason this works is because a rotary dial works by repeatedly closing the switch hook an amount of times corresponding with the number you dial. This can also be done manually by pressing the switch hook quickly. This method only works on a phone line that supports pulse dialing. Most rotary telephones, with the exception of modern clones, only work on telephone lines that support pulse dialing, so if a rotary telephone is in use or has been used before and it is not a clone, this method will work."
