When developing your style, personal stylist Susan Kim suggests trying out different looks to see what works for you. A style mood board is helpful, but don’t copy every look you see.

They'll also pair well with the rest of the clothes in your rotation, as they’re versatile and easy to style. With the basics, you’ll have simple pieces that look good, which will help you develop a sense of confidence. Once you’re comfortable in the basics, experiment with your wardrobe to see what outfits look the best on you. Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Some clothes may feel a bit weird to wear at first, but the more you incorporate them into your wardrobe, the more comfortable they will be. Mix and match using the swap trick. This is when you take a simple, neutral outfit and swap one of the pieces with something that’s colored or patterned. This will help you get comfortable with louder pieces. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose clothes that are appropriate for wherever you're headed. Follow the dress code for any events you're attending, and choose more formal outfits for more formal events. For instance, if you're going to a job interview, ask your contact what kind of attire their applicants usually wear. Wear either business casual or business formal attire. It's better to be overdressed than under-dressed for an interview. For professional networking events, industry conventions, or formal dinners, invest in a good suit. Choose a darker, classy color for increased versatility; grey, dark blue, and black are excellent choices. For formal occasions, dress to impress, as it’ll show that you respect the event, and are involved in the moment. Dressing up will also make you look more involved, approachable and confident. When it comes to patterns, stylist Tannya Bernadette says that louder patterns should be saved for special occasions. If you enjoy patterns, though, go for it! There aren’t necessarily any rules.

For casual occasions or a sporty look, wear a pair of comfortable sneakers. [6] X Research source Try to stay away from wearing athletic sneakers all the time, as they can make you look younger or seem more casual. A variety of shoes will help you dress appropriately for different occasions. Varying shoes day-to-day helps keep your look fresh, and your shoes will last longer. While formal shoes are expensive, they're a great investment to make, especially if you take care of them. Cheap or uncomfortable shoes can bring down the whole outfit. Badly fitting shoes can also affect your posture and mood, which can weaken your look overall."

High-quality accessories can make even simple clothes look great. Matching your accessories to your outfit will ensure that everything flows well and show others that you care about what you wear. [7] X Research source For formal occasions, always look for a great tie to add style to an ordinary suit. If you want to wear a hat, choose one that suits the level of formality. Baseball caps are fine for hanging with friends or running errands, but something more sophisticated like a fedora is better for days when you're dressing up. Wear jewelry sparingly. Too much jewelry can come off as loud or overbearing, but a stainless steel chain or ring can create contrast and add flair to a simple outfit. Bernadette suggests using cufflinks to express yourself. If you’re a gamer, get a cufflink with your favorite video game character. If you have a dog, get cufflinks with them on it.

Look for clothes that suit your body type , highlight your best features, and give you the ideal proportions—wider at the shoulders and narrower at the hips. [9] X Research source If you’re having trouble finding a piece that fits you, try the \"pull 3\" method. Grab your current size, a size up, and a size down, then try them all on to see which fits best. Find brands that cater to your body type. Sharp says that you’ll likely find some stores or brands that tend to fit you better than others. [10] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Find a good tailor. Often clothes off the rack simply don’t fit, but can be made to fit with simple adjustments. If something doesn’t fit right at the hips or shoulders, a tailor can make adjustments to your liking. Bernadette says that when it comes to suits, fit is the most important. Make sure your suit is well-fitting, which means you have enough room to comfortably move in it, particularly around the shoulders and torso.

      "content": "A few high-quality pieces will last longer than a lot of Iow-quality pieces. Fast fashion provides lots of low-quality options, which are enticing for first-time fashionistas. But in return, many pieces are damaged or unwearable after a few months. To avoid this, opt for the highest quality materials you can afford and sturdy construction. [12] X Research source This is especially true for basic pieces like pants and more formal pieces that you expect to wear for a long time. You don’t necessarily have to spend a lot of money on clothes, but always look for quality. Plan to spend more money on more important pieces, and less money on trendy items or things you will wear out quickly, such as T-shirts. Visit high-end stores and try on their clothes to get a feel for what type of quality you like. Buying from an expensive brand doesn’t necessarily guarantee quality. Use your best judgement when picking clothes no matter where you shop."

The colors on your clothes reflect onto your skin, eyes, and hair, and depending on your particular features, some colors will be more flattering than others. Experiment with different colors , and find the ones that suit you best. If you have blue or green eyes, try wearing a blue shirt or tie to bring them out. Also, certain shades of red or brown might contrast with your eye color. If you have fair skin and dark hair, consider wearing clothes that complement this contrast. Tans or khakis might blend in with your skin and hair and take attention away from the outfit. Some colors, like fluorescents and mustard yellows, are popular for a season. So have up-to-date colors in your wardrobe. Still, though, buy colors that make you feel and look good, regardless of the trends. Some colors, like brown, khaki, gray, and navy blue, are classics that don’t go out of style. Consider your skin tone and how you feel when you wear them. Solid-colored clothes without logos are a mature look."

While it’s comfortable to wear sweatpants, a baggy t-shirt, and running shoes all the time, it could give the message that you don’t care about what you wear. [16] X Research source There are plenty of presentable clothes that are also comfortable. Making style a priority on top of comfort is very possible. Tuck in your shirt, unless it’s a t-shirt. You may hate tucking in your shirt, but according to Julch, “tucked in, in general, is always more flattering.” It accentuates your waist and looks more dressed up. [17] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist Expert Interview. 29 July 2020. If clothes are made from a comfortable material but are still uncomfortable, this may be a sizing issue.

Certified Image Consultant, Tavia Sharp says you should be thinking about how your style reflects your personality and to create an image that matches it. [18] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Just make sure that your outfit is appropriate and reflects an image that’s true to you. If you have a casual, quiet, no-nonsense personality, it’s perfectly acceptable to have a simple wardrobe with just a few, well-made, basic items, like a simple white T-shirt or blue jeans. If you’re dramatic and like to make a statement, reflect that in your clothes. Shirts with big shoulders or flared pants can help with that. Just exercise a little restraint so you don’t go overboard. Having mature, professional clothing is essential, but you can add some fun pieces to your wardrobe, too. Finding a style that’s unique to you and your age can help maintain your youthful look.

Select pieces that resonate with you and make you feel good, but avoid being a walking advertisement for a brand, a sports team, or musicians. Draw attention away from a brand or logo by wearing a flannel or jacket over your top or by wearing eye-catching pants. Be careful wearing shirts that display offensive or sarcastic statements. Some people may take offense to them. If there is a celebrity you admire, it’s perfectly fine to use them as inspiration. Just make sure that you take your own activities and physique into consideration."

That way, your smell will be soft and subtle instead of overwhelming. Get a haircut that is flattering and up-to-date. A good haircut should complement the shape of your face. A good hair stylist can help you choose one. Don’t slouch, fidget, or have an overly exaggerated walk. Your clothes will look better if you carry yourself with ease and confidence."
