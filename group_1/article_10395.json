If the wound is gaping, jagged, or exposing muscle or fat, see a doctor as soon as possible. The cut should be stitched within a few hours to reduce the risk of infection or scarring.

Wet and lather your hands with an antibacterial soap, then scrub for 20 seconds and rinse. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

      "content": "Apply pressure to stop the bleeding. A minor cut will probably stop bleeding on its own. If your cut does keep bleeding, apply pressure to the wound with a clean cloth. If possible, elevate the wound for a few minutes to help blood flow away from the area. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the wound is bleeding a lot, keep the cloth in place for at least 5 minutes. Don’t lift it to check on the cut, or you could disturb the clot and start the bleeding up again. Put a new cloth or gauze on top of the first one if it bleeds through. If you still see signs of bleeding after 5 minutes, call your doctor or go to the emergency room right away. [4] X Research source"

Wash the surrounding area with a gentle soap and water, avoiding the actual open wound, and pat it dry with a clean cloth or piece of gauze. Sterilize a pair of tweezers by cleaning them with alcohol, then use them to remove any dirt or debris that might be stuck to your cut. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If dirt or debris remain in the cut, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or iodine to clean the wound, as they can further damage the tissue around your wound and make it harder to heal."

To hide cuts, scrapes, or scratches, purchase concealer makeup and an applicator sponge or brush (available at pharmacies or beauty supply stores). Gently tap the concealer onto the cut in layers until you get the coverage you want. Apply a light dusting of translucent powder over the area to set the makeup and prevent it from rubbing off. [10] X Research source For scars that are sunken in, fill the depression with a little primer before tapping on the concealer. If the scar is still red or pink, neutralize it with a thin layer of green concealer before putting on the skin-toned concealer. Always use a clean brush and only apply makeup to a closed wound."

Long sleeves and pants (or long skirts) will hide cuts or scrapes while they heal. It will also protect them from the sun, which can worsen scarring.

      "content": "Wear decorative bandages. To hide your cuts in plain sight, make your own colorful bandages with decorative tape (available at craft stores or online). Attach a strip of colorful tape to the non-adhesive side of the bandage and trim away the excess tape around the edges. Apply it to your cut as you would a regular band-aid. Take care not to get the tape directly on your skin, since tape that’s not made for use on skin can cause irritation. You can also buy pre-made decorative bandages at a pharmacy or grocery store."
