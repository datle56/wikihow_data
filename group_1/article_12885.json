      "content": "Take your guinea pig to the vet. Make an appointment at your veterinarian’s office right away if you notice any of these symptoms. Your vet can use an X-ray to examine your guinea pig for bladder stones, use a needle to draw a urine sample, and perform a physical examination. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Calm your guinea pig before the physical examination or X-rays. Help your veterinarian get to the bottom of the problem by calming your guinea pig before any imaging and diagnostic tests. Talk to your pet in a calming, reassuring voice. You can also ask the vet if you may stroke your pet during the physical exam to make it feel safe. Keep in mind that you will not be allowed into the room where x-rays are performed due to the radiation and liability issues."

      "title": "Administer any prescribed antibiotics as directed.",
      "content": "Administer any prescribed antibiotics as directed. Finish the complete course of any antibiotics your vet prescribes your guinea pig, even if it seems better after only a few days.

      "content": "Go back to the vet if symptoms persist on medication. If the troubling urinary symptoms do not get better after a few days on the medication, call your vet.

      "title": "Avoid handling your pet while they're healing.",
      "content": "Avoid handling your pet while they're healing. Let your guinea pig rest in their cage as they recover from being ill. Save the cuddling for another time when your pet is feeling 100%. [11] X Research source You may also need to force-feed your pet if they are avoiding food due to nausea caused by medications. When your pet is acting like their old self and not showing any symptoms of urinary illness, you can handle them again. Always remember to wash your hands before and after handling your guinea pig."

      "title": "Change your guinea pig's bedding more frequently.",
      "content": "Change your guinea pig's bedding more frequently. Replace the bedding in your guinea pig's cage every 3-4 days rather than just once a week. Scoop the old bedding into the trash and spray the bottom of the cage with a half-and-half white vinegar and water mixture. Wipe the cage dry with a paper towel, and refill it with clean bedding. When you clean the cage, place your guinea pig in a second safe cage or an enclosed location, such as a bathtub. Spot clean your guinea pig's cage on a daily basis by removing soiled spots and replacing with fresh bedding. Line the base of the cage with newspaper or puppy pads for extra absorbency."

      "content": "Trim the bottoms of longhaired guinea pigs. Take your guinea pig out of the cage, and dampen the hair near their bottom with tap water. You want the hair to be wet but not soaking. Use your fingers to take sections of the hair between your middle and index finger, and trim the excess hair with grooming scissors to keep your guinea pig’s bottom tidy. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source Regular trims will keep your guinea pig’s hair from getting dirty and matted with urine or feces. Talk to your guinea pig as you groom them to keep them calm and relaxed."

      "content": "Offer plain cranberry juice. Place some unsweetened cranberry juice in a water bottle for your guinea pig. Cranberry juice can reduce the incidence of UTIs by half and may keep your pet out of the vet’s office. Avoid cranberry juice cocktails and other sweet mixes with added sugars. [14] X Research source Plain cranberry juice can be quite bitter. If your guinea pig isn’t fond of it, try diluting the juice with a little water. Change the juice bottle twice a day to keep it clean. [15] X Research source There is no need to restrict cranberry juice, but if your guinea pig loves it you may want to stick to one cup (236 ml) a day to avoid stomach upset."
