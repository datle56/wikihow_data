      "title": "Kick your left foot behind your right knee.",
      "content": "Kick your left foot behind your right knee. Lift up your left foot and kick the foot just behind your knee, so you make a figure four shape. Keep your weight steady on your right foot. You can think of this as the position you would have if you were to sit on the floor with your legs crossed, except you're only crossing one leg behind the other in this case. You can also start this dance move with your right foot instead of your left. It really doesn't matter, unless you're coordinating your moves with other people."

    {
      "title": "Kick your left foot out.",
      "content": "Kick your left foot out. After you kicked your left foot up behind your right knee for one count, kick it out to the left, so it just barely lifts off the ground. As you do this, hop to the right a bit with your right foot. You don't have to hop far, just a few inches. It takes some coordination and practice to master this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick your right foot behind your left knee.",
      "content": "Kick your right foot behind your left knee. Make sure to land that left foot on the ground first as as you lift up your right foot. Just mirror the motion you already did with your left leg. Continue to maintain your balance as you execute this move."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick your right foot out.",
      "content": "Kick your right foot out. Just as you did with your left foot, keep it lifted off the ground a tiny bit. Make sure to jump to the left a bit with your left foot. Doing this on both sides will essentially keep you in about the same place as you continue to do the Spongebob dance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick up the pace.",
      "content": "Pick up the pace. Continue doing this 4-step dance while picking up the pace and going faster until people can't even see exactly what you're doing with your feet. Part of the fun is to pick up the speed and look like you're really rocking your dance moves. This will take some practice to get perfect. If you really want to go wild, you don't have to stay in almost the same place the whole time. Move around the room, turn while you do the Spongebob, or alternate between moving around and staying in one place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get your hands into it.",
      "content": "Get your hands into it. Though there's no set move you have to do with your hands to execute the Spongebob, adding your hands to the mix will give the dance more flair and flow. The easiest thing you can do is to move your hands in, toward your center (you can cross them for emphasis), when you kick your leg in, and move them out, palms facing away from you, whenever you kick your leg out. You can also just move the arm opposite the foot that is kicked out up, and move the other arm down by your side, alternating as you alternate feet. You can also just keep your hands up by your chest while you show off your moves to draw more attention to your feet."
