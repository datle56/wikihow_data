      "content": "Take over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce pain. Pleurisy usually causes a sharp pain in your chest while you inhale. Over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or anti-inflammatories, can do a lot to reduce pain. Follow the directions on the packaging for dosing and the length of time you can take the medication without a break.

      "content": "Take a cough suppressant to avoid painful coughing fits. If you are coughing a lot, you should take over-the-counter cough medicine to minimize it. Follow the dosing directions on the packaging but try to take the syrup right when your coughing begins. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If an over-the-counter cough syrup doesn’t work well enough, ask your doctor about getting a prescription for a codeine-based cough syrup. Codeine-based cough syrups work very well at suppressing coughing. Codeine may be prescribed, but it is potentially addictive and can cause side effects, such as shortness of breath, sleepiness, dizziness, and constipation. Follow your doctor's directions for use closely, especially if you are combining it with acetaminophen.

      "title": "Rest your body as much as possible.",
      "content": "Rest your body as much as possible. Deep breaths can make the pain of pleurisy much worse, so it’s a good idea to eliminate activities that cause you to breathe deeply. Don’t exercise or exert yourself if you don’t have to while you are coping with this condition. Many cases of pleurisy go away on their own in a few days or weeks depending on its severity. During this time you should try to move as little as possible to keep the stress on your lungs as low as possible."

      "content": "Try having excess fluids removed with an outpatient medical procedure. This procedure is called a thoracentesis. It is done by inserting a needle into the chest between the ribs and then drawing the fluid out of the area around the lungs.
