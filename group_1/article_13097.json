      "content": "Ask for a new invitation. This is the first and easiest fix you should try. Most of the time, you'll see this error code if you try to accept an invite long after it was created. Invites can be set to expire from 30 minutes to 7 days since creation. If the user is sharing a universal invite link rather than an invite through Direct Message, they also have the option to limit the number of users who can join through this link. In this case, make sure they set the Max Number of Uses to No limit until you get in."

However, software bugs on your device may prevent this from working properly. In this case, you can manually input the server invitation code. Do the following: Copy the invite link. On Discord, select + in the left panel. Select Join a Server . Paste the invite link. Select Join with Invite Link ."

      "content": "Leave a few servers to make room. Discord only allows you to be in 100 servers at a time (200 with Nitro), so you may be blocked from joining more if you're near the limit. Since Discord doesn't have a built-in way to check the exact number of servers you're in, you'll need to manually count the servers within the sidebar or just pick a few inactive servers to leave behind."

      "title": "Check if your account is banned.",
      "content": "Check if your account is banned. If you can see the server icon and name on the invitation, this means the server is valid. However, if the invitation asks for your username and doesn't let you in, your account may be banned or blocked from the server. Discord server bans are IP-based. This means all accounts using the banned IP address won't be able to join or interact with the server. Unfortunately, if someone else using your IP address gets banned, this may apply to you as well."

If you try to join more than 100, you'll be blocked from doing so. This can result in the invitation appearing expired. If you have Discord Nitro , you can join up to 200 servers at once.
