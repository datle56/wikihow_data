      "content": "Transfer bank account funds. One piece of property that can be distributed outside of probate is bank accounts. If you are the administrator of an estate or trustee of a trust, you will need to know if bank accounts need to be included in your property inventory or if it was passed along in some other manner. The manner in which a bank account is passed outside of probate will depend on how the account is titled and the type of paperwork the decedent filled out with the bank. For example: [1] X Research source If the bank account is held jointly between the decedent and one or more other people, the survivors named on the account will receive the funds. As an administrator, you can transfer the funds by simply providing the bank with a copy of the death certificate. The decedent can name a payable on death (POD) beneficiary who will receive the funds upon the decedent's death. The decedent does this by signing a beneficiary form with the bank. To transfer the funds, you will need to provide the bank with a copy of the death certificate."

Some investment accounts (e.g., mutual funds and brokerage accounts) can be designated as transfer on death (TOD) accounts, which means the funds in these accounts will be transferred to the named beneficiaries when the account holder passes away. The decedent accomplishes this by signing a beneficiary form with the investment firm where the account is held. To transfer the funds to beneficiaries, you will need to show the investment firm a copy of the death certificate. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Look at the decedent’s real property deeds. Real property (i.e., homes and land) can be passed to beneficiaries in various ways to avoid probate. This is important because real property is often some of the most valuable property the decedent owns. Passing it along outside of probate will help avoid tax liability and debt liability. In most states, real property can be passed outside of probate in the following ways: [3] X Research source If title is held by both spouses as tenants by the entirety. This designation will need to be included on the title document itself. If it is, the property will automatically pass to the surviving spouse. You will not need to do anything. If title is held by both spouses as community property in Alaska with a right of survivorship. If it is, the property will automatically pass to the surviving spouse and you will not be required to do anything. If a trustee distributes the property through a trust. If the decedent recorded a TOD deed. A TOD deed, like a TOD investment account, names a beneficiary who will take title to the real property upon the decedent's death. You will not need to do anything to effectuate this distribution either."

      "title": "Be careful with IRAs, life insurance policies, and 401(k)s.",
      "content": "Be careful with IRAs, life insurance policies, and 401(k)s. Some property is distributed to beneficiaries with some quirks and special rules. The most common forms of interestingly distributed property include IRAs, life insurance policies, and 401(k)s. Certain laws and bank policies will limit who can be named as a beneficiary and how the money can be distributed. Check each policy carefully so you know exactly how it needs to be distributed. For example, a 401(k) must name the decedent's spouse as their beneficiary unless the spouse signs a waiver. If you need to distribute a 401(k), you need to make sure the spouse is the beneficiary or that you have a signed waiver. Distributions from an IRA will be determined by how old the decedent was and what the beneficiary wants to do with the account. For example, if the beneficiary is the decedent's spouse and the decedent was under the age of 70 1/2, the spouse can choose to transfer the IRA into their own name, take periodic distributions, or take a lump sum distribution. [5] X Research source Life insurance policies are interesting because of rules about making distributions to minors. Most insurance providers will not make distributions to minors named as beneficiaries. Instead, you will have to wait until the child reaches an adult age to make distributions or you will have to distribute the funds to a court appointed guardian. [6] X Research source"

A lot of tangible personal property (e.g., furnishings, jewelry, artwork, tools, equipment) does not usually have a title associated with it. If you encounter this property and it does not have a physical title, you can usually assume that it will automatically pass to the surviving spouse. In these circumstances, it is assumed the surviving spouse held the property with the decedent as tenants by the entirety. If this is the case in your state, there is no need to do anything. The property will automatically be transferred upon death. However, if the decedent did not have a spouse, the personal property will usually have to be probated unless it was transferred into a trust. [7] X Research source"

If you are the administrator if the decedent's estate and their property is passed on by a will, the property will be owned by the estate at the point the decedent passes away. Once property is a part of the decedent's estate, it can only be transferred to beneficiaries after all estate debts have been settled. One of your first tasks as an administrator will be to open an estate bank account, which will be used to keep estate assets separate from your personal assets. Any earnings or income from estate property will be placed in the account. Any debts and taxes owed by the estate will be paid out of the estate bank account. Any cash distributions to beneficiaries will be paid out of the estate bank account. To set up an estate bank account, visit your local bank and present them with a copy of the death certificate, letters of administration from the probate court (letters proving you are the administrator), and a TIN. Ask the bank to set up an estate account for you. They will use the documents you provide to set up the account and get things started.

While it is not usually required, a proposal is a good idea if probate has been contested. Probate can be contested in many ways, one of which is by a beneficiary who believes they are not getting what they deserve. Probate courts might have a proposal form you can use. If so, simply fill the form out. However, if you need to create your own, the proposal should include the following information: [11] X Research source How you intend to distribute the property The names of everyone who will receive property The property each beneficiary will receive The value of the property each person will receive That each beneficiary can object to the proposal if they send a written objection to you within a certain period of time prescribed by law (usually around 30 days)"

Most assets can be distributed by preparing a new deed, changing the account title, or by giving the person a deed of distribution.

When you do this, the bank will transfer ownership to the beneficiary. To transfer real property, you will prepare a new deed with the beneficiary's name on it. You will give that deed to the beneficiary and make sure it gets recorded. To record a deed, take the deed document to the county recorder's office where the property is located. Hand the document to the administrator and ask that it be recorded with the rest of that property's information.

The trust agreement will have important information about your role as trustee, the role of other parties (e.g., lawyers and accountants), and the terms under which you will have to make distributions. [16] X Research source For example, the trust might state that you will need to manage trust assets for the benefit of the decedent's children so the children will have income for life. In this situation, you might be required to invest trust assets so they can grow and last through the children's lifetime.

Therefore, when you become the trustee of the trust, you will have to make sure the trust assets have transferred ownership into your name, as trustee for the trust. Do not transfer title to yourself in your personal capacity. Different types of assets will have to be transferred in different ways. For example: [17] X Research source Real property will need to be transferred using an affidavit of death and consent of the settlor. When you record these documents, along with a copy of the death certificate, title will transfer from the decedent to you as trustee. You might also need to fill out a preliminary change of ownership form with the county recorders office. This document will inform the county recorder that you are transferring title. Other assets, including bank accounts and investment accounts, will need to be transferred into your name as trustee. To do this, you will need to take a copy of the trust document and death certificate to the bank where the funds are held. The bank will transfer ownership into a trust account in your name. To open the trust account, you will need to provide the bank with a tax identification number (TIN), which is similar to a personal Social Security number. You can obtain a TIN by contacting the IRS.
