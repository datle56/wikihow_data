      "title": "Get some glasses.",
      "content": "Get some glasses. Horn-rimmed glasses have become such a nerdy staple that people often refer to them as \"nerd glasses.\" Find a pair in black or dark brown, and for an added touch, wrap some tape around the nose bridge to achieve the illusion that they are broken. If you can't find a pair with thick rims, then any pair of reading glasses will do. Be sure that they are the right prescription, or are prescription-free if you don't wear glasses."

      "title": "Wear nerdy prints.",
      "content": "Wear nerdy prints. Checkers, plaid, and argyle are the triple threat when it comes to \"geeky\" or \"school-nerd\" style. Try to find a sweater, vest, skirt, or dress in one of these prints. You can also try striped and polka dotted patterns. Try mix-and-matching a few different prints. The more they clash with one another, the better! Wear floral maxi dresses and short flowy shift dresses.

    {
      "title": "Wear a collared shirt.",
      "content": "Wear a collared shirt. The shirt should be buttoned up, and preferably tucked into a pair of pants or a skirt. Wear a collared shirt underneath a vest or sweater if you have one, and have the neck collar and sleeves showing. Try a plain white dress shirt, a plaid or checkered button-up, or a collared t-shirt in any color."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a pair of trousers.",
      "content": "Get a pair of trousers. Ideally, your pants should be high-rise and cut just above the ankle (like a capri) so that your socks are visible underneath them. Stick with simple colors like black, grey, and brown. You can wear high-waisted flare jeans and loose, blousy tops.

    {
      "title": "Find the right shoes.",
      "content": "Find the right shoes. Try a pair of dress shoes or loafers in black or brown. You can also dress down your outfit with a pair of sneakers like Chuck Taylors or Vans. Try to find a pair in a bright color like red, blue, green or purple."
    },
    {
      "title": "Accessorize.",
      "content": "Accessorize. Once you have nailed the basic look, use some accessories to play up your outfit. Carry books, pencils, pens, and/or a backpack with you. If your shirt has a breast pocket, then stick some pens inside of it. Wear suspenders. Try to find a standout color or pattern like red, purple, neon green, checkers or rainbow. Wear either a standard tie or a bow tie with your collared shirt. Again, you can keep the color scheme simple for a more reserved look, or choose funky patterns and textures if you want to channel the 90s nerd style. Choose the right socks. If you are wearing a dress, try white knee-high or thigh-high socks; for pants and shorts, try a pair of dress socks in white or argyle. Whatever type of sock you choose, make sure to pull them up so that they are visible and make sure to put the socks over your pants in order to show off your wonderful nerdy socks! Wear hats, fashion scarves, or brown suede boots. [3] X Expert Source Natalie Tincher Style Strategist & Wardrobe Specialist Expert Interview. 4 June 2020."
