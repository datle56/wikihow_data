You'll have to convince your teacher to tell her that you aren't feeling well, but before you do, make your story more believable by going to the bathroom several times.

      "content": "Approach your teacher privately. After making a few trips to the bathroom, you're ready to talk to your teacher about getting sent home. Be sure that you are appropriately embarrassed about your condition and try to talk to your teacher one-on-one. Don't come right out and admit that you have diarrhea or gas. Instead, describe it in a different way, like: \"I've been having to go to the bathroom a lot today and my stomach's hurting. I keep having to go and it's really bad. I just want to lay down for a little bit.\" \"I'm sorry I keep having to go to the bathroom. I'm really embarrassed, but I keep passing gas. It's really bad and I don't want anyone to laugh at me.\""

The last obstacle before you get sent home will likely be your school nurse or an office worker. As long as you don't change your story and continue being embarrassed about your condition, you'll likely be sent home before too long. Stress the fact that your stomach is upset and that you want to lay down for a little while. You may want to get a false scent that imitates bad gas and spritz some of this around you when no one is looking. These kind of sprays can be bought at novelty stores, magic shops, and online."

      "content": "Master your symptoms. A convincing sign that you are ill will put you in arm's distance of a thermometer, which is key to faking a fever. If you claim too many symptoms, like a headache, dizziness, and nausea, that is usually a dead giveaway you are faking. It's better to pick a single symptom, like a headache, and one feeling associated with that symptom. [3] X Research source For example, you might say: \"I have a headache and every time I stand up I feel a little dizzy. This has never happened to me before. Is this normal? I don't feel good.\" \"My stomach's upset. I don't know why, it just started hurting last night and this morning I had to go to the bathroom real bad. Can I go lay down for a while?\""

The ideal fake-sick temperature is between 99.5째F (37.5째C) and 100째F (37.78째C). To fake out the thermometer, you might: Do some light exercise on your way to the office/nurse's room. This can artificially raise your body temperature. Drink hot water before going to the office or the nurse's room. Hold the thermometer close to a heat source, like a desk lamp.
