New shoes are either pre-verified, meaning that GOAT certified them as authentic and they’re ready to ship, or they still need to be verified, so they’ll take longer to ship.

They also include the quality of the shoes (good, badly damaged, etc.) and any notes, like if they’re lacking a box. Add the shoes you want to your cart and check out. GOAT accepts most major payment options. You typically get your order in 7 to 10 days.
