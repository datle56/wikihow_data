After identifying the common multiples, identify the lowest multiple common to all the denominators. [3] X Expert Source Mario Banuelos, PhD Associate Professor of Mathematics Expert Interview. 11 December 2021. Note that if no common multiple exists at this point, you may need to continue writing out multiples until you eventually come across a shared multiple. This method is easier to use when small numbers are present in the denominator. In this example, the denominators only share one multiple and it is 30: 2 * 15 = 30 ; 3 * 10 = 30 ; 5 * 6 = 30 The LCD = 30"
