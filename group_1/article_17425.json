      "title": "Understand how your speakers work.",
      "content": "Understand how your speakers work. To know how to troubleshoot speaker problems, it's a good idea to know the basics of how your speaker system works: Sound signals generated inside your computer are sent to the speaker port (usually green) on your computer. You plug your speakers into that port, and the sound continues down the wire into the little amplifier built into the speakers. The output of the amplifier is wired to the speakers. Power from either the battery (laptop) or the wall outlet (desktop) enables the amplifier to boost the tiny signal coming from your computer into something strong enough to wiggle the magnets in the speakers, vibrating the speaker cone, which in turn vibrates the air, creating sound."

      "content": "Know what's likely to fail. While any failure along the chain of events listed in the last step can cause your speakers to stop working, there are two main reasons why you might not be getting sound: Software - Software problems can pop up due to anything from low power on a laptop to out-of-date drivers or sound preferences. Hardware - Hardware problems stem from physically broken or loose speaker parts. If your speakers' hardware is broken, it's extremely unlikely that you'll be able to fix them on your own (and virtually impossible if you have a laptop). The one exception to this is if your speakers are improperly plugged into your computer."

      "title": "Make sure that your laptop is plugged in.",
      "content": "Make sure that your laptop is plugged in. Many Windows laptops will go into low-power mode if their batteries drop below a certain threshold, which can result in some computer features (e.g., sound) functioning incorrectly. You can avoid this by plugging your laptop into a wall charger. Naturally, you'll skip this step on a desktop computer."

    {
      "title": "Check your speakers' or computer's volume.",
      "content": "Check your speakers' or computer's volume. If your speakers have a separate volume control from your computer, make sure that the volume is dialed into a level at which you can actually hear your speakers. It sounds obvious, but ruling out an accidental mute is quick and more commonly an issue than one might think. If you have a laptop instead of a desktop, make sure that the volume is all the way up."

    {
      "title": "Make sure that you don't have headphones connected.",
      "content": "Make sure that you don't have headphones connected. If your computer's headphone jack has something plugged into it, the speakers won't work. On some desktop computers, you may find the headphone jack on the back of the tower. Many speaker systems have their own headphone jacks, so check for connections there as well."

      "title": "Turn off your computer's Bluetooth.",
      "content": "Turn off your computer's Bluetooth. Sometimes your computer can connect to an external audio source (e.g., a soundbar or a car) without you realizing it, making audio output seem as though it isn't working: Windows - Press ⊞ Win + A (or click the box in the lower-right corner of the screen), then click the colored Bluetooth icon. Mac - Click the Bluetooth icon in the upper-right side of the screen, then click Turn Bluetooth Off in the resulting drop-down menu."

      "title": "Try testing your audio with headphones.",
      "content": "Try testing your audio with headphones. If you've determined that your speakers aren't working even though headphones aren't plugged in, listening to your computer's audio with headphones will help determine whether or not your computer is the problem: If your computer's sound works through headphones but not through the speakers, then the speakers or their connections are the problem. If your computer's sound still doesn't work through headphones, you're encountering a software problem."

    {
      "title": "Check your speakers' connections.",
      "content": "Check your speakers' connections. Your speakers might not be connected properly to the computer (or to each other). You can check the speakers' connections to each other by looking at the cables connecting them in the back of each speaker, and you can check your speakers' connection to your computer by looking at the connection in the back of your computer. Your speakers should plug into your computer's \"Audio Out\" port, which is usually a green headphone jack on Windows desktop computers. If your speakers connect via HDMI, optical, Thunderbolt, or so on, make sure that the connections are especially tight."

      "title": "Restart your computer.",
      "content": "Restart your computer. This will solve most temporary software problems. The best way to restart your computer when attempting to fix a software issue is by shutting it down, waiting for a few minutes, and then turning it back on: Windows - Open Start , click Power , click Shut down , leave your computer alone for five minutes, and then press the computer's \"Power\" button. Mac - Open the Apple menu , click Shut Down... , click Shut Down when prompted, leave your Mac alone for five minutes, and then press the physical \"Power\" button."

The following parts focus on changing your Windows or Mac computer's Sound settings and drivers to ensure that your computer is both using the connected speakers and making the most of the currently available software for those speakers. If none of the following software tweaks work for your speakers, you'll need to take your speakers/computer into a tech repair department and ask for assistance."
