      "content": "Memo Board You can transform a blank cork bulletin board into something special with just a little handiwork. Add cute notes about special dates, small decorative items, or a collage of photos he’ll adore. Or, you can make it even more elaborate by wrapping a ribbon or colored string over the board in a pattern, so he can stick more items onto the board. Craft specialist Amy Guerrero suggests decorating a bulletin board “by painting the cork, the frame, or covering the cork with fabric, paper, or washi tape. Stapling on ribbon lengths in a criss-cross pattern will give you the opportunity to tuck things under them and display them on your board without having to put a pin hole in them. Painting a top section of your board and hand lettering on a title or quote helps to create a unique display area.”"
