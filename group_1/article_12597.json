      "content": "Smoke buildup when you use your fireplace. If something is blocking your chimney when you burn a fire, the smoke won’t be able to vent out of your home properly. Since smoke can increase the levels of CO in your home, it can become hazardous if you leave the fire to burn. [5] X Research source Even when you aren’t burning a fire, a clean chimney will have an upward draft you can feel when you open the flue. If you can’t feel a draft, it’s another warning sign that CO levels could build up."

If you see yellow or orange flames, or if burners aren’t fully igniting, it means there’s an issue with the gas and carbon monoxide could build up. [6] X Research source"

If you notice that your pilot light doesn’t stay lit or it flickers, it could mean CO has built up in the air around it. If the pilot light flame is blue, it could also be a sign that it’s not burning gas properly and CO is accumulating in the air."
