      "content": "Assess the damage to your mailbox and post. If the post is still standing, wiggle it to see if it’s stable. If it’s sturdy, and if the mailbox is intact, you might just need to screw the box back onto the post. [1] X Research source Check the top of the post and bottom of the mailbox. If the metal bracket that connected them is damaged, you’ll need to replace it. If the post wobbles, you’ll need to remove it and install a new one. If your post is made of metal and there aren’t holes for screws at the top, your best option is to get a new post. Otherwise, you’d have to solder the mailbox to the post."

      "content": "Sand or saw off any damaged wood if you’re salvaging the post. Screws that connected the post and mailbox might have caused wood at the top of the post to splinter. If necessary, use 40- to 60-grit sandpaper to smooth the top of the post. For more significant damage, you might need to saw off the damaged top. In the United States, the US Post Office (USPS) sets guidelines for mailbox height. If you need to remove some of the top, make sure the bottom of the mailbox opening will stand 41 to 45 inches (100 to 110 cm) off of the ground. [2] X Research source For locations outside of the US, check the website of your national mail service for mailbox guidelines."

      "content": "Purchase a mounting bracket that fits your mailbox. If the mounting bracket is warped or broken, you’ll need to replace it. Universal mounting brackets are available online and at home improvement stores. If you know your mailbox’s manufacturer, you could also order a bracket specifically designed for it. [3] X Research source Most store-bought mailboxes are secured to the post by a mounting bracket. Mailboxes typically have pre-drilled holes along the sides or on the bottom. A universal bracket has an assortment of holes that line up with a variety of designs. You might need to use a piece of 1x6 wood to support your mailbox if it doesn’t use a bracket or you can’t find one that fits it."

If your bracket kit doesn’t include screws, purchase (4) 1 3 ⁄ 4 inch (4.4 cm) and (4) 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) galvanized deck screws. [4] X Research source Some kits include flimsy hardware, so it’s wise to buy screws separately even if the kit provided some."

Set the bracket aside, then use a power drill to pre-drill holes into the top of the post. Fit your drill with a bit that's slightly smaller than your screws' thread diameter. [5] X Research source In general, the bit should match the screws' shaft diameter, which is smaller than the thread diameter. For a list of screw sizes and corresponding bits, see https://faculty.etsu.edu/hemphill/tap_drill.htm . If there are already holes in the top of the post from the old mounting bracket, drill new holes. Old holes might have been stripped when the box was knocked off, or they might not fit your new screws. Shift the bracket’s position on top of the post to avoid the old holes."

The sides of the box extend about 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) past the bottom, and this depressed space on the underside is the skirt. [8] X Research source Pre-drill holes into the board that correspond with the holes in the post and mailbox. Align the holes you pre-drilled into the board with those pre-drilled into the post. Secure the 1x6 board to the post with a pair of 1 3 ⁄ 4 inch (4.4 cm) galvanized deck screws. Next, drive 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) screws through the mailbox’s pre-drilled holes to attach it to the wood support. [9] X Research source"

If it’s not embedded in concrete, digging out the post will be relatively quick and easy. [10] X Research source Pulling out a concrete block is a tougher job. You could dig around the perimeter of the block and pull it out but, because of the block’s weight, you’ll need 1 to 2 people to help. You could also saw the post off at ground level, leave the concrete in the ground, and choose another spot for your mailbox. If the old concrete is exposed, cover it with soil or gravel."

Basic posts are simple lengths of 4x4 wood or PVC. [11] X Research source For more elaborate, decorative posts, you need to attach the base to a standard 4x4. You then bury the 4x4 in the ground or embed it in concrete. The 4x4 is usually sold separately. Don’t use posts made of unyielding materials, such as concrete or solid metal, as these might be illegal in your jurisdiction. The USPS recommends a 4x4 pressure-treated wood or PVC support. You may also use a 2x2 hollow aluminum or steel pipe."

You’ll need a little room to add soil back after you’ve placed the post in the hole. Measure your post to determine how deep the hole needs to be in order to comply with USPS standards. The USPS recommends burying a mailbox post up to 2 feet (61 cm) deep. The base of the mailbox’s opening must sit 41 to 45 inches (100 to 110 cm) above ground level. The opening should be 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) from the curb, so position the hole accordingly. [12] X Research source For example, if your post is 60 inches (1.5 m) and the mailbox attaches directly to its top, dig a hole that’s 19 to 24 inches (48 to 61 cm) deep. If the mailbox will sit on a support arm, measure 41 to 45 inches (100 to 110 cm) from the arm instead of from the top of the post. You might be able to reuse the old post’s hole as long as your new post is a similar size. Otherwise, you’ll need to make the hole deeper or more shallow to accommodate the new post.
