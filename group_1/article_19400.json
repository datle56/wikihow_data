      "content": "Keep track of how you feel every day for 2 weeks. If you have a depressed mood, such as feelings of sadness, and you have lost interest or pleasure in things that were previously pleasurable, you may be depressed. These symptoms should be present most of the day and nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. These symptoms may last for 2 weeks or more and they may stop and come back again. These are called “recurrent episodes.” In this case, the symptoms are more than just a “bad day.” They are severe changes in mood that affect the way someone functions socially or at their job. You may have stopped going to school or showing up for work. Similarly, these feelings might make you lose interest in some of your favorite hobbies or activities, like playing sports, doing crafts, or visiting with friends. If you have undergone a major life event, such as a death in the family, you can exhibit many depressive symptoms and not be clinically depressed. Consult with your doctor or therapist to determine if you are experiencing more depressive symptoms than is typical in the normal grieving process.

A major life event, such as the death of a loved one, can bring on symptoms similar to depression. A noticeable difference may be, during the mourning process, that positive memories of the deceased are possible and one may still gain pleasure from certain activities. Depressed people have a harder time doing normal activities with a sense of pleasure. [3] X Research source American Psychiatric Association.

Counseling psychologists : Counseling psychology is a field of therapy that focuses on helping skills and helping people overcome difficult times in their lives. This type of therapy can be short or long-term and is often problem-specific and goal-directed. Licensed professional counselor or licensed social worker : These types of mental health providers are often much easier to find and schedule counseling sessions with than psychologists. Ask your doctor for a referral or find one in your area by searching online. Clinical psychologists : These are trained to administer tests to confirm a diagnosis and therefore, they tend to focus more on psychopathology, or the study of behavioral or mental disorders. Psychiatrists : These may use psychotherapy and scales or tests in their practice, but are typically consulted when medication is an option the patient wants to explore.

Interpersonal therapy (IPT) : IPT focuses on life changes, social isolation, deficits in social skills, and other interpersonal issues that may contribute to depressive symptoms. IPT may be particularly effective if a specific event (such as a death) has triggered a recent depressive episode.
