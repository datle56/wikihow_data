These are the muscles that form the floor of your pelvic floor. The most common way to find them is to try to stop the flow of your urine midstream. This tightening is the basic move of a Kegel.

Let those muscles go and resume the flow of urine and you'll have a better sense of where those Kegels are.

      "content": "Use a hand mirror to find your Kegels. If you're still having trouble locating or isolating your Kegels, place a hand mirror below your perineum, which is the skin-covered area between your vagina and your anus. Practice squeezing and relaxing what you think are your Kegel muscles. If you do this correctly, you should see your perineum contracting, or lifting up, with each squeeze. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure you have an empty bladder before you begin your Kegels. This is important. You don't want to do your Kegels with a full or a partially full bladder, or you may experience pain while you do your Kegels, as well as some leakage. Before you start your exercise routine, do a bladder check so you can perform those exercises as efficiently as possible. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Concentrate on only tightening your pelvic floor muscles.",
      "content": "Concentrate on only tightening your pelvic floor muscles. Your Kegel exercises should focus on these muscles only, so avoid flexing other muscles, such as your buttocks, thighs, or your abdomen, for best results. To help your concentration and the efficiency of your movements, make sure you breathe in and out as you perform each set of Kegels, instead of holding your breath. This will help you relax and get the most out of your pelvic floor exercises. [8] X Research source One way to keep your muscles relaxed is to place one hand on your belly to make sure that your belly is relaxed. If your back or belly ache a bit after you complete a set of Kegel exercises, then it's an indication that you're not doing them correctly."

If you are lying down, lay flat on your back with your arms at your sides and your knees up and together. Keep your head down, too, to avoid straining your neck. [9] X Research source"

You don't want to strain those muscles too much by squeezing them for too long. If five is even too long for you, you can begin by squeezing those muscles for just 2-3 seconds.

Three to four times a day is doable, as each Kegel session won't last very long, and you can find ways of fitting Kegels into your daily routine.

You can do them while you're sitting at your desk in your office, having lunch with your friends, or just relaxing on the couch after a long day at work. Though lying down and isolating your Kegels and focusing hard is important for beginners, once you get the hang of isolating those muscles, you can do your Kegels almost anywhere at any time.

Once you've found a set of Kegel exercises that works for you, stick to this routine instead of doing even more Kegels, or doing them more strenuously. If you overdo it, you may suffer from straining when you have to urinate or move your bowels. Just remember that, while stopping urination midstream is a great way to locate your Kegels, don't actually do your Kegels routinely while urinating or you may suffer problems associated with incontinence."

If you feel like you've been doing Kegels for a considerable amount of time, such as a few months, and have seen no results, then seek help from your doctor. Here's what your doctor can do for you: [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If necessary, your doctor can provide biofeedback training. This involves placing a monitoring device inside your vagina, and electrodes externally. The monitor can tell you how successful you were in contracting your pelvic floor muscles and how long you were able to hold the contraction. [20] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source A doctor can also use electrical stimulation to help you identify the pelvic floor muscles. During this process, a small electrical current adheres to the pelvic floor muscles. When activated, the current automatically contracts the muscle. After some use, you'll most likely be able to reproduce the effect on your own.
