Both Chamberlain and Liftmaster garage door openers, which the same company manufactures, list the model and serial numbers on a sticker. [1] X Research source You'll find this sticker in one of these locations on your garage door opener: On the right or left side of the unit's exterior. Under the front light lens on a single-light unit. Beneath the left light lens (if you're facing the unit). On the opposite side of the antenna, sometimes under an access door. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Your Genie garage door's model number location varies by model. On many newer Genie models, you'll find a sticker with the model number, serial number, and other information on the outer cover of the unit itself. The sticker faces downward, which makes it easier to read from below. [3] X Research source On other Genie models, check the front page of your garage door opener manual, if you still have it, to find the model number. If you don't have the manual, you'll need to check the back panel of the unit, which will likely require a ladder . If you don't see a sticker with the model number there, remove the light bulb cover to find the sticker beneath it."

      "content": "Find the model number plate on the back panel of the overhead unit. If you don't see your garage door manufacturer listed here or are unsure who makes your door opener, don't worryâ€”the model number location is pretty standard across brands, including Sommer, Stanley, and Linear. In most cases, you'll find the model number on a sticker or plate on the rear panel of the power unit. If you don't see it there, inspect the rest of the power unit's exterior (the back, front, sides, and bottom) for a sticker or plate, and you'll usually find it. If there's no sticker on the exterior, you'll find it under the light cover. Simply lift or pull the light cover away from the overhead unit to find the model and serial number beneath it."
