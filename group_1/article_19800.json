      "title": "Understand why you have dark spots around your mouth.",
      "content": "Understand why you have dark spots around your mouth. These spots result from high amounts of skin-darkening melanin in certain areas of your skin. This melanin can be set off by triggers from inside and outside your body. This melanin condition is called hyper-pigmentation. The triggers might include sun exposure, melasma, and skin inflammation. It generally appears as “a red type of pigmentation…in lighter-skinned folks…and then, for darker-skinned folks, you’ll have a more brown kind of pigmentation,” says Tan. Sun spots : These dark brown clusters can take months, or even years, to show up in sun-exposed areas. Once they show up, they usually don't fade unless you treat them. This pigment shift stays near the surface of the skin, so you can treat it with creams and scrubs. Use sunscreen daily to prevent sun spots or to keep them from getting worse. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source “Anytime we’re dealing with dark spots in general, regardless of whether it’s sunspots, you have to wear sunscreen,” instructs Dr. Geria. “Sunscreen is critical. Otherwise, the spots will get darker.” Melasma (Chloasma): These dusky, symmetrical spots stem from hormone changes during birth-control use or pregnancy. When these hormones combine with sun exposure, dark spots can appear on the cheeks, forehead, and upper lip. This form of hyper-pigmentation tends to return easily, even if you treat it, confirms Tan. Post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation: You may get dark spots that linger after a burn, pimple, or other skin abrasion. This is especially common in darker skin tones but can happen to anyone. In this case, the melanin is deep within your skin, and the dark spots may take six to twelve months to fade. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source “If acne is what’s causing the dark spots, you want to make sure that the acne is clear before beginning treatment,” explains Dr. Geria. “Otherwise, it becomes very expensive and almost futile because you always want to make sure that the cause of the dark spots is taken care of before you actually address the dark spots. It’s like trying to whiten your teeth when you’re still drinking 10 cups of coffee a day.”"

      "content": "Consider the climate. The skin around your mouth is drier during cold season. Some people tend to wet that area with their saliva, which can darken the skin. If you haven't been out in the sun much, you may be over-wetting the area around your mouth. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Know that the skin around your mouth is thin. This can lead to discoloration, dry skin, and mouth wrinkles. These problems do not go deep into the skin, so you will probably not need an invasive treatment. You may be able to easily get rid of your discoloration by treating or exfoliating the skin . “Chemical exfoliants can penetrate deeper into the pore,” says Tan, “and deposit ingredients deeper into the skin to attack the melanocytes that…create the brown pigmentation in skin.”"

      "title": "Exfoliate daily with a mild facial exfoliant.",
      "content": "Exfoliate daily with a mild facial exfoliant . The exfoliant will lift dead skin cells, and over time, it may fade the dark areas around your mouth. You can use a chemical or a physical exfoliant. Chemical exfoliants can be better for treating dark areas because they do not stimulate the skin like a physical exfoliant, which can “induce inflammation” and exacerbate the problem, says Tan. You can find chemical exfoliants and facial scrubs in drugstores, grocery stores, and bath-and-body stores. Read reviews of a product before you buy it. Some scrubs may be sold to treat acne and other skin conditions; these scrubs often use acids and chemicals to deep-clean your skin. Tan specifically recommends “mandelic acid, an exfoliant that will help to drop off the dead skin cells. It’s also going to help purge those acne seeds out of the skin. What’s especially great about it is that it’s also anti-bacterial and will brighten the skin.”"

      "title": "Use an over-the-counter skin-brightening cream.",
      "content": "Use an over-the-counter skin-brightening cream. You can find moisturizing, skin-brightening pigment products in drugstores and beauty-product stores. Find a cream that contains Vitamin C, kojic acid (extracted from certain fungi species), arbutin (taken from the bearberry plant), azelaic acid (found in wheat, barley, and rye), licorice extract, niacinamide, or grapeseed extract: these ingredients help to block the enzyme tyrosinase, which your skin cells need to produce melanin. Spread a thin layer of the cream around your mouth. Follow the instructions, and don’t use these skin-lightening products for more than three months. [5] X Research source Dr. Geria specifically recommends vitamin C serums like “SkinCeuticals' C E Ferulic. That's a very nice serum that's going to help lighten up dark spots.” Dr. Geria also advises the use of lightening creams, especially “hydroquinone, which is available over the counter in a 2% strength—going by the name of Ambi—or you can get a prescription strength, which is 4%.” Kojic acid is a popular treatment, but it can irritate sensitive skin. Be careful.

      "title": "Consider using a prescription cream.",
      "content": "Consider using a prescription cream. If your spots won't go away, your dermatologist may prescribe a drug-based cream like hydroquinone. Hydroquinone limits your pigment-making cells and slows your skin's production of tyrosinase. Dark spots tend to vanish quickly with lower pigment production. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Animal studies have linked hydroquinone with cancer, but those animals were fed and injected with the drug. Most human treatments stop at topical application, and no research suggests toxicity in humans. Many dermatologists deny the cancer link. [9] X Research source Most patients show the first signs of skin lightening within a few days, and most of the effects occur within six weeks. After the treatment, you can switch to an over-the-counter cream to keep up the brighter pigment. [10] X Research source “Keep in mind that no treatment for dark spots will work without sunscreen,” says Dr. Geria. Sunscreen use “really is just mandatory.”"

      "title": "Try a laser treatment.",
      "content": "Try a laser treatment. Lasers like Fraxel tend to be the most lasting and effective way to treat discolorations that are close to the surface of the skin. However, laser pigment work is not always permanent. The effect will depend upon your genetics, your UV exposure, and your skincare habits. [11] X Research source Lasers also tend to be more expensive than other treatments. [12] X Research source “Someone can go to a medispa or dermatologist and get a technology called IPL, or intense pulse light therapy,” explains Tan. “I’ve personally seen that technology very drastically reduce redness in the pigmentation of clients.”"

      "content": "Try a glycolic or salicylic acid peel. Your dermatologist may suggest these peels to reach and treat damaged cells deep within your skin. Bear in mind that these treatments are not permanent. Depending on your genetic predisposition to dark spots—and how much UV exposure you get—your spots may return as soon as a few weeks or as late as a few years. Stay out of the sun, wear sunscreen when you do go outdoors, and treat your dark spots early to make sure that your treatment lasts longer. Chemical peels “usually require a series of treatments,” says Dr. Geria. “We usually recommend about three, and each one is done on a monthly basis.” Dr. Geria adds that they usually recommend “chemical peels when there’s not too much sun, so the fall or winter is usually the best time. The chemical peels basically peel away that dead skin on top that has that pigmented layer.”"

      "content": "Try to lighten your skin naturally with lemon juice . In a small bowl, mix the juice from 1/4 lemon with 1 tablespoon of yogurt or honey. Wash your face with warm water to open the pores. Spread the lemon mixture thickly over the dark areas, then allow the mask to dry. Gently rinse your skin clean with warm water. [13] X Research source You can also blot a makeup pad with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and sugar. Scrub the dark area for 2-3 minutes, then rinse with water. For a heavier treatment, slice a lemon into halves and squeeze the juice onto the dark skin. Rinse after 10 minutes. Avoid sun exposure after using lemon. Use these treatments at night, when you won't see UV rays for a while. You should also “use sunscreen daily to help prevent pigmentation from worsening,” says Tan. If used on your whole face, lemon juice may lighten your whole complexion, not just your dark spots, due to its high Vitamin C content. [14] X Research source Warning: Lemon juice’s high acid content can lower the skin’s pH level, which may lead to skin irritation, hyperpigmentation, and sensitivity to UV light.
