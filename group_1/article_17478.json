This can help cut down on your inflammation and pain. Especially try to take a break from the activities that cause pain. For example, if you type on the computer a lot, limiting your computer time could help give your fingers a break.

If you work with your hands a lot, such as typing, gardening, housework or child-care, take breaks and shake out excess tension in your muscles and joints that build up. Sit or stand with your arms dangling by your sides, bring your hands level with your waist, soften your elbows, shake off your hands and arms 5-20 times. Then, straighten your elbows and shake out the entire length of your arms. Shake as gently or as vigorously as you find it comfortable. Rest and ice your knuckles afterward."
