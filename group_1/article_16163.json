Also, get someone to help hold the cat still while you work. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Consult a veterinarian if you haven’t already. If your cat has an abscess or infection, doing this at home may make the problem worse. You should only express a cat’s anal glands if your vet has deemed it necessary. [2] X Research source Cats normally empty their anal glands on their own, so you shouldn’t need to do this unless there’s some medical condition impacting fluid buildup in the anal sacs. [3] X Research source Note: Cats with anal gland issues may drag (or \"scoot\") their bum across their floor. They might also give extra attention to their butt or tail (often through biting or licking); because of this, they may start losing fur around their tummy and the bottom of their tail. Kitties with anal gland issues might also be hesitant to poop. [4] X Research source"

The sweetest cat of all time can turn surly and aggressive pretty quickly if someone is messing around with their rear and the sacs are hurting them. Have the cat holder throw on some thick oven mitts and a coat to prevent if your cat starts expressing their frustration with their claws. Do this in the tub if you want to make cleanup easy."

Simply grab a clipper or some scissors and carefully cut away any excess fur, mattes, or tangles. You probably shouldn’t need to do this; the area around a cat’s anus is rarely going to be overwhelmed by fur."

If this happens, try putting a warm compress in the anus for five or ten minutes to soften clogged openings."

      "content": "Pinch the anal glands gently. Using your gloved hands, pinch the two anal glands under the anus, using your forefinger and thumb. Gently push upwards and towards the sphincter, increasing your pressure until the glands express themselves and release excess secretions. [7] X Research source Some very unpleasant fluid is going to come out. Keep tons of towels or paper towels on hand. You will likely notice a distinct odor once the glands release their secretions. This is a sign you succeeded in your task. If there is blood or pus in the discharge, your cat’s anal glands are probably infected. Contact a veterinarian as soon as possible."

Aggressive behavior when you try to touch your cat’s rear end. Paying excessive attention to their rectum or licking their tail. Butt-scooting against the floor. Sticky or bloody discharge."
