      "content": "Sleep on your back or side. In order to elevate your hand while you’re sleeping, you’ll need to sleep on your back or on the side opposite of the arm that needs elevation. This is the easiest resting position for elevating your hand. [1] X Research source Sleeping on your stomach won’t allow you to elevate your hand as easily. It’s much harder to prop it up from behind if you’re lying flat on your stomach."

It may seem like a strange position to sleep in at first, but you should grow accustomed to it quickly.

[4] X Research source Make sure that you position the pillows in such a way that it won’t be easy for your hand to roll off or change positions while you are sleeping.
