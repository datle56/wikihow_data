      "content": "Cut the hair to shoulder length if you're starting with long hair. Hair that is already cut somewhat short will be a lot easier to work with than long hair. If the client’s hair falls past their shoulders, gather it into a ponytail , then cut it off. This is known as rough-cutting; it will make the length more manageable and give you a starting point for the pixie cut. [1] X Research source Don’t worry if it looks uneven. You will continue to take off length to even things out. Don’t cut too close to the person’s head. The ponytail will make the cut hair easier to manage, as it will stay tied together. It also gives the client the option to donate their hair."

      "content": "Refine the hairline along the nape. Run a comb through the hairline, pulling it up. Placing your fingers just behind the comb, make a V-shape with your fore and middle fingers, closing them against the hair at the nape. Then, cut the hair just below them. Repeat the process along the hairline, holding your fingers at a slight angle. [2] X Research source Work with a thin section of hair, no longer than the length of your first knuckle to your second knuckle on your finger. If you are cutting curly hair, plan on cutting it 1½ to 2 inches (3.81 to 5.08 centimeters) long."

Each part should meet on the top of the head. Brush the hair in front of the ear forward so it’s out of the way. [3] X Research source If the hair won't stay forward, secure it with clips."

Snip the hair that's sticking out through the bristles as you comb upward. Create a soft, round line that follows the curve of the client's head. You won't cut everything that's in front of the comb, which is the point. [6] X Research source You should only remove small quantities of hair at this time. If you realize you have a lot of hair to cut, recut it using the techniques above, then try blending again."

Then, do the same with the sides. If you have any hair left over on the top, measure it against the already-cut strands on the tip of the angles. [10] X Research source For the top of the head, gather the hair parallel to the hairline and cut straight across. Then, check the hair on the top of the head against the other sections and the sides of the head. If you don't cut enough from the top, you could end up with a mushroom shape."

[11] X Research source Choose a length and style that you think will flatter the client’s (or your own) face shape. Many stylists recommend long, feathery bangs to flatter a square face or side-swept bangs for a heart-shaped face. [12] X Research source Hair shrinks when it dries, so be careful not to cut the bangs too short. Leave them longer than the desired length and trim them once the hair dries if they are too long.

[15] X Research source If your hair looks frizzy after you dry it, use a styling cream or foam to tame it down. Check the hair after you've styled it. If necessary, trim any areas that are too long. Hair stylist Matt King says using different hair products can help you achieve different styles: “A matte finish wax… is going to be a little bit harsher and a little more defined. If you want something that’s more light and airy, you want to be using a texture spray or even a hairspray.” [16] X Expert Source Matt King Director of Education, Fox and Jane Salon Group Expert Interview. 31 August 2021."

Many hair stylists agree that pixie cuts are more flattering on certain face shapes, but these days, there are many different variations of the style designed to complement different face shapes. Traditionally, faces that are heart-shaped or more angular work well, but talk to your stylist to find a pixie cut that will work best for you. [18] X Research source Hair stylist Patrick Evan says, “Personally, if you want to rock a pixie, I say go for it! Just make sure your stylist is shaping and showing you how to style it to complement your face shape… At the end of the day, whatever makes you feel confident is what’s best.” [19] X Expert Source Patrick Evan Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. Hair stylist Bianca Cox adds, “In my opinion, short haircuts fit many, many faces. It’s really just about that cheekbone [and] the chin area. If their face is round, that’s going to determine what you do with the front of the haircut.” [20] X Expert Source Bianca Cox Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. May 9th, 2019. Hair stylist Jenny Tran thinks round faces are the least flattering for pixie cuts: “If you have a rounder face and you have it in a pixie, the head-to-hair ratio is kind of off. The shape [of the cut] makes your head look rounder.” [21] X Expert Source Jenny Tran Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 19 May 2020.
