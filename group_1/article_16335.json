      "content": "A false twin flame is someone who seems like a perfect match for you, but they aren't. When you meet a twin flame (real or false), you’ll have a ton in common and immediately connect with them on a deep level. They may feel like your soulmate and feelings are incredibly intense. With a real twin flame, you are compatible in a lot of ways indeed. But with a false twin flame, you’ll soon discover that you aren’t as compatible as you originally thought. Instead, you’ll experience a lot of friction and emotional distress as the relationship becomes toxic. [1] X Research source Some people believe that false twin flames exist to help us identify traits and patterns within ourselves that we need to work on or improve. [2] X Research source lt can be tough to tell the difference between a real and false twin flame, at least at first, since your initial connection is so strong.

      "title": "They won’t commit to you.",
      "content": "They won’t commit to you. Does it feel like the two of you are a perfect fit and you’re ready to be exclusive, but they get squirrelly every time you mention making it official? This is textbook false twin flame behavior. A false twin may also hang out with you fairly regularly so the relationship feels serious, but if you bring up the future, they promptly change the subject. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Their feelings for you are conditional.",
      "content": "Their feelings for you are conditional. A false twin flame is unlikely to forgive any mistakes that you make and may not be there for you when you truly need them. Sometimes you might feel like you’re walking on eggshells around them because you're worried that one wrong move might cost you the relationship. Because of this, it's impossible to relax around them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Most of your conversations are surface-level.",
      "content": "Most of your conversations are surface-level. False twin flames are unlikely to share their thoughts, hopes, and dreams with you (even when you ask about them). Instead, most of your conversations probably revolve around your social circle, recent events, and any hobbies you have in common. You’ll have no shortage of things to talk about together, but mostly it's all fluff and no substance. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Something just feels off when you’re around them.",
      "content": "Something just feels off when you’re around them. You can’t put your finger on exactly why, but you just don't mesh completely with this person. You never truly feel comfortable enough to relax around them, and they probably make you feel anxious and jittery most of the time. With a true twin flame, you’ll immediately feel comfortable, relaxed, and open."
    },
    {
      "title": "They rarely offer support or a kind word.",
      "content": "They rarely offer support or a kind word. A false twin flame will happily take any support and kindness that you provide, but they usually won’t reciprocate. Your conversations are usually either neutral or negative—compliments and more positive exchanges are few and far between. This kind of relationship tends to feel one-sided and you’re definitely the one doing all the work."
    },
    {
      "title": "They bring up bad memories and hurtful topics.",
      "content": "They bring up bad memories and hurtful topics. A true twin flame understands that bad memories belong in the past. Their focus will be helping you create a better future and fulfilling your potential. Conversely, a false twin flame dwells on your past mistakes and traumas. They’ll bring these negative things up at inopportune times and force you to relive them in unproductive ways. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re threatened by your success.",
      "content": "They’re threatened by your success. A real twin flame will always be excited and happy for you when you achieve a goal. False twin flames are exactly the opposite—your success will visibly bother them and they won't be happy or proud of you. They may even get jealous or try to downplay what you’ve achieved to make themselves feel better. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "They don't share their thoughts and plans with you.",
      "content": "They don't share their thoughts and plans with you. It's normal—and healthy—for any given relationship to have a sense of independence, with each partner taking time to pursue their own interests. In this case, however, a false twin flame may refuse to share any of their thoughts, dreams, and other ideas with you, opting instead to leave you in the dark."
    },
    {
      "title": "You both have different priorities.",
      "content": "You both have different priorities. When it comes to the future, it feels like you have completely different plans—and there isn't much room for reconciliation, either. Maybe they want to focus on their career and you want to focus on building a family; with a false twin flame, it doesn't seem like your hopes and dreams are compatible in the long run."

    {
      "title": "Your relationship feels stagnant.",
      "content": "Your relationship feels stagnant. While relationships don't have to bring about monumental change, there still should be some amount of change and growth. With a false twin flame, a lot of time may pass without a significant sense of improvement or growth."

    {
      "title": "You can't remember why you're with them.",
      "content": "You can't remember why you're with them. In a healthy relationship, it shouldn't be difficult to remember why you're with someone. With a false twin flame, however, you may struggle to identify why you're attracted to them, and you may come up empty when you try to think about their positive and admirable traits."

    {
      "title": "They don’t stick around long.",
      "content": "They don’t stick around long. A twin flame usually sweeps into your life out of nowhere, and that plays a big role in why the relationship feels special—it's like they magically appeared in your life exactly when you needed them. But false twins usually leave your life suddenly and abruptly, too. This can be emotionally jarring and leave you feeling heartbroken."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attraction",
      "content": "Attraction The initial stage with a false twin flame is intense attraction—you're drawn to each other and the connection is deeper than anything you’ve ever felt. This can be an intoxicating experience, so it’s easy to get attached (and even addicted) to the way a false twin makes you feel. As things start to break down in the relationship, you find yourself sticking around and hoping things shift back to the way they were in the beginning."

    {
      "title": "Friction",
      "content": "Friction Once you start getting to know each other better, cracks in the relationship start to show. You notice things about your false twin flame that are definitely not okay, and you start to get uncomfortable and anxious. You brush it off at first since this person is supposed to be your soulmate. False twin flames usually do something to cause a major rift in the relationship, like manipulate or cheat on you. There’s likely to be at least one emotionally intense confrontation."

      "content": "Separation The relationship continues to be turbulent and fraught with confrontations. You may start changing the things you do and say to please your false twin, and it feels like they always have one foot out the door. Inevitably, one of your fights results in you two splitting up. After the breakup, you’re heartbroken and completely out of sorts."

      "title": "Trauma",
      "content": "Trauma Being separated from the person who you thought was your soulmate is unbearable. You dwell on everything that happened and wonder what you could have done differently to salvage the relationship. You may even start thinking that the breakup was your fault, even if it wasn’t. Try to stay aware of this, and use this time to face your trauma head on. Journal and examine your feelings to help you understand how you ended up in this toxic relationship."

      "content": "Healing Eventually, you accept the breakup and start feeling a bit better. Even though it really hurt, you learned some valuable things about yourself and what you can do differently in the future to have healthier relationships. Happiness seems attainable again, and you start thinking maybe you should get back in touch with your false twin. The growth you’ve experienced may be enough to make the relationship work a second time around. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Reconciliation One of you will reach back out to the other and try to mend fences. You may even get back together, but the same problems from before begin to rear their ugly heads. You feel stuck in a vicious cycle of intense attachment and trauma. You might break up and get back together many times before you finally realize you’ve had enough of this toxic person."

      "content": "Release You separate from your false twin flame once and for all. It was a painful experience, but you’ve learned so much about love and relationships from this person. You may even feel thankful for that growth. But you also know that things will never work out with them, and they definitely aren’t your soulmate. You move forward without them, a little bruised but stronger than ever."

A false twin can also show you how to grow, but they tend to exacerbate the problems you need to work on (rather than help you fix them).

With a false twin flame, you’ll experience a lot of extreme ups and downs. You're never able to feel truly close to them since they won’t share their feelings, and this tends to create a lot of anxiety. [9] X Research source"

They’re the first person you turn to when you need a friend or a shoulder to cry on. A false twin flame usually doesn’t provide any kind of real support in your life. When you turn to them, they might be there for you or they might not. At the end of the day, you just can’t count on a false twin flame."

Keep in mind that you'll probably have a lot in common with your false twin flame. Initially, you’ll feel very compatible—your false twin flame feels like your soulmate .
