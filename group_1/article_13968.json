You cannot use Facebook Messenger's built-in emoji menu, since Facebook has removed the middle finger character from it. iPhone - Tap the Smiley button next to the spacebar. If you see a globe instead, tap this until the emoji keyboard appears. If you still can't access the emoji keyboard, see Get Emoji Icons on an iPhone for instructions. Android - Tap the Smiley button next to the spacebar. If you don't see a Smiley button, you may need to install a keyboard that supports emoji. See Get Emoji on Android for details."
