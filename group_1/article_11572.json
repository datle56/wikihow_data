      "title": "Understand your differences.",
      "content": "Understand your differences. Psychologists have identified at least three different primary \"love styles\" based on friendship, passion, and game playing. Some suggest there may be as many six different ways of experiencing the condition of being in love, and that most people experience love as a blend of two or more of these. Spend some time thinking about what love means to you, and what it means to your partner. Psychologist John Lee argues that there are six love styles: eros (romantic/passionate love), Ludos (love as a game), Storge (love as deep friendship), Pragma (love as a useful arrangement), Mania (love as obsession), and Agape (love as selflessness). Think about which style or styles best fit you, and which best fit your partner. If your partner is a romantic but you are not, that doesn't mean you love your partner less, it just means you experience love differently. Understanding and appreciating your differences is important in any romantic relationship. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to relate. Try to put yourself in your partner's place, and understand their way of seeing things. If you and your partner have different approaches to communicating your feelings, consider whether your way of communicating is getting the message across. For you, mowing the lawn or doing some other chore for your partner might be a way of saying \"I love you,\" but consider your partner's perspective: is he or she receiving that message from your actions? Your needs are valid, but so are your partner's, so it's important to consider whether or not you're communicating your feelings in a way she or he understands."

      "title": "Enjoy the attention.",
      "content": "Enjoy the attention. Dating a romantic can be very fulfilling. Try to focus on the perks instead of the extra effort you may have to make. Your partner will probably make an extra effort to remember what you like, to do fun, spontaneous things with you, and to cheer you up when you are feeling sad. [2] X Research source Additionally, most of the time, the primary thing your partner will want in return is to be loved by you. [3] X Research source They are also likely to focus on the things they like about you. [4] X Research source None of this means you don't have to do anything nice in return, but it does mean you are lucky enough to have a partner who really enjoys being with you and wants you to feel the same."

      "content": "Don't take your partner for granted. In any relationship, it's important to take the time to value the nice things your partner does for you, and to make that gratitude known to him or her. [5] X Research source This is especially important when dating a hopeless romantic. He or she will likely try to do lots of things to make you feel happy and loved. If you don't appreciate this, your partner will eventually move on. [6] X Research source This can be as simple as telling your partner how much you appreciate the things they do for you, especially after they have done something particularly nice."

      "title": "Keep it fun.",
      "content": "Keep it fun. Sharing new experiences is good for any relationship, because it keeps the relationship exciting and fun. [7] X Research source Again, this is especially important when dating a hopeless romantic, who is likely to enjoy spontaneity. A romantic will try to create little surprises to let you know you are loved, [8] X Research source and will probably enjoy it if you do the same.

      "title": "Negotiate.",
      "content": "Negotiate. Every lasting relationship involves negotiation and honest sharing of your feelings. If you are having trouble finding a middle ground with your partner where you can both feel fulfilled, take some time to have an honest conversation about your expectations. Try figuring out each other's love languages! You and your partner might have different love languages, such as quality time, gifts, touch, acts of service, or words of affirmation. [9] X Expert Source Crista Beck Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Be open about your feelings, without ascribing blame. Phrases like \"I feel,\" I'd like it if,\" \"I really want,\" and so forth are great because they promote openness without the blame that comes with a phrase like \"you make me feel.\" [10] X Research source Ask for space if you need it. Some people need more time alone than others, and there's nothing wrong with that. Be gentle, but direct in explaining this. As you do this though, it's a good idea to let you partner know that this isn't about them, it's about your needs. Reaffirm your commitment to the relationship as you ask for space. [11] X Research source Let your partner know that it's okay to express his or her emotions, too. Tell her or him that their feelings are important to you. When your partner talks, really listen, don't just wait your turn to talk. [12] X Research source This means making eye-contact, trying to put aside distracting thoughts, and checking in from time to time to make sure you are getting the message your partner is trying to communicate. [13] X Research source Look for a compromise. If your partner's idea of a great evening is a moonlight walk on the beach, and yours is going to museum together, look for a solution in which you both can get what you want, even if it means you don't always get what you want. In these negotiations with your partner, be attentive and accommodating to the needs and feelings they communicate to you. If your partner is feeling insecure or under-appreciated, this will help them to feel loved and valued. [14] X Research source If you've hurt your hopelessly romantic partner's feelings, say you're sorry. Even if you didn't mean to do anything wrong, or don't think you did, you can still apologize for hurting them."

      "content": "Take small steps. There are lots of small things you can do that will help your romantic partner feel loved on a day-to-day basis. These small steps don't take much effort, but can make a big difference. Below are a few suggestions. Hold hands. When walking down the street, sitting on the couch, or riding on the bus, take your partners hand. It may not seem like much, but your partner will notice. Let your partner know you are thinking of them when you're apart. Send a flirty text or email, or tell him or her about something you've just seen or heard that you think would make them laugh. You can also surprise your partner with a little love note, posted somewhere she or he will be sure to find it. Buy a little gift. It doesn't have to be much: some flowers, a favorite candy, a book or some music you came across that you think your partner would enjoy. It's just another little way of saying: \"I've been thinking about you and I care.\" [15] X Expert Source Crista Beck Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."
