      "content": "Use email to express disappointment about a work-related issue. If you’re expressing disappointment with a boss or coworker, email is a great way to voice your concern in a low-intensity format, while also keeping a digital record in the event that future problems occur. You could also send a courteous reply if you’re turned down for a job opportunity, which might increase your chances with the recruiter in the future. [1] X Research source An email is also a good way to communicate your disappointment to your boss if they denied a request for something like a vacation or an idea that you suggested."

      "content": "Write a short and direct subject line for your email. Be concise and clearly indicate what the email is about in the subject line. Avoid using a long sentence or rude language in order to make your email appear more professional. Clear and direct communication helps your recipient take your message more seriously. For instance, if you’re writing an email to a coworker about a missed deadline, you could include a subject line that looks like, “Missed Shipping Deadline.” Other possible subject lines include: “Denied Vacation Days,” “Salary Inquiry,” “Workplace Conflict,” or “Question about Policies.”"

      "content": "Set the tone with a professional greeting. This will make it clear from the start that your message is professional in nature, and should be treated as such. Choose a greeting that is appropriate for your relationship with the person. For instance, if you’re on a first-name basis with a manager named Matthew Smith, you could start your email like, “Dear Matt.” For a more formal relationship, stick to “Dear Matthew” or “Dear Mr. Smith.” [2] X Research source If you have a very open and casual relationship with the recipient, you could say something like, “Hey Matt.” If you’re writing an email to someone that you’ve never met, or if you’re unsure about exactly who will be reading the email, start with, “To whom it may concern.” For group emails with multiple recipients that you want to address, simply say, “All,” or, “Hello all.”"

      "content": "Add a short pleasantry to keep the email friendly. Make the first line of your email a short aside or pleasant exchange that shows that you’re friendly but professional–you have concerns, but you’re not looking to pick a fight. Keep it brief and don’t go over 2 or 3 lines of small talk before you get to the meat of your email. [3] X Research source Try starting with something like, “I hope you’re doing well,” or “I hope this email finds you well.” If your relationship with the recipient is casual, you could mention a personal detail such as, “I hope you had a great time at the concert last weekend,” or, “I had a nice time talking with you at the company party last week.”"

Anderson Certified Image Consultant & International Branding Icon Expert Interview. 19 July 2021 Tell them clearly how you feel, and be sure to include how it affects you—maybe the cause for your disappointment makes you uncomfortable, or sets a poor standard of workplace conduct, or impacts productivity. Summarize your complaints and keep the body of your email to 1 paragraph if possible, so the email is focused on the subject at hand. You can expand on your complaints in later communications, if need be. For example, if you were turned down for a potential job, you could say something like, “I’m sorry to hear that you decided to go in a different direction. I was looking forward to the opportunity, so I’m disappointed in the decision to hire somebody else.” If you’re writing to a coworker or employee to express your disappointment, you could say something like, “It’s come to my attention that certain policies and procedures haven’t been followed properly. The policies exist to keep us all safe, so it’s disappointing to learn that they’ve been ignored.”"

Craft your writing to be an accurate representation of yourself and your values. [6] X Research source If you’re emailing an employee or a manager, it’s possible your email may be shared with other people, so it’s important that your writing reflects well on yourself as a person and an employee. For instance, instead of saying something like, “I don’t understand what your problem is with the procedures,” say something like, “As we’ve previously discussed, the procedures are designed to keep everyone on the same page, so they should be followed by everyone.”"

Wrap up your email by including actionable information such as setting up a follow-up meeting or inviting the recipient to come to you if they have any questions.

Finally, speak well of the person with whom you have an issue, to make it clear you’re not berating them or singling them out, only that you’re concerned. [7] X Research source For example, you could say to your interviewer, “I’m thankful for the opportunity to interview with your company. Please let me know if something opens up in the future!” If you’re writing to an employee or coworker, try something like, “I know you’ve been working really hard on this, I just wanted to bring the issues that I’m having to your attention so we can keep an eye out for any future potential problems.” Alternatively, say something like, “I know you may not have meant to come off that way, but I hope we can address and be mindful of how we use sensitive language in the office.”"
