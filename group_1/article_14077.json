      "content": "Prep your skin with moisturizer and a blurring primer . Douyin makeup is all about smooth and glowing skin, so start with a freshly cleansed face so your makeup applies evenly. Wash your face, apply your favorite moisturizer, then rub an even layer of blurring primer all over to minimize the appearance of pores, blemishes, and wrinkles.

      "content": "Apply a dewy or matte foundation to create a flawless base. Choose a foundation that’s one to two shades lighter than your natural skin tone to enhance the doll-like effect, or stick to your regular shade for a more subtle take on the trend. Apply your foundation with a damp makeup sponge to prevent your skin from looking too dry or powdery, and focus on the center of your face before blending outwards for even coverage. [2] X Research source If you have any blemishes or imperfections, apply a creamy concealer over those spots. A matte foundation contrasts beautifully with the glitter you add later on, making your look more dramatic. For a more natural look, opt for a dewy foundation instead. You can always apply your foundation using your fingers or a foundation brush , but be sure to look at your skin carefully under different lights to ensure there aren’t any streaks."

Apply the powder along the sides of your nose bridge, under the tip of your nose, below the center of your lip, across your entire jawline, and slightly under your cheekbones to add dimension to your face. Use a concealer that’s about three shades lighter than your skin tone to highlight your Cupid’s bow and the tip of your nose. [3] X Research source Set your base makeup with a translucent powder for a flawless finish. Don’t blend your contour out too much. It should look slightly harsh to achieve the artificial, doll-like look."

Apply a pink or peach blush in a sideways V-shape on your chin, nose, and temples, then blend it out with a fluffy blush brush . Do not bring your blush past the middle of your iris or lower than the tip of your nose. [4] X Research source Add more product that you normally would to achieve the rosy, “drunk blush” effect, which is a signature element of Douyin makeup. Using different shades of blush can help change your face shape. For example, applying a cool-tone pink blush vertically under your pupil can plump up your face, while applying a warm rose blush on your temples can act as a contour."

Glue the lashes on both your top and bottom lash line, leaving some space between each spike for an anime-inspired look. [8] X Research source Apply longer lashes near the outer corners of your eyes for a “siren-eye” effect. If you don’t want to apply false eyelashes, curl your lashes and apply a lengthening mascara ."

Douyin makeup is meant to look doll-like, while Korean makeup is more effortless and natural. Some other key differences include: [12] X Research source Base makeup: Douyin makeup focuses on airbrushed skin, heavy blush, and “harsher” contour. Korean makeup focuses on “glass skin,” soft blush, and little to no contour. Eye makeup: Douyin makeup uses glitter eyeshadow, sharp winged liner, and false eyelashes. Korean makeup uses sheer eyeshadows, soft eyeliner, and natural looking lashes. Lip makeup: Douyin makeup features a wide range of lip colors and finishes. Korean makeup typically features a gradient lip in soft, natural shades of pink and peach."
