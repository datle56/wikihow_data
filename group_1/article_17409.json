      "content": "Buy a pair of eyebrow tweezers. The best eyebrow tweezers have a slanted edge. The slanted edge helps you grab and pluck even the finest hairs along the edges of your eyebrows. You also want an eyebrow tweezer that gives you a firm grip. [1] X Research source Consider choosing an eyebrow tweezer that has a brush on one end. The brush allows you to smooth your eyebrows and see how they look as you tweeze. The eye area has a lot of bacteria, so it's important to buy your own tools. Borrowing someone else's tweezers increases your risk of developing an infection."

      "content": "Numb your eyebrow area with an ice pack or ice cubes. Place the ice pack or ice cubes on your eyebrows for up to 5 minutes before plucking. You want to hold the ice pack or ice cubes on your eyebrows until they feel numb. You know you've numbed the spot when the coldness of the ice no longer bothers you. Tweezing can very be painful for some people, so numbing your eyebrows beforehand reduces any pain you might experience. Taking a hot shower before tweezing, or holding a hot washcloth over your eyebrows, also reduces the pain. This is because the hot water and steam open your hair follicles, making individual hairs easy to remove without pain. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pluck individual eyebrow hairs using firm, swift movements. Start by plucking out hairs below the brow. Use your finger to hold your skin taut as you pluck to make it easier. Remove the hairs that fall outside of the brow outline you made with your makeup pencil. Pull the hairs up and away from the brow. After you pluck hair from a section, press your finger into the skin to reduce the stinging. When tweezing above the brow, taking care not to pluck too many hairs out of your eyebrow arch. In fact, be very careful when tweezing above your brow, as it's easy to overpluck. Trim as few hairs as possible. Step away from the mirror often, so you can check your work. However, don't use a magnifying mirror, as it may make it harder to judge your work. Tweeze slowly and conservatively when first starting out to avoid plucking out too many hairs. Plucking your eyebrows takes a bit longer than waxing, but it offers greater precision."

Make them wide enough to fit over and under your eyebrows. They should also be wide enough to apply and remove with ease. [8] X Research source Remember, you'll be butting your wax strips against the lower and upper edges of your eyebrow. The extra wax on the strip should rest on your eyelid and forehead, not on your eyebrow. Before applying the wax strips, it's a good idea to clean the area around your eyebrows with a gentle face cleanser. Cleaning your eyebrow area before waxing reduces the chance of swelling. You can use a gentle astringent or your preferred face cleaning product."
