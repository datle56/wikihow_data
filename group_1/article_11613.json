      "content": "Think about what you want to put in your bio. Dating profile bios are supposed to be a fun way to introduce yourself to people, so don’t overthink it! Just consider what kind of first impression you want to make and the tone you want your bio to convey. Are you funny? Clever? Do you prefer snarkiness or sincerity? For example, you might aim for one of the following styles: [1] X Research source Funny . If you pride yourself on having a great sense of humor, try building your bio around a great one-liner or joke that tells the reader a little about you and your personality. Sincere . If you’d rather be totally straightforward with readers, your bio could be a simple, honest blurb about your interests and what you want in a match. Romantic . If you’re suave and want to charm potential matches as soon as possible, you could put a pick-up line or flirty suggestion in your bio (but nothing too forward). No matter what vibe you choose for bio, remember there’s no wrong choice. It’s all about what fits you and your personality best!"

      "title": "Be true to yourself and your interests.",
      "content": "Be true to yourself and your interests. Resist the urge to “tweak” your personality and give yourself traits or interests that you think other people will find attractive. “The most important thing is to make a profile that represents your interests, lifestyle, and personality,” explains Diamond. Anyone you date will learn who you are anyway, so there’s no point in trying to be someone you’re not!"

    {
      "title": "Clarify what you’re looking for and want in a match.",
      "content": "Clarify what you’re looking for and want in a match. Whether your bio is straight to the point or clever and whimsical, giving potential matches a clear picture of who you are and what you want is important. “Be very clear about why you're on [the dating app],” says Diamond. Something serious? Something casual? Tell people why you’re there and what qualities you value in a partner. If you’re clear about your wants and needs, you’ll get better matches. “[It] helps filter the people who are not right for you from messaging and helps you attract those who are the right fit for you,” explains Diamond. For example, are you active and adventurous or more of a homebody who loves curling up on the couch and binge-watching TV shows? Whatever you do, steer clear of outright negativity. A little sarcasm or self-deprecating joke can be fun if that’s the kind of humor you like, but try not to focus too much on the qualities you don’t want in other people."

      "content": "Make sure your bio is concise and easy to read. Depending on the dating app, bios vary in length. Some (like Tinder) are short, while others can be longer. Still, try not to overwhelm matches with tons of detail or take a paragraph to say something that could be a sentence. Above all, your bio should be easily readable—so matches want to stick around and read the whole thing! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Share stories that illustrate who you are as a person.",
      "content": "Share stories that illustrate who you are as a person. Why make a list of traits when you could include a cool or amusing anecdote about a particular trait (or interest) instead? A good story may compel some matches more than a basic description—so brainstorm and come up with tales that can tell people exactly the kind of person you are. [3] X Research source For example, instead of writing “good sense of humor,” you could tell a joke or share a funny story of the time you once made your strictest teacher crack up. Or, instead of saying, “I love to read,” you could include a quip about reading every single Stephen King book at least twice."

      "content": "Add photos that speak to your interests and personality. After all, pictures are worth a thousand words! In addition to clear pictures of yourself so matches can see what you look like, try adding candid photos of you doing what you enjoy most—be it playing guitar, goofing around with your dog, or big wave surfing. A great photo of you can tell people what you're like as a person. For example, a picture of you hiking tells people you're adventurous. A picture of you at a museum tells people you love culture and art."

What can you bring to a relationship—especially if it’s something other people might not? In your bio, try focusing on the qualities that make you different from others so you’re more memorable (and interesting) to matches. [4] X Research source"
