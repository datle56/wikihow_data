      "content": "Find an Electirizer and give it to your Electabuzz. Electabuzz needs this item to evolve into Electivire. The location of the Electrizer depends on the game, though you cannot find an Electirizer in Generation III or earlier. Once you acquire the item, give it to your Electabuzz so it’s currently holding it. [1] X Research source Electivire was first introduced in the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games (Gen IV), which is why you can’t get it in the earlier games."

      "content": "Trade your Electabuzz so it evolves into Electivire. Ask a friend with a game from the same franchise as you to trade Pokémon with you. Upon trading, the Electabuzz will evolve into an Electivire. Once the trade and evolution are complete, ask your friend to trade the Electivire back to you. [2] X Research source Just note that the Electirizer will disappear after Electabuzz evolves. Don’t have a friend who plays the game? Join a Pokémon Discord server to find plenty of other players to trade with, like Pokémon: Scarlet & Violet , Pokémon Universe , and more."

      "content": "Scarlet, Violet & The Indigo Disk DLC In the Scarlet and Violet franchise, the Electirizer (along with the Elekid evolutionary line) can only be found if you have The Indigo Disk DLC for the games. It can be located in spots like the Canyon Biome, or you can receive one by finding getting 130 Pokédex entries in the Blueberry Pokédex. It can also be bought for 250 BP at the Blueberry Academy school store, or made using the Item Printer. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl In Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl , the only way to get an Electirizer is by catching an Elekid who is holding the item already. Elekid can be tracked down in spots like the Stargleam Cavern, though it can only be caught in the Brilliant Diamond title—if you have Shining Pearl , you’ll need to trade with someone who has the opposite game. [6] X Research source Improve your chances of finding an Elekid with an Electirizer by using a Pokémon that has the Super Luck power (like Murkrow, Honchkrow, Absol, Togepi, Togetic, or Togekiss), which boosts your chances of finding a Pokémon with a held item. [7] X Research source You only have a 1 in 20 base chance of finding an Elekid with Electirizer, so be patient! [8] X Research source"

[10] X Research source You have a slim chance of catching an Elekid, Electabuzz, or Electivire already holding this item, too."

In April 2024, Nintendo officially closed down the online services for the 3DS and Wii U, which makes Pokémon trades impossible. [11] X Research source The Wi-Fi Connection feature for the regular DS was originally shut down in May 2014. [12] X Research source Exception: As of May 2024, Nintendo still supports the Pokémon Bank storage software for the 3DS. The Pokémon stored in this software can then be transferred to Pokémon Home, the current storage software for the Nintendo Switch. Theoretically, if you had an Electabuzz from an older game, you could transfer it to a more recent game using these features. Nintendo has noted that online support for Pokémon Bank could be discontinued in the future, so it’s best to complete these transfers sooner rather than later. [13] X Research source"

It typically starts with attacks like Leer and Quick Attack at level 1, and learns Thunder Shock at level 4. Once it hits level 30, it’ll automatically evolve into Electabuzz.
