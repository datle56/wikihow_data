      "content": "Know the complications that can happen when a dog can't urinate properly. Possible medical issues that can arise in a dog that can't urinate include urinary tract infections and urine scalding, in which the shin is burned by long term contact with urine. [1] X Research source An overflowing or leaking bladder is an invitation to urinary infections, which, if not treated, can lead to lethal complications. It is also important not to allow bladders to overflow because this can lead to loss of bladder tone. Then, when a dog might recover its bladder control, the bladder will not function correctly."

      "title": "Consider the commitment involved.",
      "content": "Consider the commitment involved. Deciding to help your dog urinate is a major commitment. You will have to do it about 4-6 times a day. Luckily it only takes about 10 - 20 seconds each time. Still, many vets do not encourage people to try expressing their dog's bladder because it takes such an intense commitment. Unfortunately, the main option other than manually emptying a dog's bladder is to euthanize the dog."

      "title": "Understand your dog's urinary system.",
      "content": "Understand your dog's urinary system. With the bladder, you have to empty it often or the dog will become poisoned by its urine. Urine will not come out by itself; it will only overflow what the bladder CANNOT contain as more urine flows into the bladder from the kidneys. The rest stays put. That's one reason why disabled dogs are so prone to urinary tract infections. What about the poop? The poop is really different from the pee. The poop will come out on its own, without your helping, eventually. There's no risk of it staying inside and causing infection."

      "title": "Get instruction from your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Get instruction from your veterinarian. Have your vet give you a demo first, so that you know the correct pressure to apply. If necessary, the next day go back and express under supervision of the vet or his vet tech to make sure you have gotten all the urine out of your dog's bladder."

      "content": "Squat in front of the toilet, holding the dog with its backside over the bowl, and its body resting on your left leg or knee. In this position the dog's head will be looking behind you. You can also do this outside over grass, but it will probably be more convenient for you to simply take your pup into the bathroom."

      "content": "Squeeze gently, pushing slightly toward the back of the dog. It takes some practice, but the hardest part is learning the \"feel\" of the bladder. This is the part that you veterinarian will be most helpful at explaining or demonstrating. Your dog may lift their tail when you have found the right spot. [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source In order to adjust the height of the sling handles that hold the dog's abdomen, put some nails along the bar. Securely fasten the nails (or screws) along the areas where the handles hang off the bar. You will want to be able to move the handles further apart to raise your dog's rear end up, so each nail should be a few inches apart, so that the height can be adjusted gradually."

Put the handles at different positions on the bar, moving one side at a time, one nail at a time, until the dog's rear end is supported by the sling. When positioned correctly, the dog's rear end should be supported but not so high that their back feet are more than a few inches off the ground. You should be supporting the back weight of your dog while you adjust the sling. Use one arm to hold the dog up while you use the other to move the sling handles."

The sling should be positioned so that the bladder is right behind the sling area and hence easy to locate and express. The whole process takes only 5 minutes to accomplish, and if necessary, one person can do it by himself (for a 70 pound dog!)."
