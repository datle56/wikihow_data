      "content": "Bring your legs together as you flip over the bar. Your hands will still be gripping the bar, elbows bent, while your legs swing over the bar and your body rotates in a circle. Your body should be anchored to the bar right across your hips. It helps to look for your legs on the other side of the bar as you rotate. Keep your head tucked in so you can see your legs coming down, and the rest of your body will follow. Rotate your wrists as your body moves around the bar. This will enable you to finish upright."

      "title": "Straighten your arms when your body is finished flipping.",
      "content": "Straighten your arms when your body is finished flipping. Raise your torso above the bar and finish with your body in a straight line: straight arms, straight chest and straight legs. Pause for a moment in an upright position before dropping to the floor."

      "content": "Stand with your feet directly under the bar. Instead of starting from a step back, stand right under the bar. Your feet should be lined up with each other and close together. Starting from this position is more difficult than starting from a step away, since all of your momentum must come from moving your legs forcefully out of a standing position. [3] X Research source"
