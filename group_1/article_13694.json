      "content": "Do a bleach bath when you want to lighten your hair color. Bleach baths help strip existing hair dye from your hair without doing a full bleach treatment. You can also do a bleach bath if you want to lighten the shade of the dye or your natural hair color by one level. If you want to prep your hair for another dye or want to try a lighter shade, consider doing a bleach bath treatment. If you have dark hair or are trying to remove dark colors, do a full bleach to lighten it completely. Bleach baths work great if you have fragile hair."
