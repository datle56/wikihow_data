Apply the spot putty to the damaged area with pressure, spreading it around with the putty knife. This will help the putty fill in any scratches or dents as fully as possible. Use your fingers to shape the putty and smooth it over the damage to prevent raised areas on your rim. [5] X Research source Try to keep the spot putty within the damaged area, as applying it to flat, non-damaged areas can create unsightly bumps."
