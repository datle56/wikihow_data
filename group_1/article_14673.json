      "content": "Determine your body shape so you can accentuate your best features. Every woman looks different, and identifying your unique qualities will help you figure out how to dress to enhance your natural beauty. Look at yourself in the mirror to see which shape your body resembles: Inverted triangle: Your shoulders are wider than your hips. Balance your proportions by adding volume to your lower body. Great options for this include A-line dresses, patterned pants or skirts, and boot-cut jeans. Column: Your shoulders, hips, and midsection are all about equally wide. Choose clothes that accentuate both your hips and shoulders, and draw attention away from your midsection, like moderately flared dresses, and avoid bodycon clothing. Apple: You have a wider waist and an average-sized chest, with a wide back and somewhat shorter arms and legs. Draw attention away from your midsection, with A-line dresses."

      "content": "Measure your bust and find a bra that fits. A bra is by no means required, but if you have breasts or want more curves up top, a great bra can help you achieve your best look. To help you choose a bra , wrap a measuring tape horizontally around your chest, just beneath your nipples—this is your band size. [1] X Research source To find your bust size, try on a bra with your band size, and fill it as you would for everyday wear. Then take another chest measurement around the widest part of your bust. Finally, subtract your band size from your chest size—this is your bust size. Generally, a difference that’s less than 1 in (2.5 cm) is an AA cup, a 1 in (2.5 cm) difference is an A cup, a 2 in (5.1 cm) difference is a B cup, and so on. It takes a little trial and error to find the perfect bra, so try on a few different bras until you find one that’s not too snug, not too loose, and feels natural on your body."

      "content": "Play up your best features so your natural beauty shows. The secret to looking gorgeous is highlighting your unique beauty. Stand in front of a mirror and pick out what you love most about your body. For instance, maybe you have long, lovely legs or a clearly defined waist. Choose outfits that accentuate your favorite features so everyone’s eyes are drawn to them. Let’s say you have great legs. You might wear shorts, tailored pants, or short skirts and dresses. If you like your waistline, show it off by belting your clothes, by wearing a cropped jacket over a longer top, or by wearing a cropped top. If you’ve got nice arms, go sleeveless when the weather permits. Use dark colors to minimize areas you want to hide and wear light colors to draw attention."

      "content": "Take a cue from how other girls or women your age dress. You can wear anything you like, so don’t worry too much about fashion “rules.” At the same time, you might be struggling to figure out where to start when it comes to building your wardrobe. Check out what your peers are wearing to get style inspiration. Consider which types of outfits you love, as well as what doesn’t fit your personal style. “Younger” styles might include things like graphic tees, short shorts, or accessories like chokers or colorful bracelets, while “mature” styles might include things like blazers, pants, blouses, or jewelry with stones. Play around with your style until you find something that suits how you want to present yourself."

      "content": "Remove your body hair if it makes you more comfortable. Many girls and women shave their underarms and legs , but that doesn’t mean you have to do so, too. If you do prefer a smooth look, apply a shaving cream or shave bar to your skin. Then, carefully shave the area until it’s smooth. For best results, apply moisturizer to your legs after you shave for softer, smoother skin.

      "content": "Opt for A-line skirts and dresses. An A-line fit is one that flares down and out at the hips. It’s great for balancing a body shape that’s wider up top, or accentuating body shapes that are wider down below. In short, it’s perfect for many trans women of most, if not all, body types. Of course, you’re not restricted to only A-lines. Maxi dresses are another key dress type in a woman’s wardrobe, and come in a variety of styles."

      "title": "Choose tops that minimize your shoulders.",
      "content": "Choose tops that minimize your shoulders. Many trans women are self-conscious about the width of their shoulders, and while we want you to feel comfortable in your body, we get it. To get a narrower look up top, go for long, deep necklines, darker fabrics, and more delicate fabrics and straps—avoid bulky fabrics or thick shoulder straps. Longer tunic tops are a great way to achieve a feminine shape in a looser, more comfortable style that goes well with things like leggings."

      "title": "Go for loose, boot-cut, or bell bottom pants.",
      "content": "Go for loose, boot-cut , or bell bottom pants. When in doubt, shun the skinny jean. Looser cuts with flared legs give you more room in the crotch, and deftly downplay a larger shoe size. This goes for everything from jeans to business pants. If you want to wiggle into some skinnies, go for it! They can be a great look with a big, loose top like a sweater or breezy blouse."

      "content": "Choose women’s shoes that are about 2 sizes larger than your men’s size. Shoes can be pretty tricky if you have larger feet, since options are limited. The important thing here is wear what’s comfy—don’t force yourself into too-small shoes just to downplay the size of your feet. Remember, work with your body, not against it! For heels, start with a low or block heel to help you get the hang of it. Heels are fabulous for lengthening your legs and accentuating your butt. For casual looks, don’t be afraid to grab sneakers, flats, or even sandals. Heels aren’t the end-all, be-all of a woman’s shoes."

And as a bonus, they add points of interest other than your body. At first, try adding 1 or 2 accessories to your look. As you develop your style, you might try adding more. For instance, you might wear dangly earrings to draw attention to your beautiful face or bangle bracelets to show off your wrists. Necklaces may not be the best option if you’re trying to hide your Adam’s apple. Try on a necklace before you buy it to see how it looks on you. Carry a handbag or purse if you like."
