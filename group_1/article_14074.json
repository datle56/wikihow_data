      "content": "Double-yolk eggs occur when a hen discharges 2 yolks instead of 1. To lay an egg, a hen lets out a single egg yolk from its ovary, which forms into the beautiful egg we all know and love during the next 26 hours. Young hens that haven’t settled into a consistent egg-laying routine occasionally dispense two egg yolks rather than just one, which creates the fabled double-yolk egg. A hen’s breed can play a factor in the yolk quantity, too. For instance, heavy-breed hens (like the Black Sex Link or Buff Orpington) are genetically more likely to lay double-yolk eggs. [1] X Research source These hen breeds aren’t common at commercial egg facilities, though, so your double-yolk can likely be chalked up to a young hen. [2] X Research source Typically, a fertilized egg with two yolks only hatches one chick (since one embryo dominates in the egg). In rare cases, two chicks can hatch from a single egg, but they often don’t survive by that point.

Independently, double-yolkers are pretty hard to find—if you were to crack 1,000 eggs total, only one of them would have two yolks. However, eggs collected from the same group of young hens are more likely have multiple double-yolkers in the same carton. In fact, your odds of finding a double-yolk egg go up to 1/100 once you’ve already found one in a batch.
