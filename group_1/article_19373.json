      "content": "Wash your ears and the surrounding area. If you notice a strange, cheesy smell behind your ears, wash the area as soon as possible. Often, it’s easy to forget to wash behind the ears because you wouldn’t think there’d be a lot of sweat and buildup in the area. However, improper washing is often the main cause of odors in the area. Scrubbing the area with soap and water can remove any dirt, debris, or product buildup that may be causing the smell. If that takes care of the smell and the area doesn’t hurt at all, you likely won’t need to do anything else. [1] X Research source Using a damp, soapy washcloth can really help, as it will exfoliate the area and remove dead skin and buildup that may be causing the smell. However you choose to wash, make sure to rinse the soap away and dry the area thoroughly."

      "content": "Disinfect the area with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. After you’ve washed behind your ears with soap and water, rub hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol behind your ears to disinfect the area. If your ears are pierced, the smell may be coming from a dirty piercing. Clean the piercing itself with mild soap and water; only use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol if it’s completely healed. [2] X Research source If your ears are pierced, clean your earrings regularly to prevent future issues. If you want a more natural alternative to hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol, try apple cider vinegar. Again, just make sure you aren’t using it in or around unhealed piercings."

If you sweat a lot, clean the area with a damp cloth or fragrance-free wipe, especially after exercising or being out in the heat. Try to keep the area as dry as possible by applying baby powder, antiperspirant, or stick deodorant. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid covering your ears. If the area behind your ears is constantly covered, it may lead to product buildup, which can clog your pores and cause an odor. If you have long hair, consider cutting it or keeping it pulled back away from your ears. Wash any hats, earmuffs, scarves, pillowcases, and anything else that touches your ears regularly to keep your ears clean.

Keep these products away from your ears to see if that reduces the smell. If you use multiple products, stop using them one at a time so you can see which one is causing the issue. If you stop using them all at once, you won’t know which, if any, is causing the odor.

To remove excess earwax at home, soften the earwax by applying a few drops of baby oil, hydrogen peroxide, or mineral oil with an eyedropper. [6] X Research source After a few days, use a rubber syringe to gently spray water into your ear. Tilt your head to allow the water to drain out, then dry your ear gently with a towel. According to Dr. Daneshrad, never use a Q-tip to clean inside your ears: “Ear infections are caused by…patients using foreign bodies like Q-tips in their ears. So, avoiding anything in the ear canal is the best way to avoid an ear infection.” If you don’t feel comfortable removing your earwax yourself, see a doctor."

Alternatively, speak to your pharmacist to see if they can recommend an over-the-counter product.

[12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source These secretions often build up behind the ears and may begin to smell.

[14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Earwax may also produce an odor if you have an ear infection or swimmer’s ear or if a foreign object is stuck in your ear. Dr. Kieu says a common symptom of swimmer’s ear is drainage: “The draining from the ear can be clear (just water) or it can be foul-smelling and white or yellow. I have even seen green, brown, or gray.” According to Dr. Daneshrad, “Earwax is a natural part of every human being’s ear canal, [and] it will move its way out of the ear canal on its own… Patients shouldn’t have to go and clean their ears, but if necessary, over-the-counter wax dissolving agents like Debrox can be used to clean the ears.”"

If you suspect your piercing is infected, see a doctor.
