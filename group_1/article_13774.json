      "content": "Stretch for the split. Stretching your legs will help you warm up before doing a Grande Jet√©. Kneel with both knees on the ground, but don't sit back. Extend your right leg forward until it is completely straight in front of you, with your heel on the ground. Lean down and place your fingers on the floor to either side of you. If this burns, hold this position. If not, scoot your heel forward until it does, and then hold. Repeat with the other leg. Perform this stretch every day until your legs are both flat on the floor and you are sitting comfortably. But please do not push yourself while doing the splits, as you may injure yourself. Allow yourself several weeks to reach a split. Go slowly and carefully to avoid a pulled muscle."

Inhale as you lower your hips almost to the floor, and breathe in again as you push up. Repeat this in repetition 30 times.

      "content": "Strengthen your jumping muscles. Start by jogging for around 15 paces, and then each time you take a stride, turn it into a leap. Focus on exploding of the ground as immediately and as far as possible on each jump. This is called bounding. Bound for around 30 yards (27.4 m), jog again, and then bound again. Three rounds of bounding is ideal."
