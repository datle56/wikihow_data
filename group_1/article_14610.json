      "content": "Dreams about car crashes typically indicate a big change is coming. A car crash is an abrupt, dramatic, and intense event. In one moment, you’re moving in a perfectly functioning vehicle. In the next, you’re not moving at all and the vehicle is a mess of metal, oil, and smoke. As a result, car crash dreams typically symbolize a major life change. You may be facing a big decision, or struggling with a serious obstacle that could change everything for you. Keep in mind that dream logic isn’t always simple or easy to understand. It’s very rare that symbolism and metaphors in a dream are super straightforward, so keep an open mind as you analyze your dream. These dreams are extremely common, so don’t worry if you’re having some unsettling dreams about car crashes. This is a universal dream that almost everybody will have at some point.

      "content": "You’re about to face an obstacle or stressful event. If you’re about to have a job interview, you’ve got a big test coming up, or you’re about to have a tough conversation with somebody, that anxiety may lead you to dream about a car crash. Don’t let that shake you, though! Whatever you’re facing, you can do it. Your subconscious is just making sure that you’re focused and sharp. Remember that change happens to everybody ! Whatever stressor or challenge you’re facing will pass. Just focus on the things you can control and put in the best effort you can."

      "title": "You’re dealing with a conflict in your relationship.",
      "content": "You’re dealing with a conflict in your relationship. If you’ve ever owned a car, you know how emotional and protective you can be over your ride. That’s comparable to the loyalty and love you may feel in a relationship, so perhaps the car represents your significant other. In this sense, a car crash dream may be your mind’s way of processing a problem you’re facing with your significant other. Perhaps you’re thinking about breaking up with them and the crash represents the turbulent end to your relationship. Maybe, your vehicle is falling apart in the dream and the crash represents the need to confront a problem you and your significant other are dealing with."

      "content": "You’re facing a major challenge at work. If you primarily use your vehicle to get to work, or you drive as a part of your job, it’s very likely the car is a metaphor for your job. If you’ve been having fights with a coworker, you’re fighting for a promotion, or you’re thinking about changing gigs, the crash may be a subconscious sign that it’s time to take action. If work has been extremely stressful lately, take a break. Call in sick or take a mental health day and just relax. You’ll probably have a much more peaceful sleep."

      "title": "You’re processing bad news.",
      "content": "You’re processing bad news. Our dreams are where we sort out the things we can’t make sense of in our conscious, waking life. A car crash is a random, catastrophic event, so if you just experienced a random negative event in your personal life, you might represent it as a car crash. If these dreams subside whenever you sort out your IRL problems, the car crash dreams were just a subconscious way of processing. [2] X Research source Don’t push yourself to “get over it” if you’re working through some complicated feelings or you’re having a rough time. You can always reach out to a mental health professional if you need support."

      "title": "You’re working through some regrets.",
      "content": "You’re working through some regrets. This is especially likely if you’re driving the car and you wake up feeling guilty or mournful. Car accidents can often be prevented, so if you’re feeling remorseful for a mistake you made, the crash may be your subconscious mind’s way of grappling with that responsibility. [3] X Research source If you’ve recently wronged someone, maybe this is a sign that it’s time to apologize . If you have been in conflict with a friend or family member and you can’t figure out if you were in the wrong, perhaps your dream is a sign that it’s time to take responsibility ."

      "content": "You’re feeling stuck and need to make a change. A car crash that immobilizes your vehicle can be a metaphor for you being trapped somewhere. Perhaps you’re in a job where you have no room to advance, or maybe you’re in a relationship where your partner refuses to commit and take things to the next level. In any case, it may time to change things. [4] X Research source If you’ve been considering changing careers, going back to school, or breaking things off with your partner, this may be the sign you need to take the plunge."

Maybe you’ve got a friend or family member who is about to take their driver’s license test. The human mind works in mysterious ways, and it’s possible that your dreams don’t really mean anything and you’ve just got car crashes on your mind for some reason. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "If you crash in a river or lake, you may be feeling trapped. People frequently dream of driving off a bridge or canyon and into a river or lake. The “drowning” component of the dream is a sign that you may be feeling stuck or “suffocated” by something going on in your life. Perhaps you think there’s no way out a dead-end job, or you can’t get away from a narcissistic parent. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "If you swerve off the road, you could be losing sight of a goal . Unless you’re dreaming about driving around randomly with no purpose, you’re probably going somewhere in that vehicle. So, a car crash is a sign that you’re veering off course. [7] X Research source This is a good time to take a step back and collect yourself. Take stock of where you’re at and figure out if there are any changes you need to make to get where you want to go ."

      "content": "If you’re navigating rocky roads, you may have hit a rough patch. You may not have even realized it, but perhaps your difficult dream travels are a sign you feel disturbed or uneven in your quest for personal fulfillment. Everyone runs into hard times in life, and maybe your dream is reflecting the anxieties and difficulties you’re encountering now. [8] X Research source Don’t be too hard on yourself. If you’re having a difficult go of things, it’s okay to be upset about it. However, if you can get back on the right path, there’s no time like now to get motivated."

      "content": "If you stole the car, perhaps you feel stripped of your identity. If you’re driving a stolen vehicle in your dream, it could be a sign that you aren’t feeling like yourself. Have you recently taken on a new role at work? Are you tasked with taking care of a loved one and you’re losing your independence? These kinds of major life shake-ups can really rattle you, so it’s understandable if you feel a little lost right now. [9] X Research source It’s normal to question who you are or feel a little unlike yourself after a major life change. The good news is that these feelings will subside over time as you adjust to your new responsibilities."

      "content": "If you aren’t hurt in the crash, you may need to solve a problem. If you escape from the car crash in your dream, it’s a sign that cleaning up the mess you’ve made is your responsibility. This could be your subconscious’s way or urging you to take the reigns and solve whatever big issue you’re currently facing in your life. [10] X Research source If you’ve been putting off going back to school, for example, and your parents are urging you to apply, this dream might be a sign it’s time to make a decision about going back to school."

It could be that you’re going to be “reborn” or go on a new journey in your life. In any case, death is something nobody can stop or control. If you’re dreaming of dying in a car accident, it could be a sign it’s time to let go or move on. [11] X Research source For example, if you’re thinking about moving in with your significant other but you have your reservations about the relationship working out, your dream may be a sign that it’s time to take a risk and trust that your decision to move will work out."

If you’re driving, you are the master of your destiny, and subconsciously, you know you’re in charge. Yes, the car crash in the dream may be a sign you’re facing down a problem or yearning for change, but you’re confident in your abilities to handle it. [12] X Research source Don’t shy away from your power. Don’t second guess yourself . You’re driving in the dream because you believe in yourself, and that’s a good thing!"

      "content": "If you’re riding shotgun, you may have issues with the driver. If you are a passenger but you’re in the front seat, it could indicate that you have unresolved problems with whoever is driving in your dream. Perhaps there’s a conflict brewing that needs to be worked out, or maybe you’re resentful without even knowing it. In any case, dig into your feelings to see if you can sort out what the tension might be. [13] X Research source If you don’t actually know who was driving the car in your dream, it could just indicate that you don’t feel like you’re in charge of your own destiny but dearly want to be."

      "content": "If you’re in one of the back seats, you may feel out of control. The back seats are far enough away from the driver’s seat that you’re firmly out of control of the vehicle. These dreams indicate that you don’t feel like you have any control over your current conditions. But this doesn’t mean you can’t change things when you wake up the next day. [14] X Research source Who is in the car with you matters a great deal. If you’re riding with coworkers, your dream is probably about work. If you’re riding with family, your dream is probably about your parents, siblings, or relatives."
