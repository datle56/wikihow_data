      "content": "Your vagina will clean itself, but consider using soap and water to wash your vulva. Your vagina naturally cleans itself even if there’s sperm in there. If you want to freshen up your vulva and outer areas, hop in the shower or wipe yourself. Lather up a clean washcloth with warm water and unscented soap and wipe your vulva from front to back. [3] X Research source You’re actually not cleaning your vagina here; you’re cleaning the vulva. The vagina is the passageway inside of your body that leads to the cervix. Don’t introduce any foreign cleaning products or contaminants by putting things inside of your vagina."

      "title": "There is no amount of cleaning in the vagina or vulva that will prevent pregnancy.",
      "content": "There is no amount of cleaning in the vagina or vulva that will prevent pregnancy. The white fluid that men ejaculate is semen, and in that semen is the sperm, which contains the male reproductive cells that lead to pregnancy. Unfortunately, semen moves extremely quickly, and it’s microscopic, which makes scraping or washing it out of the vagina impossible. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Cleaning your vulva will help you feel or smell cleaner, but it’s not going to impact any sperm inside of your vagina. Sperm cells can reach the uterus in under a minute in some cases, so it’s really not something you can realistically prevent from happening if the semen is already inside of the vagina. Even if you could remove the semen after sex, men produce pre-ejaculate (aka pre-cum), which is sperm and semen that comes out before a man has reached completion."

      "content": "You can urinate the semen out after sex. Urine actually comes out of the urethra, which is completely separate from the vagina. So, when you urinate after sex, your urine and the semen never actually cross paths. This may help prevent UTIs, but peeing won’t help prevent pregnancy or flush the semen out of your body.

      "content": "You can douche to flush the semen out. Douching involves filling a small douchebag with a cleaning solution and inserting it into the vagina to flush fluids out. If you’ve just had sex, it makes sense that douching might get the sperm out. Unfortunately, it doesn’t—the semen is just too fast and hard-to-reach. In fact, douching may even help the semen swim deeper in the vaginal canal, so don’t douche after sex. [6] X Research source While douching used to be a super popular part of the hygiene regimen for many women, it’s been proven to be not only unnecessary, but bad for your vaginal health.

[9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Even if you could flush your vagina out with bathwater, the sperm is likely going to already be at your cervix by the time you get your clothes off and draw your bath."

It’s a popular DIY remedy you might come across online, but it’s not going to help get sperm out of your body. [10] X Research source On top of that, vinegar will disrupt your vagina’s natural pH balance and kill off good bacteria you need to stay healthy and increase the odds you develop an infection.

Your body works just fine the way it is, and none of those chemicals belong in your vagina."

Don’t worry if you aren’t 18, either—in almost every state you can get condoms or birth control medications if you’re underage. [12] X Research source Here are the popular safe and proven options: Condoms – Using a condom is easy, inexpensive, and can help prevent the spread of STDs. Birth control pills – Taking pills on a regular schedule is a great way to prevent pregnancy, but you do need to see a doctor to get a prescription. Birth control shots – Getting a regular injection may be ideal if you don’t like a daily pill but you want something that requires no preparation on your end. IUD – Getting an IUD is a good option if you don’t want to remember a pill schedule. This device goes inside of you and blocks sperm from reaching the egg. Diaphragms , caps, and rings – Seeing a doctor to get a birth control device inserted can be a good middle-ground between a permanent IUD and a regular pill or shot."

This may help prevent an unwanted pregnancy. You can take the Plan B pill to prevent a pregnancy up to 5 days after having sex, but the faster you can take it, the more effective it will be.

The Plan B pill is not an “abortion pill” as some outlets have mistakenly reported. It simply prevents fertilization from taking place."

But that doesn’t mean it’s a good alternative to birth control. For one, it relies on a guy being perfectly in-tune with his body and having self-control. On top of that, men have pre-ejaculate that comes out before they finish, and that pre-ejaculate can get you pregnant.
