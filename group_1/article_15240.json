If you have darker hair or want a super vibrant color, it’s best to bleach your hair using the Manic Panic Flash Lightning bleach kit. Read the instructions that come with the kit, mixing the bleach powder with the developer thoroughly before applying the bleach to your hair evenly. [4] X Research source Before you start, protect the surface under you. Lay down newspaper or plastic bags, that way you don't stain your furniture. The kit comes with plastic gloves, bleach powder, developer, a plastic container for mixing, a tint brush, and a plastic cap. How long to leave the bleach in will depend on the natural color of your hair, so check it every ten minutes to see how light your hair has gotten. Wash your hair several times using shampoo if you bleach it to make sure all of the bleach is out of your hair. Bleaching your hair beforehand is especially important if you're dyeing it a pastel shade."

      "content": "Do a strand test to see how the color will affect your hair. Testing one small section of your hair with the dye will help you get an accurate idea of how your hair will look. Pick out a small section of your hair that’s hidden from view and apply the dye to it. Let it sit for 30 minutes, and then rinse it out with cold water. Dry your hair thoroughly to see what color the dye makes your hair. [7] X Research source The test section only needs to be about 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) in width. While it’s not required that you do a test strip, it’s a good way to know for sure how the dye will affect your hair before applying it to your whole head. Do a patch test using the hair dye by spreading a dot of it on your skin to make sure you're not allergic to it."

Start a small distance from the roots, brushing the dye onto each strand of hair and working your way down to the ends. If desired, you can use your fingers (with gloves on!) to rub the dye into each strand more thoroughly. [8] X Research source Consider separating your hair into sections to make it more manageable to dye, if desired. Short hair will likely use about half of a jar of dye, while longer hair will need a full jar."
