Wrap the tape measure around your neck to get its circumference. The average neck size is between 14-20 inches (35.56-50.8 cm) in circumference. If your neck is on the larger side and you're tall, consider getting a longer tie. [1] X Research source If you have a neck that's larger than 20 inches (50.8 cm) and you are over 6 feet (182.88 cm) tall, you should purchase a tie that's between 61-63 inches (155-160 cm) long."

[2] X Research source If you have a thicker neck but are short, you may be able to use a standard-sized tie. If you are 5 ft 8 in - 5 ft 9 in (168-175 cm) you may be able to get away with purchasing a standard sized tie and using a larger knot, like the Windsor knot . A large knot will cause your tie to hang higher. [3] X Research source"

This measurement should be close to the width of your tie at its widest point. Keep the tie width and the lapel width close. [10] X Research source For example, if the widest part of your lapel is 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide, you should get a tie that is also 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide. Sometimes the numbers won’t match up exactly. In this case, it’s okay to go up or down a fraction of an inch to match your lapel width."
