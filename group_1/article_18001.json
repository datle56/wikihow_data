      "content": "Begin with a piece of square paper. You can use origami paper or fold any piece of paper diagonally from the corner to the opposite edge and trim off the excess. It is important that the paper is square since you are creating a box. A trick is to fold your paper like a sail on a boat and cut the excess. [1] X Research source As you make each fold, run your fingernail or a creasing tool, such as a bone folder, along the crease. This will make each fold sharp and crisp, giving the box a clean, professional look."

For the purposes of the guide, the diamond furthest away from you formed by the \"necktie\" folds will be the \"head\" and the diamond closest to you will be the \"foot.\" Match the bottom tip of the foot diamond to the bottom of the head diamond. Then, match the top tip of the head diamond to the top of the foot diamond. Crease along the long sides to solidify the folds. [7] X Research source"

As you lift the head wall flap, the creases from previous folds should form two triangle shaped flaps that you will want to fold inwards. Be sure these triangles are folded inwards before proceeding. The head wall will fold over these triangle corners and the top triangle of the head wall will fit neatly into the bottom of the box where you will want to crease it snugly against the sides to keep the box together. After creasing, you should see a triangle on the bottom of the box. [8] X Research source"
