      "title": "Decide what type of gemstone to cut.",
      "content": "Decide what type of gemstone to cut. Because gemstones can vary in cost, learn to cut and facet less expensive gems. For example, work with fluorite before moving on to more expensive gems such as emeralds or garnets. For less expensive gems, start with quartz, fluorite, crystal, beryl, and tourmaline . If you're ready to work with semi-precious and precious gems, try sapphires, zircon, garnets, amethysts, and opals."

      "title": "Buy a rough or uncut gemstone.",
      "content": "Buy a rough or uncut gemstone. Decide what type of gem you'd like to cut and look for them at local gem and mineral fairs. You can buy rough or uncut stones directly from dealers which will give you the opportunity to handle the stones in person. You can also buy from dealers online, but you'll need to find a reputable dealer to be sure of what you're getting. A reputable online dealer should offer a 30-day return policy, offer a variety of payment options, and offer gem certification from an independent lab."

      "title": "Choose a basic shape for the gemstone.",
      "content": "Choose a basic shape for the gemstone. Look at the shape that the rough or uncut gemstone is already in. You might see that the gem already has a slight oval shape, so cutting it to an oval shape would be easier than making it into a square or rectangle cut. [1] X Research source Remember that the cut gem will be smaller than the rough gem, so choose a shape that won't waste too much of the gem. Other basic cuts include round, square, oval, and triangle."

    {
      "title": "Research cuts for your gem.",
      "content": "Research cuts for your gem. Once you have an idea of the shape you want for your gem, read books about various cuts. You can also take online tutorials from gem cutters or take classes at local community centers about choosing cuts. Common cuts include: [2] X Research source Square shapes such as asscher, antique (cushion), princess, emerald, octagon, or baguette. Round shapes such as briolette, cabochon, or radiant. Oval or triangular shapes such as marquise, trillion (trilliant), or heart."

      "title": "Use a faceting machine to preform the gem.",
      "content": "Use a faceting machine to preform the gem. Most uncut gems are oddly shaped so you may need to grind it down. Roughly grinding the outsides of the gem will make it closer to the size and shape you want. Hold the gem between your fingertips and carefully polish it on a 1200 grit lap. [3] X Research source If you have a lot of rough to remove, use a 260 grit lap. Since faceting machines are expensive and not usually available for rent, see if you can take a few faceting classes to become familiar with using them. If you want to buy one, find one directly from a manufacturer or look online."

      "title": "Secure the rough gem to a dop stick using warm wax.",
      "content": "Secure the rough gem to a dop stick using warm wax. Heat a dime-sized amount of dop wax on the end of your dop stick. Hold it near a flame so the wax softens and becomes pliable. Stick the base of the gem that will be mounted into the wax. The faced surface of the gem should be exposed. [4] X Research source Let the wax cool before you grind it so the gem stays on the dop stick. Once you've gained experience, consider using superglue or cyanoacrylate adhesives instead of wax. These are less likely to break off or damage heat-sensitive gems such as opals."

    {
      "title": "Grind the outlines of the stone to shape the girdle.",
      "content": "Grind the outlines of the stone to shape the girdle. Use a 1200 lap disc on your faceting machine to cut the circumference (girdle) of the gem. Set the angle to 90 degrees so you can make symmetrical cuts. Don't lock the index wheel on the machine so you can move it freely and have more control over cutting. [5] X Research source The outline you cut will depend on which shape you've chosen. For example, you'll make a rectangular girdle for an emerald cut. Consult the machine's instruction manual for specific instructions about each style of cut."

      "content": "Wipe grit from the gem and put a pre-polishing lap on the machine. Wipe the gem clean with a microfiber cloth. This will remove the coarser grit that's transferred to the gem. Take the coarser lap disc off of the machine and put a pre-polishing lap on the machine. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut the facets according to the shape you want.",
      "content": "Cut the facets according to the shape you want. Find faceting diagrams for the shape you're cutting the gem. A diagram will tell you how many facets to make and at what angles to make them. Polish the facets against the lap until the surfaces of the gem are smooth. To get the cut you want, you may have to reheat the dop wax, remove the rough, and reposition it in the hot wax. Heating the stone along with the wax will not harm it."

      "content": "Charge the polishing lap with an oxide polish. Put a polishing lap on your machine. Take the small spatula that came with your oxide polish and dip it into the polish so a peanut-sized amount is on the end of the spatula. Run the machine and spread the polish over the lap in a smooth even layer."

      "title": "Polish the top of the cut gem against the polishing lap.",
      "content": "Polish the top of the cut gem against the polishing lap. This will buff your new gemstone until it sparkles and will help remove any grit or imperfections leftover by the faceting process. To remove the finished stone from the dop stick, warm the wax near an open flame so it softens. Then pull the stone away from the wax."

      "title": "Select a softer gem for cutting without a machine.",
      "content": "Select a softer gem for cutting without a machine. While you can cut harder gems, they'll take more time and effort to cut. Instead, choose gems that are lower on the Mohs hardness scale. For example, these softer stones will cut easily: Fluorite Malachite Coral Pearl Amber"
