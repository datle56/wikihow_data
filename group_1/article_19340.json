      "content": "Wash your hands with dish soap and warm water. If your typical hand soap isn’t doing the trick, try using your dish soap instead, as it’s made to get rid of a wide variety of substance and smells. Lather up your hands, including between your fingers and under your fingernails, and then rinse them off with warm water. [1] X Research source It’s best if your dish soap is scented. The scent will help mask any bleach smell that remains even after washing. You may need to wash your hands several times to get rid of the bleach smell completely."

      "title": "Rub lemon juice on your hands for one minute to neutralize the smell.",
      "content": "Rub lemon juice on your hands for one minute to neutralize the smell. If you have washed your hands with soap and warm water but the smell of bleach still remains, try squeezing some lemon juice on them. You can either squeeze fresh lemon juice on both of your hands or a few squirts of bottled lemon juice from your fridge. After you have rubbed your hands together for a minute or so, rinse them with warm water. This should neutralize the smell of the bleach. [2] X Research source If you don’t have lemon juice on hand, you can use another type of citrus, such as limes or grapefruit. However, lemons work best."

      "title": "Apply a scented lotion to cover up the smell if cleaning your hands hasn’t worked.",
      "content": "Apply a scented lotion to cover up the smell if cleaning your hands hasn’t worked. If you still can smell the bleach after soap and lemon juice, it’s time to mask it with a scent you love. Squeeze a pea-sized amount of lotion on each hand and rub them together until the lotion is distributed all over the both. Pick a strong scented lotion that will keep smelling for a while. However, you can always reapply the lotion if you start smelling the bleach once again. Using lotion will also help your hands feel softer if they have been exposed to bleach, which can dry out the skin."

      "title": "Run your clothes through the wash again with only laundry detergent.",
      "content": "Run your clothes through the wash again with only laundry detergent. If you have washed your clothes with bleach and they smell like bleach after the cycle is done, consider running then through again, but this time only with detergent. In some cases, bleach doesn’t get washed out in the washing machine and another quick wash will get them smelling better. You can do a quick wash with a quarter of the amount of laundry detergent you would normally use if you need the clothes to be done as soon as possible."

      "title": "Add 1/4 cup (45 grams) of baking soda to your wash if the smell still is not gone.",
      "content": "Add 1/4 cup (45 grams) of baking soda to your wash if the smell still is not gone. Pour 1/4 (45 grams) cup of baking soda into the washer in the same way you add your laundry detergent. Then run the washer for a full cycle to allow the baking soda to deodorize your clothes."

      "content": "Hang your clothes outside to air out. If your clothes smell like bleach, putting them out in a well-ventilated area will help the smell dissipate more quickly. Hang them up on a clothes-drying line to make sure that all of them get fully aired out."

      "title": "Increase the ventilation in the room, if possible.",
      "content": "Increase the ventilation in the room, if possible. Open your windows or door if possible. Also blow a fan in the room or turn on an exhaust fan, if you have one. With a bit of airflow, the beach smell should dissipate quickly. [3] X Research source If you can’t open your doors or windows, such as when it’s cold outside, fans and air filters can be used to create ventilation. For example, you can turn on the air circulation feature in your furnace, if you have one."

      "content": "Spray a nice-smelling cleanser on your surfaces, if you prefer that smell. If you have a cleaner that you like the smell of better than bleach, it can be used to mask the smell of the bleach. Simply use the cleaner on your surfaces and wait for the smell to work its magic."

      "title": "Light a candle or spray a room deodorizer to eliminate the smell immediately.",
      "content": "Light a candle or spray a room deodorizer to eliminate the smell immediately. If you have a guest coming over or you just can’t stand the smell any longer, use a scented candle, room deodorizer, or any other highly scented product to mask the smell immediately. If you light a candle, be sure that you stay in the room while it is lit. Leaving an unattended candle burning creates a risk of fire."

      "title": "Clean with bleach more often to reduce the smell it creates.",
      "content": "Clean with bleach more often to reduce the smell it creates. The tell-tale smell in a room cleaned with bleach is created when the chemical in bleach breaks down proteins, such as pathogens on your counters. This means that if you clean more often with bleach, it will have less to break down, and thus will create less of a smell. [4] X Research source"
