      "title": "Yes, put the mirror inside or next to your normal trash.",
      "content": "Yes, put the mirror inside or next to your normal trash. If the mirror isn’t broken or cracked, you don’t need to do much else to it to get it ready to throw out. If you’re worried about the mirror breaking in transit to the waste facility, wrap it in cardboard and duct tape the edges shut before throwing it out. If any of the glass is broken or cracked, put duct tape over the crack if you’re worried about it shattering. If your city has a bulk or big-item pickup day, that’s the best option for an especially large mirror. You could also put a note on the front of your trash can with paper and a piece of tape that says something like, “contains glass,” so that the sanitation workers know to be extra careful. #*If the mirror doesn’t fit in the bin, just set it out next to the bin with a sign that says “trash” on it."

      "content": "Take the mirror to a landfill to dispose of it yourself as an alternative. If you’re concerned about animals or people accidentally getting hurt by a broken mirror or your city’s trash removal program is unclear on what you should do with the mirror, take it directly to a waste management facility yourself. [1] X Research source Check the hours of operation at the waste facility before you go to drop off the mirror."

      "title": "No, mirrors can’t be recycled.",
      "content": "No, mirrors can’t be recycled. Unfortunately, mirrors are extremely hard to recycle because the process is so different from how normal glass is recycled. You can always check with your local recycling facility, but most programs ask you to keep mirrors out of the recycling. [2] X Research source Some cities will collect mirrors along with the recycling and separate it later, but it’s not common. Mirror glass has two components—the actual glass, and the aluminum coating and metal underneath. These layers can be recycled, just not together. Unfortunately, since this process is very complex, most recycling centers don't do it."

      "title": "Tape over cracks before throwing out the mirror so the glass doesn’t come loose.",
      "content": "Tape over cracks before throwing out the mirror so the glass doesn’t come loose. If the mirror is cracked, the glass is at risk of falling out and hurting somebody. Put 2-3 strips of duct tape or masking tape over the entire length of the crack. If there is a section where a chunk of the mirror is missing, tape over that entire area, too. The tape helps hold the glass in the mirror in place. It also covers up any sharp edges that may not be visible but that could still cut you. If the mirror has broken into multiple pieces, don’t try to tape it back together. Wear cut-resistant gloves and wrap the pieces in newspaper before taping them into a bundle."

      "title": "Wrap broken mirror pieces in newspaper so they don’t cut anyone.",
      "content": "Wrap broken mirror pieces in newspaper so they don’t cut anyone. If your mirror has broken into pieces, don’t just throw those shards into the trash—they could easily cut a sanitation worker. Grab a stack of old newspaper and put on a pair of cut-resistant gloves . Wrap the shards of glass in 3-4 layers of newspaper, duct tape them closed, then put them into the trash. [3] X Research source If you don’t have newspaper, use an old towel or blanket. You can also use pieces of cardboard to sandwich the glass and hold it in place."

      "content": "Sell an unbroken mirror online or at an antique shop. If the mirror is in good condition, there’s always a chance that you could get some money back on your initial investment. Clean the mirror, lean it against a blank wall, and take a photo of it to post online . You could also take that photo to local antique shops to see if anyone is interested in buying it. [4] X Research source Check out the pricing on other mirrors that are for sale and price yours somewhere in the low to middle range if you want to sell it quickly. Package your mirror in a blanket or towel before transporting it anywhere to help keep it from breaking."

      "content": "Donate the mirror to a second-hand shop to help others. Call your local thrift stores to see if they accept mirrors as donations, as some may not have a need for them. Once you find a place that will accept your donation, wrap the mirror in a blanket and drop it off. [5] X Research source The blanket will keep the mirror safe while it’s in transit. Take a couple of minutes to clean the mirror before donating it."

Apply 2 coats of chalkboard paint , let it cure for 3-4 days, and then hang it up somewhere special. [6] X Research source This craft looks especially nice in a framed mirror. You could use your new message board to write quotes, notes, lists, meal plans, or anything else you can think of."

      "content": "Transform a broken mirror into a fun craft project. There are a lot of fun things you can make with the pieces of a broken mirror, but always wear protective leather gloves and use caution so you don’t cut yourself. If you’re a kid, ask an adult to help you with the craft. Though this list isn’t extensive, consider the following projects: [7] X Research source Create a mirror mosaic on a fence with large shards of mirror and super glue. Make a reflective gazing ball for a garden with small pieces of mirror, a bowling ball, and super glue. Design a stunning side table with artfully arranged pieces of broken mirror, an old table, and resin."

Hang it in a hallway, on the back of a door, above the dining room table, or on a wall in your living room. Think of it as a piece of art rather than as just a mirror. [8] X Research source You can buy new frames online or from the store, but you may also be able to find a cool frame at an antique or thrift store."

      "content": "Take the mirror outside and lay it on a large piece of cardboard. If your mirror is too big to fit into a trash can, you may need to break it into smaller pieces in order to get rid of it. Do this task outside so you don’t get small pieces of glass inside your home. Use a piece of cardboard that is slightly bigger than the mirror itself. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Tape the mirror off into a grid pattern with duct tape.",
      "content": "Tape the mirror off into a grid pattern with duct tape. When you break the mirror, the duct tape will hold the broken pieces together, which will make it a lot easier to fold them up and package them for disposal. To make a grid, place strips of tape both vertically and horizontally over the body of the mirror. [10] X Research source If you don’t have duct tape, you could also use masking tape. Just add more strips of tape to the mirror since masking tape is normally narrower than duct tape."

      "content": "Cover the mirror with cardboard and crack it into pieces with a hammer. Use a second, large piece of cardboard to ensure no small pieces of glass will fly up while you’re breaking the glass. Gently hit the mirror with a hammer over its entire surface. [11] X Research source You should audibly hear cracking when you hit the mirror. If you don’t, you may not be hitting it quite hard enough."

      "content": "Package smaller sections of glass in newspaper before throwing them away. Remove the top piece of cardboard and carefully fold the mirror over on itself. You may need to use a sharp knife to cut the duct tape in places. Prepare several smaller bundles of glass and wrap them in multiple sheets of newspaper before duct-taping them closed and throwing them out with the trash. [12] X Research source You could also sandwich smaller sections of the mirror between pieces of cardboard and secure the edges with duct tape so the glass can’t fall out. Then you can just put those packages into the trash."
