Probably the simplest way to put an end to your friendship is to just stop seeing them. Limit your interactions to group settings and avoid hanging out with them as much as you possibly can. Over time, your friendship will fade without much effort at all, and there may not be any fallout with your mutual friends. [2] X Research source It could take several months and maybe even years for a friendship to die out on its own, but it’ll happen eventually. You may not even need to really discuss your feelings too much this way. All you need to do is patiently wait for your friendship to fizzle out."

      "title": "Tell them it’s over and you want to move on.",
      "content": "Tell them it’s over and you want to move on. If you do want to discuss the end of your relationship with your friend, tell them you need to talk to them. Choose a neutral location where you can talk privately, such as a quiet cafe or a park. Talk about your feelings using “I” statements so they don’t feel like you’re blaming or accusing them. Tell them you think that it’s best if you put an end to your friendship and that you hope you can both peacefully move on. [3] X Research source For instance, you could say, “I don’t feel like my needs are being met and I think that it would be better for both of us if we stopped being friends.” You could also try, “I haven’t been super happy in a while and I don’t think things are working out really well. I think it would be better if we went our separate ways.” It may be difficult to sit down with a long-time friend, but it may also be the kindest, most respectful way to tell them."

If you’re dealing with an abusive or toxic friend, you don’t have to give them notice or talk about how much they’ve negatively affected you. Block their phone number, remove them from your social media, and just stop talking to them. If they’re really pushy and won’t take the hint, just tell them to stop contacting you. [5] X Research source Keep it short and simple with something like, “Please stop contacting me” or “I’m not interested in talking.” While this is the most extreme way to end your friendship, if you’ve been dealing with an abusive friend, you don’t have to put up with it anymore."

      "content": "Commit to being a better friend to the ones you love. Grab a pen and paper, pull up a word document, or fire up the notes app on your phone or tablet. Write down every mutual friend you share with your former friend and use your list to contact your mutual friends. Catch up with them and ask them how they’re doing. Tell them that you want to reconnect with them and make your friendship even stronger. [6] X Research source If you want, you can write down a nice thing you could do for them to reconnect and maintain your friendship. For instance, you could write “Calvin Johnson. Invite him over for pizza” or “Jackie Smith. Ask her to come to the beach with us.” If you’ve been unhappy with your former friendship, you may have neglected some of your other friends. Don’t worry. You have plenty of time to make things up to them."

It's fine to tell your friends your side of the story, but don't trash-talk the other person. Allow them to decide who they want to be friends with.

Because you have mutual friends, it’s very possible that you might run into your former friend at a party, coffee shop, or event. Don’t ignore them if that happens so your mutual friends don’t feel awkward. Instead, give them a pleasant, civil acknowledgment and don’t stress about it too much. [12] X Research source For instance, you could try something like, “Hi, hope you’re doing well” or “Hey, nice to see you” or even, “Hi, you look good.” In time, you won’t be as bothered about seeing them somewhere. Just stay calm and try to be civil when it happens."
