Keep wiping down the chrome with the pad until it reaches the patina that you desire. If you want to shine your chrome again, you can use a chrome cleaner and polish to return it to its original luster. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear the proper protective gear. Make sure that when you work with acid the room is well-ventilated so that you don't get sick from the fumes. Also, you'll want to wear a pair of rubber gloves, a face mask, and eye protection. Muriatic acid is highly dangerous and could cause serious medical problems if you get it on your skin or inhale it. [5] X Research source If you get the acid on your skin or eyes, flush it with water for at least 15 minutes before seeking professional medical attention. If you inhale the acid, go outside to get fresh air before seeking medical help."

If you can, make sure to detach the chrome from any plastic or any other materials that it's attached to before moving to the next step."

Once you get the acid, carefully pour it into a plastic or glass container so that it's high enough to completely submerge your chrome.

During this time, you should see the chrome finish begin to dissolve off of the metal. Once it has sat in the acid, you can remove it with your hands as long as you're wearing rubber gloves.

To neutralize the acid, pour a one-pound (453.59 g) box of sodium bicarbonate and an equal proportion of cold water until the acid stops fizzing. Once the acid stops fizzing, you can pour it down the sink. Pour the water into the acid slowly to prevent splashback."
