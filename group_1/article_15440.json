      "title": "Eat it by the forkful.",
      "content": "Eat it by the forkful. Raw sauerkraut can be enjoyed as is, by the forkful. Just take the jar out of the fridge, grab a fork, and enjoy the health benefits! Eat a forkful once or twice a day straight from the jar. Buy unpasteurized sauerkraut from the refrigerator section of your grocery store. Sauerkraut off the shelf will have been pasteurized which kills the helpful bacteria."

      "title": "Eat it warm or cold.",
      "content": "Eat it warm or cold. Cold sauerkraut is the best bet to reap all the natural health benefits. Sauerkraut should be kept in the fridge, even if you bought it off the shelf. Take the jar out of the fridge early if you want to have your sauerkraut at room temperature with your meal."

      "title": "Use it as a condiment.",
      "content": "Use it as a condiment. For many people, the only way they’ve encountered sauerkraut as a food option is as a condiment for street vendor sausages. From a long-standing German and Polish tradition of topping sausages, to ballpark hot dogs, sauerkraut adds a soft, acidic zing to any meal, not just when fatty meats are involved. Top your avocado toast with a forkful of sauerkraut or add a thin layer to any sandwich (not just the traditional Reuben), burger, or wrap (let the brine drip off first so your food doesn’t get soggy). Top your scrambled eggs with a little sauerkraut in the morning and you’ll feel full longer due to the cabbage’s fibre content. Try it as a mac and cheese topper."

      "content": "Add it to a salad or macro bowl. Bring the flavour and nutritional value up a notch by adding a forkful or two of sauerkraut to a simple salad. Make a simple salad of torn lettuce leaves, olive oil, lemon juice, and black pepper, then top with raw sauerkraut for a green salad with zing. [1] X Research source Sauerkraut pairs well with everything from shredded apple and carrot to ginger and mango, so be creative. The sweetness of apples and carrots perfectly balance the zip of the sauerkraut. Add or substitute it in any time you would eat pickles."

      "title": "Add sauerkraut to soups and stews.",
      "content": "Add sauerkraut to soups and stews. Sauerkraut goes well with everything from beef stew to carrot ginger soup. Cooking the sauerkraut into a dish will destroy the helpful bacteria. If you’re eating sauerkraut for the live bacteria, stir a forkful into your soup or stew just before you eat it instead. Make a potato bacon soup, then add a cup or two of sauerkraut, let it simmer for another 30 minutes, and serve."
