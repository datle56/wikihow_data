      "content": "Cut the fruit in half short-ways, across the equator. Set one half aside. This is the best way of cutting the fruit for eating it by itself.

      "title": "Eat them.",
      "content": "Eat them. Like a pomegranate , the seeds are perfectly edible, but are somewhat bland. What you're after is the sweet green flesh around the seed. You can take one at a time into your mouth and separate the seed before spitting it out, or take a whole mouthful and chew it up. If you don't like the seeds, try pinching the sac of fruit gently with your front teeth. Suck the sac of fruit through your top and bottom teeth, pinching enough to hold the seed on the outside of your teeth, yet still allowing the fruit to pass through."

      "title": "Consider scooping out the fruit.",
      "content": "Consider scooping out the fruit. You can also scoop out the seeds into a bowl and eat them with a spoon if you prefer. Its easier to break the little green kernels that way, but can be somewhat easier if you don't want to bury your face in the fruit. [4] X Research source"
