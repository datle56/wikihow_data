For a list of popular emojis and their names, jump to the next section in this article. [2] X Research source For example, if you want to add a smiling emoji to your text, say \"smiling emoji\" to your phone when Dictation is active. In order for your phone to type the correct emoji, you must use its pre-defined name. If you don't know the name of an emoji, check Unicode's full list of emojis . Note that not every emoji can be dictated. For example, \"smiling face with smiling eyes\" (or 😊) won't show up if you say \"smiling face with smiling eyes emoji.\" Instead, your phone will write \"smiling face with smiling 👀.\" Some emojis can be dictated with different names. For example, if you say \"loudly crying emoji\" or \"sobbing emoji\", your iPhone will write 😭 for both."
