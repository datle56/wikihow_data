In addition, look for background information on the attorney, such as his or her law school and areas of specialization. Look for some general information about the type of legal issue you need help with, including a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section, or a blog with articles pertaining to your legal issue. The best attorneys will maintain well-developed websites offering a lot of information. Most attorneys’ websites will provide information about each attorney working for the firm. Take a look at each attorney’s educational background and work history. Typically, you should look for an attorney with at least three to five years of experience practicing the type of law you need help with. Additionally, you should choose an attorney that currently practices in the area you need help with. Remember that many attorneys are also on social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook. Check these profiles as well. How an attorney conveys him- or herself to the public may help you get a sense of how you would be able to work with him or her."

Law firms can vary in size ranging from one attorney to many attorneys, so you need to choose a law firm that you think will be best suited to your situation. Big corporations may want to hire a big-time firm to handle extremely complicated, often international, legal matters. However, if you are simply looking for someone to help you with your divorce or to help you write a will, you should feel comfortable hiring an attorney from a smaller firm. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Make an appointment with any attorneys remaining on your list. Contact each attorney and set up a consultation. Most attorneys do consultation appointments for free. However, some may charge a small fee for a consultation. Make certain that you know whether you will be charged, and don't make an appointment with an attorney who isn't forthcoming about these details. Most attorneys offer consultations for free. Start your search with these before you consult with an attorney who charges for initial consultations. If you do not live in the same state as the attorney, you can schedule a phone consultation instead of an in-person meeting. However, because you will usually want your attorney to appear with you in court, you should try to find a local attorney to represent you."

      "content": "Write out questions about the lawyer's practice. You can generally find out the basic information about the attorney online, such as how long s/he has been practicing, where s/he went to law school, etc. For your in-person questions, ask about matters that are relevant to your specific case. The attorney should not have any problem answering any questions you may have, and should not sound hesitant or unsure. Areas to ask about include questions about the following: [3] X Research source [4] X Research source Pricing. You should ask whether the attorney offers hourly pricing or flat fees? Flat fee pricing is very popular for many areas of practice, particularly things like family law. Delivery time for legal work. You should ask how quickly you can expect for the attorney to complete your legal project. Your attorney will likely not be able to give you an exact number, but s/he should be able to tell you how long previous, similar cases have taken and when you can likely expect a resolution. Success rate. You will probably want to ask what the attorney’s track record is with cases like yours. Attorneys cannot guarantee an outcome (they are ethically forbidden to do so) but you should have an idea of what results you can reasonably expect. You can also ask for references from prior clients. Be aware that the attorney must obtain permission from prior clients before s/he can give you their information, so you may not get references immediately. Availability. You should ask how quickly the attorney can start. You should also ask who your primary contact throughout the case will be. Will you hear mostly from an assistant or junior colleague? You should know who to contact with questions about your case. Misconduct. If the attorney has misconduct or reprimands on his or her record – which you can find out at your state’s bar association website – ask about them. In some cases, the infraction may be minor, such as failure to pay bar fees on time. You must decide whether the infraction is significant enough to disturb you."

If s/he hesitated, used too much \"legalese,\" or didn't attend to your needs, pick someone else. If more than one attorney has the qualifications you are looking for, you should choose the one that you feel the most comfortable with."

      "title": "Understand how attorneys charge for their services.",
      "content": "Understand how attorneys charge for their services. Typically, there are three major ways that attorneys bill for their services: a flat fee, a contingency fee or hourly fees. [5] X Research source An attorney charging a flat fee will charge one fee (sometimes upfront) for handling an entire matter, regardless of how many hours the matter takes. Some examples of cases that are commonly handled using a flat fee are criminal cases, bankruptcy cases, domestic relations cases (such as divorce or custody matters), and document drafting, such as drafting a will or a trust document. An attorney charging a contingency fee does not collect legal fees from the client unless the attorney recovers money for the client, either through a settlement or a trial. The attorney will receive a percentage of the settlement amount, usually between 30 to 40 percent. Some examples of cases that are commonly handled on a contingency fee basis are personal injury cases, employment discrimination cases, and other types of cases where a large recovery from a corporation or business is expected. Lawyers charging an hourly rate “bill” hours and then charge the client for the amount of hours worked on the client’s matter. Usually, hourly rates are used by businesses and corporations who may be involved in litigation. Additionally, individuals may be charged hourly rates for long or complicated litigation.

      "content": "Negotiate a fee. Budget what you are able to spend, and ask if the attorney will be able to handle your case for the amount you budgeted. Additionally, you should make sure to tell your attorney that he or she should inform you before doing anything on your case that takes it out of budget. Keep in mind that even with a strict budget, if your case becomes significantly more complicated or takes significantly longer than the attorney originally anticipated, you may need to pay more in legal fees. If you cannot afford the attorney’s fees upfront, ask about potential arrangements such as payment plans. Many attorneys are willing to work with you base on your financial needs. There are several ways that attorneys can help those on moderate or low incomes find legal counsel. Many firms offer \"sliding fees\" based on your income, so that you pay however much your income level allows.

This is a contract between you and your attorney that defines the nature of the legal engagement you are involved in, and the conditions and terms of your agreement with your attorney. These conditions should include the expenses you are responsible for, the rate the attorney will be charging and the minimum billable increment.
