      "content": "Create an ingredients list with the quantity required for each. If you have an online version of a recipe, or if you created the recipe yourself in the kitchen, write out the ingredients list. Next to each ingredient include how much is required. [1] X Research source If you have a printed copy of the recipe, then this step is already done for you!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down the price of any full units of ingredients that you are using.",
      "content": "Write down the price of any full units of ingredients that you are using. For ingredients that you are using the full amount that you purchased for the recipe, then you don’t need to calculate anything just yet. Put the amount that it cost next to it on the ingredients list that you wrote. [2] X Research source For example, if you are using a full tin of diced tomatoes, or one whole avocado, then you can put the purchase price directly next to the item on the ingredients list. Use your receipts or grocery store websites to find the price for each item."
    },
    {
      "title": "Convert the measurement units to those that are used by the recipe.",
      "content": "Convert the measurement units to those that are used by the recipe. If the recipe uses a different unit of measurement than that stated on the packaging, then use a search engine to convert the packing unit to that stated on the ingredients list. For example, if an ingredient states 4 oz (113 g) of diced tomatoes, and the can was measured in grams, then use a search engine to convert the weight of the tomatoes in the can to ounces first. [3] X Research source Common conversions include 3 tsp = 1 Tbsp. 4 Tbsp = ¼ cup. 2 Tbsp = ounce (volume). 16 Tbsp = 1 cup."
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide the required amount by the full unit amount for partial ingredients.",
      "content": "Divide the required amount by the full unit amount for partial ingredients. Most of your ingredients on your list will only be one part of the full unit that you purchased. To calculate the cost, divide the amount that the recipe requires by the full amount that is in the unit that you purchased. This gives you the proportion of the full unit that you will use for the recipe. [4] X Research source Some recipes will call for specific amounts, such as 500 g (1.1 lb) of mince. This makes calculating how much you use easy, because if you bought a 1000 g (2.2 lb) pack it would be 500 / 1000, which works out to be 0.5. For recipes that don’t specify a numerical quantity, and instead say a handful, a pinch, or a sprinkle, weigh out the amount that you plan to use. Then you can do the calculation. For example, if you needed two handfuls of spinach, place two handfuls on a set of kitchen scales, and record the weight. If the spinach that is required weighs 100 g (3.5 oz), and you purchased a 300 g (10.6 oz) bag, then you calculation would be 100 / 300, which is 0.3."
    },
    {
      "title": "Multiply the proportion of partial ingredients by the full purchase cost.",
      "content": "Multiply the proportion of partial ingredients by the full purchase cost. Use the numbers that you just calculated for each partial ingredient to work out the cost of using each one in your recipe. For example, if your proportion of spinach is 0.3, and you bought a bag for $2.00, you calculation would be 0.3 x 2, which equals 0.6. This means that the cost for the spinach that you are using in your recipe would be $0.60. [5] X Research source For the mince example, the proportion that you calculated was required for your recipe is 0.5. This means that if the full unit of mince cost $10.00, the amount that is used for the recipe cost $5.00. Write down each cost that you calculated next to the ingredient on the list."

      "content": "Add all of the calculated prices for the ingredients together. You can do the calculation in your head if you just have a few ingredients, or otherwise you can use a calculator, spreadsheet or the internet to do the same thing. The final result will give you the total cost of the recipe. [6] X Research source If your ingredients list is long, you might want to double check your end total by calculating it again, to make sure it is accurate."

    {
      "title": "Divide the total recipe cost by the number of servings.",
      "content": "Divide the total recipe cost by the number of servings. This will give you the recipe cost per serving. For example, if your calculations show that a recipe costs $12.00 to make, and it makes 4 servings, 12 / 4 = 3, which means that the recipe costs $3.00 per serving. [7] X Research source"

Many of these are free, but there are paid upgrades available, which may be particularly helpful if you are a in a food business.

You will be given an end total which tells you how much the recipe costs to make, both fully and per serving. Some websites and apps will also be able to calculate your profit if you are part of a food business. Calculating the labour cost for each recipe is also an option if you prefer."
