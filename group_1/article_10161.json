    {
      "title": "Seek answers from adults.",
      "content": "Seek answers from adults. Your dad's death may have left you with lots of confusion or unanswered questions. Though your mom or other relatives might be trying to protect you, it's understandable that you want to know the truth. Talk to your family and tell them what you'd like to know. You might say, “Hey Aunt Judy, I know everyone is saying that Dad got in a car wreck, but no one is saying how. I have a lot of questions. Can you answer them for me?” The more you know about the situation, the easier it will be for you to properly grieve. Don't be afraid to ask questions that you want or need to know the answer to."

    {
      "title": "Cry it out if you need to.",
      "content": "Cry it out if you need to. During this difficult time, try to spend some time each day just being sad. Crying can help you grieve by getting your emotions out. Don't be embarrassed to show how you're feeling, even if you have to cry in front of others. They'll understand. Sometimes, you might also feel numb or completely in shock, and that's okay, too. If you can't cry, don't force yourself. Just take some time to be alone with your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spend time reminiscing.",
      "content": "Spend time reminiscing. Take some time to reflect on all the memories you have of your father. Pull out some photo albums and remember him as he was. This will probably make you feel sad, and that's normal. You'll also feel moments of happiness as you reflect on good times. Reflect especially on the times you spent alone with your dad. Remember that those memories are special because they are only between the two of you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your siblings if you have any.",
      "content": "Talk to your siblings if you have any. Though it's nice to talk to adults during this time, sometimes conversations with others can be more helpful. If your dad had other kids, talk to them, especially if you're around the same age. They'll be able to understand your pain better than anyone because he was their dad, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down your thoughts.",
      "content": "Write down your thoughts. Writing can help you release all of the pent-up feelings you may have. At the end of each day or when you're having a really tough moment, jot down your feelings on paper. Sometimes, getting your thoughts out can be just the release you need to feel better. For instance, you might write, “I just had a breakdown because I was shopping and saw some fishing gear and Dad always loved fishing. I wish I could fish with him again.”"

      "title": "Express your feelings in creative ways.",
      "content": "Express your feelings in creative ways. Maybe you don't really feel like talking about your dad right now, or maybe you feel more angry than sad. You can find other ways to get your emotions out. You might choose to draw, paint, listen to music, or reorganize your room. Just do what feels right to you. Try drawing or coloring memories that you have with your father. You might choose to create images that would have been meaningful to your father. For example, if your father loved to fish, you might draw a lake."

      "content": "Pick a few items of his to keep. There are probably a few really important things of your dad's that you'd like to have.

      "title": "Ask for some time off from school if you need it.",
      "content": "Ask for some time off from school if you need it. If you're still in grade school, you might find that it will be hard to focus while you're coping with the loss. Ask your mom or guardian if you can stay out of school for a week or so. Though you'll still be dealing with your dad's death then, some of the shock will have worn off. [1] X Research source You can say, “Hey Mom, I know that school starts back on Monday, but I just don't feel ready. I'm still really sad and I'm afraid I'll cry in class. Can I have a few days off?” If you have to go back to school, try to take it day by day. Tell your teachers what happened and take notes so you can stay focused."

      "content": "Find ways to honor your dad on important days. After your dad's death, his birthday, Father's Day, or other major holidays may be really tough for you. Instead of dreading these days, do something for your dad instead. Plan a family dinner where you all can share stories about how funny he was. You can also do something that he always enjoyed doing, like playing baseball or volunteering. [2] X Research source Try not to be alone on these days since they can be really tough. It might be hard to face important holidays, but try to do it. Actively remembering your father on these days will help the healing process go faster, not slower."

      "content": "Remember that it's not your fault. Sometimes, when people close to you die, you might blame yourself. You might be thinking, “If I were better to my dad, maybe he'd still be here.” Remember that there is nothing you could have done to prevent this and it's not your fault! It's normal to wish your dad were still here, but don't beat yourself up about things you didn't do or can't change. [3] X Research source If you had a fight with your father in his last days, remember that your father would have forgiven you. Try not to blame yourself."

Find a few people you can confide in about how you're feeling and have them on speed dial for the particularly bad days. You might choose to talk to your mom, grandparent, sibling, guidance counselor, or friend. For instance, you might call up a friend who lost her mom a while back. You can say, “Hey, I know you lost your mom a few years ago. I guess I always knew my dad would die one day, but this was so sudden. I didn't get to tell him goodbye and I'm having a hard time with that.” If you try to talk to someone whose parent recently passed, be aware that they might not be ready to talk about it yet."

      "content": "Spend time with friends and family. Though alone time is necessary, too much of it during this period can be isolating. Try to be alone for no more than three hours during the day.

If you can't sleep, try taking a relaxing bath before bedtime and cutting out caffeine after 12 PM. [4] X Research source Exercise is great, too!
