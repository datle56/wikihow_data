      "content": "Use moisturizer to improve your skin's texture. Moisturizers have many benefits for your skin like protecting it from breakouts, improving tone and texture, and covering up imperfections. Not all skin is the same, therefore, the moisturizer you choose will depend on if you have dry, oily, sensitive, or normal skin. In general, some of the best natural moisturizers contain jojoba oil, honey, shea butter, and coconut oil. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Water-based moisturizers go with nearly all skin types because they typically contain light oils, silicone-derived ingredients, and leave a non-greasy feel to them after application. For dry skin, consider a heavier, oil-based moisturizer that focus on hydration. If you have acne or oily skin, use a water-based moisturizer that is classified as non-comedogenic because it won't clog your pores. Sensitive skin prone to irritation, redness, or rashes requires a more soothing moisturizer with chamomile or aloe. Look for a hypoallergenic product as well."

Honey can also reduce redness and inflammation from acne. Wash your hands and use your finger to dab some honey onto inflamed areas. Leave it on for 30 minutes and then rinse it off with cool water. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Regular food-grade honey won't work as well because it might have preservatives or chemicals that actually increase inflammation.

If the outer layer of skin, the epidermis, does not retain enough water, it will lose elasticity and feel coarse. Drink 8-10 glasses of water per day to stay hydrated. Despite the connection between water and a hydrated epidermis, there is no evidence that drinking excess water will increase the hydration of your skin. This amount of water is just a guideline, and you may need to drink more if you exercise or live in a hot climate."
