      "content": "Learn about the different kinds of psychic abilities. Some psychics are strongest in one psychic area or they choose to focus on one at the expense of others. Imagine you are using your “ third eye ” – the chakra (or energy field) that is located above your real eyes. Visualize this third eye opening and expanding. See what you notice in the mind’s “inner screen.” Try this with your eyes shut. Clairvoyance means you are able to see spirit images. One aspect of clairvoyance is “remote viewing,” which is the ability to see things that are not known by the common senses. Clairvoyants work through the aura to receive impressions from spirit communicators. [2] X Research source For remote viewing, determine a remote location you want to sense. Shut your eyes, and think about the location. Shift your intention upward to your third eye. Note the first impression you have, and write it down. Clairaudience means the ability to receive spirit impressions but in the form of sounds. Words are transmitted through the aura into the medium’s subconscious as if the medium is a telephone. To practice clairaudience, repeat a word in your mind as you think it. This helps develop your inner voice. Clairsentience is the ability to sense the presence of a spirit, including its emotions and personality."

      "title": "Practice your psychic ability with small objects.",
      "content": "Practice your psychic ability with small objects. Some psychics, such as those working on criminal investigations, will use clothing. The key is to find an object that’s been used, as psychics believe it will have more energy than an unused object. Put the object in your hands, close your eyes, relax, and feel – what your body feels. You could ask yourself whether you think the object belonged to a man or woman, what the emotions were of the person who owned it, and what kind of work they did. Write what comes to you as instinct. This is called an energetic impression. Don’t edit anything. It’s best if the person who gives you the object actually knows the owner but doesn’t tell you. That way you can compare what you write down to the actual facts."

      "title": "Try other exercises with objects.",
      "content": "Try other exercises with objects. Have someone hide an object, and see if you can find it. The key, again, is to see whether you can sense the energy in the object. Try to “feel” where the object is located. Visualize yourself connecting with the object’s energy in order to figure out its location. Ask yourself whether it seems somewhere high or low, and whether it’s hidden under something or placed inside of something. You could use pictures instead of objects. Have a friend select photos out of magazines, and seal them in envelopes. Then, see how many details you come up with about the photos."

      "title": "Meditate",
      "content": "Meditate in order to develop your psychic abilities. This will allow you to clear your mind and better focus on your sixth sense. It's extremely important that you reduce clutter. Upon waking in the morning, make an effort to lie still for a few minutes without opening your eyes. Try to notice as many sounds, textures, and smells as possible before you decide to open your eyes. This exercise, if carried out for several weeks, can greatly help to increase your levels of awareness and intuition. To meditate, close your eyes and draw in a deep and slow breath. Then, inhale through your nose. Hold the breath in for a moment. Breathe back out through your mouth. Playing soft music in the background could help you still your mind. Or you could chant a mantra to do so – this is a word or short phrase that you repeat to yourself over and over again. The goal is to screen out unwanted mental clutter. The reason meditation works is that it helps you turn off your analytical mind and free up the subconscious mind. Imagine a “plus” sign when you inhale, and imagine a “minus” sign when you exhale. Do this exercise repeatedly. Clear your mind of all negative thoughts, as they can impede psychic abilities. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn how to rely on and recognize intuition.",
      "content": "Learn how to rely on and recognize intuition . Intuition is a belief or sense of something that is not anchored to logical reasoning. It’s a gut instinct that transcends logic. Although everyone has intuition, some people are able to develop it more than other people. Work on developing your intuition by trusting it; it’s the gut feelings you get when you first meet someone. [4] X Research source Make sure your motives are pure; that will free up psychic tendencies. [5] X Research source Pay attention to random thoughts and feelings. Keep a journal handy at all times, and try to write down those thoughts that seem to come out of nowhere. You may notice after a while that patterns tend to emerge. Thoughts that previously seemed completely random and unconnected begin to form themes or recognizable ideas. [6] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. Allowing yourself a few minutes to be still upon waking makes it much easier to remember dreams with more detail than if you rush out of bed in the morning and hurry to start the day. Try setting your alarm clock to wake you up ten or fifteen minutes before your normal waking time. Give yourself some time to remember your dreams and make a few quick notes in your journal. The subconscious is more unrestrained during sleep."

      "content": "Study the major chakras and work on unblocking them. Within the body are seven major chakras. These are openings in which energy flows in and out of the body. The top two chakras are mental centers, the four on the front deal with emotions and the four on the back of the body focus on will. The root chakra relates to physical. [10] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. If a chakra is blocked, energy doesn’t flow. This can cause illness and suppression of emotion. If chakras are too open, this can lead to overreaction and emotional problems.

Shut your actual eyes, and imagine the third eye opening more. [12] X Research source"

If you learn how to sense a person’s aura, you can better perceive their thoughts. [13] X Research source Energy is everywhere, including radiating from the body. Stand about 10 feet away from another person. Have them stand against a plain white or black background. Look at their nose with a relaxed gaze, and use your peripheral vision. The aura will look like a slight fog first. Keep your gaze at the fog. Once you see it, hold the gaze and you should be able to see it. When you blink the aura will probably disappear."

      "content": "Be still and quiet in order to perceive natural energy. You will want to get out of the clutter of modern life with all of its distractions to perceive energy better.

Drink in the beauty of natural sounds, like the chirping of birds, the babbling of water from a brook, waterfall, etc. These natural echos are known to enhance intuition and psychic abilities. Remove the distractions of electronic devices - cell phones, television, and even electric lighting can be a barrier to psychic abilities."
