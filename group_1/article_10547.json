Ethernet: Use the Ethernet cable to connect both routers using the Ethernet port. Connect one end of the Ethernet cable into to the Ethernet port of the primary router and the other end into the Ethernet port of the secondary router. Wi-Fi : Go to secondary router’s settings page and Login with credentials. Check the back or the bottom of your router for the address. The address might either be a link or a series of numbers. For example, http://login.net or 192.168.x.x. In most cases, the username and password can be found next to the address information. If username and password are not present, try “admin” for the username and “password” for the password. If this does not work contact ISP. Locate and enter the secondary router's settings page. Find the setup/settings page for your secondary router. Set up the secondary router. Click on the range extender button on the settings page in your secondary router. Connect the secondary router. Search and connect the secondary router to the already existing network."
