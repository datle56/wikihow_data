      "content": "DDF stands for “drug & disease free.” The acronym DDF was originally used in print ads to indication the person doesn’t use drugs or have sexually transmitted diseases or infections. It’s commonly used by the LGBTQ+ community but is sometimes used by heterosexual users on dating apps. The abbreviation may be more commonly used in LGBTQ+ spaces because the high mortality rates among gay men during the AIDS epidemic made them more aware of the risks associated with unprotected sex. This led to routine HIV testing and the widespread use of condoms. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The “disease” in DDF has historically referred to a person’s HIV status, but it can also mean other STDs and STIs, like herpes, chlamydia, or gonorrhea. “Drug-free” has also become a more ambiguous term with the legalization of marijuana in many areas. Some may consider it to be a drug, while others see it in the same category as alcohol. DDF refers to a person’s current status. They may use the term even if they have used illegal drugs or had an illness in the past but are no longer using drugs and are currently healthy."

      "content": "DDF is often used to communicate someone's health status online. A person might add DDF to their dating profile to indicate they don’t currently have any STIs or STDs. While this status was historically used only to indicate HIV status, many interpret it as meaning someone is free of any STI or STD. People often share their health status using DDF on adult chat forums, in ads on dating sites, as a text response to a potential partner interested in their current state of health, or in a post on social media platforms. For example, a profile may read: \"DDF man seeking casual partners.\""

      "content": "DDF can also indicate what type of partner someone is looking for. Some may request connections that are DDF in their dating profile to let other users know what type of person they want in a partner, whether for a casual or more serious relationship. It’s possible that someone who doesn’t use drugs and is disease-free may share their values if they include that status. For instance, a profile may say something like, \"Seeking a DDF partner to share my life with.\" Remember, there’s no way to know if the person is being truthful about their status, so make sure to take the necessary precautions to keep yourself safe during sexual contact , such as using condoms properly or taking other protective measures.

Even if your interactions are casual, it’s important to treat others with respect. Making them aware of potential STDs or STIs also helps protect their health and well-being. [3] X Research source If you find out you have an STD or STI and you’ve already had sexual contact, telling your partner gives them the chance to see a doctor for treatment. Remember, even if you get treatment, your partner can reinfect you if they haven’t had the chance to get treatment themselves."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Using DDF is seen by some as an extension of that stigma. Those receiving treatment for HIV often have undetectable viral loads that make transmission during sex extremely unlikely.

It also doesn’t take the place of regular testing and practicing safer sex. In some cases, a person may not even know that they have an STD or STI. Using a barrier – like condoms, dental dams, and latex gloves – during sexual contact can help protect both partners from STDs and STIs. People who are sexually active should get tested for STDs and STIs regularly, even if they use barriers and feel fine. [7] X Research source"
