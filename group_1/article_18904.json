      "content": "A planner makes it easy to track homework, assignments, and due dates. Whether it's a day planner you carry in your backpack, a calendar on your wall at home, a to-do list, it can help you stay organized. At the beginning of the term, when you get your planner, note down every test, quiz, and assignment due date. Do this for each class. [1] X Expert Source Jennifer Kaifesh Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Every day when you get home from school, check your calendar and see what needs to be done before tomorrow, as well as what's on the horizon for the next few days. Check off what you have already done so you don’t get confused."

      "title": "Raise your hand to ask and answer questions.",
      "content": "Raise your hand to ask and answer questions. Some classes even grade you on participation, so it’s important to make your voice heard. If you ever feel stuck or confused, raise your hand and ask the teacher for clarification. If you have trouble paying attention in class, try to sit near the front so it’s harder to get distracted. [2] X Research source If you’re an auditory learner, try recording the lectures so you can listen to them later on. Your teacher will really appreciate it if you participate, especially if you’re one of the only people doing so. And if you get on their good side, they’re more likely to be lenient on you during the grading process."

      "title": "Write down the most relevant information during class.",
      "content": "Write down the most relevant information during class. You don’t have to copy everything the teacher says (you probably won’t have time), but make sure you write down key concepts. Anything your teacher writes on the board or projects to the class is probably worth writing down. [3] X Research source To write notes quickly, try using shorthand instead of full sentences. For instance, if you’re in math class, shorten “geometry” to “geo” and “algebra” into “alg.” Understand the 80/20 rule of studying: 80% of the test questions surround 20% of the most important concepts. If you are crammed for time figure out these core concepts by looking at past tests and study these first."

      "title": "Your teacher is there to answer any questions you might have.",
      "content": "Your teacher is there to answer any questions you might have. It doesn't have to be a complex question; your teacher is always happy to help you. Ask after class, during office hours, or in an e-mail for assistance. [4] X Research source Often things we're told one-on-one stick with us more than things we're just being lectured about. If you’re a visual learner, try asking the teacher for handouts or study guides you can use. If you’re a hands-on learner, your teacher might have suggestions for you on how you can translate your work into good study material."

      "title": "You might struggle with some subjects, and that’s okay.",
      "content": "You might struggle with some subjects, and that’s okay. If the subject is super hard and you just can't understand it, get a tutor to help you. Sometimes a tutor is even more helpful than getting a one-on-one with a teacher because they are closer to your age and can explain things to you in a manner that you can understand better. [5] X Research source Your school might also have a tutoring center where you can go and get help from different departments."

      "title": "Try to stick to the schedule as much as possible.",
      "content": "Try to stick to the schedule as much as possible. Map out your week to see when your studying can and should get done. That way you know just how much time you can devote to each class and when it makes the most sense to study for each one. It’s up to you how often you need to study, but be sure to make more time for the tougher classes. [6] X Research source Use your common sense when it comes to allotting time to specific classes. For example, Badminton needs a lot less time than the Principles of Celestial Mechanics. Reader Poll: We asked 504 wikiHow readers how they like to prepare for a multiple choice exam, and 50% of them said studying in advance and following a study schedule. [Take Poll] This works for other types of exams, too!"

      "title": "Studying with your friends can help you understand tough concepts.",
      "content": "Studying with your friends can help you understand tough concepts. Bouncing ideas off each other and combining knowledge is a great way to study for tests and do homework. Just make sure you don't distract each other or spend your whole time chatting with each other about the day! [7] X Research source This takes the information off the page and makes it fun and memorable. When you have to explain something to a friend, you think about it in a different way that can make it easier to understand."

      "title": "Mnemonic devices can help you remember tough information.",
      "content": "Mnemonic devices can help you remember tough information. Odds are, you probably know Roy G. Biv for the order of the colors of the rainbow or \"My very exhausted mother just slept until noon.\" for the order of the planets. Why is that? They're effective mnemonic devices that stick in your mind! [8] X Research source Associations work, too. If you're trying to remember that India used to be a British colony, picture the queen jogging laps around the Taj Mahal. When the test comes, you may not remember what you actually should remember, but you'll remember enough to jog your memory!"

      "content": "Cramming isn’t the most effective way to retain information. Although it’s inevitable sometimes, the best way to study is to do a little bit each day up until the test. Try to start studying a full week before you need to use the information. [9] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Try not to pull all-nighters before a test, either. If you’re tired and groggy, you won’t be able to think clearly and effectively."

      "title": "They’ll help you prepare for the real thing.",
      "content": "They’ll help you prepare for the real thing. Look up a practice test online in your subject of choice and try to answer it as best you can. Check your answers, then go back over anything that you missed. [10] X Research source There are tons of practice tests for big exams like the SAT or the ACT online. If you have trouble finding a practice test, ask your teacher to give you one."

      "title": "Taking breaks gives your brain a chance to relax.",
      "content": "Taking breaks gives your brain a chance to relax. When you’re studying or doing homework, be sure to give yourself time to pause. You can walk around your house, get a snack, or go take a quick jaunt around the neighborhood. [11] X Research source Make sure you do something on your break that’s actually relaxing. It will help you feel rested and ready to tackle the rest of your work."

      "title": "Studies show that breakfast can really put your best foot forward.",
      "content": "Studies show that breakfast can really put your best foot forward. Before you head to class in the morning, try to eat a little something to fill up your stomach and give you fuel until lunch time. If you really aren’t hungry, grab a granola bar or a yogurt so you can eat it later on. Pick a breakfast that’s both filling and nutritious. Go for oatmeal, toast, bagels, eggs, fresh fruit, yogurt, or granola to fuel your mind and your body."
