      "content": "Create a LinkedIn profile. This is one of the main social networking sites used by employers looking for future employees. [1] X Expert Source Alyson Garrido, PCC Career Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. Crafting a profile is relatively easy and LinkedIn provides online instructions and prompts to help users. After you’ve filled out your profile, start to send out connection invitations to friends, family, and professional associates. You can also ask your LinkedIn connections to introduce you to other people, which will expand your potential job pool even more. [2] X Research source It’s important that your profile be 100% complete. Spend some time filling out all of the website questionnaires and uploading any professional documents that you have available. Every time that you make a major update to your resume, go ahead and upload the new document to your page. As you see who is viewing your LinkedIn page, don’t be afraid to reach out to them for advice or assistance. This is how many online connections are made. ZoomInfo is another site that can be beneficial for an online job search. If you create an account, it will give you access to updated contact information for companies."

[3] X Expert Source Alyson Garrido, PCC Career Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. Many potential employers will do this as well, so it’s a great way to determine what they may be seeing. Make note of any negative hits, so that you can work to remove or bury them. The best way to do this is to post additional positive news about yourself on social media or other website and then wait for it to get hits. [4] X Research source If you don’t pull up at all on search engines, this can also be a problem. Keep monitoring these searches as you add your resume to job search sites."

      "content": "Remove any negative information about yourself on social media. Open up each of the social media sites, such as Facebook, and work your way through your profile from top to bottom. Delete anything that is even borderline unprofessional."

      "content": "Adjust your social media settings to “Private.” Open the “Settings” menu of each of your social media profiles. Move any privacy options to “Private” or “Not Public.” This will limit the amount of personal information that is available about you online."

      "content": "Comment on or create your own professional blog or website. Go to professional blogs or websites in your area of interest and make a habit of commenting or even submitting full entries. Try to establish connections with other people that you find online who share your ambitions. You can also upload videos of any professional presentations that you’ve done. [5] X Research source You might even consider starting your own blog or creating your own website. This will allow you to shape what information shows up in search results about you. Keep the information focused on your professional life and use it as an opportunity to reach out to others in your field."

      "title": "Target jobs that align with your past work experiences and skill set.",
      "content": "Target jobs that align with your past work experiences and skill set. Use this information to create a list of job types that you would qualify for and are interested in doing. Being unfocused in an online job search can cost you valuable time, so the sooner that you narrow your focus, the better you’ll do. [6] X Research source For example, it’s probably too broad to say that you are interested in “sales.” Start to target your search by asking yourself what type of sales you enjoy, what kind of sales environment do you want, and what are your pay requirements. Once you narrow your search, start to develop a list of keyword terms that you can enter into job search databases. For example, instead of “sales” you might put “auto sales.”"

      "title": "Try the generic job hunting websites.",
      "content": "Try the generic job hunting websites. Sites such as Monster, Askalo or Indeed include mass listings of jobs. Their benefit lies in the large numbers of jobs that are posted from a wide variety of professions. The downside is that you are competing with many other people for every single posting. [7] X Research source Many of these larger sites will also let you post your resume online for employers to look at. If this is an option, go ahead and do so. It’s also a good idea to agree to have the site email you a notice whenever a job in a certain category is posted."

      "title": "Network on social media sites.",
      "content": "Network on social media sites. As soon as you start your job search, create a post for each of your social media sites that lets your contacts know that you are on the market. Mention your general qualifications and the types of jobs that might catch your interest. Close your post by asking for their assistance with your search, whether this means sharing your post or talking to their friends/colleagues. For example, you might write, “As you all know, I resigned my position at the MTC, Inc. about a week ago. I’m now in the process of looking for a job in print marketing. I’d love to stay in the Denver area, if possible. Please let me know if you can think of any good contacts or leads for me to pursue. Thank you!” Don’t be shy about sharing your job search on social media. Most people have been in a similar position and will understand your motives. You can also share photos showing you “in action” in a workplace environment. If you are a teacher, for example, you might post photos of you working with students or standing at the front of your former classroom. However, some people prefer to keep Facebook and Instagram just for personal, not professional, use and that is a fine option as well."

      "content": "Browse government websites. These sites range from ones that cover a large number of federal positions, such as usajobs.gov, to smaller search engines devoted just to a certain type of government job or positions in a particular city.

Go to their websites to see if they offer any type of professional job search assistance to either their members or the public on the whole. In addition, many of these organizations will offer mentors to persons new to the field. [8] X Research source For example, the American Historical Association (AHA) posts a job board on their website that lists new jobs with brief descriptions and contact information. Other organizations, like Playbill, offer a more informal listing of job opportunities. [9] X Research source"
