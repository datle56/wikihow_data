Never try to work on a fan while it is still moving—you could really hurt yourself! Let the fan stop naturally rather than grabbing a blade to slow it down. Grabbing at or jerking the fan blades could knock them out of alignment and cause more problems. [2] X Research source ."

[3] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. Wipe down the top and bottom of the blades with a microfiber cloth. Then lightly spray the blades with an all-purpose cleaner and gently wipe them down with either a new microfiber cloth or with paper towels. [4] X Research source The weight of excess dust can actually make your fan squeak! That’s why cleaning it is one of the first steps to maintaining your ceiling fan. Use gentle pressure when cleaning the fan blades and avoid putting too much weight on them."

While standing securely on your ladder, try to wiggle each fan blade to see if any of them need to be tightened. If the blade is securely fastened, it shouldn’t move at all. If it wiggles from side-to-side or up-and-down, use your Phillips screwdriver to tighten the screws until it no longer moves.

      "content": "Check the bulbs to make sure they are screwed in tight. If your ceiling fan has lights, check each bulb to ensure they are fully screwed in. If your fan had been on for a while before you turned it off, lightly touch the bulbs first to make sure they’re not too hot. [8] X Research source Loose light bulbs can cause squeaking sounds when the screw thread contact wobbles inside the base. This is also a great time to change lightbulbs that have burnt out."

      "content": "Inspect the globe on the light kit if there is one. Some ceiling fans have a globe or dome that encases the lightbulbs, or light kit. Check that it is tightly fastened in place. If needed, use your Phillips screwdriver to tighten those bolts, which will be the ones you have to remove when you need to change a lightbulb. [9] X Research source"

The ceiling mount is the part of the fan that attaches to the ceiling and connects the wiring to the body of the fan. Visually examine the ceiling mount to see if there are any loose screws. If so, use your Phillips screwdriver to tighten them. [11] X Research source The screws connecting the fan to the ceiling mount can start to wiggle loose over time, which can make the fan squeak. Occasionally screws can break. If there is a missing or damaged screw in your ceiling fan, replace it."

If the squeaking is gone, that’s great! Now you know how to maintain your fan. If the squeaking still persists, there may be a more complex issue. [12] X Research source You can attempt to troubleshoot the complex problem yourself, or you could call in a certified electrician."

      "content": "Use a balancing kit to rebalance your fan blades. Place the balancing clip in-between the base and tip of a fan blade. Run the fan to see if it is still squeaking. Repeat this on each blade. Once you find the spot that needs to be balanced, peel the adhesive off of one of the balancing weights and place it on top of the blade, directly across from the balancing clip. You can then remove the clip. [14] X Research source You can purchase an inexpensive balancing kit from your local hardware store for about $20. Rebalancing the fan blades can eliminate squeaking if the cause was from wobbling and uneven blades. Look up tutorials online to see a balancing kit test in action."

Disassemble the entire fan (make sure the power is off!), and remove the motor from the interior. Locate the bearings and apply 2-3 drops of lubricating oil on each one. Spin the motor back and forth to disperse the oil. Repeat this process on the opposite side of the motor. Reassemble the fan, turn the power back on, and check to see if the squeaking is gone.

      "content": "Contact a licensed electrician if you can’t fix the squeaking sound. If general cleaning and maintenance and checking a few more advanced issues don’t resolve the problem , it’s possible that the issue lies deeper in the structural component of the fan. Check online for reviews of different companies, and always look for the words “licensed, bonded, and insured.” [17] X Research source Call several electricians to get an estimate for how much it’ll cost for them to come do an inspection, and compare that with the cost to replace the fan to help make a decision about how you want to proceed. When hiring an electrician, ask about what kind of warranties or guarantees they offer. If the squeaking sounds come back several weeks after you paid to have it fixed, will they come back for free to address the problem?"
