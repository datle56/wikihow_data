Use an alligator clip or hair tie to pull up the top section and keep it secure. [3] X Research source You'll start by curling the bottom half so it helps to keep the top layers up and out of your way."

      "content": "Heat up a 1 in (2.5 cm) barrel curling wand. Choose a curling wand with an adjustable heat setting. Set yours to the lowest possible temperature you can to create a curl in your hair. Pick a wand with a 1 in (2.5 cm) barrel and without a clamp. Anything smaller will create tight ringlets rather than bouncy curls. [4] X Research source Short hair can be harder to manipulate using the clamp on a standard curling iron. For fine, fragile hair you may not need to go past 200 degrees. Thicker or healthier hair can withstand temperatures in the 300-degree range. Experiment with different temperature settings until you find what works best for your hair type. In most cases, avoid going past 400 degrees. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a heat-resistant glove to protect your fingers from burns. Slip a heat-resistant glove designed for use with heat styling tools onto the hand you'll be using to manipulate your hair. If you're curling your right side, this would be your right hand, and for your left side, your left hand. Opt for a glove that either protects your entire hand if you're not used to operating a curling wand. Or, choose one that just slips onto your fingertips if you're more experienced. [6] X Research source With a heat-resistant glove, you won't singe your fingers if you accidentally touch the hot barrel of the curling wand. Many curling wands come with a single heat-resistant glove that will cover your fingertips and thumb. If yours doesn't, pick one up at a local beauty supply store or order one online."

      "title": "Hold the curling wand vertically near 1 side of your head.",
      "content": "Hold the curling wand vertically near 1 side of your head. To curl the right side, grip the wand's handle in your left hand (and vice versa). Hold the wand vertically with the handle upward and the barrel pointing down. Lift your arm up and over your head to get the best angle. [7] X Research source This position may feel a little awkward at first, but with a little practice you'll get the hang of it! [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap 1 in (2.5 cm) sections of hair around the wand, away from your face. Pick up a 1 in (2.5 cm) section of hair from the bottom section. Position the wand close to your head and loop the strand around the barrel using your gloved hand. Keep it in place for about 5 to 10 seconds before releasing the wand and moving onto another section of hair. [9] X Research source Make sure you're angling the hair away from your face, rather than bringing it toward your face, as you work around the wand. On the right side, you'll twist each strand around the wand in a clockwise manner. Then on the left side, you'll wrap it counter-clockwise around the wand. Some shorter pieces at your nape may not go all the way around, which is totally fine!"

      "title": "Avoid wrapping the ends of each strand around the wand.",
      "content": "Avoid wrapping the ends of each strand around the wand. When wrapping each strand around the curling wand, stop when you have about 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 ⁄ 4 in (1.27 to 0.64 cm) of hair left at the ends. Hold this out away from the heated barrel. You can gently tug on it to keep the rest of the hair tightly around the wand. [10] X Research source If your short bob features blunt ends or piecey layers, you can highlight this by leaving the ends straight. The ends will sit straight in an effortless-looking style. If you do curl the ends, they may coil out in different directions and look untidy, especially as your curls start to loosen up over the course of the day."

      "content": "Curl the top strands with the wand held at a 45-degree angle for more lift. Try holding the wand at more of an angle, rather than keeping it completely vertical, when curling the top half of your hair. [12] X Research source If you pitch the tip of the barrel upwards about 45 degrees, you'll encourage your curls to lift up at the roots. This will give your curled bob a more natural shape."

      "title": "Hold the wand at your crown horizontally to prevent flatness.",
      "content": "Hold the wand at your crown horizontally to prevent flatness. When you go to curl the shorter top layers at the back of your bob, angle the barrel horizontally. Wrap the strands up and over the wand rather than around it sideways. [13] X Research source As you curl the pieces at the top and progress towards the sides and front of your head, transition from having the wand completely horizontal to holding it at a 45-degree angle to create a natural shape. If you try this trick, you'll get more volume at your roots. This can help you avoid the triangular bob look, with your hair sitting limp and flat at the crown but poofing out at the sides."

      "content": "Allow your curls to cool before manipulating them. Once you've curled your whole head of hair, it's okay to go back and re-curl some strands for more definition.

      "content": "Start with damp hair. This technique works well after a shower, if you allow your hair to air-dry for a while. If you're working with dry hair, spritz your strands with water to dampen them. Comb through your hair to distribute the moisture. [15] X Research source Make sure your hair isn't dripping wet. You'll just need a little moisture to help the curls lock into place as your strands dry."

If you wear a natural middle-part, divide your hair with an off-center part. [16] X Research source Use a soft scrunchie or alligator clips to hold back 1 side so you can get to work on twisting the other side. Eventually you'll flip your curled tresses back over to your natural part for more volume."

      "content": "Twist 2 small sections of hair together near your part on 1 side. Starting on 1 of the 2 sides of your hair, pick up a 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) strand at your hairline, near your part. Lift up another similarly-sized section from directly below the first. Twist 1 around the other to begin a coil, working towards your scalp. [17] X Research source Do this by overlapping the bottom strand over the top, and then continuing the twist until the strands are locked together. By wrapping the twists towards your scalp, you'll end up with curls that angle away from your face."

      "content": "Continue adding hair to your 2-strand twist as you proceed down your scalp. Once you've started the twist, pick up 1 more 2 in (5.1 cm) section from below. Add this to whichever of the 2 original strands is on the bottom. Coil the 2 pieces around each other once more, until the opposite strand is now at the bottom. Repeat this process until you've added all of the hair into the 2 sections while twisting them together. [18] X Research source Use your thumb to lift up each new section of hair before adding it to the twist. Continue adding hair to the twist until you reach your nape. Instead of doing a 2-strand twist, you could instead do a 3-strand French braid if you prefer. This would create S-shaped waves rather than rounded curls, but it will definitely add volume and texture to your bob."

      "content": "Wrap the twisted ends into a small bun at your nape. When you run out of hair along your scalp, just keep wrapping the 2 pieces around each other until you reach the ends. Working in the same direction as the twist, coil the hair against your head in a small bun. Secure this with a soft scrunchie. [19] X Research source Use a scrunchie instead of a regular hair tie, since the narrow elastic will crease your hair. [20] X Research source If you have a layered bob, it's okay if some of the ends are poking out."

On this second side, the direction of the twist should mirror that of the first twist. End this twist in a small bun and hold it in place with another soft scrunchie. Make sure to twist the curls towards your scalp so your curls area angled away from your face."

      "content": "Leave in both twists overnight. Once you finish one side, move onto the next. Then allow your hair to dry in with the twists in place. You'll eventually have soft, bouncy curls the next morning. [21] X Research source This is a great technique for hair types that don't hold a curl created with heat-styling tools. If your hair started out pretty damp, feel free to blow-dry the twists. The extra heat will encourage the curls to set as well while drying your hair so you can sleep comfortably."

[22] X Research source If you used the overnight twist method, take off the scrunchies and undo the twists with your fingers. Then finger-comb your tresses to separate the curls even more. Avoid brushing through your curls unless you want very soft and full waves."
