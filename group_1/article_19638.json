      "title": "Look around to find where the stink bugs are located.",
      "content": "Look around to find where the stink bugs are located. If you see just 1 stink bug, it may indicate a larger issue. Look around for warm pockets near heating vents or sunny spots along your walls and windows. Keep your eyes peeled for their brown, gray, or green bodies that may blend into the surrounding area. [1] X Research source If you have an outdoor infestation, look on the underside of leaves for eggs and keep an eye out for discolored leaves. Stink bugs prefer tomatoes, peaches, apples, grapes, berries, corn, soybeans, peppers, alfalfa, and wheat, so check these plants first. If you haven’t crushed any stink bugs but start to notice a cilantro-like odor in your home, chances are you have an infestation."

      "content": "Vacuum up a stink bug to kill and remove it. Suck the stink bugs up using a vacuum cleaner with a bag. [2] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. For stink bugs sitting on walls or in crevices, use a small vacuum attachment to capture them. Discard the bag immediately to keep the smell out of your home. Alternatively, you can wrap a stocking around the vacuum attachment tube to catch the bugs before they reach the bag or filter. Secure the stocking with a rubber band and push it inside the tube. Once you’ve sucked up the bugs, pull out the stocking, tie off the end, and dispose of it immediately. Refrain from using a bagless vacuum as it may smell foul for several weeks. Make sure you use a vacuum cleaner with a disposable bag."

      "content": "Knock stink bugs off plants by spraying them with a garden hose. Once you spot stink bugs on your plants, use a high-pressure jet setting on a garden hose attachment to detach them from the leaves. Once you’ve forced them away, keep monitoring the plants in your garden to see if the stink bugs reappear. [3] X Research source The water pressure won’t necessarily kill them off, but this is a good tactic to use to protect your plants at a moment’s notice."

      "title": "Flick the stink bugs into a bucket of soapy water to catch and kill them.",
      "content": "Flick the stink bugs into a bucket of soapy water to catch and kill them. Instead of spraying a solution onto the bugs, mix up a solution of 4 cups (950 mL) of hot water with 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 mL) of mild dish soap in a bucket. Hold this beneath the climbing stink bugs and flick them down into the solution using a gloved hand. After a few hours, drain out the water, bag up the dead bugs, and dispose of them immediately. The soap will make it difficult for the insects to move, and they will ultimately drown in the water. As far as stink bug elimination methods go, this is probably the closest to an odorless option since the bugs will be killed relatively quickly."

      "content": "Crush a stink bug with a disposable item if you find it outside. If you spot a single stink bug scuttling around your property, use a rolled-up magazine or another firm but disposable object to squash it. Scoop up the remains with a piece of paper towel and then bag up and dispose of the crushing tool and debris. The nasty smell may keep other stink bugs away. Refrain from stepping on stink bugs with your shoes as you’ll track the scent into your home. Avoid squishing stink bugs indoors at all costs! You’ll only end up with a lingering foul smell and a messy clean-up process. [4] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a desk lamp to draw stink bugs to a tray of soapy water.",
      "content": "Use a desk lamp to draw stink bugs to a tray of soapy water. Fill up a shallow pan or tray with soapy water. Mix up about 4 cups (950 mL) of hot water and 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 mL) of mild dish soap, or less for a smaller container. Place the tray near where you’ve spotted the stink bugs. Then insert a white, blue, or blacklight bulb into a downward-facing desk lamp and shine it over your trap to attract the stink bugs. Wait at least 12 hours and you’ll start to see the stink bugs congregating and dying in the soapy water. [6] X Research source The stink bugs will be attracted by these types of lights. A standard incandescent bulb may not work as well."

      "title": "Lay out a wet towel outside for the stink bugs to gather on.",
      "content": "Lay out a wet towel outside for the stink bugs to gather on. Saturate a towel with water and wring it out so that it’s damp, rather than dripping. Bring it outdoors and drape the towel over a deck railing, an empty planter, a tree branch, or any other surface in your yard. It’s most effective when draped vertically. Leave it there overnight. The next day, you’ll see stink bugs sitting on the towel drinking the water. Submerge the bug-laden towel in a bucket of soapy water to kill the bugs. [7] X Research source After a few hours, carefully pull out the towel and be sure to knock all of the bugs back into the water. Drain the bucket and catch the bugs in a plastic bag to dispose of them. Make sure to thoroughly wash the towel after trapping the bugs if you plan to use it for anything else."

Then slip a piece of paper underneath the opening to create a temporary lid so you can flip the container over and keep the bug inside. Then screw on the lid tightly. Once you’ve caught it, either bag it up and dispose of it in an outdoor garbage can or flush it down the toilet. [8] X Research source Add some soapy water to the container to more quickly kill the bugs. If you’re trying to catch a flying stink bug, know that they have relatively slow reflexes. Keep your eye on the bug and try to capture it after it lands."

Purchase an electric insect trap from a hardware store and install it near where the stink bugs gather, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Turn it on at night to attract the bugs. As they approach the trap’s bright light, they’ll get a sudden shock of electricity. The next morning, turn off the trap and shake off or vacuum away any dead bugs."

      "content": "Spread fly tape along stink bug entryways to capture them. Apply sticky fly tape along windowsills, doorways, cracks, vents, and any other notable entryways around your home. Check the tape every day for trapped bugs. To keep the odors at a minimum, bag up and discard the whole strip once you catch a single stink bug, then replace the strip. Keep in mind that since this is not a quick death, trapped stink bugs may give off their trademark odor after being caught. Fly tape can be purchased at a hardware store. If you prefer, make a natural sticking trap by boiling a solution of equal parts water, sugar, and corn syrup. Once it’s boiled and cooled, spread it onto a piece of cardboard."

Use a spray bottle to spritz this solution directly onto stink bugs or on the vegetation they’ve been gathering on. [9] X Research source Or try a mixture of equal parts hot water, mild dish soap, and lavender oil to kill the bugs and keep them away. Soap kills stink bugs by breaking down their protective exoskeleton and dehydrating them."

      "content": "Use a neem oil spray to prevent stink bugs from laying new eggs. Combine 4 cups (950 mL) of warm water with 2 tsp (9.9 mL) of neem oil in a spray bottle. Shake it thoroughly, then spray it generously on leaves, windowsills, and other potential entryways or hiding spots around the perimeter of your home. [10] X Research source As a preventative method, repeat this every other day for about a week. Neem oil works by disrupting the eating and mating instinct of insects. As a result, adult stink bugs that are exposed to it will gradually starve themselves and will not lay any eggs."

      "content": "Sprinkle diatomaceous earth (DE) around your property to kill bugs when they try to enter. [11] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. DE is a natural sedimentary rock containing silica, alumina, and iron oxide that is often used as a natural pesticide. Spread this chalky powder both outside and inside, focusing on entryways like windows and doors along with other areas where stink bugs seem to gather. Dust any stink bugs you see with the powder directly, in addition to spreading the powder out in areas where stink bugs gather. DE works by breaking down the waxy protective layer on an insect's exoskeleton, essentially causing the insect to dehydrate. Look for a bag of DE at your local hardware store."

Use caulk or expandable foam to seal off any holes you find. Stink bugs will sneak into any little crack or crevice they can find, so take action to seal off as many holes as you can. If you have a fireplace, attic, or other rarely-used entryways, check these areas, too. Keep doors and fireplaces flues closed while they’re not being used."

Pull out all of the weeds from your property and invest in natural lawn care services to keep your grass healthy and free of weeds. Keep the soil and plants on your property healthy, nutrient-rich, and well-pruned. Consider cultivating beds around your property if you’d like to grow flowers or vegetables. By spending time outside taking care of your vegetation, you’ll be able to catch weeds and stink bugs sooner. Avoid simply mowing over weeds; this will only encourage stink bugs to find another home nearby.
