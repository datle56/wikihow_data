Grasp the top of the frame and pull it up gently until it clicks into place. [1] X Research source A few bifold futons may have different seat adjustment options, making it easy to lock them in place just like you would a chaise lounge."

      "title": "Push down on the bifold’s seat section.",
      "content": "Push down on the bifold’s seat section. It’s best if you do this while you’re also pulling up on the top section for a smoother transition. By pushing down on the seat section while lifting up on the back section, you’ll transform the futon into a couch. [2] X Research source Make sure the futon is locked in place before sitting down—you can do this by giving it a shake once you think it’s in place to see if it moves at all."

      "title": "Move the futon back into its lounge position against a wall, if desired.",
      "content": "Move the futon back into its lounge position against a wall, if desired. If your futon needed to be pulled away from a wall or furniture to be in the bed position, you can now push it back up against a wall or move it to another location. Readjust the mattress, as needed."

      "title": "Move the bottom section of a trifold futon to your desired placement.",
      "content": "Move the bottom section of a trifold futon to your desired placement. You can either tuck the trifold’s third section back up under the middle section to hide it away, or you can simply tuck in the legs of the third section so that the section angles downwards. [3] X Research source By only tucking in the legs, you’ll still have 3 sections of the futon out, but they’ll be in more of a ‘Z’ formation, with the third section acting as an ottoman. If you tuck in the third section completely, you’ll be left with 2 sections—one for resting your back and one for sitting."

      "content": "Pull the top section of the trifold futon up. This is the section where your back will rest. Pull it up until it's in the desired seating position, and then lock it into place. Some trifold futons will have options for how far up you’d like to position your seat. If this is the case, lock in your seat using the height adjustments. Give the futon a small shake to ensure the seat adjustments and legs are all stable."

      "content": "Adjust the mattress or padding, if necessary. Position the padding so that it's centered on the futon, making sure that none of it is falling over the edges. Once the padding is perfect, it's ready to be used."

      "title": "Pull the futon frame away from the wall or other furniture.",
      "content": "Pull the futon frame away from the wall or other furniture. Since the mattress will be spread out, it’s important to move the frame at least 8 inches (20 cm) away from the wall or any other obstacles that might be in the way to prevent damage. [4] X Research source Make sure you have plenty of room to walk around the futon so you can easily reach the frame."

      "title": "Unfold a hidden third deck of a trifold futon, if necessary.",
      "content": "Unfold a hidden third deck of a trifold futon, if necessary. Some trifold futons will have a hidden third part that needs to be pulled out before the futon can lay flat. Find this third section under the main seat and pull it out, adjusting the legs as necessary so that it’s stable on the ground. If your trifold futon already has the third section (also called the ottoman feature) out, adjust the legs so that it’s level with the middle section. You may have to release a locking mechanism in order for the bottom section to move."

      "content": "Adjust the top section of a trifold futon so it lays flat. This is the section where your back rests when the futon is upright. As you’re pulling the ottoman section flat, you should begin to push down on the top section so that it lays flat as well. Adjust the top section’s legs so that the futon is completely horizontal and stable. If you’re having trouble adjusting or unlocking your trifold futon, go online and look up instructions for the specific brand—not all trifold futons will work exactly the same."

If you grabbed the middle of the frame, simply lift it up 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) until you hear it unlock from the base. You can also start at one side and lift an end up slightly to unlock that end before unlocking the opposite side. [6] X Research source If you’re unlocking each end separately, don’t lift each one up too high before both are unlocked. Some futons will have a locking mechanism that you’ll need to unlock before the futon can be lifted. This will be visible on the inside of the frame, near the legs."
