      "title": "Test your cup.",
      "content": "Test your cup. You'll want a fairly sturdy cup to play the cup game with. Plastic cups make a great sound when hit and clapped on the table, but be sure if you're using a plastic cup that it's strong enough to withstand the game. Otherwise you might break the cup over the course of your game. If playing with a plastic cup, take it in your hand and put pressure on it gently. If it feels like it is brittle or might break, you may want to get a different cup. Glass or ceramic cups can break while playing the cup game. This can lead to cuts, so if you plan on using a glass or ceramic cup, it should be very sturdy. Some glass and ceramic cup can make a bright, pleasing sound when clapped to the table."

      "title": "Clear your surface.",
      "content": "Clear your surface. When playing the cup game you'll be tapping on the surface in front of you, clapping the cup to the surface, and sliding your cup back and forth. You'll want to make sure that objects that might get in your way, like your lunch or a beverage, are safely out of the way before playing. Table cloths can make it difficult for you to slide your glass while playing the cup game. Depending on the cup you are using and the heaviness of the tablecloth, you may want to remove the cloth before play. Be sure your flat surface is stable! A card table or a poorly supported table might not be able to withstand the claps, taps, and slaps of the cup game."

This is optional, but a song can help you stay in sync with other people when you are playing with your friends. \"When I'm Gone\" is the song performed by Anna Kendrick while playing the cup game, but you might find the rhythms of other songs work just as well. [3] X Research source You might sing the song that is credited as the origin of the cup song, \"Screen Door\" by Rich Mullens. [4] X Research source"

This will make a hollow, rhythmic sound from your cup that will break up your clapping. Tap the top of the cup three times: right hand, left hand, right hand. [6] X Research source Left-handers should tap the bottom of the cup similarly, using the tapping pattern left-right-left. Tap the cup rapidly with your fingers to add variety between the slower rhythms of your claps and your faster, lighter taps."

[7] X Research source Left-handers should perform this motion similarly, picking up the cup with the left hand and then placing it back down onto the table about 6 inches (15 cm) to the left of its starting position. You shouldn't need to raise your cup any more than 2 inches (5 cm) from the table. Your cup should remain upside down while tapping it to the table."

Left-handers should clap the cup to their right palm, and then knock the bottom of the cup against the table in the same fashion employed by right-handers. You should not let go of the cup at this point. [8] X Research source"

Left-handers will mirror these ending motions so that their left hand slaps the table a little to the right of directly in front of them, the right hand claps the cup to the table a little to the left of directly in front of them, both arms crossing in front. After returning the cup to the table, your arms should be crossed in front of you, your right hand to the left, your left hand to the right and still holding the cup. Return your hands to either side of the cup to prepare to repeat the game from the beginning. You can continue playing the cup game for as long as the music plays, or for as long as you wish.
