      "content": "Bob your head to the rhythm. To find the beat of the music, listen to the drums or bass, which typically carry the rhythm of the song. Let the music guide your body and start bobbing your head however you like. If it helps, you can try counting along, snapping your fingers, or clapping your hands to the beat. [1] X Research source Once you get your head moving, you can also work the rest of your upper body—roll your shoulders back, pop your chest out, or sing the lyrics if you know the song. To get comfortable finding the rhythm of a song, listen to songs with a clear and pronounced beat. For example, you can try grooving to “Uptown Funk” by Mark Ronson (feat. Bruno Mars) or “Don’t Start Now” by Dua Lipa."

      "content": "Shift your weight from one foot to another. When you have a good sense of the beat, you can incorporate some simple footwork. Shift all of your weight to one foot, then lift the other foot slightly off the ground. At every other count, shift back and forth in time to the music. [2] X Research source You can also shift your weight at every count once you feel comfortable dancing at a faster pace. To look like a natural, keep your legs loose and your knees slightly bent. Add a bit of “bounce” every time you shift weight and a subtle bounce (in place) on the counts when you aren’t shifting weight."

      "title": "Step-touch along with the beat.",
      "content": "Step-touch along with the beat. Once you're comfortable shifting your weight to the rhythm, you can take a bigger step. Right before you shift your weight to a foot, move it slightly, even just 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from where it was before, and keep it fairly close to the ground when you move your foot. [3] X Research source Be sure to stay on the balls of your feet so you can move and bounce easily. If you're dancing with someone else , be sure to move around in a way that accommodates your partner."

      "content": "Add some hip action. When you put your weight on a foot, move your hips (and your body) slightly in the direction of that foot. If you shift your weight onto your right foot, for example, move your hips to the right. You can also twist your upper body slightly to add more movement and dimension. [4] X Research source For example, when you move to the right, put your right shoulder forward a little and your left shoulder back. Then, do the opposite when you move to the left."

      "title": "Incorporate some arm movements.",
      "content": "Incorporate some arm movements. To make your arms appear smooth and fluid, keep your hands open or in very loose fists. You can put your arms in the air or bend them at the elbows (like you’re running). But whatever you do, have fun and keep switching it up! [5] X Research source If you don’t know where to start, try following one of these moves: Roll the dice. Make a loose fist and shake your arm and hand as though you’re shaking a pair of dice for a roll. After a few shakes, throw your hand out to \"roll\" the dice. Mow the lawn. Bend forward and grasp the starter of an imaginary lawn mower with one hand, then pull your hand back as though you're pulling on the starter. Once you get it going, take a few steps while you mow the lawn. Swing an air lasso. Grab an imaginary lasso and swing it above your head as though you're about to rope a cow. Shift your weight to the foot opposite your \"lasso hand\" and thrust your hips in that direction. Pump your fist. Get low and use your hand to hit the ground to the beat. As the song builds up, make a fist and pump it in the air in a celebratory fashion. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Find your own style. Follow your natural impulses when you’re dancing freestyle. It's easy to feel like you're only good at one move, but the more you feel the rhythm, the more natural your movements will become. Listening to subtleties in music will also help to train your body to move. Most importantly, be creative ! Creating your own dance moves is easy with confidence and an understanding of your body. [7] X Research source Experiment with different moves, positions, and speeds while you dance. Don’t be afraid to make up your own moves. Freestyle is all about improvisation and individual expression. If you want to learn a particular dance style, focus on mastering one move first. For example, if you want to work on your dubstep dancing , practice body isolations or popping before imitating an entire routine."

      "content": "Get into position with your partner. Stand face-to-face with your partner and get into a basic partner position. If you’re leading, put your right hand on your partner’s shoulder blade and interlock your left hand with their right hand, with your hands positioned in the shape of a pair of Cs. Instruct your partner to put their left hand on your right shoulder. [8] X Research source You can keep your clasped hands held as high as eye level or as low as waist level, depending on your preference. Just keep them relaxed, with a comfortable bend at the elbow, and don’t raise your partner’s shoulder. Leave about 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) of space between yourself and your partner. Make sure you and your partner agree on who is leading before you begin!"

      "content": "Step to the left with your left foot. Once you’re ready to start dancing, move your left foot out to the side in a smooth, gliding motion. Let your partner mirror you with their right foot, as the first part of the basic “step-touch” slow dance move. [9] X Research source If your partner is leading, let them initiate the first step, but try to move with them as smoothly as possible. Try to time your steps with the beat of the music. You may find it helpful to count along with the music in your head."

      "title": "Repeat your foot movements in the opposite direction.",
      "content": "Repeat your foot movements in the opposite direction. Once you’ve brought your feet together, step to the right with your right foot. Then, bring your left foot over to meet your right. Continue this pattern throughout the rest of the dance. [11] X Research source Alternatively, you can do 2 steps to the left and then 2 steps to the right."

      "content": "Use your hands to steer your partner if you want to move around. To move around the dance floor, use your hands to gently push or pull your partner in the direction you want to go. After touching your feet together, push with one hand and pull with the other at the same time you step out on the next beat. [12] X Research source For example, if you’re stepping left but want to pivot to the right, start by bringing your right foot to meet your left. Then, push your partner’s right hand with your left hand while gently pulling on their shoulder with your right hand, and step to the left at the same time."

The Chicken Dance is a staple of many wedding receptions—it's easy to do because there are just 3 basic moves, and you change them in time with the music. To perform this low-pressure routine: [13] X Research source Raise your arms to shoulder level and line your thumbs up with your index fingers to create a shape that resembles a chicken's beak. Move your thumbs up and down to simulate a chicken clucking. Then, ball up your hands and tuck your fists under your arms as though you have wings. Flap your wings up and down in time to the music. With your wings still in place, continue flapping but now stick out your backside, bend your knees and wiggle your bottom down toward the floor. Repeat these moves over and over until the song ends."

      "content": "Master the hora for Jewish weddings. The hora is danced at many traditional Jewish wedding receptions to the song \"Hava Nagila\" or other traditional Jewish songs. To follow the \"grapevine\" pattern: step the left foot across to the right (and let the right foot follow), then step the left foot behind the right and follow again with the right. [14] X Research source People usually position themselves in a circle, either holding hands or throwing their arms over one another's shoulders. The tempo of this dance is typically fast. Sometimes the music starts slowly, and the band speeds up the tempo as the song goes along."

      "content": "Use basic slow dance moves for the Dollar Dance. At some weddings, the guests line up and pay a dollar (or more) to dance with the wedding couple. You can perform a basic slow dance , but it's really not about the moves; it's about having a few moments with the merrier to express your happiness for the couple and compliment the wedding ceremony and reception. [15] X Research source Holding on and simply swaying in place is perfectly acceptable if it makes it easier to have a personal conversation."

      "content": "Take a dance class to pick up some basic moves. There are dance classes for every style of dancing from hip-hop to ballet, break dancing to salsa . Search online for the classes in your area, and don’t be afraid to ask your instructor for tips—they can help you overcome whatever it is you're finding to be difficult. When you are being taught a routine, look at what the teacher is doing. Try to copy it exactly. If it doesn't work, watch the teacher again and look for the little things they do that make it easier. Since many dance styles have their roots in ballroom dancing, consider learning the cha cha, waltz, or foxtrot. Even a few hours of class time can help you learn the basics and build your confidence."

You can always incorporate the moves from a viral video the next time you hit the dance floor: Hit the griddy. Bend your knees slightly and tap the back of your heels, alternating between the left and right. You can do this in place or move forward, but be sure to add a little bounce to your step. Swing your arms back and forth, then throw up your Bs—make circles with your pointer finger and thumb and place them over your eyes like binoculars. [16] X Research source Get sturdy. Keep a little bounce to your step and alternate tapping your heels. After you feel comfortable, hop on your left leg and kick your right leg back and forth at the same time. Occasionally clap your hands under your right leg when you kick forward, then clap behind your back when you kick back. [17] X Research source"

While these dance performances may seem spontaneous, the truth is that they're usually fairly well rehearsed in advance. You can find flash mobs online, join them for a several-week rehearsal period as the group learns a dance, and then perform with the mob in public. [18] X Research source Some flash mobs put videos online with instructions for learning and rehearsing the planned dance. Flash mobs welcome people of all skill levels; their focus is on having fun and creating a joyful scene, so the more people who participate, the better. You can also learn some great dance moves and connect with other people who enjoy dancing."

[19] X Research source Since focusing on the steps might be a bit challenging, pay attention to how loose the dancers are, how much confidence they display, and how much fun it looks like they're having on the dance floor. Try tuning in to reality television dance competition shows like Dancing with the Stars, So You Think You Can Dance, or World of Dance."

See as many as you can or pick and choose those that speak to your particular interests. For example: Check out Dirty Dancing or Shall We Dance to watch 2 dance novices develop confidence and grace and learn to perform with pizzazz. Watch Footloose or Flashdance to see the power of dance as a form of defiance against uptight authority figures and personal circumstances.

      "content": "Put on comfortable dance shoes. Different styles of dance call for different types of shoes, so do some research about what’s needed for your preferred style. Choose a well-fitting shoe with a flexible, thin sole for the dance floor, and make sure you feel secure. [21] X Research source For example, sneakers are great for hip-hop or freestyle dancing, while heels are ideal for Latin dance styles. Do not wear sneakers or other shoes with rubbery or sticky soles for ballroom-style dancing, since these can make it hard to move your feet smoothly across the floor. Stay away from platform shoes, since that thick sole and heel make it difficult to feel the floor."

These breathable fabrics draw moisture away from your skin, helping you cool down during your routine. [22] X Research source For extra sweat protection, drop a pack of moist towelettes and a travel-size powder in your pocket so you can freshen up when needed. If you’re dancing with a partner, avoid wearing slippery materials, like silk. Your partner may have a hard time holding onto you if their hands get sweaty. [23] X Research source"

Be sure to choose clothes that are either loose enough to let you move or stretchy enough to move with your body, and try on your outfit at home to be sure you can dance with ease. [24] X Research source Select a top with sleeves that don’t restrict your arm movement—you should be able to lift your arms above your head. To avoid wardrobe malfunctions, make sure your clothing fits securely and won’t slip out of place if you really get moving!"
