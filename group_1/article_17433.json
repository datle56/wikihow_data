If the issue is related to DNS specifically, you'll see an error like \"The DNS server is not responding,\" \"Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (DNS server) is not responding,\" or \"your DNS server might be unavailable.\" Windows 10: Go to Start > Settings > Network & Internet > Status . Click Network troubleshooter under \"Change your network settings.\" Follow the steps in the troubleshooter.

Go to source Windows 11: Right-click the Wi-Fi, globe, or ethernet icon at the bottom-right corner (in the system tray) and select Diagnose network problems . If a problem is detected, you'll see an error. Mac: Press and hold Option as you click the Wi-Fi status icon in the menu bar.

To completely clear the cache on your network, you'll want to restart the modem, router, and your device in a particular way: If your router and modem are two separate devices, unplug the power cords from each device. If you have one combined unit, unplug it. Wait about a minute. Plug the modem back in and wait 3-5 minutes. If you have a separate router, don't plug it back in yet. (If your modem/router is not combined into one unit): Once the modem is back up (after 3-5 minutes), plug your router back in and wait another 3-5 minutes. When the modem and router (or combo gateway) are back online, reconnect to Wi-Fi if your computer doesn't connect automatically, then try using the internet again."

If you see \"Reply from 8.8.4.4\" or \"64 bytes from 8.8.4.4\" followed by some statistics, your internet connection is working. If you see \"Request timed out\" or \"Destination host unreachable,\" there is a problem with your internet connection, not your DNS servers. See our guide to troubleshooting your internet connection . Now type ping dns.google and press Enter or Return . If you get an error like \"Ping request could not find host,\" \"Name or service not known,\" or \"cannot resolve dns.google: Unknown host,\" but were able to ping 8.8.4.4, the DNS servers your computer is using are not working, but your internet is working. In this case, see this method to learn how to change your DNS servers to ones that won't give you errors."
