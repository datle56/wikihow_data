      "content": "Choose garments made with breathable, quick-drying fabrics. With all the rain and humidity, it’s unfortunately inevitable that your clothes are going to get a little damp. With this in mind, pick out some breezy materials like cotton, linen, chambray, and jersey. [2] X Research source Additionally, look for clothing made with moisture-wicking materials like bamboo, which won’t soak up the rain. [3] X Research source Stay away from materials like leather, heavy denim, and vinyl, which aren’t ideal for hot, humid weather. [4] X Research source Ditch any garments made with silk. You’re bound to be sweating a bit in the heat, and silk is not-so-great at hiding sweat stains from the naked eye. If you’re really in the mood for silk, slip into a white top, instead.

      "content": "Pair a lightweight jacket and dress for an easy outfit. Dresses offer a lot of comfortable freedom and breeziness, which can be hard to come by on a hot, rainy day. Take advantage of this by wearing a long dress with a lightweight trench coat. To jazz things up, pick out a brightly-patterned dress that will contrast nicely with the trench coat. [6] X Research source For instance, you can pair a long, printed dress with a plaid trench coat for a rain-ready outfit. If you’re looking for a minimalist outfit, wear a neutral-toned dress with your trench coat, instead. Dresses and skirts give your body a lot of breathing room, which can be hard to come by during hot, humid weather. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a sleek look with a lightweight trench coat and a casual outfit. Pick out an outfit that you feel comfortable going out and about in. Slide a trench coat over top, so you’ll be a little protected from the rain and humidity outside. This type of outfit gives you a lot of freedom, so don’t be afraid to cater to your personal preferences! [8] X Research source For example, you can pair your favorite lightweight hoodie with some comfortable leggings, then accent it with a trench coat. For a breezier look, pair baggy jeans and a loose top. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick out a comfortable pair of pants to stay cool.",
      "content": "Pick out a comfortable pair of pants to stay cool. Go through your closet and pick out some pants that feel comfortable for the current weather. Look for garments made with lightweight materials, like linen, or other breathable pants, like harem pants, culottes, or jeans. Pair these with a comfortable top for a quick, rain-ready outfit! [10] X Research source For example, you might pair a basic T-shirt with boyfriend-style jeans. You might also like changing things up with a jumpsuit."

      "title": "Stay relaxed in a pair of jeans and a windbreaker.",
      "content": "Stay relaxed in a pair of jeans and a windbreaker. Grab your favorite pair of jeans, which will keep your outfit comfortably casual. Slide on a breathable top, along with a windbreaker. Pick out a colorful windbreaker for a more dynamic look, or play around with neutral tones if you’d prefer to be subtle. [11] X Research source For example, you can wear a pastel-toned windbreaker with blue jeans for a colorful outfit. You can also pair a solid-toned windbreaker with your jeans for a less ambitious look."

      "content": "Dress up in a trench dress. Trench dresses provide a fun twist on the typical trench coat. You can wear a trench dress on its own, or layer it over another outfit for extra emphasis. Play around with different outfit combinations and see what strikes your fancy! [12] X Research source For instance, you can layer a solid-toned trench dress over a blouse and slacks. You can also wear a brightly-colored trench dress as the centerpiece of your ensemble."

      "title": "Slip into ankle-length pants instead of floor-grazing bottoms.",
      "content": "Slip into ankle-length pants instead of floor-grazing bottoms. Floor-length pants are a great option when the weather is dry, but they’ll just get soggy and icky when you wear them in the rain. Instead, look for ankle-length pants or bottoms that won’t drag along the ground, like a nice pair of skinny jeans or slacks. [13] X Research source For instance, a nice pair of slacks is a good replacement for floor-length pants. If it’s really warm, you can ditch the pants altogether and go for shorts!"

Don’t be afraid to play around with colors and patterns—with your transparent raincoat, everything will be visible for the rest of the world to see. [14] X Research source For instance, you can pair a lightweight blazer and a skirt beneath a transparent raincoat. You can also spice things up by wearing a trench coat with a graphic tee and a pair of jeans. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a scarf in place of jewelry.",
      "content": "Wear a scarf in place of jewelry. Slip a lightweight scarf around your neck instead of wearing a necklace. This way, your jewelry won’t be as likely to soak up excess water and sweat, which can lead to unwanted tarnishing. [17] X Research source This method works best for necklaces. If it’s really rainy outside, you might want to leave your jewelry at home for the day."

      "content": "Pick out a bucket hat to make your outfit rain-resistant. Slip-on a bucket hat to stay extra protected from any water and moisture headed your way. You can pair your hats with a flowing garment, like a dress, or a basic shirt and jeans—the choice is yours! [18] X Research source For example, you can pair a neutral-toned bucket hat with a relaxed midi dress for an easy look. Mix and match a solid-colored top with jeans and a bucket hat."

Go for sturdier footwear like combat boots and waterproof sneakers, as opposed to flip-flops, which can slip off or break easily in puddles. [22] X Research source Additionally, stay away from flat or strappy shoes, which don’t offer a lot of protection. [23] X Research source Instead, pick out shoes that you feel comfortable and safe walking around in, where you’ll be steady on your feet. [24] X Research source"
