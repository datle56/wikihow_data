[4] X Research source She wants you to know that she’s into you, even when you’re not physically around, and is hoping that when you see that notification, you’ll be thinking of her, too.

[5] X Research source You may not be partners at the moment, but it does mean she cares about you and is already comfortable talking to you in that way.

[6] X Research source She might not ask you out directly, but even just a “Let’s hang out!” on a regular basis is a potential indicator that she wants to be more than friends. Making plans is also a good way to test out what a long-term relationship with someone might be like. Try to choose someplace you both enjoy, so that you can both be in your element and you can really get to know her. Reader Poll: We asked 1257 wikiHow readers who've asked someone out, and 55% of them agreed that the best way to do so is by casually suggesting you hang out and spend time together. [Take Poll] So odds are, if she’s already doing this, she likes you!"

She might not say exactly that, but asking you on a date or a similar, typically romantic activity could mean the same thing. This is also a sign of strong and confident communication. She’s confident and knows what she wants, which are desirable traits in a partner. It’s also a green light for you to say it back, if that’s how you feel. If you’re not into it, the expectation for honest communication has been set, and you can tell her you don’t feel the same way. Just be sure to let her down easy . Try something like, “It means a lot that you told me that, but I’m not in the right place for a relationship right now.”"
