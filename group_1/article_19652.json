Fill a bulb syringe with the vinegar and alcohol mixture and squirt a trickle into your ear canal, letting it drain out. Warm water rinsing is not recommended for swimmer's ear. If your ear still feels blocked, visit an otolaryngologist or ask a general practice doctor for a referral. The otolaryngologist can clean your ear more effectively using suction. Never perform this step on a person with diabetes, not even at a doctor's office.

Both of these make your ear a less welcoming place for bacteria. Apply with the following method: Warm the solution by rubbing the container in your hands or placing it in a cup of warm water â€“ without mixing the two liquids together. Lie down with your ear facing upward. Have an assistant place two or three drops on the wall of the ear canal, allowing air to escape so drops can get into the ear. Gently wiggling your ears will aid in this process. Remain lying down for a few minutes. [11] X Research source"
