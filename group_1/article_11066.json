      "content": "Avoid over-washing your face. Though you may think that the more you wash your face the better, this is not the case. Like with harsh chemicals, excessive washing will lead to irritation and can make your symptoms worse. You should wash your face no more than two times daily."

      "title": "Use a gentle facial cleanser twice a day.",
      "content": "Use a gentle facial cleanser twice a day. Most dermatologists agree that cleansing the skin is the best way to reduce oil. [1] X Research source Make sure to use a gentle, pH balanced cleanser rather than regular soap. Most soaps are highly alkaline and strip the natural acid mantle from the skin leaving it vulnerable to bacteria. Products containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or beta-hydroxy acid are often considered best. These are slightly acidic, however, so start off with only a small amount to make sure your skin doesn't have an adverse reaction. When washing your face, make sure you use warm water, not hot. Hot water can further irritate the skin. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a clay mask.",
