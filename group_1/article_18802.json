Share does not work if your Pokémon faints—they won’t get experience from battles until they are revived. This item is a great way to level up weaker Pokémon or even out your team’s experience without having to send each Pokémon into battle. [21] X Research source In Gen 1 (Red/Blue/Yellow): You keep the Exp. All in your bag. The Pokémon that battled receive 50% of the experience points (split evenly) while the rest of the Pokémon in your party receive the other 50% (split evenly). In Gen 2 to 5 (Gold/Silver/Crystal, Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, FireRed/LeafGreen, Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, Black/White 1 & 2): The Exp. Share is a held item that you give to 1 Pokémon. The Pokémon receives 50% of the experience points earned from the battle. The Pokémon that battled receive the other 50% (split evenly among them). In Gen 6 and 7 (X/Y, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, Sun/Moon, Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon): The Exp. Share is a Key Item that you keep in your pocket and can turn on or off. The Pokémon in your party that don’t battle get 50% of the experience earned. The Pokémon who did battle get 100% of the experience that they earned. In Gen 8 and 9 (Sword/Shield, Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, Scarlet/Violet): All Pokémon in your party receive experience, regardless if they are used in battle, which can’t be turned off. The amount of experience your Pokémon receive is based on their level and whether they were used in battle."
