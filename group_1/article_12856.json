      "title": "Watch for swelling, especially in an arm or leg.",
      "content": "Watch for swelling, especially in an arm or leg. Since clots block your blood flow, blood builds up behind the clot. This excess blood will cause swelling in the area around the clot. Swelling is often the first symptom that you will notice. If your arm or leg is swelling but you haven’t injured yourself, then you may have a blood clot. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In some cases, swelling can be severe in size. Pain, tenderness, redness, and warmth in your lower leg could also be a sign of a blood clot."

      "content": "Notice if you have pain in your shoulder, arm, back, or jaw. Blood clots can cause pain in the location of the clot, or, as in the case of heart attacks, which are caused by blood clots, displaced pain. The pain may feel like a cramp or charley horse. Unlike with a cramp, you will also experience other symptoms such as swelling and discoloration. [2] X Research source Any blood clot can cause this type of pain, but it’s especially common with DVT. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The pain will be severe and not relieved by over-the-counter pain killers."

      "content": "Look for patches of discolored skin. The skin around the swollen area may also have a reddish or bluish discoloration that looks like a bruise that won’t go away. If discolored skin is coupled with swelling and pain, then you should seek immediate medical attention. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Feel to see if your skin is warm. Blood clots cause your skin to be warm to the touch. Place your palm against your skin to feel the temperature. Compare it to the temperature of your forehead to determine if the skin over the potential clot feels warmer. While the warmth may radiate just from the swollen part of your body, your entire limb could be warm.

This symptom can be caused by all types of blood clots, including DVT, heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolisms. You may not be able to lift your arm, walk, or speak. If you experience this symptom, you should seek medical care immediately.

      "content": "Recognize symptoms of a blood clot in your lungs. A blood clot in your lungs is called a pulmonary embolism. While they share many of the symptoms of blood clots in other parts of your body, they also include a few specific symptoms involving your lungs. Blood clots in the lungs usually have a sudden onset, so you may feel okay but then have symptoms. If you have any of these symptoms, you should call emergency services immediately: [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A bloody cough.

      "content": "Know if you have risk factors. You’re more likely to develop a blood clot if you have risk factors for one. Knowing your risk factors could help you and your doctor determine if your symptoms could be a blood clot. This is particularly important in the early stages when your symptoms may not be that serious. Common risk factors include: [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Recent hospitalization or a recent orthopedic cast on a lower extremity. Major surgery within 4 weeks Obesity, pregnancy, smoking, surgery, and prior history of stroke. Prolonged sitting or rest, bedrest for more than 3 days. History of pulmonary embolism, DVT, and heart failure. Swelling your entire leg or greater than 3 in (7.6 cm) on your calf. Hiatal hernia, peripheral artery disease, polycythemia vera, and heart arrhythmias. Non-varicose superficial veins. Active cancer or cancer treatment within the past 6 months.

The sound waves from the wand will travel through your body and may provide an image of the clot. Your doctor may do several ultrasounds over a few days to see if the clot is growing. CT or MRI scans can also provide an image of the clot.

High levels of D dimer mean that you likely have a blood clot or one that's recently dissolved.

      "title": "Take anticoagulants as prescribed by your doctor.",
      "content": "Take anticoagulants as prescribed by your doctor. Once your doctor has diagnosed a blood clot, you will likely be prescribed anticoagulants, such as low-molecular-weight-heparin, which are also called blood thinners. This medication prevents your blood from thickening, which reduces the likelihood that it will form another clot that would cause the vein blockage to worsen. It won’t fix an existing clot, but it will keep the clot from expanding and prevent others from forming. Blood thinners are prescribed based on how long it takes your blood to clot. This is called your prothrombin time (PT) baseline. Your doctor will conduct tests to determine your PT before prescribing blood thinners. Blood thinners can be given as an injection once or twice daily or in pill form. If you’re on blood thinners, take care to avoid accidents and injuries as your blood will be less able to clot. You will likely need to continue taking the blood thinners after the danger has passed so that another clot doesn’t form. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your doctor will conduct blood tests to determine if the dosage of the blood thinners is correct. They will likely need to adjust the dosage frequently. Depending on what medication you’re prescribed, you may need to monitor your PT and international normalized ratio (INR) as often as your doctor recommends."

This is a large vein in your abdomen. The filter will stop clots that may form from traveling to your lungs.

      "content": "Undergo surgery to remove the clot if other treatments don’t work. Surgery is often the last treatment option for a clot unless you’re in an emergency situation. This surgery is called a thrombectomy. The doctor will open your blood vessel, remove the clot, and then close the vein. They may also install a catheter or a stent to keep the vein open and clot free afterward.
