    {
      "title": "Sketch a frown wrinkle where the center of the eyes will be.",
      "content": "Sketch a frown wrinkle where the center of the eyes will be. Take a pencil or pen and draw a tiny horizontal line, which will be the frown wrinkle in between Goku's eyes. Then, make 2 angled lines that extend up from each side and point towards each other. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw angled eyebrows that extend up from each side of the frown wrinkle.",
      "content": "Draw angled eyebrows that extend up from each side of the frown wrinkle. Put the tip of your pen or pencil at 1 end of the horizontal line of the frown wrinkle and draw a curved line up and away from the wrinkle. Make the curved line about 4 times the length of the wrinkle line. To draw the top of the eyebrow, sketch another curved line that's parallel to the line you just drew, but make it wider at the end and draw a vertical line to connect them. [2] X Research source You can shade in the eyebrow with a pen or colored pencil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a circular pupil below the eyebrow.",
      "content": "Make a circular pupil below the eyebrow. Draw a half-circle that extends from the bottom of the eyebrow. Position it close to where the eyebrow meets the wrinkle mark and fill in the pupil so it's completely dark. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the bottom and side of the eye.",
      "content": "Draw the bottom and side of the eye. Make a tiny vertical line in between the pupil and wrinkle line. Sketch another vertical line at the opposite edge of the line from the eyebrow down so it's even with the short line you just made. Then, draw a horizontal line that comes off of the outer line towards the middle of the eye. Repeat these steps to make the opposite eye. [4] X Research source Make the bottom horizontal line about halfway across the bottom of the eye."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a small nose below the frown wrinkle.",
      "content": "Create a small nose below the frown wrinkle. Leave space the same size as the frown wrinkle directly below the horizontal wrinkle line and make a vertical line that's as long as you want the nose to be. Then, draw a horizontal line that curves to the left of this vertical line so the nose now looks like a backward \"L.\" [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch a crooked smile for the mouth directly below the nose.",
      "content": "Sketch a crooked smile for the mouth directly below the nose. Since most of the emphasis is on Goku's eyes, the mouth is much simpler to draw. Make a line that curves up at an angle to the right. Then, make a small vertical line at each end to make the mouth look like Goku is smiling or smirking. [6] X Research source You could make Goku's mouth in any shape you like. Draw a simple curved line to make an easy smile, for instance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add lines to indicate the cheekbones and indent of his chin.",
      "content": "Add lines to indicate the cheekbones and indent of his chin. Make 2 horizontal small lines directly below the mouth that are 1/2 the size of the mouth. These will make the indent of the chin. To make the cheekbones, draw 2 slightly curved lines right below 1 eye. Then, draw 1 line below the other eye. [7] X Research source The cheekbone lines will also help to define the eyes themselves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the outline of the head from the temples down to the pointed chin.",
      "content": "Draw the outline of the head from the temples down to the pointed chin. Make a small point next to each of Goku's temples to create 2 tiny marks. Draw down from each point in towards his jaw. Make the jaw come to a curved point. [8] X Research source You'll now have the outline of Goku's face from his temples to his chin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch a large ear on each side of Goku's head.",
      "content": "Sketch a large ear on each side of Goku's head. Put your pen or pencil at one of the temple mark you made earlier. Draw an ear that curves up and to the right before going down and around the side of his face. To add details to the ear, make a line that curves to the right and goes down at the top of the ear and in the middle of the ear. Then, make a curve that goes from the bottom up to the right near the ear lobe. [9] X Research source Repeat this going in the opposite direction to make the other ear. Make the ears extend until they're level with the bottom of Goku's nose."

    {
      "title": "Create large triangular-shaped hair across his head.",
      "content": "Create large triangular-shaped hair across his head. Place your pen or pencil on the center of Goku's forehead and bring it down towards 1 of the eyes. Move the pen or pencil back up to create a large triangle shape. Repeat this across the forehead before you make large triangles that extend from the sides and top of Goku's head. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline the neck and shoulders.",
      "content": "Outline the neck and shoulders. Draw a vertical line from the corner of the jaw straight down until it's level with the bottom of the chin. Repeat this on the other side of the jaw. Then, put your pencil near the top of the line you just drew and draw a straight line that angles away from the neck at 210 degrees to the left. Make another 1 off to the right at a 330-degree angle. [11] X Research source These angled lines will form the rest of the neck where it meets the shoulders."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the large muscles in the center of the chest.",
      "content": "Draw the large muscles in the center of the chest. Sketch a small vertical line in the center of the chest. To make the muscles, draw 2 lines that curve up and away from the top of the line in an \"m\" shape. Extend them until they line up with the shoulder line you drew in the last step. [12] X Research source To add detail to the hollow of the neck, draw a \"V\" in the top of these chest muscles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the vest over the shoulders.",
      "content": "Make the vest over the shoulders. Draw a thick strap over each shoulder and make the lines curve in toward the center of the chest. Let the lines taper off. [13] X Research source The vest covers almost all of Goku's shoulders so draw the vest almost to the end of where the shoulders will be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curve the ends of the shoulder line and sketch the top of Goku's shirt.",
      "content": "Curve the ends of the shoulder line and sketch the top of Goku's shirt. Look at the shoulder line that you drew earlier and imagine it going through the vest. Continue this line past the vest and make the line slope down to the left. Repeat this for the right shoulder but make the line curve down to the right. Then, draw a horizontal line below the chest muscles to make the top of the shirt. [14] X Research source Make the ends of the shirt line touch the edges of the vest. To improve your artistic skills learn to observe things from a teacher. [15] X Research source Practice sketching. [16] X Research source Read more about art."
