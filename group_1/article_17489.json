Other metal pipes simply have you place the cigarette at one end of the pipe while you hold the metal tube and inhale from the free end. The smoke by volume is much greater with a hookah than a typical cigarette. The smoke is cooled as it passes through a water system before going through the pipe the user inhales from."
