      "title": "Trust in and flatter her open-mindedness.",
      "content": "Trust in and flatter her open-mindedness. Aquarius women are variously described as bohemian, eccentric, unusual or even a little quirky. [1] X Research source Use this knowledge to your advantage. Aquarius women want love, but not the cookie-cutter version you find in Hollywood movies. Do the unpredictable . Stay loose. Sometimes, consciously do something acceptable, but out of the ordinary, encouraging her to join you. Make sure your dates aren't too conventional, or she might lose interest. Don't waste your time with too many compliments. Aquarius women have more of a devil-may-care mentality, and generally aren't looking for approval from the rest of society. Give her one unusual compliment and leave it at that — your interest in her must already be apparent even without compliments. After she says or does something totally unexpected, say, “You’re the most interesting person I’ve ever met.” If you want her to take you seriously, you have to engage with her intellectually first."

      "title": "Stimulate all her senses.",
      "content": "Stimulate all her senses. Aquarius women want all their senses to be stimulated, although not at the same time, of course. She wants to do things out of the ordinary, and she wants her senses to be tickled at every step of the way. Here are some ideas for dates: Take her to a museum with contemporary art — the more outré, the better. Going glass blowing might be a good idea as well. These will stimulate her visual sense. Take her to a Szechuan restaurant, or maybe for some Israeli street food, or perhaps for some Caribbean jerk chicken. These will stimulate her sense of smell and taste. Take her to a concert that features some unusual music. Maybe look for some traditional Vietnamese folk music, or some salt-of-the-earth underground rock."

      "title": "Give her plenty of freedom.",
      "content": "Give her plenty of freedom. Aquarius women love their independence. Whether she eventually wants a spouse and family and white picket fence or not, she doesn’t want to be defined by them, and she’s in no rush to settle down. Avoid mentioning your desire for kids and a blissful domestic life until you’ve been dating for a while. Concentrate on improvising and staying loose for the time being. Take the relationship slower in the beginning. Coming on too strong too fast could scare her away. Don't let her know that you're pinning your hopes and dreams on her, even if you are. She won't want you to control her. Remember to not be clingy . She is very independent and definitely needs space."

      "title": "Embrace her erratic nature.",
      "content": "Embrace her erratic nature. It's not so much that she'll say one thing one day and do something else the next; it's that she's constantly exploring, experimenting, and building up information about novel things. [2] X Research source Be prepared for this. Although Aquarians are very well-rounded, they can be social butterflies and flit about without appearing to have a \"direction.\" Aquarius women are very social and love to be around people. Meeting new and interesting people is one of their favorite pastimes, so let your Aquarius feel like she has that option. Try to avoid feeling insecure if she seems to have a lot of intimate friends. Aquarians are good at staying emotionally detached, and while it may seem like she's paying undue attention to other people, it’s likely not a threat to your relationship."

      "title": "Give the courtship time to develop.",
      "content": "Give the courtship time to develop. Although Aquarians are air signs, they are by no means a whirlwind date. This means that you need to take the courtship slow in the beginning. She can be committed to someone but needs to be sure. Don't expect to woo her in a week. It takes time for her to let you into her inner circle, but once she does, you'll have the key for quite some time. Aquarius women may appear cold at first, but that’s only because they need time to get to know you better. [3] X Research source Once you’re in, though, you’re in for life: Aquarians are very loyal."

      "title": "Challenge her, but don't butt heads with her stubbornness.",
      "content": "Challenge her, but don't butt heads with her stubbornness. Since Aquarius women are naturally intelligent, they love hearing about new opinions and having opportunities to test out their logic. [4] X Research source That being said, Aquarians are also very stubborn people. They do not make changes in their opinions or viewpoints very frequently, so be prepared to back down from an argument, even if you know that you're right. To get an Aquarius to agree with you (or at least understand your perspective), try to use reasoning to argue your points. Aquarians are more susceptible to logic than to emotional appeals."

    {
      "title": "Support her ambitions.",
      "content": "Support her ambitions. As someone with lofty ideas, she wants to follow her passions and make a real difference in the world. Don’t just give her the time and space to dedicate to her ambition— cheer her on from the sidelines. Aquarius women have big ideas and can generally make things happen, but sometimes they appreciate some help with the details. [5] X Research source Don’t offer unsolicited advice, but if she asks for your opinion on something, praise her genius—but offer an honest critique , too. If she needs space to work on personal projects, avoid getting clingy. Better yet, use this time to work on personal projects of your own: it’s a good use of your time apart, and she’ll find your independence and initiative attractive."

    {
      "title": "Expect her to talk about (or even to) old flames.",
      "content": "Expect her to talk about (or even to) old flames. For the Aquarius woman, love is a sort of ideal quality, to be enjoyed and celebrated, not something that turns possessive or jealous. She will talk about her exes and crushes, and she expects you to treat them with the same respect that she does. Try to trust that her love for you is unconditional, even if she doesn't show it in the way you'd hope. She’s unlikely to marry you unless you become her best friend first. In her book, friends are held in very high esteem, almost equal with her lover. As far as Aquarians are concerned, Friends are forever and lovers can come and go . However, that doesn’t mean keeping it a secret that you’re into her: if you don’t make it clear that you like an Aquarius as more than just a friend, she may keep you in the friendzone forever."

      "title": "Spice things up, especially in bed.",
      "content": "Spice things up, especially in bed. An Aquarian will leave the relationship if she becomes bored with it. If you fall into the same routine day in and day out, it doesn't feel right to her. So try to spice things up a bit now and again. Let her feel like you're on the cutting edge of something so she'll always want to stick around for the ride. [6] X Research source She is not afraid to try new things in bed . She likes to push the envelope, which means everything from positions and scenarios to locations — a little romp in the hay somewhere public (but still secluded) might be exactly what she wants."

    {
      "title": "Research your own sign to understand how it relates to hers.",
      "content": "Research your own sign to understand how it relates to hers. No matter your astrological sign, you can make a relationship with an Aquarius work, and researching your sign can help you better anticipate what it'd be like to date your Aquarius lady. Aquarians are particularly compatible with Libras, Geminis, Sagittariuses, and Aries. With Libras : This partnership is lively and fun-loving. Great intellectual relationships, low in intensity, but great long-term. With Geminis : This partnership is one in which the Aquarius is completely stimulated one second and frustrated the next, albeit in a good way. Aquarius finds Gemini completely irresistible, making way for unconditional love. With \"Leos\": This partnership is rewarding and once they care it is unbreakable. When they meet there is magic in the air and after some disagreements they discover how loyal (in the deep sense) they are. These two opposites can make a long life entertaining partnership. With Sagittariuses : A very passionate relationship. Sagittarius needs even more space than Aquarius, which gives her the freedom she most desires. An unusual but usually deeply successful match. [7] X Research source With Aries : A very physical relationship. Though the possibility of burnout is high, Aquarius loves Aries' independence, and Aries’ directness stimulates her intellect.
