      "content": "Boil your shallots for 2 minutes and rinse them with cool water. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring the water to a boil. Submerge 4 cups (600 g) of shallots in the boiling water and leave them for 2 minutes to soften up the skins. Then, drain the shallots through a colander and rinse them off with cool water to stop the cooking process. [2] X Research source For reference, you can get 1 cup (150 g) from about 0.35 lb (0.16 kg) of shallots. Feel free to dump out the old water when you’re done. You can also skip this step and just peel them right away—shallots caramelize better when they're sliced."

      "content": "Peel the shallots to remove all of the skin. Trim away the roots from the end of the plant with a knife. Slide your knife in a vertical line down the surface of the shallot, which helps start the peeling process. Pinch and peel the outer skin away from the shallot. [3] X Research source If you’re roasting your shallots, you don’t have to worry about this."

At this point, move the shallots around in the skillet, keeping a close eye on them as you go. Flip the shallots over periodically, checking to see if they’re golden brown. [5] X Research source Don’t adjust the stovetop temperature at any point while the shallots cook."

      "content": "Drain out the leftover oil from the skillet. Remove your pan from the stovetop and lean it carefully over the nearest sink. While keeping your shallots in the pan with a spoon or other stirring utensil, pour out any extra oil so you can move onto the next part of the cooking phase. [6] X Research source While your shallots are pretty well cooked, you haven’t had the chance to add any extra flavor yet!"

Keep the stovetop on high temperature as you stir 2.1 cups (500 mL) of beef stock in with the caramelized shallots. Continue cooking the shallots until the sauce reduces, gets thicker, and has a sticky texture. [8] X Research source It may take several minutes before the sauce reaches your preferred consistency. The amount the sauce reduces will depend on how long you choose to cook the sauce."

Scoop up the shallots with a slotted spoon and move them over to the plate, where they’ll be ready to eat! [9] X Research source Cooked shallots are good for 3-5 days in the fridge. This dish makes about 8 servings, which equals ½ cup (75 g) of shallots per person."

[14] X Research source You can also eat the shallots within the skins, as long as you aren’t eating the skins themselves. If you’re using the shallots as an ingredient in a sauce, vinaigrette, or other homemade condiment, be sure to remove the skins before whipping up the finished product. [15] X Research source You can refrigerate your shallots for up to 5 days, or freeze them for up to 1 year. [16] X Research source"
