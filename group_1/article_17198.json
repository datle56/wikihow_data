It does not terribly matter which point is which, as long as you keep the labels (1 and 2) consistent throughout the problem. [1] X Research source x1 is the horizontal coordinate (along the x axis) of Point 1, and x2 is the horizontal coordinate of Point 2. y1 is the vertical coordinate (along the y axis) of Point 1, and y2 is the vertical coordinate of Point 2. For an example, take the points (3,2) and (7,8). If (3,2) is (x1,y1), then (7,8) is (x2,y2)."

The linear distance is the square root of the square of the horizontal distance plus the square of the vertical distance between two points. [2] X Research source More simply put, it is the square root of: ( x 2 − x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 − y 1 ) 2 {\\displaystyle (x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}"

      "content": "Find the horizontal and vertical distance between the points. First, subtract y2 - y1 to find the vertical distance. Then, subtract x2 - x1 to find the horizontal distance. Don't worry if the subtraction yields negative numbers. The next step is to square these values, and squaring always results in a positive number. [3] X Research source Find the distance along the y-axis. For the example points (3,2) and (7,8), in which (3,2) is Point 1 and (7,8) is Point 2: (y2 - y1) = 8 - 2 = 6. This means that there are six units of distance on the y-axis between these two points. Find the distance along the x-axis. For the same example points (3,2) and (7,8): (x2 - x1) = 7 - 3 = 4. This means that there are four units of distance separating the two points on the x-axis."

The linear distance between the two points is the square root of the sum of the squared values of the x-axis distance and the y-axis distance.
