      "content": "Mix one part dishwashing detergent with two parts of hydrogen peroxide. Both of these agents are effective stain and pigment removers on their own. Combinations of the two are considered to be among the strongest of household cleaners. [1] X Research source Though it is uncommon, hydrogen peroxide can damage certain types of fabrics. While peroxide is one of the most powerful cleaners you could use, you may not want to use it on the most delicate or valuable of clothes. [2] X Research source While it is always best to try to remove ink marks or any other potential stains as quickly as possible, the peroxide and dish soap treatment is also considered effective on older marks. Follow these same instructions to remove the stain."

A bare majority says that hot water only sets the ink and results in a stain. [3] X Research source Just to play it safe, cold water may be the best washing option. Wash the shirt by itself. The ink can be transferred from the shirt to other pieces of clothing in the wash, so it should be kept to itself."

Allow it to sit for at least ten minutes, and up to an hour. [4] X Research source Milk is one of the mildest potential cleaning agents you can use, and there is not known fabric that can not be treated in this way. It may be best to use 2 percent or whole milk. While the water in milk will pick up most types of dyes, the fats in whole and 2 percent milk will absorb others. This form of treatment is really only effective for the freshest of ink marks. Dried stains will not be affected by soaking in milk."
