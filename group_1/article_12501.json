      "title": "Feel the cotton wreath print for an authentic, rough texture.",
      "content": "Feel the cotton wreath print for an authentic, rough texture. A legitimate Denim Tears hoodie features embossed cotton wreaths that feel slightly rough to the touch. [1] X Research source A fake hoodie usually features smooth cotton wreaths because they’re made with a cheap, alternative printing process."

      "title": "Ensure that the cotton wreath is solid white and slightly raised.",
      "content": "Ensure that the cotton wreath is solid white and slightly raised. On a real Denim Tears hoodie, the cotton wreaths are a solid white color. A knock-off hoodie’s cotton wreaths may be patchy or faded, indicating they were screen-printed. [2] X Research source Additionally, the wreaths on an authentic hoodie are only slightly raised off the fabric. If they look super puffy and marshmallow-like, it could be a sign they’re fake."

    {
      "title": "Check that one cotton wreath continues under the hood.",
      "content": "Check that one cotton wreath continues under the hood. Real Denim Tears hoodies have a single cotton wreath that goes from the top outer edge of the hood to the inner head with no stitching or gaps. [3] X Research source If there’s stitching between the outer and inner part of the cotton wreath, or the cotton wreath cuts off on the outside of the hood, it’s a sign your hoodie is fake. [4] X Research source Some shoppers claim that early Denim Tears hoodies have a cotton wreath that cuts off on the edge of the hood and extra cotton wreaths inside the hood, but this is unverified."

      "title": "Look for out-of-place cotton wreaths on the inner hood.",
      "content": "Look for out-of-place cotton wreaths on the inner hood. Turn the hood inside-out to check for extra cotton wreaths. An authentic Denim Tears hoodie only has one wreath on the inside of the hood, continuing from the outside. A counterfeit may have random extra cotton wreaths around the inside of the hood.

      "title": "Check for a large black bar at the top of the wash tag.",
      "content": "Check for a large black bar at the top of the wash tag. Under the seams that attach the wash tag (the white tag with care instructions) to the inside of the hoodie, look for a large black rectangle. [6] X Research source The rectangle may be slightly covered by the seams. If the rectangle is absent, thin, or a different color, it’s a sign the hoodie is a knock-off. [7] X Research source If there’s no wash tag inside your Denim Tears hoodie, it’s a fake. The FTC requires manufacturers to attach a wash tag to garments that includes care instructions, the garment’s materials, the country of origin, and the manufacturer’s identity.

There are two main types of Denim Tears wash tags, one with “DENIM TEARS, LLC” at the top and one with “DENIM TEARS” in a blocky, outlined font at the top. Here’s some of the information to look for on each type of wash tag: [9] X Research source DENIM TEARS, LLC Wash Tag MADE IN PORTUGAL 100% COTTON MACHINE WASH AT 30 WASH WITH SIMILAR COLORS COLD IRON DO NOT IRON PRINT BLEACH, TUMBLE DRY FABRIQUE AU PORTUGAL DENIM TEARS Wash Tag 100% COTTON MACHINE WASH COLD GENTLE CYCLE TUMBLE DRY LOW DO NOT IRON DO NOT DRY CLEAN Collaborations between Denim Tears and other brands may have differing information on the wash tag. Some shoppers claim early Denim Tears hoodies were manufactured in the USA, not Portugal, but there’s no confirmation that this is true. Recent Denim Tears hoodies are made in Portugal and reflect this on their tags."

All Denim Tears hoodies have their neck tag sewn slightly below the back collar seam, leaving a gap between the seam and the top of the tag.

While some early Denim Tears hoodies featured stitching along the edge of the hood as well as under the hood, most newer designs don’t have any stitching at the edge.

A fake Denim Tears hoodie may appear smooth or fuzzy because it’s made of low-quality material instead of 100% cotton fabric.

While not every Denim Tears hoodie on the second-hand market is a fake, if it’s listed for a very cheap price, it could be a knock-off. It doesn’t make sense for a reseller to sell products at a loss. If someone makes a fake hoodie from subpar materials, they profit even while selling it cheaply.

Look at reviews to see if customers have complained about receiving fake products, but beware that positive reviews can be faked by the seller.
