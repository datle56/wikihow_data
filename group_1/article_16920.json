      "content": "Note the difference between family surnames and clan names. In North America, it is the standard that people are given surnames based on the names of the head of their family.

Depending on where your ancestors are from, you may need to trace back your surname to the clan, tribe, or kingdom your ancestors belonged to, rather than using a mother or father’s name as a guide."
