[2] X Research source If your CD/DVD-ROM drive has a long horizontal plastic bar on the front, press firmly on the right side of the bar to eject the tray.

Behind that hole is a button that can eject the tray whether the PC is on or off. This will allow you to remove a stuck CD or DVD . [4] X Research source If you're using a desktop PC and don't see a pinhole, you'll need to remove the front panel to make it visible. Check your PC's manual for instructions on removing the panel. If you’re using a laptop without a manual release hole, you’ll need to take your device in for repair. Before doing so, try restarting your computer and updating its drivers to see if it’s a software issue rather than a hardware problem."

If the paperclip doesn't easily insert into the hole, don't force it—you've likely found the light rather than the release hole."
