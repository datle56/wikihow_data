      "title": "Line up a wire stripper's printed side to your screw.",
      "content": "Line up a wire stripper's printed side to your screw. Wire strippers have a side with measurements printed on them and a blank side. The side with measurements has the sharper end of the blade, so you'll want to cut with the screw inserted into the printed side. The tip of the screw should be poking out of the blank side. [1] X Research source Wire strippers work best for small- to medium-sized screws up to about 3 mm (0.1 in) in diameter, especially when the end of the screw is sticking out in a confined space (like inside a drawer). Use a high quality wire stripper as lower quality pairs, especially those included in tool kits, may not be strong enough to get the job done. Alternatively, use a pair of cutting pliers instead of a wire stripper. These are also great for small or medium screws and work well in tight spaces. Safety tip: Wear safety goggles before cutting a screw in case the clipped end flies away."

      "content": "Locate the correct hole size on your wire stripper. Wire strippers have multiple hole sizes. Choose one that fits your screw snugly but doesn't require it to be forced in. If the hole is too big, the screw may just bend instead of being cut. If it's too small, you won't get a close cut. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the wire stripper against the project surface.",
      "content": "Press the wire stripper against the project surface. Slide the wire stripper over the screw until the printed side is pressed snugly against the underside of your project surface. The tip of the screw you’re trying to cut and the wire stripper should both be on the same side of the surface. Check that the handles of the wire strippers are open enough to let the screw slide through the hole. [3] X Research source You may have to thread or turn the screw to get it into the wire stripper hole. You can do this by hand, or use a small drill to quickly turn the screw."

      "title": "Squeeze the wire stripper until the end of the screw snaps off.",
      "content": "Squeeze the wire stripper until the end of the screw snaps off. To cut the screw, squeeze the wire stripper tightly until you feel the end of the screw fall off. It's okay to squeeze a few times, but avoid jiggling the wire stripper. You'll wind up with an uneven cut. [4] X Research source If you're having trouble cutting the screw, try squeezing the wire strippers 3-4 times. If you're not making any progress, go to the next smaller hole. If there’s any length of screw still sticking out, you can cut the screw again. Some wire strippers will be difficult to line up perfectly with a surface, so it's okay to make a second cut."

      "title": "Hacksaw",
      "content": "Hacksaw A hacksaw can cut through screws of any diameter and comes in handy for those too big for a wire stripper or cutting pliers. Simply use the gap between 2 threads as a guide for the saw blade to cut a protruding screw close to the surface. If you’re cutting a loose screw, secure it in a vice or clamps before sawing. [5] X Research source Afterward, your cut will be slightly angled (since the threads are angled). If you need to smooth it out, twist a nut over the screw so only the angled tip is protruding, then use the flat surface of the nut as a guide to saw the screw again (flat this time). If needed, take the end of the screw to a belt sander to smooth out the bottom edges."

      "title": "Reciprocating saw",
      "content": "Reciprocating saw If you're having a hard time accessing the back of the screw with your wire strippers, you can use a reciprocating saw with a long bi-metal blade . The blade is long and typically flexible, helping you make your cut flush with your project surface, and the saw will make a smooth cut with no sharp edges. These tools are often used at demolition sites for screw cutting. [6] X Research source To use a reciprocating saw , position the saw-edge of the blade against the screw. Try to angle the flexible blade so it’s as flush against your work surface as you can get it (try to keep the blade as straight as possible for the cleanest results). Turn on the saw and apply gentle pressure as you glide it back and forth against the screw. The blade moves back and forth rapidly and will cut through the screw in a few seconds.

      "content": "Oscillating tool An oscillating tool with a multipurpose blade can cut through nearly any material, including thick metal screws. [8] X Research source To cut a screw, attach your blade and adjust the blade angle so it’s as flush to your project surface as you can get it (the adjustable blades make this a great tool for cutting screws in tight places or at difficult angles). [9] X Research source Then, position the blade so the screw is centered on the edge (don’t start cutting from one end of the blade or the other). Set the tool to a low speed and press gently against the screw (high speed or pressure creates lots of friction heat, which can be dangerous). [10] X Research source Move the tool back and forth slightly as you cut to avoid heating up the blade in one concentrated area. Take your time and avoid rushing through the screw. Know that sawing through metal may damage or wear down your saw blades."

      "title": "Angle grinder or Dremel tool",
      "content": "Angle grinder or Dremel tool Home improvement specialist Ryaan Tuttle says, “Grinders or Dremel tools are amazing for cutting screws. That's what I use. The little spinning metal cutting disk can dip all the little metal heads right off or you could just use a typical forage angle grinder with a metal blade on it.” [11] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. An angle grinder uses a heavy duty circular blade that can cut through thick metal screws. The tool itself is a bit cumbersome, so it’s easier to cut loose screws than screws that are already sticking out of a surface. First, clamp your screw in place at a workstation (measuring and marking your cut line with a marker first, if needed). Then, turn on the saw and glide it back and forth against the screw until the end is cut loose. [12] X Research source The cut may be rough, so sand the end of the screw or hold it to a bench grinder to smooth the edges. Twist a nut back and forth over the end to reform the threads. A Dremel tool similarly uses a circular saw attachment to do the same job. These tend to be smaller and work better in tighter spaces than an angle grinder."

      "title": "Bolt cutters",
      "content": "Bolt cutters Bolt cutters can cut through thick metal diameters and come in a variety of sizes to fit the screw you’re working with. However, they’re kind of bulky and can be difficult to use in tight spaces or on small screws. To use them, first secure the screw in clamps or a vice (or position the bolt cutters as flush as you can against your project surface if the screw is already inserted and sticking out). [13] X Research source Then, position the jaws of the bolt cutters around the screw and squeeze the handles together to cut through it. The cut may not be super clean (especially if you have to twist or jiggle the bolt cutters to slice through the screw), so plan on sanding or covering the end of the screw afterward."

      "title": "Sand the tip of the screw if it’s barely protruding from the surface.",
      "content": "Sand the tip of the screw if it’s barely protruding from the surface. If the remaining screw tip is almost level with the surface and is just a little rough, use a sander with coarse paper to smooth it out a little. Sandpaper in the 40- to 50-grit range should do the trick. Be careful—sharp edges can damage a sander. If you don't have a sander, try using heavy duty sandpaper (the kind that has material backing) on a sanding block . Run it over the screw tip a few times. If you're sanding down multiple screws, it's easier to use a grinder or drill with a grinding tip. This will save you time and elbow grease."

      "content": "Use a thread file to repair damaged threads so you can reuse the screw. If the threads toward the end of the screw were damaged during cutting (or if they’re just showing wear and tear) and you want to reuse the screw later, a thread file will do the job. First, determine how many threads there are per inch (or per millimeter if you’re using a metric tool). If you’re unsure, just measure 1 inch with a tape measure and count how many threads there are (the thickness of the screw does not matter for this). [14] X Research source Say there are 18 threads per inch. Find the portion of the thread file marked “18” (this is the portion you’ll use to file the screw threads). [15] X Research source Gently file the screw threads with the thread file, running the tool back and forth parallel to the threads to redefine them. It may be helpful to secure the screw in a clamp or vice. [16] X Research source Try to screw on a nut periodically to check your progress and make sure you’re not taking off too much metal. Wear protective work gloves to protect your fingertips from the abrasive surface of the thread file."

      "content": "Add a nut to hide the end of longer screws. If there is a longer piece of screw that you can't trim any further, use a nut with the same thread size to hold it in place and prevent snags. Just use a wrench to secure it snugly in place. [17] X Research source As an alternative, you can use screw end caps , also called thread covers. These are soft and flexible, making them easy to slide over the exposed end of your screw."

      "title": "Drill a pilot hole into your project surface.",
      "content": "Drill a pilot hole into your project surface. Never drill a screw directly into any surface. Drilling a pilot hole will prevent splitting and buckling, and will make it easier to determine if your screw is actually too long. To drill a pilot hole, choose a drill bit 1 size smaller from your actual screw size. Then, drill all the way down in the exact spot where you plan to put your screw. [18] X Research source If you want your screw to be flush with the board, use a drill bit 1 size larger than your screw head. However, only drill about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) into the wood."

      "title": "Thread the screw into the hole.",
      "content": "Thread the screw into the hole. Use a drill or a screwdriver to work the screw into your pilot hole. A screwdriver is best for softer woods and delicate jobs, such as antique furniture. Use a drill for hardwood and metal. Make sure the screw is fully sunk into the pilot hole. If your screw isn't all the way in, you won't get an accurate measurement. Bolt the screw firmly into place. The head of the screw should be level to or slightly below your project surface in most cases. Don't drill too hard—if you strip the screw, it will be almost impossible to remove later."

      "title": "Check the backside of your project to see if the screw is poking out.",
      "content": "Check the backside of your project to see if the screw is poking out. Look on the other side of your project surface. If you can see or feel the tip of the screw poking out, it's too long and you'll need to cut it to fit. Depending on how much is sticking out and how much space you have to work with, you may not have to take the screw back out to cut it—you can probably trim it right there with wire strippers. If you know you’ll need to cut multiple screws to the same length, measure how much you need to cut off of this test screw. Then, use a tape measure and marker to measure and mark where to cut on the rest of your screws."
