      "content": "Choose a bleaching kit with a 30- or 40-volume developer to lift dark color. A 40-volume developer will lift your hair up to 8 levels of color (from near black to dark blonde) in one session. This is great if your desired red color is bright, coppery, or blondish. To get the truest-to-shade red when you color, bleach your hair to a pale yellow color. [1] X Research source For darker or brownish red, use a 20-volume developer (most store-bought bleaching kits come with this strength). This lightens your hair 2 to 3 shades. If you want a reddish tint to your natural shade of brown, you don’t need to bleach at all. [2] X Research source If your hair is already colored, though, bleaching is a must. Follow the instructions on your bleaching kit carefully. 30- and 40-volume developers can cause scalp irritation or burns if misused or left on too long."

There’s always the chance you’ll drip some bleach onto your clothes, so wear something you don’t mind getting stained, like an old t-shirt. Wrap an old towel around your neck as well. Wear some rubber gloves to protect your hands from the bleaching product. [3] X Research source Bleach your hair in a room with good ventilation. Remove any bathroom rugs or mats to protect them from accidental bleach spills and drips."

Once your time is up, rinse out the bleach with cool water and wash it with a blue toner or purple shampoo to prevent a brassy or orange color from forming. To restore moisture, do a deep conditioning treatment too. [8] X Research source Washing and conditioning your hair reduces brassiness and ensures your red dye will come out true-to-shade."

If you have cool undertones (your skin tone is pink or pale and the veins in your wrist look blue), opt for cool , dark , or ashy reds. For warm undertones (your skin tone is tan or olive and your wrist veins look green), go for a bright or golden red. [10] X Research source If you have neutral undertones (a mix of cool and warm), you can pull off almost any kind of red! Follow the “2 shade rule”—pick a color at least 2 shades lighter or darker than your skin tone to avoid looking washed out. [11] X Research source Choose permanent color for long lasting red, or demi-permanent to experiment with color for just a few weeks."

[22] X Research source When you start washing your hair again, use cold water (hot water will steam away the color, meaning your dye job won’t last as long). If your hair gets oily, try a scalp exfoliator or dry shampoo. It will remove some oil from your hair and keep it moisturized without eroding your color."
