      "content": "Consider wearing nylon stockings with a “control top.” Control-top hosiery works extremely well to keep your midsection flat, especially when wearing dresses and skirts. Control top hosiery has a tall, thick layer at the top hem designed to stretch over your stomach and keep everything in place. This creates a smoother look that will make your dress or skirt look more flattering."

      "title": "Buy the right size clothes.",
      "content": "Buy the right size clothes. Clothes that are too small and tight will show every area of excess your body has. On the other hand, clothes that are too big and baggy will make you look wider and heavier than you actually are. Only clothes that fit you properly will flatter you. That means trying clothes on at the store. [5] X Research source Just because a size tag claims a shirt is a certain size, doesn't mean that that shirt is going to fit you the same as other shirts you have in that same size. If having your clothes fit you properly means getting you garments tailored, so be it. [6] X Research source"

That means avoiding overly tight and clingy clothes. [7] X Research source Tight material will hug to your body and show every fold you have. When you're trying to look slimmer, you should aim to draw attention away from excess skin, not display it. The same can be said for the opposite: Clothes that are too loose make you look frumpy and bigger than you actually are – which is unflattering. However, look for clothing that drapes over your frame rather than hanging off of it. [8] X Research source You want your clothing to be fitted yet comfortably loose enough to follow along your body's contours without smothering them. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source A good way to bring color and interest into your wardrobe is by including a variety of rich colors, from deep plum to dark olive and navy blue to chocolate brown.

      "content": "Try to incorporate bold colors and patterns. As mentioned earlier, bold colors can accentuate your good areas and dark colors can conceal on your problem areas. Consider adding some bold color and print patterns into your wardrobe to mix things up. Be sure that you choose print patterns that are small – approximately the size of your fist. [13] X Research source [14] X Research source Bold patterns can distract the eye and camouflage your outline, causing the observer to notice the item of clothing instead of your size. Choose patterns in bright or deep colors, since patterns in light colors may actually draw further attention to your imperfections and make you look larger."

As a result, the eye takes in more height than width, causing you to appear thinner and taller.

Color blocked dresses can create the same flattering look a dress with one color creates, except color blocked dresses have with different colored panels that can create or accentuate a flattering figure.

If you have wide feet, strappy sandals and flats will only accentuate the heft of your foot.

Be sure to keep your eyebrows nicely arched and shaped and to cover up and under eye circles that could appear to drag your face down. However, you don't wear too much make-up.

Even though it creates a horizontal line across your body, a fashionable belt tied around your natural waist may emphasize the narrowness of your waist and create a flattering, slim silhouette. Stick with narrow belts rather than wider belts. This will encourage that your waist looks cinched, rather than bound. For example, consider a thin, leopard printed belt with a black outfit."
