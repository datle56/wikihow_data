      "content": "Deserts are one of the most fascinating biomes on Earth! They’re found all over the world on every continent—even Antarctica. They feature bright sunsets, terrestrial-looking plants, and interesting wildlife. Life in a desert is likely different from what you may know, and we’ve put together this list of fun and interesting facts to prove it! The word “desert” comes from the Latin word for “an abandoned place.” Deserts can be hot, like the Sahara, or cold, like Antarctica. The average size of a desert is 46,000 square miles (119,140 sq km). After it rains, a desert might not get another rainfall for months or years. Only about 20% of deserts are covered by sand. Most deserts were formed over 10,000 years ago. About ⅙ of the Earth’s population lives in deserts. Dust storms can reach up to 25 miles an hour. A fully-grown saguaro cactus can store up to 200 gallons (760 L) of water. [2] X Research source Succulents make their own sunscreen. Deserts are the driest places on Earth, getting less than 10 inches (25 cm) of rain a year. [3] X Research source The biggest desert in the world is Antarctica. Most desert animals stay underground during the day and come out to hunt at night. The desert biome covers ⅕ of the Earth’s surface. [4] X Research source Cacti have enlarged stems to store water. There are 4 types of deserts: hot and dry, semi-arid, coastal, and cold. Some deserts have an oasis, or an area of land that has natural underground springs. [5] X Research source There are 4 major deserts in the US: the Great Basin, the Mojave, the Sonoran, and the Chihuahuan. Desert plants give off a special chemical that helps prevent other plants from growing in their area. One way desert plants get water is by growing deep taproots that are over 100 feet (30 m) long. Plants in the desert can shrink or swell depending on their water storage. Desert plants can grow hair and spines to help reduce water loss and wind damage. Animals in the desert don’t need as much water to survive. The clouds of sand during a sandstorm are often so dense they block the sun. [6] X Research source Camels survive in the desert by storing water in the body fat of their humps. Mars is the only other planet that has identifiable deserts."

The Sahara Desert covers 8% of the Earth’s land area. There are over 20 lakes in the Sahara, with most of them being saltwater lakes. The sand dunes in the Sahara can be as high as 1,476 feet (450 m). “Sahara” is derived from the Arabic word ṣaḥrā, which means “desert.” The Sahara desert has a population of about 2 million people. The Sahara desert is 3,000 metres (3.0 km) wide from east to west. [9] X Research source Sand sheets and dunes make up 25% of the Sahara. The Sahara is divided into two climatic regimes: dry subtropical and dry tropical climates."

The Kalahari is the southernmost desert in Africa. The Kalahari Desert covers more than 70% of Botswana. [22] X Research source The Kalahari receives 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) of rain a year, meaning it’s not always considered a true desert. [23] X Research source The word “Kalahari” comes from the Tswana word kgala , which means “great thirst.” The earliest inhabitants of the Kalahari were the Khoisan, who were hunter-gatherers. Central Kalahari has the largest game reserve in Botswana."
