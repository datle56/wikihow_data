      "title": "Take a Sitz bath.",
      "content": "Take a Sitz bath. Sitz baths technically only have a few inches of water to soak the anus but if you prefer a full bath, it can accomplish the same thing. If you prefer the traditional Sitz bath, just fill the tub with a few inches of water or buy a Sitz bath at any pharmacy or medical supply store. Some of the commercial bags come with tubing and vents to allow water to constantly circulate. These provide a constant supply of water that is useful but not essential; the same effects can be accomplished at home using the tub. These baths allow for better circulation in the anal area and for relaxation and healing of the tissues around the anus. [2] X Research source [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Add about one cup of epsom salts to a full bathtub or two to three tablespoons of epsom salts for a few inches of water in the tub. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. Repeat two to three times a day. Fill your bathtub with about 6 inches (15 cm) of warm water and add a handful of Epsom salt to the mix, stirring it up so it dissolves. Now sit in the bathtub with your knees flexed for fifteen minutes. Flexing the knees will expose your anus to the water and the warm water will soothe the pain and the inflammation."

      "title": "Use unscented moistened wipes.",
      "content": "Use unscented moistened wipes. Maintaining hygiene is important for someone who is suffering from hemorrhoids because it prevents complications from forming, such as infection or blistering of anal mucosa due to excessive dryness. To prevent such complications, one may use unscented cotton wet wipes, often called \"baby wipes\" (can be purchased in many common types of stores) to gently wipe the anal region after every bowel movement. After a Sitz bath—and in general—avoid wiping with regular toilet paper or hard towels. Only use soft and gentle methods of cleaning. A baby wipe is an effective and soothing product. In addition, avoid perfumed or colored toilet paper. Although they may seem pleasing, the chemical additives that create scent and color can cause local irritation on the body."

      "title": "Apply an astringent to the affected area.",
      "content": "Apply an astringent to the affected area. Pharmaceutical witch hazel is a naturally-derived antioxidant and astringent, which can help soothe engorged hemorrhoids and make them feel less sore, and may significantly help to reduce itching of piles. [6] X Research source Witch hazel can be applied directly--gently and in moderate amounts--with cotton swabs or cotton pads; soaked pads can be bought in stores. However, know that witch hazel and other astringents will likely need to be avoided in the presence of auto-immune disorders such as moderate to severe dermal sensitivity (i.e. rosacea, eczema), and, of course, allergy to a substance in question; always consider your overall health and other known or suspected health conditions before using medicinal products. Repeat as often as needed. Try to apply witch hazel at least 4 to 5 times a day. Warm olive oil is an alternative to witch hazel. Olive oil will additionally remedy the dryness of the affected area as it is a rich lubricant containing antioxidants. For non-dietary use, choose non-virgin oil for lower price and better resource allocation. Warm, wet tea bags can also be used to soothe pain in the anal region. Tea contains a natural astringent which helps to reduce swelling, while the warmth of the tea bag can relieve pain. Before use, ensure that the tea (not \"tisane\") bag is not hot."

      "content": "Try pain- and itch-relieving topical applications. After a bath and fully drying off, use a small amount of aloe vera gel or Preparation H ointment to help with hemorrhoidal pain and discomfort. Apply as often as needed (also consult directions and ingredients written on labels). Aloe vera gel contains components that have been shown to inhibit infection and help in healing minor wounds. You can use the gel straight from an aloe plant by taking a large leaf and cutting it open to release the gel. Alternatively, you can purchase 100% natural aloe vera gel from a drug store. Preparation H ointment, available in most grocery stores, contains petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrine—phenylephrine acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid."

You can take senna as tablets (following manufacturer’s instructions) or as a nightly tea. [8] X Research source Psyllium : A natural bulking and softening agent. Adults can take between 1/2 and 2 teaspoons of psyllium (such as Metamucil) in 8 ounces of water once daily. The psyllium should be added to the water, stirred and drunk immediately (the mixture thickens quickly). You may want to start with 1/2 teaspoon and increase the dose by 1/2 teaspoon the next day if passing stool is still uncomfortable. Flaxseed : Add as a bulking agent to foods such as cereals, salads, soups and smoothies. Adding 2 to 3 tablespoons of flaxseed daily can ease the passage of stools.

Here are some ideas: Bitter gourd leaves , when crushed, can be applied locally to relieve the pain caused by piles. [10] X Research source Grover, J. K.; Yadav, S. P. (2004). \"Pharmacological actions and potential uses of Momordica charantia: A review\". Journal of Ethnopharmacology 93 (1): 123–132 Baking soda can be applied as a powder or as a paste on the swollen veins (use 1 tablespoon of baking soda and mix with water). Make sure to only leave it on for 15 minutes as the paste could dry out the area and worsen the situation. [11] X Research source About 5 milliliters of the latex or juice of the banyan tree , when added to a serving of milk and consumed once daily (especially in the morning), is beneficial for patients with piles. A mixture of ginger and honey , boiled to make a decoction (an extraction through boiling) and then spiced with a dash of sweet lime and mint leaves helps detoxify the body and cool the body system. It will ensure a good blood supply to the piles. 3 teaspoons of honey boiled with 2 teaspoons of pepper and 2 teaspoons of fennel along with 500 millimeters of water makes an excellent decoction that can be consumed over the day."

To create a dilution, add 2 to 4 drops of a chosen essential oil to 2 fluid ounces (59.1 ml) of a base, such as jojoba oil, castor oil, almond oil or avocado oil. Mix well and apply directly to external piles. Use 1 essential oil or up to 2 to 3 in a mixture. [12] X Research source Lavender oil can help relieve pain and itching. Cypress oil is used to soothe and help in healing tissue. Tea tree oil is an antiseptic and is anti-inflammatory. Avocado oil can be used as a base or added to other oils. It moisturizes, soothes and accelerates healing."

      "title": "Eat more fiber.",
      "content": "Eat more fiber. Preventing difficult or straining bowel movements by softening the stool is a major method of both preventing and getting rid of piles. Fiber is very important in this regard. It helps keep water in the stool and bulks it up so that the stool passes through the rectum and anus more easily and, in the case of hemorrhoids, with less pain. (Note: determine ingredient sensitivity and allergy prior to following any consumption advice.) Good sources of fiber include: [13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Whole grains, including brown rice, barley, corn, rye, bulgur wheat, kasha (buckwheat) and oatmeal. (Note: consuming grain while having auto-immune disorders or sensitivity to gluten or starches can cause bloating, cramping, diarrhea, intestinal damage and other ailments.) Fruits, especially cherries, blueberries, plums, prunes, apricots, raspberries and strawberries. Vegetables, such as leafy vegetables like Swiss chard, collard greens, spinach, lettuce, beet greens.

Vitamin C along with anthocyanins helps keep your veins strong and can protect against straining or tearing in the anus. [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Citrus and other fruits often also contain bioflavonoids, which help strengthen your veins. Fruits rich in flavonoids are lemons and limes, apples and tomatoes. Anthocyanin-rich foods include onions, red cabbage and carrots and fruits like berries, grapes and cherries. (Note: most of the aforementioned foods in this section are noted cautionary items in auto-immune diet protocols, and they can disrupt digestion, blood pressure and immune response in sensitive individuals with compromised auto-immunity.) All varieties of berries, owing to their anti-inflammatory properties and being rich in vitamin C and flavonoids, ensure smooth passage for the stool. They're also excellent sources of antioxidants."

      "content": "Try drinking more vegetable juices. Drinking beetroot juice has shown to reduce blood pressure by about 2% and may be helpful in reducing the swelling of hemorrhoids. You might try having a glass each week or eat a boiled beetroot each day for a month and see if you notice the difference. Alternatively, radish juice is one of the best options to flush out the toxins from the body as well as ensure that the stool passes through without any pain and discomfort. One must be careful with the quantity consumed, as ¼ cup of radish juice once a day is more than enough. More than ½ a cup can aggravate the symptoms. A little juice of turnip leaves can also be added to the radish juice or can be had by itself too."
