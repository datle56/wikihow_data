Soak a cotton ball in your favorite nail polish remover and quickly swipe the surface of each nail with the cotton ball. Nail polish remover gets rid of any oil or dirt on your nails so the polish sticks well and lasts longer. [1] X Research source Acetone nail polish remover works best. If you prefer non-acetone remover, don’t worry! It will still get the job done. If you'd like, you can make cleanup easier by applying a latex skin protector around each nail.

      "content": "Grab 2-3 nail polish colors that look good together. You need a minimum of 2 colors to do a gradient. Monochrome gradients use different shades of the same color. Colors that are right next to each other on the color wheel also look great together. Create a simple monochrome gradient with baby blue, navy blue, and midnight blue polish. Green, blue, and purple work well since they're next to each other on the color wheel."

      "content": "Apply a clear or white base coat and wait 2 minutes for it to dry. A base coat gives the colored polish something to stick to so your manicure lasts longer. Clear is traditional but a white base coat can make colors pop a bit more. Apply a single narrow stroke right down the center of your nail. Then, finish with 1 stroke on each side of the center stripe. [3] X Research source This 3-stroke application technique is a tried-and-true way to apply nail polish with great results. Avoid putting down a thick layer of base coat. A thin coat is all you need!"

      "content": "Apply 1 coat of the first color to each nail and let it dry for 2 minutes. You can start with any of your chosen colors, but most nail artists suggest beginning with the lightest color. Use the 3-stroke application technique to put down a thin coat of your first color. Paint the entire surface of every nail just like you would if you were doing a normal manicure. Most nail polishes take about 2 minutes to dry. It's easier to start with the lightest color and work a darker color into it. Things get a bit messier and it's harder to create a nice gradient if you start with a dark color and try to blend a lighter shade into it."

Apply a small amount of polish—you can always add more polish as you go. Correcting a thick, goopy layer of polish on your nails is much harder! [4] X Research source If you don't have cotton swabs, cotton balls also work. You'll need to work a little harder at keeping your hand steady, though! It's easier to mess up because the surface of a cotton ball is a lot wider than a cotton swab. Be sure to apply the polish to the cotton ball in the shape of your nail. If you have a clean eyeshadow applicator, you can use the same technique to create this look. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use light pressure to apply the second color starting at the center. If you want the gradient to move from cuticle to tip, start at the center of your nail and work toward the end of each nail. Use gentle pressure to dab and blend the color lightly at the center. Keep the color soft and don't create any hard lines. Continue adding polish as you work your way to the tip, gradually making the color darker and more saturated as you go. [6] X Research source For a horizontal gradient, start in the center and move to the left or right of the center. Everything else is the same. [7] X Research source If you’re doing 3 colors, stop halfway to the edge of your nail to leave room for the last color. The rest of the instructions are the same."

For the upper portion, a plain white polish will do the trick. [10] X Research source The peach/pink mimics the flesh-toned color of your nail beds. The white mimics the white tips of natural fingernails. This technique is ideal for precision-blending an ombre French manicure, but you can use it for regular gradients, as well."
