      "content": "Determine whether the event requires cocktail, formal, or casual garden attire. Check your invitation or contact the party’s host to see if there’s a specific dress code. While garden party attire has a general aesthetic, the exact length, style, and pattern of your dress—or the type of suit you should wear—depends on whether the party calls for formal, cocktail, or casual attire. [1] X Research source Most garden parties call for casual or cocktail (semi-formal) garden party attire. Most garden party weddings call for cocktail (semi-formal) or formal garden party attire."

      "title": "Wear light, breathable fabrics like linen and chiffon.",
      "content": "Wear light, breathable fabrics like linen and chiffon. As the name suggests, a garden party event or wedding tends to be held outside in a garden environment. Prevent discomfort and sweat stains by choosing an outfit made of a light, breathable fabric like linen, cotton, seersucker, chiffon, or silk. [2] X Research source Check the weather ahead of the event to make sure your outfit is suited for any rain, wind, or harsh sun in the forecast. Consider if the event will go into the evening or night—in that case, you’ll probably need a light cardigan or blazer when the sun goes down. Avoid heavy fabrics like denim and fleece and non-breathable fabrics like polyester, rayon, latex, leather, acrylic, and nylon. Synthetic fabrics tend to retain odors. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Opt for light, bright colors like pastel pinks and summery oranges. Whether you’re planning to wear a dress, a suit, a jumpsuit, or a dress shirt and slacks, it’s important to choose clothes in a hue that fits the season and the garden setting. Appropriate garden party attire colors include baby blue, pastel pink, pale peach, daffodil, and mint green. For a summer party, bright colors like red or orange work as well. [4] X Research source Looking for a more neutral outfit? Go for a light gray or blush outfit. You can wear white to a non-wedding garden party—just be extra careful not to stain it. There’s no rule banning dark colors from garden parties. However, these shades are best suited for fall garden parties and weddings."

      "content": "Incorporate floral patterns, ruffles, and flowy silhouettes. Nothing says “garden party” like a floral print. Look for a floral dress or tie. Another source of inspiration for garden party attire is cottagecore, an aesthetic that features ruffles, puffy sleeves, and flowy silhouettes. Keep these elements in mind when shopping for the perfect outfit. [5] X Research source If you go for a floral print, make sure it’s not too loud or busy. Not a fan of classic florals? Go for an intricate paisley pattern."

      "title": "Choose pieces that are modest and elegant.",
      "content": "Choose pieces that are modest and elegant. Most garden party events have an elegant, classy vibe. Wear a dress with a hem that hits above the knee or lower—midi-length is a popular choice, but maxi dresses are appropriate too. Choose a dress that’s not too revealing or form-fitting—a garden party is an occasion to look reserved and modest. [6] X Research source At a casual or cocktail attire garden party or wedding, feel free to rock a shorter dress—such as a mini dress . [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear comfortable shoes that can handle the outdoors.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable shoes that can handle the outdoors. Stilettos and other heels could sink into the grass. Instead, opt for sandals, wedges, espadrilles, or summery flats. [8] X Research source Wedges are best for a formal event, including weddings, while sandals or espadrilles are perfectly on-theme for a casual- or cocktail-attire garden party. For men, dress shoes are the standard, but you can wear sandals to a casual event. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Accessorize with jewelry, sunglasses, and hats. A classic garden-party look isn’t complete without a wide-brimmed hat or fascinator—find one that complements your outfit without distracting from it. Bring a pair of shades in case it’s bright out. Finally, polish off your look with delicate gold or silver jewelry . [10] X Research source Unsure how to accessorize a suit? “I would consider shoes, socks, ties, and belts to be accessories [for a suit], and they should all coordinate with each other and the suit color,” says stylist and image consultant Nejla Renee. Wondering which bag to bring? Choose a small clutch or cross-body purse that matches the color of your outfit. Leave larger bags at home."

      "content": "A floral sundress with espadrilles and a sun hat. Look for a maxi sundress in your favorite soft-colored floral pattern. Add casual, garden-ready footwear like espadrilles . Protect yourself from the sun’s glare with a wide-brimmed straw hat that offers portable shade. This look is best for casual or cocktail garden party events, so it might be too casual for a wedding."

      "content": "An A-line midi dress with two-tone flats. A-line silhouettes are flattering on almost every body type. Resembling the letter “A,” they cling to the bodice before widening out from waist to hem. [11] X Research source Pick your favorite A-line midi dress in a bright color like flame orange. Neutralize the look with two-tone flats (black and white, for example). This look works for formal garden party events, including weddings. Depending on the dress’s style, it could also fit in at a casual soirée."

      "content": "A gingham blouse, tan dress pants, and a light sweater. Ditch the dress for a classy pants-and-top look. Find tailored dress pants in tan or another sandy beige. Pair with a pastel gingham blouse . Finally, layer on a light sweater or cardigan that matches the blouse. Feel free to accessorize with delicate jewelry, such as small hoops . [12] X Research source A casual or cocktail garden party is the perfect setting for this business-casual look."

      "title": "A dressy romper, block heels, and stud earrings.",
      "content": "A dressy romper, block heels, and stud earrings. If dresses aren’t your thing, opt for a dressy romper instead. Avoid smocking or ruffles, as these make a romper look more casual. Instead, look for a sleek design and a quality fabric like 100% cotton. Add a pair of block heels that won’t sink into the grass, and some stud earrings for a touch of sparkle. [13] X Research source Because this is a shorter look, wear it only to casual or semi-formal (cocktail) attire events."

      "title": "A pantsuit, flats, and a clutch.",
      "content": "A pantsuit, flats, and a clutch. Make a statement by wearing a powerful pantsuit in a bold hue like deep green (to match a garden’s colors). Wear flats or simple sandals so you don’t trip on the hem of your pantsuit. Complete the look with a clutch in a neutral color like black, or go for a flashier bag with green sequins . [14] X Research source From cocktail to formal dress codes, a pantsuit is usually considered wedding-worthy. Avoid wearing this look at a casual garden party—especially if it’s going to be a hot day."

      "content": "A lightweight blazer, crisp dress shirt, chinos, and loafers. While most events leave men to choose from just a few neutral colors, a garden party opens up the possibilities. Dress to fit the theme with a lightweight blazer in a pastel hue. Layer it over a crisp white dress shirt . Polish off the look with neutral chinos and whatever loafers you’re comfortable getting dirt on. [17] X Research source Depending on your interpretation of a cocktail dress code, wear this look to a casual or cocktail garden party event or wedding. A formal event calls for a suit, instead."

      "content": "A light-colored suit and comfortable dress shoes. Wear a lightweight, light-colored seersucker or linen suit in a pastel color like blush or baby blue. [18] X Research source Pair the look with dress shoes that complement the suit—your best bet is light brown.

Add a subtle pop of color with a summery gingham pocket square in a standout hue like red or blue. Wear a tan suit to a summer garden party wedding. For garden parties, it might be best to wear chinos and a blazer to a casual affair so you don’t feel overdressed, but cocktail- and formal-attire dress codes are fair game."

      "title": "A fine-knit sweater, chinos, and moccasins.",
      "content": "A fine-knit sweater, chinos, and moccasins. On chillier days, swap a button-down for a fine-knit sweater in a muted shade like lilac or dusty rose.

Choose this look for casual or cocktail garden party events."

      "title": "Avoid tight, revealing, or heavy garments.",
      "content": "Avoid tight, revealing, or heavy garments. Wearing tight or revealing clothes goes against the elegant nature of the event—and can be uncomfortable after a while in the sun. The same goes for heavy materials like denim or wool. [20] X Research source Your dress or pants and top can be fitted to flatter your body type—just avoid bodycon fits that cling to the skin."

      "content": "Avoid impractical or overly casual shoes. Stilettos and other heels can sink into the grass and even cause you to fall—wedges, block heels, or flats are a safer choice.

      "title": "Avoid dark colors in the spring or summer.",
      "content": "Avoid dark colors in the spring or summer. A garden party or garden wedding is the time for light, bright colors that match the spirit of the season. Take cues from florals and natural colors like dusty rose, peach, or mint green. If the event is taking place at the very end of summer or in the fall, darker colors work—but most people will probably stick to pastels and bright shades. [22] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid over-accessorizing.",
      "content": "Avoid over-accessorizing. A garden party theme invites accessorizing, but try to limit how many accessories you layer on so you don’t distract from your outfit. For example, if you’re wearing a dramatic hat, you probably don’t need a necklace as well—but a cute clutch will complete the outfit. [23] X Research source"

      "content": "Weddings may call for cocktail or formal wear, while casual parties are more relaxed. Garden party weddings often require dressier styles that fit a cocktail or formal dress code. Casual garden parties, on the other hand, allow for more relaxed styles. For a cocktail garden party dress code, wear a lightweight dress, jumpsuit, or dressy romper in a light or bright color. For a formal garden party dress code, choose a longer (midi- to maxi-length) dress or pantsuit. Look for sleek silhouettes and elegant fabrics like silk or chiffon. [24] X Research source For men’s cocktail garden party attire, choose a suit in a light color, such as a gray or pastel shade. If you interpret the vibe as less formal, pair tailored chinos with a blazer instead. [25] X Research source For a casual garden party, you could wear a flowy sundress with a smocked bodice to a casual garden party. You can also rock a shorter dress and swap wedges for sandals. Since it’s a non-wedding, feel free to wear a white dress, skirt, or pants. [26] X Research source For men’s casual garden party attire, ditch the jacket and wear a collared button-down or polo shirt. Wear well-fitted trousers or chinos in a light, neutral color like tan or gray. If sneakers match your outfit, go for it! [27] X Research source"
