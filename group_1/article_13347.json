Regardless of your goals — losing weight or just improving overall health — you won't see or feel any change in your body unless you exercise regularly. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get at least 2.5 hours of moderate aerobic exercise (low-impact aerobics) or 75 minutes of strenuous aerobic exercise (high-impact aerobics) per week. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source So one hour-long low-impact aerobics class per week isn't enough to meet professional standards for a healthy lifestyle. Set aside enough time throughout the week to reach your exercise goals. Another way to approach your routine is to elevate your heart rate for half an hour every day, taking a day off here and there. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you are trying to lose weight, you should increase the amount of time you dedicate to exercise, as these recommendations are a minimum guideline for healthy living."

      "content": "Pre-prepare a workout plan. Regardless of what type of aerobics you're doing, you want to make sure you're working out your entire body in a thoughtful manner. Of the five recommended elements of physical activity — aerobic exercise, strength training, core exercise, balance training, and flexibility — aerobics itself is simply one piece of the overall picture. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, with a little bit of pre-planning, you can incorporate steps and tools into your workout plan that help you achieve the recommended balance. Aerobic exercise: obviously, you want to keep your heart rate elevated throughout. This is why aerobics instructors ask you to march in place in between steps rather than stopping and taking a break. If you can speak easily, you're not working out hard enough. Strength training: Holding hand weights while performing your aerobics routine will help build muscles in the arm, while adding ankle weights will build leg muscle. Core strength: Incorporate moves that target the muscles in your abdomen — windmills, for example. The addition of hand weights while performing windmills will result in an even better core workout. Balance training: Many moves in aerobics require you to shift your weight from one foot to the other. Focus on the slow, deliberate transfer of weight and the balance of your body when doing these steps. Hamstring curls and ski jumps, for example, are a good opportunity to focus on balance. Flexibility: When performing steps that require stretching, commit all the way to the stretch. Windmills are a great example of an exercise where you may not be able to reach your feet at first due to poor flexibility. With some attention and practice, your flexibility will increase over time."

You'll also sweat a lot, so wear clothes that won't make you overheat — athletic shorts and a t-shirt will work just fine.

[5] X Research source Because the main point of aerobics is to raise your heart rate, choose only music that has a fast rhythm, so you'll have to work hard to keep up with the beat. Only choose songs that you like, though! The more you enjoy the music, the more you'll get into the steps you're doing, and the better your workout will be. Furthermore, if you enjoy the workout because of the music, you'll be less likely to get bored and stop working out after a couple of sessions."

Dynamic stretches are movements that go through a full range of motion as opposed to static stretches that are held for twenty or thirty seconds. There are many different types of dynamic stretches that you can do to warm up. Arm circles can help increase the range of motion in your shoulders. Hold your arms out straight to form a T. Make small circles with them for ten seconds before reversing the direction of the circle. Raise your arms in front of you before bringing them straight above your head. Try to bring them down as far back behind you as they will go. Move them back to starting position, and repeat. Lie down to do hip and knee bends. Bend your knee as you bring it up towards your chest. Slowly straighten it back out again. Repeat with the other leg."

      "title": "Understand reasons for choosing low-impact aerobics.",
      "content": "Understand reasons for choosing low-impact aerobics. Low-impact aerobics avoid movements that put a lot of pressure on joints, including movements like jumping, running in place, and the like. Low-impact aerobics is designed to minimize the risk of leg injuries, and is recommended for seniors, pregnant women, and overweight people. If you fall into one of those categories or have joint problems you should not attempt high-impact aerobics at all, unless you doctor approves it for you. If you're out of shape and want to ease your way into a workout regimen, low-impact aerobics is a great way to get your body used to a range of motions before you start pushing yourself. Low-impact aerobics are not only for people with \"issues\". Many workouts designed for minimizing impact are just as effective as high impact, without as much risk of injury. Not all \"low-impact aerobics\" are appropriate for everyone. It is not risk-free. A very overweight or out of shape person may still get injured if he or she is working out at too high a level. Using improper form or incorrect movement patterns may also cause injury. Cycle through a variety of different motions. It doesn't matter what order you go in, but stay in each motion for at least one or two minutes before moving on to the next motion. You should repeat the same motions repeatedly throughout your workout. If you are having difficulty with a more advanced move, return to more basic movements, such as stepping back and forth. Once your muscles stop burning, go back to the more difficult motions."

Your arms can hang naturally at your sides, or you can swing them in a sharp, but controlled motion to work out your arm muscles as well. Make sure to lift your knees enough to cause your legs to burn over a period of time. Simply shuffling in place will not make you sweat! Do this for at least two minutes to warm your body up in preparation for a wider range of more demanding movements. Get into the music! Clap your hands if you feel like it.

Move your left foot back out to your original position, then touch your right foot to the ground by your left foot. You can combine this with any number of arm movements, from controlled arm swings to shoulder rolls. A shoulder roll is simply when you pull one shoulder forward slightly, then roll it up and back.

Then repeat the process to the right side. Kick your leg out to the front on the last beat (when you would normally simply tap one foot to the other) to increase your activity rate. Begin the movement to the left with your arms down, and slowly lift them out to your sides and up over your head in a deliberate, wide motion, with your hands meeting over your head on the fourth beat.

You can push your arms forward as though pushing the air away from your chest on the leg curl, then pull your arms back into your chest when you return your foot to the ground. You can also do bow-and-arrows with your arms: extend one arm out directly to the side and tuck the other into your chest while keeping your elbow pointed out to the side. Alternate sides to match your feet movement. The motion should look a little bit like using a bow and arrow. To increase the muscle exertion, you can double or triple up on the curls you do on each side before moving on to the other leg. This way, you muscle doesn't get to relax immediately, and the workout is a little more difficult."

Balance your weight over your heels and sink down into your bent stance again. The jumping movement should be completely lateral, not forward and back. As you're completing the jumping motion with your legs, bring your hands up to the sides of your head as you extend into the jump, then bring them down to your sides, keeping elbows bent, as you land and go back into your bent position.
