      "content": "Scrape up excess fresh paint. Scrape the paint gently with a spoon, dull knife, or paint scraper. Wipe the spoon or knife with a rag in between scrapes if you’re dealing with a large spill. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove excess dried paint.",
      "content": "Remove excess dried paint. Brush the stain with a soft brush, such as a toothbrush. Use a vacuum attachment or dustpan to collect the pieces of dried paint. Loosen big chunks of paint carefully with needle-nose pliers. [2] X Research source Make sure you’re brushing at the top of the carpet fibers, horizontally, not driving paint downwards. If you’re having trouble breaking up a dry stain, use a putty knife and a citrus cleaner such as Goo Gone. [3] X Research source Spray a lubricant like WD-40 on dried paint and let it sit for 20-25 minutes. This helps soften the paint so you can remove it easier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blot any wet paint.",
      "content": "Blot any wet paint. Use gentle blotting motions with dry paper towels or an absorbent cloth. Tap around the edges of the stain first. Use a clean part of your cloth so you don’t accidentally transfer the paint back onto the carpet. Continue blotting until you’ve absorbed as much of the wet paint as you can. [4] X Research source Starting at the outside edges of the stain will help you to contain the spill. Make sure you are blotting and not rubbing in the paint. You don’t want to push it deeper into the fibers of the carpet."

      "title": "Make a soap solution.",
      "content": "Make a soap solution. Mix in one teaspoon of liquid soap for every one cup of warm water. Use a bucket for the solution, or fill a spray bottle. Choose a mild soap such as Dawn. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply the solution to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply the solution to the stain. Spray the solution onto the stain. Alternately, soak a sponge in the solution and dab it onto the stain. Work the solution into the carpeting with a brush. [6] X Research source Blot the area with an absorbent cloth. Lift the solution with a steam vacuum attachment. [7] X Research source Use a brush that is stiff, but not so harsh that it can damage the carpet fibers. Repeat this step until you’ve lifted as much of the stain as you can."

    {
      "title": "Blot the stain with a vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Blot the stain with a vinegar solution. Mix one part white vinegar for every ten parts water. Moisten a sponge in the solution and dab the carpet with the sponge. Pat an absorbent towel on the area. Then use a sponge with cold water only on the area. Blot dry with a cloth. [8] X Research source Test this on an inconspicuous area of carpeting first. Some carpet materials and dyes may react to acetic acid."

      "content": "Test an area of the carpet. Pour a little bit of acetone or nail polish remover on it. Spray spot cleaner, such as 409, next to that. Let it sit for six minutes. Clean the area with a steam vacuum attachment. See if the acetone or spot cleaner caused any damage to the carpeting. [14] X Research source Use a carpet sample or an extra piece of your carpeting, if you have it. Otherwise, find a concealed area of carpeting, such as inside of a closet. Some carpet fibers and dyes may be sensitive to chemical cleaners."

      "title": "Lift the paint with acetone.",
      "content": "Lift the paint with acetone. Dampen a cloth with acetone, or use an eyedropper to apply acetone directly onto the stain. [15] X Research source Blot the stain with the cloth. Move to a clean area of the cloth when it becomes soiled with paint. [16] X Research source This process may make the stain appear worse before it gets better. Don’t worry! The acetone is lifting the paint to the surface of the carpeting for removal. Wear gloves and a mask when using acetone. Ensure proper ventilation by opening windows and running a fan if needed. Don’t pour acetone directly from its container onto the carpeting, or it’ll leak down into the padding."
