This will make it easier to reheat portions without drying them out. [2] X Research source Bake your go-to meatloaf recipe in muffin tins and freeze for single servings. Each meatloaf \"muffin\" will be about one serving size. Meatloaf will get dry if you reheat it for too long after it's already cooked. While it's perfectly safe to freeze and reheat an entire meatloaf, it will be more juicy and tender if you reheat individual portions."
