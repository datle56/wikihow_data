      "title": "Kick your legs up directly into the air.",
      "content": "Kick your legs up directly into the air. The most important part is to kick upwards as hard as you can, not at an angle. Your body should fly into the air from the force of you kicking your legs."

    {
      "title": "Push hard with your hands as soon as you feel your momentum shifting upwards.",
      "content": "Push hard with your hands as soon as you feel your momentum shifting upwards. Picture that you're doing a backwards push-up, and push as hard as you can. Try to make this movement as explosive as possible. There's no turning back at this point — you either complete the kick-up or land flat on your back. Time to give it your all!"

    {
      "title": "Land in a squat.",
      "content": "Land in a squat. When you feel that sensation of weightlessness just before you're about to fall downwards, pull your legs downward as quickly as you can. Snap them down hard, and the momentum will cause the rest of your body to whirl upwards (land on your toes first). You'll suddenly, almost magically, be on your feet."

    {
      "title": "Lie face-down on the floor.",
      "content": "Lie face-down on the floor. Face forward but keep your neck comfortable; your chin should point downward without touching the floor. Keep your arms on the floor and bent in front of you, so that your hands are just beyond your face."

    {
      "title": "Bend your legs at the knees and curl them up.",
      "content": "Bend your legs at the knees and curl them up. Your heels should be touching the back of your thighs."

      "title": "Put your hands flat on the ground, next to your ears.",
      "content": "Put your hands flat on the ground, next to your ears. For a face-down kip-up, you can use flat palms or fists — whichever works best for you."

      "title": "Kick back hard with your legs, while pushing up with your hands.",
      "content": "Kick back hard with your legs, while pushing up with your hands. Move your arms like you're doing a pushup, while flipping your legs back hard. Between the momentum in your legs and the slight push upwards from your hands, you should be able to flip into a squatting position."
