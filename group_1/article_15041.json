      "title": "Leave the gourds on the vines where they grow.",
      "content": "Leave the gourds on the vines where they grow. Mature gourds can handle frost and can even withstand a few cycles of freezing and thawing. As the plant turns brown and dies, the gourds dry and fall off. If the gourds have matured by the end of the growing season but have not had time to dry, you can leave them on the vine over winter. When the snow melts and exposes them in the spring, they will continue drying where they left off in the fall. However, there is a risk that they will rot if you leave them over winter."

      "title": "Pick up a gourd and shake it.",
      "content": "Pick up a gourd and shake it. Dried gourds are lightweight and hollow. Listen for the sound of seeds rattling around inside. Sometimes, however, the seeds stick to the inside of the gourd before drying and do not rattle. The seeds can be used for other uses as stock."

    {
      "title": "Gather the gourds from the field when they are fully dry.",
      "content": "Gather the gourds from the field when they are fully dry. If they are still attached to the plant, you can cut the vine flush with the gourd or leave a piece of stem intact--leaving the gourd is purely ornamental when you dry the gourd on the vine."

      "title": "Compost any gourds that started to rot before fully drying.",
      "content": "Compost any gourds that started to rot before fully drying. No matter how you choose to dry gourds, a small percentage of them will always rot--be prepared for this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the mature gourds off of the vines when the leaves and stem begin turning brown.",
      "content": "Cut the mature gourds off of the vines when the leaves and stem begin turning brown. Use sharp pruners to make a nice, even cut. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of stem attached to each gourd. Leaving this bit of stem is important because it helps with the evaporation of water. The skin of the gourd is hard and non-porous, so the porous stem is necessary to let moisture escape from the gourd. If you have gourds that are considered immature (it is fleshy and bright green) and are concerned that the first frost will kill them, cut them from the vine and use them as temporary decorations. You generally will not be able to dry these gourds. You can also leave them on the vine--occasionally they will be hardened by the frost rather than killed."

      "title": "Wash the gourds with warm soapy water.",
      "content": "Wash the gourds with warm soapy water. Doing this removes bacteria and helps prevent rotting. [1] X Research source You can also soak them for 20 minutes in a solution of one part household bleach and nine parts warm water."

      "title": "Choose a spot outdoors where the gourds can sit and dry.",
      "content": "Choose a spot outdoors where the gourds can sit and dry. The gourds can dry in a cold location, but keep in mind that repetitive freezing and thawing can often damage the seeds inside the gourds. In turn, damage to the seeds will make it so that the seeds cannot be replanted. You can also dry gourds in a garage, barn or inside of the house, but they will get the best air circulation if you allow them to dry outside. It may take several months for the gourds to dry fully. Keep in mind that large quantities of drying gourds give off an unpleasant odor. If you dry them inside your home, it will take some time to get rid of the smell."

Run a string through the holes and hang the gourds upside down. Be aware that puncturing the gourds may lead to mold growth inside of the gourds. [5] X Research source"

In general, you will want to scrape it off. You can also use steel wool or sandpaper to remove the outer layer of skin. However, using either of these tools will result in scratch marks. Only use sandpaper or steel wool if you plan on painting the gourd."
