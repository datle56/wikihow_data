Since prayer is typically considered the best way to communicate with God, think of this as your chance to ask for exactly what it is you want. Even if you base your prayer on an existing prayer, adjust the wording so it's specific to you. Not only will that help you understand your own need more clearly, but it will help you be better attuned to the answer to your prayer. [5] X Research source For instance, if you're asking dua , you might follow the traditional structure by first invoking Allah's name, then confessing your shortcomings and repenting for your sins, and finally asking Allah for help. If you do find a pre-written prayer, mantra, or dua that you feel suits your needs, it's okay to use it as-is, as long as you truly feel a connection to every word. If there's anything that doesn't fit your situation, it's ok to adjust the language."

For instance, you might pray something like, \"God, only you know how heartbroken I've been since my sister went missing. I cry every night, and I feel like I'll never be the same until she's home safely.\" If you feel a sense of wrongdoing or guilt—like you argued with a loved one before they passed away or you feel responsible for the end of your relationship—include that in the prayer as well, and ask for forgiveness."

[13] X Research source Spending time in nature—like going for a hike, visiting a nature center, or having a picnic—is a great way to distract yourself, and it can also help you feel connected to a higher power. Exercise is always a good stress reliever, and caring for your body is a good way to honor the god of your faith. You may also benefit from a meditation or yoga practice.

Here are a few tips for healing from grief: [14] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Allow yourself to experience your emotions as they come up, without judging yourself. If you're sad, be sad. If you're angry, be angry. If you try to bury your feelings, it will only be harder to heal in the long term. Take as much time as you need. Regardless of the nature of your loss, there's no set timetable for healing. Even when you've mostly moved on, you may still occasionally experience feelings of sadness. Make it a priority to care for yourself by eating nutritious meals, making time for physical activity, spending time with people who love you, and getting involved in activities you enjoy."

It just means the answer is different from what you'd hoped because this person isn't meant to be a part of your journey any more. Verse 2:216 in the Qu'ran beautifully describes why you may not get the exact answer you seek from prayer: \"Perhaps you hate something and it's good for you, and perhaps you love something and it's bad for you. Allah knows, while you don't know.\" [15] X Research source The answer may also sometimes be, \"Not yet.\" However, don't put your life on hold waiting for the other person. Get back out there and live your best life—if they're meant to return to you in time, they will."

Embrace new relationships as well—you may find that the universe has a new love in store for you, as long as you're open to it."
