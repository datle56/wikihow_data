      "content": "Confirm that the leak is at either the handle or spout. If your two-handled cartridge-style faucet is dripping from the spout, it’s likely due to faulty rubber O-rings. If the leak is coming from the base of one or both handles, one or both of the internal cartridges is likely to blame. [1] X Research source Because you have to pull out the cartridge to fix the leak in any case, you may opt to just replace the entire internal setup regardless of the type of leak.

If the leak stops, you know the hot water is the culprit. If it’s still leaking, open the hot and close the cold to confirm that you don’t have both hot and cold water leaks.

Close both the hot and cold supply lines under the sink cabinet, then open both the hot and cold taps until all the water in the lines has drained out.

If the handles have decorative caps (often labeled with “H” and “C”) on top, pry off the relevant cap with the flat edge of a screwdriver. Unscrew the set-screw beneath the cap and lift off the handle. [6] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. If the handle doesn’t have a decorative cap, look for a small notch that accepts a thin Allen wrench (hex wrench). Loosen the small screw in the notch until you can lift off the handle. [7] X Research source If you need an Allen wrench (hex wrench), Delta faucets usually require the 1 ⁄ 8 in (3.2 mm) diameter size."

Grip the octagonal collar firmly and rotate it counterclockwise with a series of short turns until it comes loose and can be removed. [8] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. If the collar is already loose, there’s a small chance that you may be able to quickly fix the leak right here and now. Use your wrench or pliers to tighten the collar fully (stopping when you feel moderate resistance). Then put the handle back on, turn on the water, and check to see if the leak is fixed. If so, you’re all done! [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide if you’ll replace the O-rings or the whole cartridge. If the cartridge appears to be in good condition, you might consider replacing the cartridge’s black rubber O-rings—especially if your leak is a dripping spout. Cartridges often have two O-rings, one at the bottom and one closer to the top, and they can be removed with needle-nose pliers. Alternatively—and perhaps preferably—just replace the entire cartridge at this point since you’ve already removed it. [12] X Research source If an O-ring is brittle, frayed, torn, misshapen, or discolored, always replace it. Similarly, replace the cartridge if it shows any signs of excessive wear or damage, such as cracks or heavy discoloration. If the leak is coming from the base of the faucet handle, definitely replace the entire cartridge instead of just the O-rings."

      "content": "Take the old parts to a hardware store to get replacements. Faucet cartridges have subtle differences, even among Delta models, so use the old parts to get exact matches. Delta replacement parts are widely available at home improvement retailers, so you shouldn’t have trouble finding them at your local store. [13] X Research source If you have the model name and/or number for your Delta faucet, write it down and bring it along as well. If you’re just buying new O-rings instead of a complete cartridge, make sure the replacements are an exact size and shape match. Alternatively, buy an O-ring “variety pack” for around $10-$15 USD. Delta replacement cartridges typically cost around $15-$30 USD. You may be able to find cheaper non-Delta-approved cartridges for $10-$15, but these may void Delta’s warranty for your faucet."

Then, line up the cartridge in the same orientation as before—if you took photos during the removal, use them as a guide. Press down firmly to seat the cartridge in the opening. [14] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. Here’s a frustrating fact about faucet cartridges: they’ll often fit into place even when oriented incorrectly, which will lead to another leak or a lack of water flow."

Since you’re dealing with a one-handled faucet with an internal ball bearing, the ball bearing itself is the likely culprit if the leak is coming from under the handle. If, however, you’re dealing with a drip from the spout, the problem may be the round rubber gaskets inside the handle that are known as “seats.” [18] X Research source Since you need to remove the ball bearing to fix either type of leak, consider replacing the entire ball bearing mechanism (including gaskets, washers, etc.) no matter which leak you’re dealing with.

[26] X Research source Delta-branded ball bearing replacement kits cost around $25-$35 USD, while Delta-compatible (but possibly not warranty-approved) kits typically cost around $15-$25 USD.
