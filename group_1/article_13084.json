      "content": "Layout Many Discord intro templates are actually pretty similar when it comes to layout! Consider the following layout details: Title: Some intros have a title, such as \"introduction\" or \"[your name]'s intro,\" but this isn't required. Symbols: Many Discord intros use Unicode or ASCII symbols to create borders, dividers, or cute emojis. Common symbols used are stars, bullet points, dots, hyphens, lines, and plus signs. Japanese kanji, hiragana, and katakana are also common, especially in servers about anime, gaming, or Japanese/kawaii culture. Emojis: A lot of Discord users include emojis in their intros. You can use the standard emojis available on your phone or computer's emoji keyboard, or you can use custom emojis from a Discord server. Common emojis include flowers (🌸🥀🌻), hearts (💗🖤🤍), and stars (⭐🌟✨). Fancy fonts: While Discord doesn't let you actually change the font of your text, you can fake it with Unicode characters. Jump to the links section of this article to see where you can find these fancy font characters."
