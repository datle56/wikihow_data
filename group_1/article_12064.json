      "title": "Acknowledge obvious, illegal abuse.",
      "content": "Acknowledge obvious, illegal abuse. Some types of abuse are explicitly prohibited under the law, including discrimination and sexual harassment. Approximately 70% of workplace sexual harassment incidents go unreported. The first step to protecting yourself from these types of abuse is recognizing and acknowledging abuse when it occurs. You may initially rationalize these behaviors or chalk them up to your workplace's culture, but excusing abuse only perpetuates it. Sexual harassment can include inappropriate comments, requests for sexual favors, pressuring and controlling behavior, and unwanted physical contact. Discrimination includes unfair treatment based on the employee's sex, age, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other legally-protected characteristic."

      "content": "Recognize abusive behavior patterns. There are other types of abuse that are not necessarily illegal, but are nonetheless harmful and disruptive. Some bosses are verbally abusive (to you directly, or behind your back), while others use their position to manipulate situations and cause trouble for employees. A boss who snaps once in a while might just be having a bad day, but one who regularly belittles you, insults you, or makes your job difficult is probably displaying abusive behavior. If you recognize a pattern of abuse, take action."

Some people yell because they are just mean, but is it possible that your boss is stressed at work or at home? Your boss may come off as extremely intense because he or she is under a lot of pressure to succeed. If you can empathize with your boss's situation, it may drain some of the tension out of the situation.

[10] X Expert Source Jessica Notini, JD Negotiation & Mediation Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020. Schedule a meeting about improving your workplace relationship. Even if your boss does not change his or her behavior, standing up for yourself can improve your mental health and keep you from feeling like a victim. In addition, your boss might decide that you're not such an easy target and leave you alone. [11] X Research source Prepare for your meeting by reviewing and bringing notes about past abusive incidents. Refer to specific incidents at your meeting instead of making general complaints. For example, telling your boss \"you always insult me at work\" is ineffective, because it is overly general and easy to deny. Instead, try, \"You often insult me at work, including twice during Monday's staff meeting and yesterday in the break room. I am open to constructive criticism of my work, but I want you to stop making jokes at my expense.\" You can also stand up for yourself in the moment when your boss engages in abusive behavior. Saying something as simple as, \"I will not tolerate that kind of language,\" and walking away can be an effective response to verbal abuse."

When your boss makes a point, repeat and rephrase that point in your response. This demonstrates that you are truly listening and understanding what your boss is saying. If your boss was not clear, ask him or her to clarify. [13] X Expert Source Meredith Walters, MBA Certified Career Coach Expert Interview. 22 November 2019. You can use this principle when you initiate your discussion by repeating the underlying message behind your boss's behavior. This shows that you understand and take responsibility for his or her complaint, which may make your boss more receptive to your criticism of his or her delivery. For example, \"I understand why you were upset yesterday. The report I gave you did not address one of the issues you asked for, and I told you I would revise it by the end of the day. However, I don't think it was necessary for you to curse and raise your voice to make your point.\""

To improve your work relationship going forward, you and your boss will need to find some common ground. Since you work together, you have certain common goals and experiences in common. Perhaps you share a common stressor, such as a looming project or deadline. You might try to work some of these common experiences into your discussion. For example, \"You must be getting a lot of pressure about your presentation at the upcoming shareholder's meeting. The rest of the team is anxious about it too, and we'll all be glad when it's over, so let me know if I can help you prepare this week.\""

If talking to your boss didn't work, or if you are afraid that a confrontation will make your situation worse, you may need to talk to someone else or another department within your workplace.

[17] X Research source You can also make a complaint with your human resources department. The department may investigate and/or attempt to mediate the situation. At minimum, initiating a complaint with HR creates official documentation of your boss's abuse.

That said, you may be able to reclaim a sense of control at work and show your boss that you have a backbone.

You can find a better fit somewhere else. If you can't find a new job before quitting, find out if your state law permits workers who quit their jobs to collect unemployment benefits. [29] X Research source You can collect unemployment benefits if you quit for good cause, but each state defines \"good cause\" differently.

This can occur when your employer creates working conditions (or allows conditions to continue) that are so terrible that you feel that you have no choice but to quit. To prove constructive discharge, you must show that you suffered mistreatment so intolerable that any reasonable employee would choose to quit, and that you tried to stop the mistreatment by complaining to your boss or HR department. Talk to an attorney about filing a lawsuit against your employer for wrongful termination and constructive discharge. If you win a constructive discharge suit, you may be entitled to back pay, front pay from the time of the case to the time you are rehired or find another job, and damages."

However, if you have suffered sexual harassment, discrimination, or sufficient threats, physical contact, or intimidation to make you feel endangered, you may have a case. You can get referrals from friends and family, or from attorneys who may not practice family law but know a trusted colleague who does. You can also use referral services through your state and local bar associations, or just search online."
