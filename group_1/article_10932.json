      "content": "Choose a matching or contrasting color yarn to use for a border. You can add a border onto a knit or crocheted item that is the same color as the item or that is a different color. Consider how much you want the border to stand out and what color would work best with the item. [1] X Research source For example, if you will be adding a border onto a baby blue blanket, then you may choose a baby blue yarn in the same shade, or opt for something that will contrast with the blanket, such as pale yellow, mint green, or white."

      "content": "Pick yarn that is the same weight as the item. For best results, make sure that the yarn is the same weight as the yarn that was used to knit or crochet the item. You can find the yarn weight listed on the package of the yarn, or just compare a strand of the yarn in your item with a strand in the yarn you'd like to use and see if they are roughly the same diameter. [2] X Research source For example, if the item is made from medium-weight yarn, then use a medium-weight yarn for the border."

      "content": "Select a crochet hook that will work with the type of yarn you are using. Check your yarn’s label for a crochet hook size recommendation, or look it up online if you are unsure. Using the correct size hook for the yarn you have selected will help to ensure that you get the best results. [3] X Research source For example, if you are using a medium-weight yarn to create a scalloped border, then the recommended size may be a US size I-9 (5.5 mm)."

      "content": "Slipstitch into the edge of the item. Identify where you want to work the first stitch on the border of your item. Then, make a slipknot and slide it onto your hook. Insert the end of the hook into the stitch where you want the border to begin. Then, loop the yarn over the end of the hook and pull it through both loops to anchor the yarn to your item. [4] X Research source If you plan to go all the way around the item, then you can start anywhere along the border. If you only plan to add a border to part of the item, decide where you want the border to begin and end."

Then, work a slipstitch into the space between your first and last stitches if you are doing a full border, or after the last stitch if you are doing a partial border. [11] X Research source If you are doing a full border, do your best to position the last scallop and slipstitch so that the ends will be as evenly spaced as the rest of the item. However, don’t worry if you are 1 or 2 stitches off. It will not be noticeable."
