You won't see the following option if your iPhone was sold as a prepaid plan since these companies often leave this setting turned off until several minimum data payments have been made to keep your data service active. iPhone's sold as prepaid plans through third-party offerings often leave LTE service off until they can be assured you can keep data service on the phone with applicable money for a set period. Tap Cellular in your Settings, then tap the toggle switch next to Cellular Data. If you see this switch turn green (or was green already), look just below this for a second check for the Personal Hotspot option."
