Make sure the top is completely sealed to prevent bacteria and water from getting in. [1] X Research source This method of thawing works for either ground beef or cuts of beef such as steak."

      "content": "Place the bag with the beef in a large bowl and cover it with cold water. Make sure the bowl is big enough that you can completely submerge the bag with the beef. Fill it almost to the top with cold water and set it in the sink or on a counter. [2] X Research source Never use hot water to thaw beef because this will greatly increase the chances of dangerous bacteria developing on the meat."

      "content": "Leave the beef for at least 15 minutes to an hour. It will take about 1 hour for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of beef to thaw. Thin cuts of beef, like steak, will thaw in about 15-30 minutes.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source It’s ok to cook the beef even if it has not thawed completely. The frozen parts will just take a bit longer to cook."

      "content": "Place the frozen beef in the fridge in its package or a covered dish. Leave the beef in its store packaging or place it in a dish with a lid or covered with plastic wrap. This will ensure that no moisture or meat juices end up leaking into your fridge. [6] X Research source This method works for both ground beef and any cuts of beef. Never thaw frozen beef on the counter because bacteria can develop on the outer surfaces of the meat as they warm up first."

      "content": "Cook the beef within 1-2 days after it thaws. The beef will stay good up to 2 days after it thaws, as long as you leave it in the fridge. Refreeze any parts you will not be able to cook within 2 days to save the beef for later. [8] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Make sure the dish has sides so that juices and moisture won’t spill all over your microwave. [9] X Research source You can thaw either ground beef or cuts of beef in the microwave.
