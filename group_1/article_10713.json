      "title": "Decide on a map theme.",
      "content": "Decide on a map theme. There is a wide range of different map types; some of the more popular map types include the following: Survival - These maps involve the player trying to survive within the parameters of the map. Players can break blocks, build items, and generally do whatever it takes to survive against waves of enemies. Story - Players are given instructions and a set of objectives to complete. Parkour - Players must reach whatever the goal is, usually by going through a series of skill-based challenges (e.g., a series of precise jumps)."

      "title": "Determine your map's building logistics.",
      "content": "Determine your map's building logistics. This will vary from map to map, but some things you need to consider beforehand include the following: Building material - Rarely will your map be made from the same material across the board, but you should figure out what your buildings, terrain, and other items will be made of. Map size - An exact number (e.g., 100 x 100) will help you plan the size of structures, obstacles, terrain pieces, and more. Route - Knowing how your map's players will get from point A to point B will help focus the map's composition. Story - Optional, but recommended for adventure maps. If you can put together a storyboard before you actually create the map, you'll have a much better idea of what your map's flow should look like."

Some possible ideas include the following: Change the biome. If your selected area is in a superflat world or you just want to change one area into a different biome (e.g., jungle to desert), you can do so with your editor. Add foliage. Trees and other plants can lend a natural feeling to your adventure map. Remove automatically generated structures. Since you'll be adding your own structures, you may want to remove villages, dungeons, and so on."

There are a few ways to add directions to your map: Signs - This is the easiest and most common way to leave a message for a player. Books - If you want to go for a slightly more subtle instructional method, leave your messages as contextual clues in a book."
