      "content": "If the car is a rental, confirm that the rental company allows decorations. If they give you the green light, chat about what you can and can’t include. In many cases, rental car companies encourage newlyweds to deck out their car, but it’s still a good policy to get permission. [1] X Research source Some companies may also require that you purchase a decoration package from them instead of changing up the look of a car yourself. Just ask to see if that’s the case! If the wedding car isn't a rental, get the make and model so you know the vehicle's size, how many doors there are, and how much window space is available."

      "content": "Using the wedding color scheme for the ribbon is great solution. You can also consider the wedding theme. For example, if the wedding is taking place in a forest, you might use complementary ribbon colors like green, maroon, and brown. You can also use the color palette and theme to help you choose other decorations. [2] X Research source For example, if the wedding is shabby chic, you can make a rustic “Just Married” banner for the windshield out of burlap or card stock and twine. If the wedding theme is rock ‘n’ roll, paint the banner on old 45 rpm vinyl records. You can also choose colors and decor that highlight the car. For instance, if the wedding car is a vintage limo, traditional white ribbons would really sell the classy, old-fashioned look."

      "content": "Make sure you have waterproof supplies if it will rain. If you’re expecting wet weather on the day of the nuptials, choose decorations that can handle these damp conditions. To make sure none of the car's accessories get damp or soggy, laminate paper banners or and use accents with water-resistant material. [3] X Research source Also think about the ground your clients will be driving on. If it’s going to be wet and muddy, think about using dark-colored ribbons that will hide the dirt."

      "content": "Create a sleek, modern look using just a couple ribbons. Cut out 2 pieces of thick fabric ribbon that measure roughly from the hood of the car to the back of the roof. Secure the ends of both ribbons to the latch on the middle of the hood. [4] X Research source You can also use some mounting putty to secure the ribbon in place. Avoid using tape to secure ribbon to the car since this could damage the paint."

      "content": "Add a pop of color that's front and center. After attaching 1 end to the hood latch, pull each ribbon back in a diagonal to form a V shape up toward the rearview mirrors. Secure the other ends of the ribbon by rolling them around the front windows on either side of the car or tying them around the rearview mirrors. [5] X Research source This special technique makes the car look gift-wrapped and can definitely make your newlyweds look forward to riding off toward a bright future. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Go for a traditional look by decking out the back of the car.",
      "content": "Go for a traditional look by decking out the back of the car. Cut several lengths of ribbon that are long enough to trail 2–3 feet (61–91 cm) behind the car when they’re hung from the rear bumper. The exact number of ribbons you’ll need depends on the width of the car and how long you’d like the car’s trail of ribbons to be. [7] X Research source For a small ribbon trail, 20-25 lengths of ribbon should work. For a dense trail, it might be closer to 50. With some cars, you may be able to slip the ribbons through the bumper itself. For others, you may have to bundle the ends of the ribbons and close them in the trunk so they’ll stay in place. Make sure you don't cover up the license plate with all the ribbons! [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Enchant everyone with this shimmery fabric. For a simple solution, wrap the hood in colorful tulle and tie the ends around the rear view mirrors or the car door handles. Secure one end of the tulle at the hood latch, drape it loosely over the hood, and tie the other end around one of the rearview mirrors, the antenna, or the door handles. Use mounting putty to secure the loose tulle to the car's body. Alternatively, drape the tulle along the sides of the car or use the trunk to secure sections of tulle to the rear of the car. Just don't block the doors with all of the tulle!"

      "content": "Give an antenna a celebratory look with fun and colorful touches. For a really festive look that pops, use ribbons in a few different colors, sizes, and fabrics. Knot the ribbons and streamers around the top of the antenna or use tape to attach them to it. Just make sure the ribbons are only a few feet long since longer ones may snag on objects or create obstacles for other drivers on the road. [9] X Research source You can use as many ribbons you want—just remember to keep them short so that you don't block the view of any drivers behind you! Try to avoid using thick bunches of ribbons or really wide ribbons as car antennas aren't super sturdy. 5-10 lightweight ribbons should be enough!"

      "content": "Make the wedding vehicle look like a nice, big present. Make a large ribbon bow to put on the hood of the car or to stick it onto the back near the latch of the trunk. No matter the wedding theme or aesthetic, bows are a classic decoration that are sure to be a crowd favorite! [10] X Research source If you pull V-shaped ribbons across the hood of your car, put the bow at the front of your hood where the 2 ribbons meet. This will cover up any messy ends at the bottom of the V. For the best look, use very thick ribbon that's 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) wide. You can also make smaller, matching bows to stick on the back of each of the rearview mirrors. Go with ribbon that's about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide."

      "content": "Use some cheap, cute add-ons to create fun sounds. Traditionally, tin cans were used, but these can actually create sparks when they hit the asphalt at high speeds. In some areas, using tin cans for this is even illegal! A safer, more modern take on this is to tie plastic soda bottles to the ends of the ribbons. [11] X Research source A strong double-knot should secure the plastic bottle to the ribbon, but you can also use hot glue. You could also use small, heart-shaped Mylar balloons instead of plastic bottles for a quieter option!"

Tie them around the rearview mirrors and secure the flower part to the back of each mirror with mounting putty. Then, let the streaming ends hang down so they'll flutter in the wind when the couple drives away. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Go the extra mile with even more festive accessories. Hang a banner from the rear bumper or windshield that says “Just Married” or another message that’s really meaningful to the couple. Use magnetic tape to attach the banner to the car—this type of adhesive shouldn't cause any damage. For another fun touch, write a message on the rear windshield with window-writing markers. [13] X Research source To show off your message, you can also hang the banner on the inside of the back windshield or use decals that stick to the rear window glass. Especially since it’s more creative and less common, make sure you check with the car rental company before you write in the windows."
