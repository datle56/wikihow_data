      "content": "Yes, but check with your waste management company to see if they'll take it. Despite popular belief, Styrofoam is recyclable. It’s just so lightweight and comes in such big, awkward pieces that most municipal recycling programs won’t pick it up. Find your local trash pickup policy online to determine if they’ll take your Styrofoam. [1] X Research source If they won’t pick it up but they will accept Styrofoam at their recycling plants, take it there yourself."

      "title": "Recycle clean, plain white Styrofoam with the recycling symbol.",
      "content": "Recycle clean, plain white Styrofoam with the recycling symbol. If your foam is dyed, it probably won’t be accepted. Typically, plain white Styrofoam is marked with a triangle, and the number 6 is stamped inside. Any #6 plastic is a polystyrene, which means it is recyclable. [2] X Research source Empty, clean, and remove any tape, labels, or plastic film from your styrofoam. [3] X Research source This foam can be turned into plastic, sent overseas to make another item like a picture frame, then shipped back for sale in the U.S. One potential variable is packing peanuts. Some recycling centers won’t take them because they tend to fly around in the plant and make a mess. Consider reaching out to a local shipping company to see if they want them! Just FYI, you can’t recycle food containers or used cups and plates. Foam used for medical purposes is also unrecyclable."

      "content": "Take Styrofoam to a drop-off site or mail it in if your city won't recycle it. Look for a drop-off site or mail-in location on EPS-IA’s website . Remove any debris, then break the Styrofoam into small pieces. Place the foam in a shipping box if you are mailing it in, and expect to cover the shipping cost yourself (but it should be inexpensive) [4] X Research source If you have a truck's worth of recyclable Styrofoam, there might be a fee due to the amount."

      "title": "Break the Styrofoam into smaller pieces if necessary.",
      "content": "Break the Styrofoam into smaller pieces if necessary. If you have large foam blocks or sheets, cut them into smaller cubes with a utility knife or scissors. If you don’t want any random Styrofoam particles potentially floating around in your home, put the Styrofoam in a large bin or the tub and stomp on it with a thick boot. Collect the pieces by hand and bag them up. Pro-tip: if you use an electric carving knife or a hot knife you can cut through the Styrofoam like butter."

      "content": "Throw the Styrofoam into your garbage bin or dumpster. This is what most local agencies not only suggest, but require. [5] X Research source Since recycling Styrofoam can be costly, for most, it’s not worthwhile for a lot of recycling programs to pour resources into processing it. [6] X Research source Follow guidelines and toss your foam with your everyday trash."

      "content": "Compost the Styrofoam with live mealworms. Mealworms will happily munch down Styrofoam and leave compost behind. If you have a pet that can use some live mealworms or you want to build your own worm farm , purchase some mealworms and set them in a plastic or wood container. Toss your Styrofoam inside and watch the mealworms munch it down over time. [7] X Research source If you’re building a worm farm, don’t exclusively feed the mealworms plastic. They can survive on it, but it’s not nutritious. Periodically feed them any food scraps or decaying plant material. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Dissolve the Styrofoam in pure acetone.",
      "content": "Dissolve the Styrofoam in pure acetone. Grab some 100% pure acetone and fill a small container with it. Take your Styrofoam and set it in the container. The acetone will dissolve the plastic slowly. Just make sure you crack a window—the odor of the melting plastic isn’t dangerous or anything, but it can be relatively stinky. You must use pure acetone. The diluted nail polish remover will not work. Just be careful around any open flames—pure acetone is highly flammable. This is an easy option if you don’t have a ton of Styrofoam to get rid of. You may need an unreasonable amount of acetone for larger amounts of Styrofoam. Dispose of the acetone by pouring it into a small metal or glass container. Don’t use plastic, since the acetone will degrade it."

      "content": "Create sets, props, or crafts with the Styrofoam. Styrofoam makes a great material for costumes or decorations because it's lightweight. Create templates on the Styrofoam for desired shapes, then cut them out. Use paint or markers to decorate low-cost but sturdy-looking props and stage backgrounds. Make a magic wand by cutting out a star shape. Poke a hole in the bottom with a pencil. Insert craft glue into the hole, then slide in a wooden dowel for the handle. Use markers or paint to turn a Styrofoam plate into a shining sun. Glue white packing peanuts into the shape of a little igloo. [10] X Research source"

When it’s time to glue something, set your Styrofoam out on top of some newspaper and pour a few drops of acetone-based nail polish remover on it. Then, use a cotton swab or wood stirring stick to scoop the softened Styrofoam up. Rub the material on whatever you want to glue and wait for it to cure! [13] X Research source"
