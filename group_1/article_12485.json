If this doesn’t work, give it to her in your hand like a treat. You can hide or press the pills into softer treats, like bananas and strawberries.You can also sprinkle crushed pills onto a treat.

      "content": "Decide if your bunny needs restraining. If your rabbit is aggressive, resistant to taking her medication, or won't eat the medicine in the treats, you should restrain her. When you restrain your rabbit, you will be swaddling her in a towel or large cloth. [7] X Research source You can also find a restraining jacket in a pet shop to place your bunny in. Properly restraining your bunny is one of the most important parts of giving medication to a rabbit. An improperly restrained rabbit can kick out with its back legs and hurt itself to the point of breaking its back. If you are uncomfortable with restraining your rabbit, have a veterinarian demonstrate how to do so."

Make sure to spread it flat. [8] X Research source You can use a towel, blanket, t-shirt, or other kind of cloth. The working surface can be the floor or a table top.

Your rabbit should be placed so ⅓ of the length of the towel is on one side of the rabbit, and ⅔ of the length of the towel is on the other side. The two ends should be long enough to wrap over the rabbit. Handle your bunny so that you protect her hind legs. Rabbits can easily hop or jump, which can cause spinal injury. [11] X Research source When you set your rabbit down, you need to calmly hold her in place. Put one hand on the scruff of her neck and the other hand on her hip, or place both hands on her shoulders. This not only helps prevent her from escaping, but it can also help to calm her. [12] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Only the rabbit’s head should be exposed.

Start by recruiting a person to help you. Have the helper hold the rabbit on the table by taking a firm grip on its scruff, which is the skin behind the ears. He should then wrap his free arm around the rabbit’s body to cradle it. This free arm should support the hind legs.

      "content": "Hold the rabbit’s head. It's common for a bunny to resist taking medicine even when it's hidden in treats. If this is the case, you can squirt liquid medication into the bunny's mouth with a syringe. Avoid trying to hold the rabbit's head up, as this is not a natural position and could severely hurt your rabbit or even break its neck. [16] X Research source [17] X Research source Start by holding your bunny, making sure the back legs are secure so the bunny doesn't injure herself. Carefully place your non-dominant hand over the bunny’s head to hold it still. Don’t put too much pressure on the head.

      "content": "Squirt liquid medication into the mouth. With liquid medication, the nozzle end of the syringe or dropper can be gently worked in between the corner of the mouth. Place the nozzle in at an angle right behind the front teeth. This helps keep the medication from going into the lungs. [19] X Research source Then slowly squirt the medicine into the mouth. Make sure to squirt the medicine in the mouth slowly. If you go too fast, the liquid may go into the lungs, which can cause asphyxiation. Don’t squirt the whole syringe into her mouth at once. Don’t shove the syringe or dropper too far into the bunny’s mouth. You could choke her. Just put it in enough so that the medicine gets in the mouth so she can swallow."
