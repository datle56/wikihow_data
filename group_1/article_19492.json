Using a disinfected tool to place a small piece of cotton or unflavored dental floss between your toenail and the skin should keep the ingrown toenail from coming back. [4] X Research source If you are using a cotton round or cotton ball, remove a small piece of cotton with the tweezers. If you are using unflavored dental floss, cut a 6 inches (15 cm) piece of dental floss. Lift the corner of the ingrown toenail with the disinfected tweezers and gently work the cotton or dental floss under the nail. If desired, you may apply an antiseptic ointment, such as Neosporin , to the cotton or floss before sliding it under the nail. Do not try to put the cotton or dental floss under the nail if the nail bed looks swollen or red. Remove the cotton or dental floss daily, cleanse the area, and replace with new cotton or dental floss to reduce the risk of infection."

      "content": "Ask your healthcare provider about taping. If your nails are still cutting into the skin, then you may also consider trying taping. Taping is when you secure a band-aid to the bottom of your toe and pull the skin away from the location where the nail is cutting into the nailbed. The trick is to move the skin away from the offending nail with the help of a band-aid. This can decrease pressure in the area, and if done properly, promote drainage and drying. However, you may want to ask your healthcare provider to show you the proper way to do this because it can be difficult to master.

Ordinary nail clippers are small enough that they tend to leave sharp edges near the corner of the toenail. Optimally, try to cut your toenails once every 2-3 weeks. Unless your toenails grow extremely fast, cutting your toenails often won't give them a good chance to become ingrown ."
