      "content": "Preheat the oven to 425 °F (218 °C) and place the pie on a foil-lined baking sheet. The foil will make cleanup easier if the filling bubbles over the sides. Never place a cold Pyrex or a glass pan directly into a hot oven. It can shatter. [1] X Research source If you froze your pie in a glass dish, thaw the pie first to reduce the chance of shattering the dish. However, it’s best to play it safe and use a disposable metal pie pan when baking a frozen pie. Some people suggest thawing the pie for about 25 minutes before you place it in the oven because it helps the pastry flour cook better."

      "content": "Brush the top crust of the pie with melted butter if desired. Alternatively, you could brush the top crust of the pie with cream or egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water). Then, sprinkle it with sugar to add texture and color to the pie crust. [2] X Research source You may have less prep work to do before baking a packaged frozen pie . We'll offer instructions on how to do that in the next section."

      "title": "Place the pie on the bottom rack of the oven.",
      "content": "Place the pie on the bottom rack of the oven. Baking frozen pies can be tricky because the top can get brown before the bottom cooks. Oven placement is essential for a frozen pie. Bake your pie on the lowest rack, which places the bottom of the pie closest to the heating element. You can move the pie lower and higher as it cooks as needed. One trick that may help if you have raw bottom crust is to preheat the baking sheet before you place the pie in the oven. Put the empty baking sheet into the oven as you preheat it. A preheated pizza stone will also work. Another tip is to place strips of foil around the edge of the pie. Keep the foil in place until the middle of the pie begins to brown, so that you stop the edges from over-browning. Or, you can “tent” a piece of foil over the top of the pie."

      "title": "Bake the pie for 1 hour, rotating it after 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Bake the pie for 1 hour, rotating it after 30 minutes. To start out, bake the pie at 425 °F (218 °C) for 15 minutes. Then, reduce the heat to 350 °F (177 °C). Continue baking the pie for another 45 minutes. After 30 minutes total cook time, rotate the pie 180 degrees to ensure it cooks evenly. The length of time you will have to bake the pie depends on how cold your freezer is, how hot the oven is, and the amount of filling in the pie. A good general rule is to bake the pie for 20-45 minutes longer than the recipe specifies for cooking normally. [3] X Research source If you added foil around the edge of the pie, remove the foil edge pieces when the middle starts to brown. If the top of the pie starts to brown before the middle or bottom is cooked, make a tent with foil over the top of the pie."

      "content": "Remove the pie from the oven. When the whole pie appears golden brown, take the pie from the oven. Insert a knife into the center of pie to check if the filling is completely done. If you hit hard chunks, put it back in the oven on a lower temperature. Shield the edges with foil again if necessary. When it’s done, allow the pie to cool slightly before serving."

      "content": "Plan for some trial-and-error. Baking a frozen pie (or any pie, for that matter) is both an art and a science. Every baker seems to have their particular tricks and tips, but there’s really only one way to find out what works best for you. Luckily, you get to eat your mistakes—and they’ll still be pretty tasty! While some will argue in favor of it, most bakers seem to agree that it’s best not to freeze a homemade fruit pie after baking it. Prepare it raw, then bake it from frozen. [4] X Research source This differs from recommendations for baking a savory frozen pie : it's advised to bake the filling in the savory pie prior to freezing the pie. More on this in part 3! However, instead of assembling the pie before freezing, you may want to try freezing it in parts—the prepared filling and the (unrolled) dough. In this case, you will let the components thaw to the point that they are workable."

      "title": "Determine if your pie needs thawing.",
      "content": "Determine if your pie needs thawing. Some frozen pies need thawing, while others don't. Follow the directions on the box to determine if you need to thaw your pie. If so, leave it out at room temperature for a few hours. You want the pie to be partially frozen when you put it in the oven. Some pies, like a Dutch apple pie, may need to thaw for hours before cooking, while a pumpkin pie might need only 20 minutes. Other pies, like berry, strawberry, or peach, might not need to thaw at all. If you're baking a frozen hand pie , this may need even less time to thaw. Head to section four for instructions on how to bake a frozen hand pie!"

      "content": "Place the pie in a preheated oven. Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C), or whatever temperature is indicated on the box. Place your pie on a foil-lined baking sheet, which will catch any filling that bubbles over. Place the pie in the oven, following any instructions the box gives you. If the box doesn't provide instructions, cook the pie on the lowest rack to make sure the bottom crust cooks. To help the bottom of the pie cook thoroughly, place it lower in the oven, and/or preheat the baking sheet. Or, try to make a tent with foil to cover the top so it doesn't burn. To keep the edges of the pie from browning too much, wrap the edge of the pie with strips of aluminum foil."

      "title": "Bake the pie according to the package instructions.",
      "content": "Bake the pie according to the package instructions. Many frozen pies need to be baked for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown in color. If that doesn't yield a pie that’s done all the way through, try baking it for 30 minutes, then reducing the temperature to 325 °F (163 °C) and baking for an additional 25-30 minutes. For best results, rotate the pie 180 degrees halfway through the cooking time. This will ensure the pie cooks evenly."

      "content": "Learn from past experiences. If you regularly bake a particular brand of frozen pie, take note of the baking time, temperature, and techniques (covering the edges with foil, preheating the baking sheet, etc.) that seem to produce the best results. Each oven is unique, so you may find that a bit of tweaking to the given instructions is necessary."

      "title": "Cook your filling thoroughly before freezing.",
      "content": "Cook your filling thoroughly before freezing. If you are making a homemade savory pie, cook all meats, vegetables, and other ingredients for the filling as if you intend to bake the pie immediately after. In other words, don’t freeze uncooked or undercooked filling ingredients and expect them to cook through in the oven later. [5] X Research source Uncooked or undercooked meats could pose a serious health hazard."

      "title": "Choose to freeze your pie components separately or together.",
      "content": "Choose to freeze your pie components separately or together. This is one of the many elements of frozen pie baking in which you can easily find a wide range of opinions. Your best bet is to try the different methods and see which works for you. Some cooks recommend cooking the filling and freezing it and the (unrolled) pie crust separately in labeled freezer bags. In this case, you would allow each element to thaw to the point to which you could assemble the pie. [6] X Research source Others, however, prefer the method of assembling the pie then freezing it whole. That way, you can pop it straight from the freezer into the oven. In this instance, don’t freeze the pie in a glass dish as it could shatter in the oven."

      "title": "Adjust your unfrozen baking instructions.",
      "content": "Adjust your unfrozen baking instructions. Not surprisingly, a frozen pie will take a bit longer to cook through than an unfrozen one. You may also find that you need to reduce the temperature a little so that the edges don’t burn before the center cooks through. For example, one pot pie recipe recommends baking unfrozen at 400 °F (204 °C) for about 30 minutes, and frozen at 375 °F (191 °C) for up to 45 minutes. [7] X Research source If you’re concerned about not getting good browning on the bottom crust, start out at the regular temperature for the first 15 minutes or so, then reduce it. If the edge crust is getting too brown before the center of the pie heats through, you can also try creating a ring-shaped heat shield out of aluminum foil, which you can (carefully) place over the edge of the pie. Use another pie dish as a template."

      "content": "Make or buy a few hand pies. Many cultures around the world enjoy some version of a savory hand-held pie—sometimes called a pasty, empanada, or samosa, among other names. They’re relatively easy to make, very portable, and tasty—and ideal for freezing ahead of time and baking on demand. In fact, many hand pie lovers contend that they come out even better when frozen first. [8] X Research source Pasty recipes abound online, so try several variations and see what crust and filling combinations hit the spot for you."

      "content": "Ensure the filling is thick if your pie is homemade. Excess moisture—fats from cooked meats, water content in veggies, etc.—in the filling can make for a soggy hand pie, so drain or thicken fillings a bit more as a precautionary measure. Then, freeze the hand pie until you’re ready to cook it."

      "content": "Cook the pie according to the packaged frozen pie instructions. If you simply want to bake up a boxed pot pie from a freezer section, follow the instructions on the box. In almost every case, these pies are meant to be baked directly from frozen. If you made the pie, note that the frozen baking time will increase a bit and the baking temperature may need to be slightly reduced. Of course, with experience, you may find that adjustments to baking time and temperature produce a better result with a particular frozen pie brand. As instructed, make sure the center of the pie is cooked through. Use a knife—or for more certainty, a meat thermometer—to test the center."
