      "title": "Use a tape measure to measure the mirror you want to frame.",
      "content": "Use a tape measure to measure the mirror you want to frame. Measure the height and write it down. Measure the width and write it down next. You will use these measurements to determine how long to cut the baseboards for the frame. [1] X Research source This method works for framing basic mirrors that don't have any kind of rim or frames around them already. These types of mirrors are also known as floating mirrors or construction-ready mirrors. You can use this method to put a frame around a mirror that is already attached to a wall, or to frame a mirror before hanging it. The mirror needs to have straight edges to build a frame around it with baseboards."

      "title": "Purchase primed MDF baseboards to make the frame with.",
      "content": "Purchase primed MDF baseboards to make the frame with. Go to a home improvement center and select the style of baseboards that you want. Purchase a sufficient length of baseboard to surround the mirror according to the measurements you took. [2] X Research source Primed MDF baseboards are easy to paint so you can make them any color you want for the frame."

    {
      "title": "Cut the baseboards to length with a miter saw.",
      "content": "Cut the baseboards to length with a miter saw. Measure and mark your baseboards to the lengths you need for the sides, top, and bottom. Place the baseboards in a miter box and cut them straight to the lengths that you need. [3] X Research source For example, if your mirror is 2 ft (0.61 m) wide by 3 ft (0.91 m) tall, then you need 2 baseboards that are 2 ft (0.61 m) long and 2 that are 3 ft (0.91 m) long."

    {
      "title": "Cut the corners of the baseboards to a 45-degree angle with a miter saw.",
      "content": "Cut the corners of the baseboards to a 45-degree angle with a miter saw. Change the angle on the miter box to 45 degrees. Cut in from the corners of each board at a 45-degree angle down towards the inside edge of each board. [4] X Research source This will make the frame fit nicely together in each corner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint the baseboards",
      "content": "Paint the baseboards a color of your choice or leave them as is. Use a paintbrush to coat both the front and back of the baseboards (if you want to paint them). Leave them as is if you are fine with the color they came in (such as natural wood). [5] X Research source It's important to paint the backs the same color as well because they can reflect in the mirror."

    {
      "title": "Install the baseboards around the mirror using liquid nails.",
      "content": "Install the baseboards around the mirror using liquid nails. Squeeze a zig-zag line of liquid nails along the back of the baseboards with a caulk gun . Start with the bottom board, then the sides, then the top and stick them to the mirror one-by-one. [6] X Research source Liquid nails are an adhesive form of caulking. Avoid placing the liquid nails too close to the inside edges of the baseboards, or it can squeeze out and get on the mirror when you stick the boards on."

    {
      "title": "Secure the baseboards with painter's tape or lay the mirror on the ground.",
      "content": "Secure the baseboards with painter's tape or lay the mirror on the ground. Tape all the baseboards to the wall with painter's tape if you attached them to a mirror that is already hanging. Lay the mirror flat on the ground while the frame dries if the mirror isn't already hanging. [7] X Research source Painter's tape is the blue masking tape that painters use to cover things up that they don't want to get paint on."

      "title": "Let the frame dry completely for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Let the frame dry completely for 24 hours. Liquid nails need 24 hours to set before you can apply any stress to the frame. Remove the painter's tape after 24 hours if you used it to secure the frame in place on a hanging mirror. [8] X Research source Liquid nails can take a full week to completely cure for maximum strength, but you will be able to safely touch the newly-framed mirror after 24 hours."

      "title": "Fill any gaps in the corners with caulk and paint over it.",
      "content": "Fill any gaps in the corners with caulk and paint over it. Use a caulk gun to squeeze a thin line of caulk into any gaps. Smooth it over with your fingers, then paint over it to match the rest of the frame. [9] X Research source This applies only if you used MDF baseboards and painted them. If you used natural wood boards, you will need to do this part with wood filler instead."

    {
      "title": "Find a mirror and frame that match in size.",
      "content": "Find a mirror and frame that match in size. The mirror needs to be the same size as the glass that goes in the picture frame (if it has any). This is easiest to do with square or rectangular mirrors. [10] X Research source If you can't find a frame and mirror that fit together, then you can have a mirror custom cut to fit a frame you want to use. You can also have a frame custom built to fit a mirror that you already have."

      "title": "Remove the frame glass from the frame if there is any.",
      "content": "Remove the frame glass from the frame if there is any. Remove the frame's backing that holds the glass in place and set everything aside so you just have the frame. You don't want glass in front of a reflective mirror. [11] X Research source You might be able to use the backing to secure the mirror in place, but you can recycle or save the glass for something else."

      "content": "Attach the mirror to the back of the frame using silicone. Put a thin bead of silicone around the edge of the mirror or inside lip of the frame. Carefully align the mirror to the back and press it into place. [12] X Research source If the picture frame has a backing material, you could also attach the mirror to that instead and use it to secure the mirror inside the frame. Just make sure it all fits together in place before you start using silicone to attach the mirror to the backing. Once the mirror is secured to the frame, there are lots of ways you can decorate it , like by putting stencils on the glass of the mirror, or even gluing things like fabric or shells around the frame."

      "content": "Test the weight to make sure the hanging mechanism is strong enough. A mirror is heavier than a picture. Check by lifting up the mirror and frame slightly off the ground by its hanging mechanism (the wire or the hooks) to make sure it's strong enough to support the weight before you hang it to a wall. [13] X Research source If the frame doesn't already have a hanging mechanism, or the existing one isn't strong enough, then you will have to hang it yourself ."

Get the mirror pieces custom-cut to the dimensions you need by a mirror and glass company. Mount the mirror with silicone adhesive. [14] X Research source Make sure to remove any old glass pieces from the door or window before you mount the mirror pieces."
