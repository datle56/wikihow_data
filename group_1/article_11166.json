If you are using multiple colors, put the lighter colors down first, then the darker ones, and finally your outlines.

Whatever you choose to use, just make sure that they match. Try adding chains, fringe, or wool flowers to your shoes for a fun, funky look.

Cut both ends of the ribbon at an angle. Seal the edges with fabric glue or super glue so that they do not fray. Use the ribbon to lace up your shoes instead of regular shoe laces. You can use any color of ribbon you want, but a matching color or a contrasting color might look the best. For example: If your shoes are white, consider getting a teal or black ribbon. If your shoes are light blue, they might look good with a light blue, dark blue, or white ribbon."

When you get to the other end of the flip flop, cut off any excess ribbon and glue the end down to the base of the strap. You can also use thin strips of fabric. Consider starting with two pieces of ribbon. Glue the end of each ribbon to the base of each strap, and wrap them towards each other. Tie them together into a pretty bow when they meet in the middle, right above the toe thong."
