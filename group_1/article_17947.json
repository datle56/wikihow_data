Fold the shirt once more to get it ready for storage. [1] X Research source Stick to simple folds. While complex folds might be able to save you a little more space, they are more time-consuming to do and can make it hard to distinguish your shirts from one another. [2] X Research source Jaymes, Caitlyn. Personal interview. 16 December 2019. Once you’ve folded your shirt, you can keep it upright in your dresser or wardrobe drawer.
