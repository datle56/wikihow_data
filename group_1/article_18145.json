      "content": "Pick a serif font for a print document. Serif fonts have extra strokes on the ends of the letters, which make the text look a little more decorative and elegant. Some typography pros also believe that serif fonts are easier to read in print. If you’re planning to print out your document, choose a classic serif font, such as Times New Roman, Book Antiqua, or Georgia. [1] X Research source To choose a font, go to the Home tab at the top of your document. Select the font you like best from the drop-down font menu at the right side of the menu ribbon. There are hundreds of fonts to choose from, but try to stick to fonts with a simple, classic look to keep your document looking professional and easy to read. Avoid anything overly elaborate or artsy."

      "content": "Go with a sans-serif font for digital documents. Sans-serif fonts lack the little decorative feet that serif fonts have. Many typography experts believe that they are easier to read on digital screens than serif fonts. If you’re not planning to print your document out, go with a classic sans-serif font such as Verdana, Lucida, or Calibri. [2] X Research source While Comic Sans is a popular and easy-to-read sans-serif font, it’s gained a bit of a bad rap for looking childish and unprofessional. Avoid using comic sans if you want your doc to have a polished and mature look."

      "content": "Break up your text with headings. Headings are subsection titles that you can insert throughout the document to clearly mark each section. They not only make your text look nice, but they also make it much easier for people using screen readers to navigate your document. [3] X Research source To insert a heading into your document: Type the text you’d like to use for a heading. For instance, you might write something like “Section 1” or “Introduction.” Select the heading text. Open the Home tab and go to the Styles section of the ribbon menu, at the top right side of the document. Select the heading style you want from the list of styles. For instance, if you’re creating a top-level heading, select Heading 1 . For subheadings, choose Heading 2 or Heading 3 ."

      "title": "Use contrasting fonts for headings and main text.",
      "content": "Use contrasting fonts for headings and main text. Headings are usually bigger than the main body text, which helps them stand out. However, they’ll also stick out more and look more visually interesting if you use a different font for headings than the rest of the text. While Word usually uses a different font for headings by default (for example, Calibri Light versus regular Calibri), feel free to experiment with choosing your own Headings font. [4] X Research source It works well to combine serif fonts in the headings with sans-serif fonts in the body of your document. For instance, you might use Didot for your headings and Gill Sans for the body text. If you don’t want to change the font of each heading manually, go to the Home tab and open the Styles Pane . Select the drop-down menu for the heading style you want, choose Modify Style… and select the font you want."

      "content": "Align your paragraphs left. Typically, left alignment is the default setting for Word documents. If the settings have been changed, you can reset the alignment by opening the Home pane and selecting left alignment from the formatting section in the middle of the ribbon menu at the top of the document. The alignment buttons are located right under the list format buttons. Choose the one at far left, which looks like a series of lines that are even on the left side and uneven on the right. [5] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source You can also change the text alignment by going to the Format menu at the top of your screen and picking Paragraph from the drop-down list. Set the alignment to Left in the general settings menu. While left alignment looks best in most cases, there are exceptions. For instance, you will typically center the title and author lines at the top of a paper. You might also choose to center your headings. In most cases, it’s best to avoid using the “justify” alignment, which makes the text even on both the right and left sides. This formatting style works best in documents written in narrow columns, like brochures, magazine articles, and newsletters. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the margins to at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). The margin settings determine how much space there is between your text and the edge of the page. By default, the margins in Word documents are set to 1 inch (2.5 cm) on each side. However, sometimes a bigger margin looks better. For instance, margins that are 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide are a good choice for cover letters. [7] X Research source To change the margin size, choose the Layout tab from the top of your document and select Margins at far right. Select one of the presets or choose custom margins , then enter whatever numbers you like. Word’s default combination of 12-point font size and 1 in (2.5 cm) margin size is required by a lot of professional citation and formatting styles, like APA and MLA. [8] X Research source If you’re completing a writing assignment for class or a publication, check the guidelines about margins and font size. While you can make your margins smaller, your document will be less readable and pleasant to look at if the text crowds the edges of the page."

      "content": "Indent the first line of each paragraph if your style requires it. If your document is one solid block of text, readers will quickly get tired of looking at it. One traditional way to deal with this is to use paragraph indents. The easiest way to do this is to simply hit ⏎ Return when you’re ready to start a new paragraph, then hit the Tab ↹ key to create an indent at the start of the new line. The default indent in Word is .5 inches (1.3 cm), which is the size of indent required by many standard formatting styles (such as APA and MLA). [9] X Research source You can also use the Layout tab in Word to automatically indent each paragraph. Set the Indent setting in the middle of the ribbon menu to the desired size. For example, set the Left indent to .5 inches (1.3 cm). Every time you hit ⏎ Return to start a new paragraph, it will be automatically indented. You can also make these adjustments by opening up Paragraph… in the Format dropdown menu. Set the exact indent size you want in the Indentation section of the settings window. If you’d rather use Tab ↹ to indent each paragraph, you can also adjust the tab stop setting to change the size of the indent. Go to the Home tab and click the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent buttons in the central paragraph section of the ribbon menu.
