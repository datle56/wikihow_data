However, you can get Lugia in Gold, Silver, and Pokémon XD, though a little work is required to transfer it to Fire Red. If you know someone who has caught Lugia in Gold or Silver , this is the easiest way to get the Pokémon and trade it over. Simply use a Game Boy transfer code and move it to your Fire Red game. If you own a GameCube and Pokémon XD, you can trade for a special Lugia with a unique move. [1] X Research source"

Get its health down as low as possible with moves like tackle and false swipe—anything that doesn't do a ton of damage and might kill it before you catch it. Even if your Ultra Ball fails, throwing one ball makes the next one even more effective, so keep chucking them. [12] X Research source"
