      "content": "Use a lip-plumping product. In the cosmetic section of the drugstore you'll find shelves of products designed to have a lip-plumping effect. These glosses and chapsticks usually contain ingredients like cinnamon oil or capsaicin, the substance that makes hot peppers hot. These ingredients slightly irritate the skin, causing it to plump up temporarily. [1] X Research source Lip-plumpers are usually quite glossy, which creates an even poutier appearance. Caffeine is also commonly found in lip plumpers, so check the ingredients if you're sensitive to it."

      "content": "Try brushing with a little cinnamon. Cinnamon is a mild irritant that can safely plump up your lips a little.

      "content": "Rub a hot pepper on your lips. This method isn't for the faint of heart, but it works! Take a small piece of jalape√±o or another moderately spicy pepper and rub it over your lips. In a moment or two, your lips will start to swell, much like they do when you eat hot salsa or hot sauce.

Put a little on your toothbrush and scrub away. Your lips will look shiny and fresh when you're finished. You can also make a moisturizing scrub by mixing equal parts olive oil and brown sugar. Use your fingertips to gently massage the scrub over your lips, then wipe it away with a clean, wet washcloth. Or try using a baking soda paste to help exfoliate deeper. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, then apply it to your toothbrush and scrub."
