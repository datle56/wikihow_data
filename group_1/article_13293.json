[3] X Research source The closest equivalent is multiplying by the inverse of another matrix. In other words, while [A] ÷ [B] is undefined, you can solve the problem [A] * [B] -1 . Since these two equations would be equivalent for scalar quantities, this \"feels\" like matrix division, but it's important to use the correct terminology. Note that [A] * [B] -1 and [B] -1 * [A] are not the same problem. You may need to solve both to find all possible solutions. For example, instead of ( 13 26 39 13 ) ÷ ( 7 4 2 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\\\39&13\\end{pmatrix}}\\div {\\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\\\2&3\\end{pmatrix}}} , write ( 13 26 39 13 ) ∗ ( 7 4 2 3 ) − 1 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\\\39&13\\end{pmatrix}}*{\\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\\\2&3\\end{pmatrix}}^{-1}} . You may also need to calculate ( 7 4 2 3 ) − 1 ∗ ( 13 26 39 13 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\\\2&3\\end{pmatrix}}^{-1}*{\\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\\\39&13\\end{pmatrix}}} , which may have a different answer."

If the matrix you're planning to inverse is non-square, there is no unique solution to the problem. [4] X Research source The term \"divisor matrix\" is a little loose, since this is not technically a division problem. For [A] * [B] -1 , this refers to matrix [B]. In our example problem, this is ( 7 4 2 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\\\2&3\\end{pmatrix}}} . A matrix that has an inverse is called \"invertible\" or \"non-singular.\" Matrices without an inverse are \"singular.\""

      "content": "Check that the two matrices can be multiplied together. To multiply two matrices together, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. [5] X Research source If this does not work in either arrangement ([A] * [B] -1 or [B] -1 * [A]), there is no solution to the problem. For example, if [A] is a 4 x 3 matrix (4 rows, 3 columns) and [B] is a 2 x 2 matrix (2 rows, 2 columns), there is no solution. [A] * [B] -1 does not work since 3 ≠ 2, and [B] -1 * [A] does not work since 2 ≠ 4. Note that the inverse [B] -1 always has the same number of rows and columns as the original matrix [B]. There's no need to calculate the inverse to complete this step. In our example problem, both matrices are 2 x 2s, so they can be multiplied in either order."

If the determinant is zero, the matrix does not have an inverse. Here's how to find the determinant in the simplest case, the 2 x 2 matrix: [6] X Research source 2 x 2 matrix: The determinant of the matrix ( a b c d ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{pmatrix}}} is ad - bc. [7] X Research source In other words, take the product of the main diagonal (top left to bottom right), then subtract the product of the anti-diagonal (top right to bottom left). For example, the matrix ( 7 4 2 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\\\2&3\\end{pmatrix}}} has the determinant (7)(3) - (4)(2) = 21 - 8 = 13.

Repeat this for the other two elements in the same row or column as the first one you chose, then sum all three determinants.

For example, [B] → [B | I ]. The identity matrix has \"1\" elements along the main diagonal, and \"0\" elements in all other positions. Perform row operations to reduce the matrix until the left side is in row-echelon form, then continue reducing until the left side is the identity matrix. Once the operation is complete, your matrix will be in the form [I | B -1 ]. In other words, the right side will be the inverse of the original matrix."
