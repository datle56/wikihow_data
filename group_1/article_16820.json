      "content": "Look for the person's profile. If you can see the profile while on the People tab of the search results, the person's profile is still active, meaning that they just unfriended you. If you can't find the profile, they may have deleted their account or blocked you from seeing it; however, they may also have set their privacy settings high enough that you can't search for them on Facebook. If you do see the account, try tapping or clicking it. You'll be able to see a limited view of the profile if you aren't blocked. To confirm, ask a mutual friend to search for the person. If they see the user and you don't, it's very likely you're blocked by them."

Only do this as a last resort—if a long-term friend has blocked you, for example, it might be worth talking to them to try to salvage the relationship. Otherwise, it might be best to take the hint and move on."
