      "content": "Find the middle number of the set. How you do this will depend on whether you have an even amount of numbers or an odd amount. [6] X Research source Here's what you can do in either situation: If odd, cross out the leftmost number, then the rightmost number, and then repeat. When you have one number left, this is your median. If you're working with the numbers 4, 7, 8, 11, and 21, then 8 is your mode because it's the number in the middle. If even, cross out numbers on either side, but you should have two numbers exactly in the middle. Add them together and divide by two for the median value. (If the two numbers in the middle are the same, that number is your median.) [7] X Research source If you're working with the numbers 1, 2, 5, 3, 7, and 10, then your two middle numbers are 5 and 3. Add up 5 and 3 to get 8 and divide this result by 2 to get 4 as your median."
