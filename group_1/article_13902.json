      "content": "The Mayo-clinic recommends and upper limit of 2000mg a day of Vitamin C and states that higher doses might cause kidney stones in some people and digestive issues. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source They also state that \"too much dietary vitamin C is unlikely to be harmful\" [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In 1986 a report was published of a woman who had kidney stones and also was taking vitamin C. There were also a number of other factors that could have caused it. It appears that all references to vitamin C causing kidney stones refer back to this report, in combination to a study that showed that oxalate blood levels reached saturation during vitamin C use, but this does not necessarily translate to greater likelihood of kidney stones, as those patients taking vitamin C did not exhibit symptoms of kidney stones, and it is believed kidney stone precipitate is a function of misappropriated oxalate rather than oversaturation. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source More recent studies all indicate that large doses of vitamin C do not cause stones even in extreme doses only possible with intravenous use, even where the blood concentration is up to 100x higher (7mmol/L) than normal (70umol/L). [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Vitamin C is essential to kidney function and can play an important role in kidney repair. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source [8] X Research source According to some sources doses of Vitamin C higher than 2,000mg a day can cause cramps, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, heartburn, and gut issues. If you are worried about these symptoms, talk to your doctor before taking Vitamin C. If you are pregnant or breast feeding, use caution when taking Vitamin C. Speak to your doctor to confirm if it is safe for you and your baby before taking it."
