      "content": "No, you can't pour muriatic acid outside. Doing so would kill plants and harm the soil, and the acid could leach into groundwater. Dumping muriatic acid down a storm drain harms the ecosystem because this untreated water feeds into local rivers and streams. It's illegal to dispose of hazardous waste this way. [1] X Research source Don't pour muriatic acid down a kitchen or sink drain without first diluting it or neutralizing it, either."
