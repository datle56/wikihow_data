      "content": "Place paper on the areas you don’t want to glitter. You can wrap strips of tissue paper around the candle and tie them in place, or tape down individual pieces to create different designs. Plan out what you want your candle to look like, then tie down or attach the paper with Scotch tape to start the decorating process. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush Mod Podge on the areas you want to cover.",
      "content": "Brush Mod Podge on the areas you want to cover. Use a paintbrush or a crafting brush to spread a thin, even layer of Mod Podge on the candle. You can paint over the edges of the paper to ensure full coverage, but try not to cover the paper completely. [2] X Research source If you don’t have Mod Podge, you can make your own or use regular liquid glue, although the glitter may not stay on as long."

      "title": "Sprinkle glitter over the candle.",
      "content": "Sprinkle glitter over the candle. Thick coats of glitter look best on candles, making the glitter look neater and more professional. You shouldn’t be able to see any of the candle surface underneath. You’ll get glitter on your work surface, so put down newspapers beforehand to catch it. Tap the bottom of the candle gently against the surface when you’re done to knock off any extra glitter. [3] X Research source Match the glitter color to your candle and your event. You might pair red glitter with a white candle for the holidays, for example, or put black glitter on an orange candle for Halloween."

      "content": "Let the candle dry, then seal it with Mod Podge sealer. Leave the candle standing up on your work surface overnight to dry. When it’s dry, remove the paper cut outs and spray the glitter with Mod Podge clear sealer to help it stay on longer. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Dab your candle with candle varnish and let it dry overnight. Wet a makeup sponge with candle and soap colors varnish, then dab it across the surface of the candle in an even, smooth coat. Let it set overnight. [6] X Research source Varnish prepares your candle for paint, keeping the paint in place and protecting it from wear and tear. You can find the varnish online or in craft stores."

      "content": "Mark off the areas you don’t want to paint with tape or rubber bands. If you don’t want to paint your whole candle, you can make stripes or designs with painter’s tape or rubber bands.

      "content": "Paint the candle with acrylic paint. Use acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush to paint your candle in a smooth, even layer. If you’re painting with different colors, paint all of the sections in one color before rinsing your brush and moving onto the next, or use separate brushes.

Let it dry again, then remove the tape. To prevent the paint from chipping and give it a glossy appearance, you can dab an even coat of varnish over the entire candle. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Print a photo onto white tissue paper. Cut a sheet of white or transparent tissue paper just smaller than a sheet of printer paper. Then, tape it onto the printer paper, shiny side down. Feed the paper into the printer so that your image prints onto the tissue side. [10] X Research source Most printers flip the paper over before printing, so you’ll need to place your paper tissue side-down. Check your printer’s instructions to make sure. You can transfer a photo, an illustration, or even a few words onto your candle."

      "content": "Apply a heat tool, like a hair dryer or heat gun, to the picture. Run an embossing heat gun over the image to embed it into the candle. Watch the ink as you heat it—you should be able to see it coming through darker and more clearly, which means it’s done. [13] X Research source If you don’t have a heat gun, use a hair dryer on the hottest setting. Use the diffuser attachment or wear gloves to protect your hands from the heat."

      "content": "Peel off the wax paper gently and throw it away. Slowly and gently pull away the wax paper, like you’re peeling away a temporary tattoo. The picture should stay behind as a unique candle decoration. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Bedazzle your candles with plastic jewels. Buy rhinestones or plastic jewels at a craft store and use super glue to attach them to your candle.

      "content": "Wind bright yarn or fabric around the candle for a striped look. Choose a ribbon or yarn that matches or offsets your candle color, then twirl it around the candle to create a striped, candy cane effect.

[19] X Research source This method looks best with a plain white or cream candle. You can add as many seashells as you like."
