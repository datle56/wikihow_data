    {
      "title": "Avoid comparing yourself to their new partner.",
      "content": "Avoid comparing yourself to their new partner. Don’t try to learn more about their new partner or question what they have that you don't. Resist the urge to ask mutual friends for details! You will only make yourself feel worse. [1] X Research source When you compare yourself to others, you're never fair to yourself. That's because it's easy to see what others have that you don't, but it's hard to recognize what's great about you."

      "title": "Remind yourself why you’re not together.",
      "content": "Remind yourself why you’re not together. No matter how sad you might be feeling, there’s a reason you broke up. Remember all their bad habits and inconsiderate behaviors? Now their new partner has to deal with them! [2] X Research source Write down all of the bad things that happened while you were together. [3] X Research source Think about all the ways they let you down. You may struggle more to acknowledge the reasons for the breakup if your ex is the one who broke up with you.

    {
      "title": "Distract yourself with fun activities.",
      "content": "Distract yourself with fun activities. Don’t give yourself time to dwell on your ex’s new relationship.

Fill your life with awesome activities, and you won’t have time to worry about your ex. [4] X Research source Try something you’ve always wanted to try. Do the things you used to enjoy before your relationship with your ex, such as girls’ night, hot yoga, or taking an evening art class."

    {
      "title": "Don’t trash talk your ex to make yourself feel better.",
      "content": "Don’t trash talk your ex to make yourself feel better. This works temporarily, but it’ll hurt you in the long run. It keeps you stuck in your breakup rut. Your ex’s relationship with someone else won’t stop you from living the life you want. Only you can do that! [5] X Research source It’s okay to vent on occasion, but don’t let all of your conversations turn into rants about your ex. If someone changes the subject, don’t try to change it back to your ex."

    {
      "title": "Name the emotions you’re feeling instead of fighting them.",
      "content": "Name the emotions you’re feeling instead of fighting them. It’s normal to feel a range of emotions when you find out your ex is dating someone new. Don’t try to force yourself to stop feeling them. Instead, acknowledge what you’re feeling and let it pass. [6] X Research source It’s okay if you need to cry sometimes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your friends about your feelings.",
      "content": "Talk to your friends about your feelings. Meet them in person for coffee, or text them whenever you need to talk. Let them know if you need to vent or would like advice. [7] X Research source Choose the people you trust the most. Try to avoid talking to mutual friends, as they might inadvertently mention details about your ex."

    {
      "title": "Journal",

    {
      "title": "Forgive them",
      "content": "Forgive them if they hurt you. Don’t hold onto your hurt feelings. It may feel like forgiveness is for the other person, but it’s really for you. Forgiveness will give you the freedom to move on. Look for their good qualities in addition to the bad, and realize that they likely weren't trying to hurt you. [9] X Research source Let go of your anger and resentment toward your ex. Holding onto anger only punishes you. Remember the good parts of your relationship, as well as the lessons you've learned. Although they hurt you, some good likely came from the relationship. Talk to someone about your feelings, such as a friend or therapist. Writing in your journal can also help you work through these feelings. You might even write a long letter to your ex about how they hurt you. Burn it or throw it away instead of sending it. You don't need to let the person back into your life. With forgiveness, you can actually let go of them forever, if that's what you want. Don’t let one bad experience prevent you from finding happiness with someone else."
