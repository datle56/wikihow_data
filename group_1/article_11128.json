      "title": "Start with dry hair that hasn’t been washed for at least a day.",
      "content": "Start with dry hair that hasn’t been washed for at least a day. Hair that hasn’t been washed for 1 to 3 days, will hold much better than freshly-washed hair. Makes sure your hair is completely dry as wet hair won’t hold the curls well. If you decide to wash your hair before curling it, use as little shampoo and conditioner as possible.

      "content": "Apply a heat-protectant to your hair. Liberally spray a heat-protectant over the top layer of your hair as well as throughout your hair. Use your fingers to lift up sections of hair and spray the heat-protectant all over your hair. This helps to stop the heat of the curling iron damaging your hair. Don’t worry about rubbing the product into the hair as it will dry quickly. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Mist your hair with a light to medium hold non-aerosol hairspray.",
      "content": "Mist your hair with a light to medium hold non-aerosol hairspray. This helps your curls to stay in place and gives your hair another barrier of protection from the heat. This is especially important if your hair doesn’t tend to hold curls well. Spray the non-aerosol hairspray lightly over the top layer of your hair. If you accidentally spray on too much hairspray and the hair goes crusty or sticky, brush the hair to remove the excess spray. [3] X Research source It is important to use non-aerosol hairspray because the aerosol kind will make your hair sticky and difficult to curl."

      "content": "Tie up the top section of your hair into a bun. It is much easier to tell what hair you have curled if you only have half your hair down. Gather the top half of your hair into a bun on the top of your head and secure it with a hair tie. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Heat up the curling iron.",
      "content": "Heat up the curling iron. Plug the curling iron into an outlet that is close to a mirror. If you have fine or colored hair, choose the lowest heat setting. If you have thick, coarse or healthy hair, choose the medium or high setting. Higher temperatures will set your curls better but are more likely to damage your hair. Experiment with different temperatures. Choose the lowest temperature that sets your curls, as this will cause the least damage to your hair.

Squeeze the hand lever to open the clasp. Close the clasp onto the ends of the hair. Wrap the hair around the curler until you reach the roots. Wrap the hair away from your face to give the curls a natural look. [6] X Research source Continue curling the bottom layer of hair in {2 in (5.1 cm) sections."

      "content": "Style your hair into ringlets using a small-barrel iron. Repeat the beachy-waves curling process, but use a thin-barrel iron instead. This will create tighter ringlets and makes your hair look extra curly. If you find that the ringlets aren’t holding their curl well, spray hairspray onto the hair right before you curl it.

When you have finished curling the bottom section of your hair, secure it into a loose ponytail at the nape of your neck. Remove the hair tie from the top bun and curl the top layer. Use a mirror to help you see the back of your head. This will show you what hair you still need to curl. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Run your fingers through the curls to achieve a beachy look. If you prefer looser curls, run your fingers from the roots of your hair to the ends. Spread your fingers apart and use them like a comb. This will open up the curls and make them looser. If you like tighter, more traditional curls, skip this step. The more you run your hands through your hair the looser the curls will become. Keep in mind that the curls will naturally become looser over the course of the day, so don’t comb them too much.

      "content": "Flip your hair forward and then back to add volume. Long hair can be heavy which can make the roots look limp. Try bending your head down and flipping all your hair over your head, and then spray your hair lightly with hairspray. Bring your head back to its usual position and pull your hair back so it sits normally. This will add volume and texture to your hair.
