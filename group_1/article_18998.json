      "title": "Coat your hands with olive oil.",
      "content": "Coat your hands with olive oil. Pour a tablespoon of olive oil into the palm of one hand, then gently rub your hands together. Make sure to coat your fingers, palms, and backs of your hands evenly with oil. [2] X Research source Capsaicin is dissolved in oil more easily than water. If you were to only rinse your hands with water, you could actually cause more harm than good, spreading the capsaicin oil rather than eliminating it! You can use vegetable oil as a substitute for olive oil."

      "title": "Rub oil underneath your fingernails.",
      "content": "Rub oil underneath your fingernails. Capsaicin can get stuck under your fingernails, lingering and continuing to cause irritation after even a vigorous hand washing. Try to rub oil underneath the tips of your fingernails as best as possible. Twist the corner of a paper towel into a point, then dip it in oil. Slide the oil-soaked tip of the paper towel gently along the underside of your fingernail. This will allow any hiding capsaicin to be dissolved by the oil. Also, consider trimming your fingernails to get rid of any remaining jalapeno juices."

      "title": "Wash the oil from your hands with soap and water.",
      "content": "Wash the oil from your hands with soap and water. Repeat this process as many times as necessary to remove the oil completely from your hands. Make sure to rinse away any residual oil left underneath your fingernails. [3] X Research source Consider using dish soap rather than regular hand soap. It is designed to cut through thick grease on dirty dishes and will remove the oil from your hands more quickly. [4] X Research source Olive oil has the added bonus of moisturizing dry skin so you may notice that your hands feel softer afterward!"

      "title": "Submerge your hands in a bowl of alcohol for quick relief.",
      "content": "Submerge your hands in a bowl of alcohol for quick relief. Pour a cup of rubbing alcohol into a bowl and submerge your hands. Rub your hands together vigorously, making sure that the alcohol coats all parts of your hands and wrists. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Alcohol dissolves the capsaicin present in the jalapeno oil in a similar manner as olive oil. You do not need to submerge your hands for a long period. Once they have been thoroughly coated with alcohol, simply remove your hands from the bowl. You can also use a high proof liquor like vodka if you don't have any rubbing alcohol handy! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Dip your hands into a diluted bleach solution if you don't have alcohol.",
      "content": "Dip your hands into a diluted bleach solution if you don't have alcohol. As an alternative to alcohol, you can mix 5 parts water and 1 part bleach in a bowl or large container. Immediately remove your hands from the diluted bleach solution after submerging them. Bleach can cause burns and serious skin irritation if it comes in contact with your skin for long enough, so be extremely careful. The bleach will chemically react with the capsaicin found in the jalapeno oil that is clinging to your skin. This reaction will neutralize its irritation-causing properties. [7] X Research source Bleach is a harsh chemical that will remove pigment from clothing, so practice extreme care when pouring it into the bowl. To protect against splashing, consider wearing an old shirt or apron to protect your clothing. It is best to prepare this solution in the kitchen or bathroom sink in order to minimize the chances of bleach coming into contact with rugs, towels, or carpet."

      "content": "Wash and moisturize your hands. After rinsing your hands with alcohol or bleach, use soap and water to gently wash away residual jalapeno oil from your hands and wrists. Both alcohol and bleach can quickly dry out your skin, so it is best to use a gentle hand cleanser as opposed to dish soap. It may take several washes to completely remove the smell of bleach from your hands! Apply a moisturizer after washing your hands in order to restore your skin's natural moisture, which may have been removed by the chemicals.

      "content": "Create a paste by combining water, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide. Combine â…› teaspoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of water, and 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide together in a bowl. Use a fork to gently whisk together the solution, breaking apart any clumps of baking soda. [9] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide affects the structure of the capsaicin molecules, neutralizing their irritation-causing properties. The baking soda helps absorb the capsaicin oil while also activating the hydrogen peroxide."

      "content": "Submerge your hands in the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide paste. Allow your hands to soak in the mixture, making sure that the paste covers your hands entirely. Rub your hands together in order to evenly coat the spaces in between your fingers. [10] X Research source Keep your hands submerged in the liquid for about 1 minute, then remove them from the bowl. Hydrogen peroxide can stain your clothing, so keep the solution away from any fabric. Consider wearing an apron to protect your clothing while applying the paste."

Place your hands under running water to rinse away the paste. [11] X Research source Scrub the area around and underneath your fingernails as you wash. The grit from the paste will help remove any lingering jalapeno oil from underneath your nails. Any remaining jalapeno oil should be dissolved and removed with the soap and water."
