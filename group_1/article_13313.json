Ask \"Does 15 fit into 3?\" Since 15 is definitely larger than 3, the answer is \"no,\" and we move on to the next step."

Since you can't fit a two-digit number into a one-digit number, we'll look at the first two digits of the dividend instead, just like we would in a regular division problem. If you still have an impossible division problem, you'll need to look at the first three digits instead, but we don't need to in this example: [2] X Research source Does 15 fit into 34? Yes, it does, so we can start calculating the answer. (The first number doesn't have to fit perfectly, it just needs to be smaller than the second number.)"

[3] X Research source We need to solve 34 ÷ 15, or \"how many times does 15 go into 34\"? You're looking for a number you can multiply with 15 to get a number less than 34, but pretty close to it: Does 1 work? 15 x 1 = 15, which is less than 34, but keep guessing. Does 2 work? 15 x 2 = 30. This is still less than 34, so 2 is a better answer than 1. Does 3 work? 15 x 3 = 45, which is greater than 34. Too high! The answer must be 2."

Nope, too high! We'll try three instead: 15 x 3 = 45. Smaller than 47 but close to it. Perfect. The answer is 3, so we'll write that about the \"7\" on the answer line.

For example, let's say we're solving 143 ÷ 27, but we don't have a good guess at how many times 27 goes into 143. Let's pretend we're solving 143 ÷ 30 instead."
