      "title": "Use waxed floss if possible.",
      "content": "Use waxed floss if possible. When you're flossing with braces, it's important to remember that there are plenty of metal pieces and corners to catch your floss on. Because of this, you'll want to use a thin, wax-coated floss whenever you can. Unwaxed, thread-like floss is much more likely to get stuck to your braces. [1] X Research source The amount of floss you should use can vary slightly based on the size of your mouth and your hands. Most dental resources recommend a piece about 12 – 18 inches (30 – 46 cm) long."

      "title": "Thread the floss behind the brace wire.",
      "content": "Thread the floss behind the brace wire. Grab the floss with one hand a few inches from one end. Carefully thread it under or over the main wire of your braces, taking care not to get it stuck. When it's around the wire, pull it through so there's enough slack on either end to grab. A mirror can be a big help here. [2] X Research source Be gentle. Do not pull on the brace wire with the floss — you're just trying to get the floss behind it, not to \"scrub\" the wire itself."

      "title": "Slide the floss between your teeth.",
      "content": "Slide the floss between your teeth. Grab one end of the floss in each hand. Wrap the ends around your index fingers for a tighter grip. Adjust the floss so that it runs up the bottom of each index finger to the fingertip. Move one index finger inside your mouth and gently pull the floss so that it goes into the space between your teeth. [3] X Research source If you've flossed before, this movement should feel natural. You basically want to move the floss into the gap between the teeth, then push it down into the gap. For some of your teeth, this will probably be a tight fit — this is normal."

      "title": "Slide the floss up and down.",
      "content": "Slide the floss up and down. Now that the floss is in between your teeth, use your fingers to slide it up and down from the gums to the point where it's difficult to keep moving it. Pull gently so that the floss rubs against the insides of both teeth. [4] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. You want to \"scrub\" as much of this inner space as possible — try doing it five times against each surface. This scrubbing motion may seem like it's not \"doing\" anything, but it is. Flossing isn't just for removing bits of food that get stuck — it's also important for removing plaque, an invisible film of bacteria that can cause decay, pain, and discoloration if it's not dealt with.

      "title": "Repeat for each tooth until finished.",
      "content": "Repeat for each tooth until finished. Go down each row of teeth and carefully thread the floss between every set of teeth all the way to your furthest-back molars. When you have \"scrubbed\" with every set of teeth on the top and bottom of your mouth, you're done. Take your time. [6] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. Flossing properly when you have braces can take up to three times longer than a normal flossing session, but it's especially important to floss when you're wearing orthodontic devices because these devices can get in the way of cleaning with a brush alone. You may also experience some gum bleeding which is normal due to inflammation which occurs when braces are placed in."

Now that it’s in position, grab the floss in your hands and floss down between the teeth. Pull the floss out and repeat it with the same threader. The threader is useful for making it easier to get the floss into the correct position without scraping up your fingers. Be careful when you apply the pressure to get in between your teeth — go gently with a back and forth movement."

This tool shoots a narrow stream of water which can be used to remove particles of food and clean between teeth, though dentists don't usually recommend them in place of flossing. They can be really helpful as a complement to flossing, flushing out some of the food that might be in particularly difficult-to-reach places. As an added benefit, water flossing can be used for gum stimulation, restoring proper health and function to gums that are inflamed or receded. [12] X Research source"

Dental tape is a special type of floss that's especially thin and wide — almost like a small ribbon. Dental tape is used in the same way as normal floss, but people who have painful teeth or gums often find it to be more comfortable."

Their unique shape makes them perfect for cleaning behind braces — simply insert the brush under the wire and between the teeth, then scrub to clean. Interdental brushes aren't available everywhere, so talk to your dentist or orthodontist if you're interested in getting one. [13] X Research source You can also use a bit of toothpaste on the interdental brush for better cleaning. Interdental brushes aren't intended to be used as a replacement for floss. They can't clean between the teeth as thoroughly as floss can. Instead, they're used along with floss to ensure that the area behind the braces receives enough cleaning."
