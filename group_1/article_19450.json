To enable \"Frequently Visited,\" simply go back to a new tab, tap Edit and tap the switch so it's green. For older iOS versions, the \"Frequently Visited\" tab is located within your Settings app in the Safari option. If it doesn't work, like you toggle it off and then look a day later and see the toggle is back on, make sure you don't have \"Use Start Page on All Devices\" checked on your Mac, as that could be syncing your Mac's Safari preferences with your other Apple devices. To delete individual \"Frequently Visited\" sites, press and hold the icon next to a site and tap Delete when it pops up."
