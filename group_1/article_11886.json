If you’re sensitive, looking for true love, and want someone you can spend a lot of your time with, then consider looking for someone else. However, if you’re okay with being with someone who sees other people, and with seeing other people yourself, then go for it.

However, if you’re okay with more casual flings and don’t care who else is texting your partner—and don’t care if they know who else is texting you—then you’ll be able to deal with the player much more easily. [5] X Research source If you express jealousy, then the player is likely to back off, since they won’t have the patience to deal with it. As soon as you start getting suspicious or antsy, they'll begin to suspect this isn’t the right thing for them."

      "content": "Stick to casual dates that don’t require commitment. Players aren’t there to take the big relationship steps with you. There’s no sense in trying to get a player to really commit to you, whether you want them to move in with you, meet your sister and friends, or take a weekend hike with you. If they’re not into all that, then trying to force it will only make them more cautious around you. Of course, wanting commitment is perfectly natural, but it’s not likely that you’ll be getting it from a player. [6] X Research source Instead, let things go at their own pace. In an ideal situation, things just reach a natural progression, and you’ll both grow closer when the time is right. If you feel like you’re always pressuring them, then it’s a sign that you want something more and that you should move on."

Don’t read into every little phone call, text message, or Instagram post that they make, thinking that it means something big for your relationship. Be more lighthearted, and you’ll save yourself a lot of stress in the process. For instance, if they show up late to your date, chastise them a little, but don’t let them ruin your night. After all, a player sticks to their own schedule. [7] X Research source Being with a player is all about having fun and enjoying the carefree benefits of the relationship. If you hold the player to the same standards as a serious partner or spouse, then you are bound to be disappointed."

The best thing you can do with a player is not let them get into your head or your heart. Don’t think about taking vacation with them next summer. Don’t think about what a great parent they’ll be, or how sexy they’ll look with some gray in their hair. Remind yourself that this is a temporary relationship to avoid heartbreak in the future. If you find yourself getting lonely when you’re not with them or wondering what they’re up to, then it’s likely that you’re already emotionally invested. It’s natural to become attached in a relationship, but if you’re dating a player, this is a sign that you need to take a step back."

Let them know early on what’s okay and what’s not. For instance, maybe you’re not okay when they disappear for hours with no explanation. Or, maybe you get uncomfortable when they check out other people in front of you. Express your boundaries and consider moving on if the person you’re dating doesn’t respect them. “I know we’re just casually dating, but I’d really like it if you could stop checking out other women in front of me. It makes me uncomfortable.” “You can’t just blow me off and miss our date without texting me, okay? It’s fine if you’re a little late, but if you’re not going to show up at all, I need to know.” “I get that this is a mostly physical relationship, but I’m not okay with being a booty call. I’d like to go on a date first before going back to your place.”"

If they’re seeing other people, then what’s to stop you from hanging out with others, too? If they go out late at night without telling you what they’re up to, you’re free to do the same. You don’t have to play a player if that’s not your thing, but it’s a great way to keep a player on their toes. [10] X Research source However, if you were dating a player without realizing it, that’s a different story. If you found this out the hard way and you’re much more into monogamy, let them know that they really hurt you, but don’t feel compelled to fight fire with fire if it’s not in your nature."

To play hard to get, don’t be there to answer the phone every time they call. Don’t be available if they ask you out the day-of, or even the day before. Flirt with them, but don’t make them think they have you in the palms of their hands. [11] X Research source Give them compliments about their appearance or personality, but don’t tell them how much you love them (or even like them). Make a player work for it.

Don’t lie or pretend like you don’t have feelings, but don’t be completely vulnerable around the player unless you want to get burned. If they start opening up to you a bit, follow suit, but make sure not to give too much up at once. [12] X Research source Letting your guard down can be tempting, especially if you’re with someone you’re really starting to like. However, the more you reveal, the more you’ll regret later when your relationship is over. Tell them what’s on your mind, but avoid telling them your deepest, darkest secrets."

Though you may go out once or even twice a week, they won’t be the person who watches TV in their pajamas with you all day, and they won’t be free to meet up for lunch or brunch whenever. If you’re codependent or the type of person who loves spending 24/7 with whomever they’re dating, then this player is probably not for you. [15] X Research source Instead, fill your schedule with time with your friends, as well as time to be on your own to decompress and do your own thing, and you’ll be better off."

If they’re a true player, then their friends may not take the time to really get to know you because they’ll be seeing you as the latest “Flavor of the Week.” If you do meet their friends, though, be kind and friendly toward them without getting to know them too much. Even players care what their friends think about their partner, so try to make a good impression . You may not think their friends are the greatest people in the world, but nothing is stopping you from saying hi and asking how they’re doing when you see them. Make it easier for yourself to get along with them, and your time with the player will be more enjoyable."

A player might think they can tell you where to meet up and what to do all the time, but it’s up to you to show them you have other ideas. They can pick where to hang out sometimes, but push back occasionally. Set your own schedule for dates and meet up whenever it’s best for you. Staying in control of the relationship will make the player see that you’re a force to be reckoned with. If the player feels like they have you under their thumb, they’ll be much less intrigued than they’d be if you’re behind the steering wheel."

Make it known that you’re open to seeing other people, that you’re not closing down your walls just for them and that you’re just as free-spirited as they are. If you’re looking for something more serious and know they’re not it, it’s cool to keep hanging with them while looking for something more. [16] X Research source Plus, if you’re looking for something more than a player, keeping your options open can lead you to find that special person you were looking for.

Let them see that you’re watching them and you want the player to bring their A-game. [17] X Research source Show them that you’re capable, too. If they tease you, respond with a quick comeback . If they spout off their baseball knowledge, spit out a few impressive facts."

If you’re stepping out to meet a friend, don’t say who it is. If you moved around a lot as a kid, leave it at that instead of giving all the details. If you show up late, don’t say what held you up all the time. [18] X Research source Though you don’t need to wear black sunglasses or an edgy hat, work on being less forthcoming so the player will have to do more work to get to know you."

Limiting your communication will show them that you have better things to do than to worry about them all the time, and they’ll be even more intrigued by you. [19] X Research source As a rule, text each other about the same amount. If they’re calling you a lot, then call them at least a few times to keep things fairly even."

Don’t do it just to make the player jealous, but don’t be secretive about what you’re doing, either. [20] X Research source Be careful of using other people to make your partner jealous. Remember that other people have feelings too, and they probably wouldn’t appreciate it if you’re just using them to get back at a player."

Though dating a player can be a fun way to pass a summer or a boring cold winter, there will come a time when you need to cut the player loose. There can be a number of reasons for doing this, but the one that comes up the most is that you find yourself getting too attached without getting anything back. Be honest with yourself and make sure not to prolong the relationship if you find yourself really wanting something more. [21] X Research source Trust your gut. If you suspect that you’re starting to feel some heartache, then that’s probably the case. If you think your feelings are too strong and the player isn’t going to be there for you, then it’s time to say your goodbyes."
