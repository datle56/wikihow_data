Other great ideas include images that remind you of family or friends. Think of metaphors that you can use that apply to your life.

      "content": "Start simple if you're new to drawing. Creating a simple design will help you become acclimated to drawing. Try simple geometric shapes like squares and triangles before moving on to more complex and detailed images. [5] X Research source Other simple designs include a puzzle piece, a star, a phrase or word, or a musical note. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Sketch out your different ideas.",
      "content": "Sketch out your different ideas. Use a sketchpad and a pen to create ideas and forms on paper. Visualize what you'd want to create for your temporary tattoo and try drawing it on a regular piece of paper. If you mess up, start again next to your mistake. The goal is not to get everything down perfectly, but to explore different ideas, shapes, and forms that you can use in your temporary tattoo."

      "title": "Draw the outline of your tattoo first.",
      "content": "Draw the outline of your tattoo first. Don't get caught up in minute details or shading at first. Start by drawing the outside outline of your image before moving onto more intricate parts. Try to draw continuous, steady lines and avoid scratching or scraping at the image."

    {
      "title": "Add smaller details and fill in colors.",
      "content": "Add smaller details and fill in colors. Once you've got the outline drawn, you can start filling in the finer details. Work your way around the image and fill in smaller details. When you're satisfied with what you've designed and drawn, you can move on to apply the temporary tattoo to your skin. Use markers with a smaller tip to draw in fine detail."

    {
      "title": "Trace the design onto tracing paper for ease of use.",
      "content": "Trace the design onto tracing paper for ease of use. Tracing paper is thin so you can see through it. Use a pencil to go over the design, making thick, dark lines. You need to make them thick because otherwise, they won't transfer well to your skin. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that the design will flip when you transfer it to your skin. If you need to, trace it on one side, then flip it over to trace it backwards on the other side. You'll apply the \"backwards\" side to your skin, which will then flip the design the right way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use printer paper if you don't have tracing paper.",
      "content": "Use printer paper if you don't have tracing paper. You can use regular paper, but you won't be able to see as well. Try tracing the design lightly on a lighted screen, such as a tablet. To transfer it to the other side so the design is flipped, rub pencil back and forth on another piece of paper until you have a solid block. Place your design on top, right-side up. Trace over it with a pen, hard, then flip it. You'll have a light outline in pencil, brought up from the scribbling you did. [8] X Research source Trace over it with more pencil or even a pen to make it darker before trying to apply it to your skin."

      "title": "Add rubbing alcohol to your skin.",
      "content": "Add rubbing alcohol to your skin. The rubbing alcohol will help adhere the pencil to your skin. Rub it up and down where you want to place the tattoo, and make sure your skin is still slightly damp with it when you put the paper on it. [9] X Research source You can pour a little on, then rub it in with a cotton ball."

      "content": "Press the paper into your skin, pencil-side down. Apply a damp washcloth over the paper, and hold it there for a few seconds. Peel up a little of the paper to see if you have an outline. If you don't, hold it there a few more seconds. Remove the paper when you have an outline. [10] X Research source Now you have a tattoo you can trace over."

      "title": "Test the marker on your skin first.",
      "content": "Test the marker on your skin first. You can use any permanent marker, but keep in mind that some aren't made to be used on the skin. Always test the marker on a small area of skin first. That way, if you get a reaction, you know not to use that marker. [11] X Research source For instance, test a little bit on the inside of your elbow to see how it reacts. A temporary tattoo pen is your best option, which you can find online."

      "content": "Draw the outline with a thin marker. Use a fine point pen to draw the outside of your design. That way, you can get in the fine details that larger markers won't let you do. Draw a freehand design, or trace over a pencil design you adhered to your skin. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill in larger areas with a fat-tipped marker.",
      "content": "Fill in larger areas with a fat-tipped marker. Once you have the outline in place, save yourself some time by using a marker with the large tip to fill it in. Use this size marker to cover a big area, as well. [13] X Research source You can fill in the lines with a different color, if you'd prefer, like a coloring book."

      "content": "Rub baby powder on the design. Sprinkle the baby powder all over the design until it's covered. Rub it in gently with the tips of your fingers. When you have it covered, gently shake and brush the excess powder off. [14] X Research source The baby powder helps set the design. You can even layer baby powder, then ink, then baby powder, then ink, over and over again to build up a solid tattoo."

      "content": "Draw the tattoo on with the eyeliner. Start by tracing the outline of the tattoo, so you know where the edges are. Use a fine tip for this part. Once the outline is in place, fill in the tattoo with the eyeliner, using a thicker tip if you have one.

The liquid bandage makes the tattoo waterproof."
