      "content": "The coquette aesthetic is a fashion trend characterized by romantic, ultra-feminine clothing. The definition of coquette, which is originally a French word, is a flirtatious woman who wants only to gain the attention and admiration of men. [1] X Research source The coquette style has moved beyond this misogynistic definition, however, to create a campy and feminine aesthetic that embraces all things romantic, girly, and hyper-feminine. [2] X Research source Common features of a coquette outfit include flirty and dainty elements like ruffles, bows, frills, lace, and satin. Floral patterns and light pastel colors are often featured—especially baby pink and blue. Much of coquette fashion calls back to youth and teenage girlhood, which followers of the trend see as an empowering way to highlight the things that make girlhood so special while also reclaiming the ways in which their girlhood was ridiculed or taken away from them. For example, being or dressing like a “girly girl” was a major insult for many who grew up in the 2000s and 2010s. Now, they see the coquette aesthetic as a way to play out some of those childhood dreams and fantasies in a playful and self-aware way without having to feel any guilt or shame."

In 2023 and 2024, the coquette trend became immensely popular, but prior to that, it had been gaining traction on Tumblr since the 2010s. [11] X Research source Originally, however, the Tumblr community connected this style to the term “nymphet”—a word used to describe a supposedly sexually precocious and attractive underage girl. [12] X Research source But the “nymphet” aesthetic—which is synonymous with Vladimir Nabakov’s Lolita —became problematic due to its connection to pedophilia and the sexualization of minors. Therefore, the name evolved to coquette in order to avoid the word “nymphet” being banned on social media sites. Plus, the coquette aesthetic has evolved to be much less explicit."

      "title": "Early inspirations for the coquette style include Vivienne Westwood and Lana Del Rey.",
      "content": "Early inspirations for the coquette style include Vivienne Westwood and Lana Del Rey. The aesthetic draws from fashion trends prominent in both pop culture and historical eras. Coquettish looks emulate the silhouettes and fabrics of the Victorian, Regency, and Rococo eras. It also draws inspiration from the novels of Jane Austen and the Brontë sisters, as well as the more modern Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov. [13] X Research source Two of the most revered examples of coquette fashion in the present day are musician Lana Del Ray’s personal aesthetic and Sofia Coppola’s costuming choices in her 2006 film Marie Antoinette . More recent films and television programs like Netflix’s Bridgerton and 2023’s Barbie have also been connected to the rise of the coquette aesthetic. [14] X Research source Predating these media references, however, renowned designer Vivienne Westwood showcased coquette looks inspired by late 19th-century French fashion in her Spring 1994 and Fall 1995 shows—titled “Cafe Society” and “Vive la Cocotte,” respectively.

      "title": "Controversy of coquette styles critiques the sexualization of youthful looks.",
      "content": "Controversy of coquette styles critiques the sexualization of youthful looks. Much of the inspiration for the coquette aesthetic comes from Lolita , Vladimir Nabakov’s 1955 novel, whose titular character is an underage girl in a sexual relationship with an adult man. Critics have drawn this connection and also highlighted the girlish and infantilizing looks associated with the trend as a glorification of sexualized innocence and youth. [16] X Research source More broadly, the coquette aesthetic is thought to reinforce damaging gender roles for women as hyper-feminine fashion tends to pander to the male gaze. [17] X Research source Another major controversy around the coquette aesthetic is its focus on outdated ideals of European femininity and beauty. As a result, most of the imagery around this style focuses on thin, white women and excludes diverse bodies and skin tones. However, defenders of the aesthetic argue that any person who wishes to dress in this aesthetic is not responsible for misogynistic or even pedophilic reactions to it. Similarly, most people believe that anyone can and should wear this aesthetic—regardless of gender, body type, and skin color. Additionally, they find the coquette aesthetic empowering as a way to reclaim their girlhood and challenge the male gaze, not to pander to it. [18] X Research source"

[20] X Research source Other sub-aesthetics of the coquette style popular on social media include: Dark Coquette : Similar to the femme fatale archetype with vampy cocktail dresses, fitted suits, fur coats, bows, and a red and black color palette. Dollette : Most representative of mainstream coquette fashion with pink hues, florals, and ballet-inspired elements. Gloomy Coquette : A darker version of Dollette that includes gothic imagery of angels, graveyards, and porcelain dolls. Farmer’s Daughter : A cottagecore variation that centers on a hyper-feminine and sexually precocious girl living in rural America. Key West Kitten : Inspired by Florida beach culture in the 1960s-1980s, with neon pinks and turquoise infused into summertime clothing. [21] X Research source Waif : A toxic and unhealthy spin on the Coquette aesthetic that references drug use, mental illness, extreme thinness, and a tortured imperfection. [22] X Research source Winter Fairy Coquette : Combines coquette with a “fairy grunge” aesthetic with ripped clothing, fur-inspired pieces, and a mostly white color palette. Bubblegum Coquette : Nostalgic looks of the late ‘90s to mid-2000s with adolescent imagery like lollipops, bows, butterflies, and all things pink. Coquette Academia : Combines coquette femininity with academic looks like tweed jackets, lace blouses, and corduroy pants. Trailer Park Princess : Inspired by lower-class, vintage Americana styles that often feature more racy and adult lingerie looks. Blokette : Combines traditionally masculine and feminine pieces like Adidas Sambas, ballet flats, athletic pants, sports jerseys, pleated skirts, and hair ribbons. Buckle Bunny : A cross between coquette and cowgirl aesthetics with Western-inspired wear in shades of pastel pink and creamy white. Keep in mind that many of these aesthetics aren’t just used for style purposes—they’re used as personal aesthetics on social media that may influence someone’s online persona, decor choices, music tastes, and more."
