Press 1 teaspoon (0.8 g) of fresh, chopped thyme and 1 tablespoon (2.6 g) of fresh, chopped basil into the flesh side of the fish only. If you don't have fresh herbs, add a sprinkling of dried herbs, such as 1 teaspoon (0.5 g) of basil or rosemary, 1 teaspoon (1 g) of thyme, or 1 teaspoon (0.6 g) of rosemary. Italian seasoning in similar measurements would also work."

      "content": "Prepare the redfish fillets by washing them and slitting the skin. Rinse the fish under cool, running water, and pat it dry. Moisture will make the skin steam instead of crisping up. Some chefs prefer to make a few cuts along the skin. Simply make shallow diagonal slices in the skin from top to bottom every 1 in (2.5 cm) or so to allow moisture through. [5] X Research source If you prefer, you can cook the fish without the skin."

Make sure the grill is very clean before you put the fish down, as it will stick if it's not. Rub oil across the grill to keep the fish from sticking. Use enough to coat the grate, but be careful not to burn your hands."
