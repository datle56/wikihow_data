      "content": "Give yourself time to grieve and work through your emotions. Don’t force yourself to move on if you don’t feel ready. It is perfectly fine to take your time and allow yourself to feel bad for a while. It may only take you a couple of weeks to feel better or you may need months or longer to work through your emotions. Don’t rush it! [1] X Research source The longer the relationship was, the longer it may take to work through your emotions. For example, you will likely recover from a 2-month relationship much more quickly than a 2-year relationship."

      "title": "Accept your feelings as a normal part of the process.",
      "content": "Accept your feelings as a normal part of the process. After a breakup, you will likely go through a gamut of emotions, such as sadness, anger, and anxiety. While it may seem like you will never feel better, these feelings are temporary and they will pass. Remind yourself of this any time you start to feel overwhelmed or hopeless. [2] X Research source Try saying or writing something like, “I am angry that my relationship ended, and that is totally normal. Everyone who has been through a breakup has experienced something similar. They survived and so will I.” Feeling unmoored and foggy-headed are natural and normal reactions to being apart from someone when you’re used to having them around all the time. It takes time for your brain to adjust to the absence of the other person."

      "title": "Acknowledge and react to your feelings.",
      "content": "Acknowledge and react to your feelings. Name the feeling, accept it, and let the feelings take over for a little while. Take a moment to say to yourself, “I feel sad right now,” and then allow yourself to feel sad. This is a great way to work through your feelings. Do what feels natural to you in these moments, such as crying, writing about how you feel, or talking about your feelings with someone you trust. [3] X Research source Try writing in a journal as a way to acknowledge and express your feelings. Spend 15 minutes or longer daily writing about your feelings. If you wish you could speak directly to your ex, then write them letter that you don’t send. Say everything you want to say to them, and then tear up the letter and throw it away. Keep in mind that even if you deny how you feel, you will still feel that way. It is better to acknowledge what you are feeling, and then let the feelings wash over you like a wave. This may be intense for a few minutes, but you will likely feel better afterwards."
