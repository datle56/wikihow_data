      "title": "Place a CO2 trap in your home.",
      "content": "Place a CO 2 trap in your home. Simply set the CO 2 trap down and turn it on. It emits a stream of CO 2 gas which attracts no-see-ums and other blood-sucking insects. When they get close to the trap, they are sucked in by a small but powerful vacuum nozzle. [1] X Research source Once the no-see-ums are in the trap, they get dehydrated and eventually die. Position the trap near your front door or somewhere else where no-see-ums are likely to get inside, such as a screened-in porch or mudroom. CO 2 traps can range in price from $40 to upwards of $300, which might make them prohibitively expensive."

      "content": "Trap stray no-see-ums with a mixture of vinegar and soap. Fill a small bowl with distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Then, squeeze in a few drops of liquid dish soap and set your trap in a spot where you notice no-see-ums. The midges are drawn to the vinegar but get stuck under the surface of the slippery soap, which kills them. [2] X Research source The dish soap reduces the surface tension of the vinegar, making it impossible for the no-see-ums to escape once they’re inside. This method can be a little smelly. Place your vinegar trap near an open window with good ventilation to help reduce odors."

      "content": "Use insecticides containing DEET or picaridin to blast bugs on sight. When you spot no-see-ums or their larvae, spray them with a powerful chemical insecticide. This can stop them in their tracks and kill them. [3] X Research source Don’t go hunting for no-see-ums, as it may be a lost cause. These critters are translucent and often no more than ⅛ inch (3 mm) long! Instead, wait for them to show up. Insecticides can provide a short-term fix by killing off adult flies, but they're not a permanent solution to more serious infestations."

No-see-ums are incredibly small and often get through standard mesh screening. Then, simply place the mesh screen over your home’s windows and doors. [5] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Find rolls of mesh screening at any hardware or home improvement store. Some stores even have ultra-fine screening called “No-See-Um Mesh.” Parker recommends treating mesh screens with a pesticide. This makes the screen a physical and chemical barrier, “so even if [no-see-ums] land on it and try and squeeze around it, they will not be successful.” [6] X Expert Source Chris Parker Founder, Parker Eco Pest Control Expert Interview. 18 February 2021. Just use an approved pesticide, like permethrin . [7] X Research source Inspect your screens regularly to ensure they’re free of holes and replace damaged sections as necessary.

      "content": "Leave your air conditioner on to lower the temperature and humidity. Set your thermostat to around 65–70 °F (18–21 °C) and let it run throughout the day. No-see-ums are attracted to warmth and moisture, so the cooler you keep it in your home, the less likely they are to come around. If blasting your air conditioner nonstop isn’t an option (for instance, if it’s winter), turn on your ceiling fans or place portable fans around your home. This circulates cool air and helps keep any stray no-see-ums from landing on you. [9] X Research source If you live in a hot, humid climate, run a dehumidifier in your home to help reduce the humidity levels."

No-see-ums have a hard time biting you through clothes, so wear pants and a long-sleeved shirt if you’re going to be outside to maximize your protection. Choose clothing in light colors, as no-see-ums are attracted to darker colors. [15] X Research source Throw on a hat or wear a mosquito head net to minimize bites around your face, head, and neck.

Many types of insects, including no-see-ums, gravitate towards light sources. Lights essentially act like homing beacons, signaling for bugs to come closer. [16] X Research source Not only will shutting your lights off make you less visible to no-see-ums, but it will also save you money on your monthly utility bill!

Depending on the extent of the problem, an exterminator may set traps, employ high-strength pesticide sprays, or even decide that a more intensive solution like fumigation is necessary. Because no-see-ums breed so quickly, pesticides can typically only limit the amount of bugs you see, rather than completely eradicating them. Focusing on prevention may be a more effective way to get rid of these pests, which we describe below.
