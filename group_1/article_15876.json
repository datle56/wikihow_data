      "content": "Watch ethical porn to test things out. Scope out different ethical porn sites—these are content platforms that produce adult content where the actors are treated and paid fairly. [3] X Research source Try subscribing to one channel or platform at a time, so you can save a little money in the long run. Aortafilms, Dreams of Spanking, and CHEEX are great sites to try out if you aren’t sure where to start. Watching porn ethically almost always involves paying for it—but this is a worthwhile investment since you’re giving money back to platforms that respect their content and treat their performers well. Did You Know? Pornhub is one of the biggest names in the adult entertainment industry known for its wealth of free content—but it isn’t the best platform to patronize. Over the years, Pornhub has gone under fire for inadvertently platforming unethical pornography, like sexual assault. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Open up a conversation about porn when you aren’t being intimate. Try to bring the topic up casually, like mentioning a video you watched or an article you skimmed. Use the conversation to gauge how your partner feels about watching porn together—do they seem down to give it a try, or not? Are there any reservations they have? Treat the conversation as an opportunity to have an open-minded and supportive chat about your sexual interests.

[7] X Research source It might help to make a list of “likes” and “dislikes” first. From there, see if any of your “likes” overlap."

Some people even like to play romantic music when enjoying pornography. Make sure that you have privacy by locking the door, closing the blinds, and double-checking to see if anyone else is home. You might also want to check your phone to see if there are any calls or texts you need to immediately attend to. Choose a suitable time to watch porn with your partner—nighttime is often ideal since there’s less of a chance that your friends will visit or that you’ll receive a call. It’s also a good idea to pick a time when your partner isn’t tired or stressed out."
