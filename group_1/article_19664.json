      "title": "Use ant bait.",
      "content": "Use ant bait. Commercial ant bait traps are one of the most effective ways to get rid of tiny ants. The ants are attracted to the bait and secrete pheromones that encourage more ants to eat the bait, which is laced with insecticide. They will then take the bait back to their colony, which should eliminate the infestation relatively quickly. [1] X Research source There are many different kinds of bait traps. For example, some are sugar-based, grease-based, and protein-based and are designed to target different types of ants. Consider getting one of each if you’re not sure which would work best. [2] X Research source If the ants aren’t taking the bait, try using a different type or relocating the bait to a more active area. When using bait, all other food competition must be removed from the area, so remove any food products or trash. [3] X Research source If you find specific entry points where small ants are coming into your home, focus your repellant and deterrent efforts on these areas. [4] X Research source That way, you reduce the chances of the ants reentering your home through these avenues. Spraying an insecticide is another option, but these are often harmful for humans, animals, and sometimes the environment. It may not be the best idea, especially if the little ants are indoors."

      "title": "Poison ants with boric acid.",
      "content": "Poison ants with boric acid. Boric acid , or Borax, is a cleaning chemical that is poisonous to ants but non-toxic to humans. Make a Borax bait by mixing one part corn syrup (or any sweet, sticky substance) with one part Borax. Spread the mixture on an index card and place the card in an area with a lot of ant activity. The little ants will bring the sweet, poisonous mixture back to their colony, and it will slowly eliminate the ants. [5] X Research source Consider setting this bait at night, as ants tend to hunt for food during the night hours. Alternatively, mix 1 part Borax with 3 parts powdered sugar and place the mixture in a small container (like a bottle cap, spoon, etc.). If you have children or pets who could get into the Borax, try mixing 1 cup (236 ml) of warm water, 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, and 3 tbsp (100 g) of Borax. Soak cotton balls in the mixture and set them out in shallow dishes near known ant entry points."

      "title": "Pour boiling water on ant hills.",
      "content": "Pour boiling water on ant hills. If you are able to follow an ant trail back to a nest or anthill, consider pouring salty boiling water down the hill opening. This will likely cause part of the colony to cave in and will kill a large number of ants. It may take many containers of water, however, and could damage the surrounding vegetation. [6] X Research source Because ant colonies are large and complex, this method likely won’t kill all of the ants. Be sure to treat every ant hole you see to eliminate as many as possible. Mixing dish soap with water and pouring it over the ant hills also works."

      "title": "Deter ants with vinegar.",
      "content": "Deter ants with vinegar. Distilled white vinegar is a cheap and effective way to kill and repel ants. Mix a 1:1 ratio of vinegar and water and use it to clean hard surfaces where the tiny ants like to travel, like floors and countertops. If you see any ants, spray the mixture on them and wipe them up with a paper towel. The vinegar smell should fade relatively quickly for humans, but the ants will still be able to smell it and stay away. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Dehydrate the ants with diatomaceous earth.",
      "content": "Dehydrate the ants with diatomaceous earth. Diatomaceous earth is a sharp, powdery substance made of the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of plankton. It sticks to ants’ bodies and dries them out by absorbing the oils in their exoskeletons. While wearing gloves, simply follow the instructions on the diatomaceous earth’s package to sprinkle it on the small ants and eliminate them. [8] X Research source Diatomaceous earth isn’t a poison, but it is an irritant. Avoid breathing it in or getting it on your skin. Diatomaceous earth also works well if ants are getting in your houseplants. Simply sprinkle a thin layer on top of the plant’s soil. Be careful not to get any on the plant itself, as it could dry out. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use natural and essential oils to repel ants. If you’re looking for a natural way to get rid of tiny ants, many oils have been found to deter them. In general, mix a few drops of an essential oil with 2 cups of water in a spray bottle. Then, spray the mixture around the windows and baseboards of your home, as well as any entry points you’ve noticed. Natural oils also work well to keep ants away from houseplants. Here are a few oils to try: [10] X Research source Peppermint oil Tea tree oil Lemon eucalyptus oil Cinnamon leaf essential oil Neem oil Some of these oils work best undiluted, so be sure to research how best to use the one you choose."

      "content": "Replace the soil in potted plants. If you’ve noticed ants in your houseplants, try replacing the old soil with a new potting mix. This will remove any ant trails or nests that may be in the soil and discourage more ants from coming to the area. Dispose of the old soil in a sealed bag so any ants inside cannot come back.

      "title": "Seal crevices and cracks that act as entry points.",
      "content": "Seal crevices and cracks that act as entry points. Look for any cracks and crevices around your home, including in the walls, floorboards, and windows, as these are common areas through which small ants can enter a home. Caulk any cracks you find and seal other possible entrances, like ripped window screens. Consider putting some sort of deterrent (like Borax or cinnamon) in the cracks before sealing them completely. [13] X Research source Latex caulks are not effective when trying to seal ant entryways because ants can break down these caulking treatments. Silicone caulks tend to be more durable and work better to keep ants out. If you see a trail of ants in your home, follow them to see where they are entering from."

      "title": "Eliminate ant trails with soapy water.",
      "content": "Eliminate ant trails with soapy water. Ants leave scented trails for other ants to follow, so it’s important to erase the scent as soon as possible. Create a solution of dish soap and water, then use a sponge to wipe away the trail and the surrounding area. That way, the ants will no longer have a trail to follow each other into your home. Another option is to use vinegar. Simply spray white vinegar over areas with a lot of ant activity and wipe down any surfaces where you have seen tiny ants before. Mixing glass cleaner with dish soap in a spray bottle also works."

      "content": "Keep your house clean. Because ants enter houses looking for food, it’s important to eliminate as many sources as possible by keeping your house clean. Ants love to feast on small food particles, so pay special attention to your kitchen. Wash your dishes regularly, and use bleach or vinegar to wipe down your sink, dishwasher, countertops, cabinets, refrigerator, and any other areas ants may frequent. Clean up any messes as soon as possible. [15] X Research source Sweep, mop, and vacuum regularly, as well, as there may be food particles on the floor. Pay special attention to any areas where food is eaten and around your sink and/or dishwasher.

      "content": "Store food in airtight containers. The ants probably entered your house looking for food, so it’s important to make sure they can’t access it. Store any open food in airtight containers so it’s impossible for the ants to get in, and avoid leaving food out in the open. Consider keeping sticky foods like honey, molasses, and syrups in the refrigerator so they don’t spill and attract more insects. [16] X Research source Consider keeping baking goods (sugar, flour, etc.) and cereals in airtight containers or bags."

Some ants tend to hide under debris, so if there’s a lot of vegetation or wood in your yard, they may get into your house or infest your yard or garden. Cut off any vines or vegetation that touches or leans toward your home’s exterior walls or windows, as the ants can crawl from the plants into your home. Pick up sticks and debris around your yard, as well, to discourage the ants from building colonies there. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a barrier around your house with coffee grounds or mint plants. Brewed coffee grounds have been known to deter ant activity, as they’re believed to hate the smell. Scatter coffee grounds around the foundation of your house, along the perimeter of your garden, and along any sites where you have noticed ant trails or a lot of ant activity. [19] X Research source Additionally, consider keeping mint or chili pepper plants around your house or garden, as these are known to keep intrusive ants at bay. [20] X Research source Sprinkling diatomaceous earth around the perimeter of your garden is another option. Commercial insecticides can also be used on the outside of your home, but bear in mind that insecticides are usually dangerous to humans, pets, and sometimes the environment."
