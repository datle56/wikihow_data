      "title": "Unlock the Tycoon glove in Slap Battles’ Normal mode.",
      "content": "Unlock the Tycoon glove in Slap Battles’ Normal mode. The Tycoon glove is a major prerequisite to getting Spoonful; to get it, you’ll need to survive for 10 minutes in Normal mode, and you can’t fall off the plate. After 10 minutes, you’ll see a pop-up notifying you that you’ve earned the Plate Master badge; after that, you can go back to the lobby to grab the Tycoon glove! [1] X Research source To get the Tycoon glove, you’ll also need at least 7 players in the arena with you. While this is easier to do on a private server, you can also use a public server if you don’t have 7 friends available to join."

      "title": "Equip the Tycoon glove and use it to summon the tycoon.",
      "content": "Equip the Tycoon glove and use it to summon the tycoon. With the glove equipped, use its unique ability. A semi-see-through green tycoon will appear; you can place it somewhere on the ground near you. If the image of the tycoon turns red, it can’t be placed—so find a safe spot that’ll work! A full tycoon (a conveyor belt creating blocks) will spawn once placed. [2] X Research source Doing this on a private server is best to ensure you won’t be disturbed. If you summon the tycoon in a private match, anyone can destroy it. Once a tycoon is destroyed, you’ll have to do everything over again."

      "title": "Earn 5,000 tycoon points to get a badge and the Spoonful glove.",
      "content": "Earn 5,000 tycoon points to get a badge and the Spoonful glove. You’ll see a counter on the right side of the newly-summoned tycoon. Get that counter to 5,000 by repeatedly clicking the bright green button on the left side of the tycoon; once you reach 5,000 tycoon points, you’ll earn the SLAP BATTLES SWEEP badge and accompanying Spoonful glove! [3] X Research source Maxing out the tycoon counter is super easy but time-consuming. To make it easier, you could use an auto-clicker to keep hitting the green button so you don’t have to. Each time you hit the green tycoon button, it’ll flash red. You can’t die during this process; if you do, you’ll have to redo everything to get the glove."

      "title": "Spoonful has a special ability called \"Comically Large Spoon\".",
      "content": "Spoonful has a special ability called \"Comically Large Spoon\". When triggered, it plays a sound clip that says, “Hey, dawg, can I get some ice cream?” Then, it shoots the user into the air, hovering, until pressing “E,” after which they get a comically large spoon. That’ll last for 5 seconds before both ability and spoon disappear. [4] X Research source If the user presses “E” while holding the spoon, the avatar will spin (with the spoon) for 1.5 seconds, then charge toward the crosshair that appears on the screen with a booming sound. The charge causes an area-of-effect explosion that deals around 60 knockback to other players based on their proximity to the explosion. However, keep in mind that you can’t control the direction of your avatar once you press “E.”"

      "title": "The Spoonful glove is effective for targeting other Slap Battles players.",
      "content": "The Spoonful glove is effective for targeting other Slap Battles players. When you use its special ability, decide who you want to hit first, then aim and carefully lock onto that player—but aim the crosshair (or cursor) slightly above or below them. That’ll help you hit them more accurately with the Spoonful’s explosion! [5] X Research source If you get cornered by other players, you can use the Comically Large Spoon ability to become invulnerable to attack briefly. You can also use Comically Large Spoon to fly to safety if you get slapped off the map."

    {
      "title": "Pros.",
      "content": "Pros. Generally, the Spoonful glove has decent power, speed, area-of-effect, and knockback levels. It’s great for traveling long distances quickly and targeting multiple players, and because it has such a fast speed, you can use it to surprise other players (and catch them off-guard at the start of a battle). You can even use its unique ability to survive being knocked off the map (or jumping). [6] X Research source When another player targets you, you can also use the Spoonful glove to avoid damage. You can hit difficult targets, including the Blocked, Shield, Extended, Elude, and buddies gloves, as well as players taking shelter on the Normal Mode plate. You can even escape Admin’s jail using the Comically Large Spoon ability or rush to the cube of death to get away from the bob glove!"

    {
      "title": "Cons.",
      "content": "Cons. Spoonful is a pretty good glove overall, but it has a few notable downsides (as with most gloves). For instance, targeting enemies with the glove’s crosshair isn’t always easy since it’s slightly offset (which is why we recommended aiming a bit above or below a target). Additionally, enemies can avoid the Spoonful glove’s charge if they’re fast and far away. [7] X Research source There’s a limit on how far Spoonful’s unique ability can take you—and it can’t go from specific locations to other ones (like Slapple Island to Cannon Island). The Spoonful glove’s ability won’t work on Baller, Replica, or Blink, and the Reverse and Pusher gloves can counter it. You can fly right into the void if you accidentally offshoot when aiming!"

      "title": "Jump onto the floating plate and stay there for the full time.",
      "content": "Jump onto the floating plate and stay there for the full time. In Normal Mode, there are a bunch of floating islands and a floating plate that circles the area. Instead of taking part in any battles (and potentially dying, forcing you to restart), you can just wait on a smaller island until the floating plate passes by, then jump onto it. Wait there for 10 minutes, and you’ll get the Tycoon glove! [8] X Research source While you’re on the plate, you can also watch the counter at the top of the screen. It needs to reach 600 to get the Plate Master badge (and Tycoon glove). Other players can still jump onto the plate and try to slap you, but it’s still a safer spot than most other arena areas. As long as the other players are busy fighting one another, you can wait out the 10 minutes fairly easily."
