      "title": "Measure the width of your window and bamboo shades.",
      "content": "Measure the width of your window and bamboo shades. Start the end of your tape measure at the top corner of the window and pull it across the width to find your measurement. Check the width in the middle and the bottom of your window in case it isn't perfectly square. Write down your measurements so you don't forget them later. [1] X Research source If you plan on hanging your blinds outside of the trim, be sure to measure from the outer edges of the trim rather than the size of the window."

      "title": "Determine how much of your blinds you need to cut off each side.",
      "content": "Determine how much of your blinds you need to cut off each side. Use your tape measure to find the width of your blinds so you know how much you need to trim. Look at the top bar of your blinds to see how much space there is between the ends and the mounting hardware. If you only need to make a minor adjustment, you can cut one side of the blinds, but if you need to remove more than 4–5 inches (10–13 cm), then cut a little bit off of each side. [2] X Research source For example, if your window is 36 inches (91 cm) wide and your blinds are 40 inches (100 cm) wide, then you can either trim 4 inches (10 cm) off of one side or you can remove 2 inches (5.1 cm) off of each side. Use bamboo blinds that are only slightly larger than your window since you can only remove about 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) total. Most bamboo blinds are asymmetrical, meaning the hardware is usually closer to one end than it is to the other."

      "title": "Draw lines on the backside of your blinds to mark your cuts.",
      "content": "Draw lines on the backside of your blinds to mark your cuts. Lay your blinds face down on a flat surface so you can draw on the back. Use your measuring tape to find the length you need to remove and mark it on your blinds. Measure the same distance from the edge in 2 more places to ensure you draw a straight line. Lay a straightedge so it lines up with your marks and use a pencil to draw your line. [3] X Research source Repeat the process on the other side of the blinds if you need to trim both ends."

    {
      "title": "Place painter's tape on the inside of each of your lines.",
      "content": "Place painter's tape on the inside of each of your lines. Painter's tape help holds the bamboo in place and prevents the edges from fraying once you cut them. Cut a piece of tape that's as long as the lines you drew and press it onto the bamboo. Make sure your tape is on the side of the line that you aren't removing or else the edges will fray. [4] X Research source If you can't accurately place a long strip of tape on the line, you can use multiple shorter strips."

      "title": "Flip the blinds over and put tape on the front side.",
      "content": "Flip the blinds over and put tape on the front side. Once you've taped the back side, turn over the blinds so they're face-up. Transfer your measurements onto the front side and draw a straight line on top of them. Place another strip of tape on the inside of the line so your blinds are protected while you cut them.

      "title": "Roll up your blinds so the ends of the bamboo are flush with one another.",
      "content": "Roll up your blinds so the ends of the bamboo are flush with one another. Start from one end of the blinds and slowly roll them up. Keep the roll as tight as you can so the bamboo pieces don't move around. Once the blinds are rolled up, tap on the ends so they're flat. Secure the roll by wrapping pieces of tape around the middle of the roll. [6] X Research source Don't carry your blinds vertically since the bamboo pieces in the middle of the roll may come loose."

      "title": "Cut along your line with a miter saw.",
      "content": "Cut along your line with a miter saw. Wear safety glasses whenever you work with your saw so you don't injure yourself. Position the blinds underneath the saw blade so it lines up with the outside edge of your tape, and hold it in place with your nondominant hand. Pull the saw handle down slowly and cut through your blinds. Once the first cut is finished, lift the handle of the saw back up to stop it. Make cuts on the other side of the roll if you need to. [7] X Research source You can use a manual hacksaw if you want, but your cut may be crooked or jagged."

      "content": "Lay your blinds flat and mark the length you need on the back side. Unroll your blinds and spread them out on a flat surface so they're face down. Measure down from the top of the blinds to the same length as your window. Add 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) to the end of your measurement so your blinds have a slight overhang. Draw a mark on each end of your blinds at your measurement with a pencil. [9] X Research source If your measurement ends between 2 pieces of bamboo, choose one of them to draw your mark on."

      "content": "Cut the main pull strings at the mark you just made. The pull strings are the thick cords that pull your blinds up when you retract them. Find where your mark intersects with the pull strings and cut through them with a pair of scissors. Make your cut straight through the strings rather than at an angle so the ends don't fray. [10] X Research source The back of your blinds may have multiple pull strings so be sure to cut through each of them."

      "title": "Tie the pull strings to the ring directly above them.",
      "content": "Tie the pull strings to the ring directly above them. The pull strings feed through small metal or wood rings along the back of the blinds. Find the ring that's the closest to your cut and feed the ends of the pull string through it. Use 2 overhand knots to secure the pull strings to the ring so they'll pull up the new bottom of your blinds. [11] X Research source Repeat the process if you have multiple pull strings on the back of your blinds."

The bamboo pieces in your blinds are held together by small strings that run from the top to the bottom. Warm up a glue gun so you can easily apply hot glue to the strings. Start 1 inch (2.5 cm) lower than your mark and place a dot of glue on each of the small strings. Work across the row of strings until all of them are glued in place. [12] X Research source If you don't glue the strings down, then the pieces of your blinds will fall apart."

Position your scissors in the gap between the bamboo pieces so you can cut across the blinds. Cut across the width of the blinds until you can remove the bottom piece. [13] X Research source"

Take the bottom 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the blinds and fold it onto the backside. Place a line of hot glue across the width of the blinds and press the folded over section in place so it adheres. Keep applying pressure for 10 seconds so the glue has time to dry. [14] X Research source Make sure you fold the piece onto the back side of the blinds or else it will be visible."
