      "content": "Pick a dress that is appropriate for your school. Most schools have some sort of dress code that will dictate how revealing your prom dress can be. Check the dress code restrictions about acceptable hemlines, necklines, cutaways, and slits. Most prom dresses are long formal gowns, but some may have long slits up the leg. Check your school's prom handbook to determine if a gown with a long slit is allowed. Prom is a great chance to express your style, but don't feel pressured to be overtly sexy or show off too much skin. Remember, you still want to look like yourself. [1] X Research source Katie Quinn.

Use some of these suggestions as a starting point for colors based on skin tone: Warm : If you have skin with a greenish, yellow, or olive undertone with hair that ranges from dark blonde to dark brown, try oranges, reds, yellows, warm greens, deep blues, and red-purples. Avoid icy colors and jewel tones. Cool : For very fair to very dark skin with a bluish undertone and very light to very dark hair, pick bright blues, jewel tones, purples, and bright pinks. Avoid oranges and yellows. Neutral : If you can't tell if you have a warm or cool undertone and you have hazel eyes, try neutral colors like pinks, peaches, jade, and pale blue. Avoid bright colors, reds, and bold yellows."

      "content": "Rent a tuxedo or get a suit jacket. Prom is a semi-formal event, so you'll either need a tuxedo jacket or a suit jacket that can mimic the tuxedo look. An actual tuxedo jacket will make you look sharper, but suit jackets are the cheaper option. If you do go with a tuxedo, rent instead of buy. Tuxedos are expensive, and since you're still growing, you'll probably only wear this piece once. The jacket should either have a peaked lapel or a shawl collar. The lapels can either be faced in satin or in the same fabric as the rest of the jacket."

If you're unsure, try on both to see which you prefer. You'll also need to decide if you want the standard collar that lays down or if you want a fancier collar that's wing-tipped. [3] X Research source If you don't want a traditional look, choose a shirt color that compliments the color of your date's outfit instead of white. Remember to take cuff style into consideration.

Keep in mind that you may be pinning a corsage onto your dress or wearing it on your wrist. A statement necklace looks great with dresses with a more open neckline, especially if you wear your hair pulled back. [5] X Research source Katie Quinn. Stylist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020.
