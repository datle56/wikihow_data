      "content": "Get a diagnosis before anything else. It is really important to know what is causing your pain. See a doctor before you start doing any exercises or taking any medication. There are many reasons your hip could be in pain, including arthritis, back injuries, foot problems, bursitis , or an injury you've got while playing a sport. Always ask your doctor what you should and should not be doing, given the cause of your hip pain. [1] X Research source If your doctor suspects there is a medical reason for your hip pain, they may request x-rays, possibly followed by an MRI or CT scan."

      "title": "Take pain-relieving medicine.",
      "content": "Take pain-relieving medicine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are best when soothing hip pain (which is most often caused by inflammation of the joints.) Ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin will both reduce inflammation and alleviate the pain for several hours. NSAIDS block the enzymes that create the chemicals that cause inflammation in the body. [2] X Research source If over-the-counter drugs like aspirin don’t seem to be having much of an effect, see your doctor. He or she may prescribe a more powerful pain-relieving medication. You should also always consult your doctor before introducing a new medicine (even one as common as aspirin) into your daily life."

Consider taking a hot bath or shower, or soak in a hot tub if there is one available to you. You could also consider purchasing a hot pad that you can place directly on your hip.

Instead, grab an ice pack, a bowl of popcorn and watch some movies. You should give your hip a rest for at least 24 to 48 hours.

      "content": "Avoid high-impact activities. If you are in severe pain, chances are you won’t feel like running or jumping anyway, but it is good to keep in mind that these activities should be avoided. High-impact activities will cause your joints to become more inflamed, thus causing your more pain. Instead of running, try taking a brisk walk, as walking has much less of an impact on your joints.

      "content": "Choose the right shoes. You should buy shoes that give you as much support as possible. Look for shoes that have great cushions, or have removable insoles so that you can add orthopedics. The sole should have good shock absorption, should limit pronation (turning or rotating the foot) and will evenly distribute pressure along the length of your foot. If you need corrective shoes, you can get these from specialty shoe shops or a from a podiatrist."

Stretching can help ease hip pain, while also strengthening your hip muscles so that you can avoid future pain.

Keep your other leg straight and on the ground with your toes pointing up. Rotate your bent leg out and away from your body. Do not push your leg any further than is comfortable, and if really begins to hurt, stop stretching it. Hold the stretch for five seconds and then bring your leg back so that your foot is flat on the ground again. Repeat this 10-15 times on each side. Hip flexion stretch: Lie flat on your back. Choose the leg you want to work on and then bend it so that your foot is flat on the ground. Wrap your arms around your bent leg, holding on to the shin area, and pull your leg towards your chest. Only go as far as your body will allow--if it begins to hurt, release your leg. Hold your leg against your chest for five seconds and then release. Repeat this process 10 to 15 times on both sides. Glute squeezes: Roll a towel into a tight cylinder. Lie on your back with both of your legs bent so that your feet are flat on the ground. Place the towel between your knees. Squeeze your knees together so that you are engaging your buttocks and inner thighs. Hold the squeeze for three to five seconds and then release. Repeat this 10 to 15 times."
