      "content": "Go to the website you want to clone in Google Chrome . If you'd rather copy a website's code without downloading the entire website and its subfolders, you can do so easily in the Google Chrome web browser. This method is great if you're familiar with HTML and CSS and only care about the code—not archiving all of a website's content. You can copy a site's HTML and linked CSS files and create local copies of them on your computer, but you may need to modify the code slightly to fix any broken references. While you won't want to replicate another designer's website exactly for legal reasons, it doesn't hurt to adapt existing HTML and CSS from another site and work it into your own code."

Copying that code is easy: Click the three dots at the top-right and select Open file . Look for files that end with .css, such as styles.css or default.css—the index page you copied relies on code in those CSS files for layout and style. Select a file, then copy and paste it into a new text file on your computer. Be sure to give it the same name as it appears on the live website so the index page you downloaded knows how to reference the file. Additionally, note the directory the CSS files are in—if you want to be able to view the website exactly as it appears online, you'll need to mimic the file structure of the remote site or modify the HTML code so the site knows how to reference the CSS file."
