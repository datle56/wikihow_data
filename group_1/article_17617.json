      "title": "Make sure your formula is formatted correctly.",
      "content": "Make sure your formula is formatted correctly. Excel won't consider your syntax a formula unless it starts with an equal sign (=). For example, if you have \"A2 + B2,\" you need to write \"=A2 + B2\" for Excel to treat it as a formula. You also must use the asterisk (*) to multiply. If you use the X key on your keyboard, the formula will not calculate. Your formula will not calculate if your sheet name (if more than the default \"D3\") is not in single quotation marks ('). For example, if your cell references your third worksheet, you need to write \" ='Example Sheet'D3! \" If you're referring to a workbook outside of your current file, make sure it is formatted correctly. The outside file name must be surrounded by brackets ([]) followed by the worksheet name and cell range. For example, you'd enter \" =[Example Workbook.xlsx]Example Sheet!A1:A8 .\""

      "title": "Check your parentheses and quotation marks.",
      "content": "Check your parentheses and quotation marks. For Excel to correctly use your formula, it needs to have an equal amount of open and closed parentheses and quotation marks. For example, if you have \"=IF(B5<0),\"Not valid\",B5*1.05),\" you need to change it to \"=IF(B5<0,\"Not valid\",B5*1.05)\" so you have the same amount of open and closed parentheses. For quotation marks, you want to surround any text you want to stay text in your formula. For example, if you input \" =\"Today is \" & TEXT(TODAY(),\"dddd, mmmm dd\") \", you'll get \"Today is Thursday, January 9.\""

      "title": "Fix incorrect values.",
      "content": "Fix incorrect values. You'll need to change certain values in your formula according to the error to fix the issue. Some examples: If you see the pound sign (#) in the error, you might have an incorrect value. For example, \"#VALUE!\" indicates incorrect formatting or unsupported data types in arguments. If you see \"#REF!\", the formula refers to cells you entered that have been deleted or replaced with other data. If you're dividing by 0, you might get the \"#DIV!/0!\" error. Your calculation could result in a no-value or you need to change some values."

If you have a dollar amount in a cell, you shouldn't use the dollar sign ($) since it stands for a function instead of being a dollar sign symbol.
