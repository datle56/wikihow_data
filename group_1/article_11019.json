      "content": "Maintain good oral hygiene to keep your mouth and lips healthy. To keep your mouth healthy, brush your teeth at least 2 times daily, once after breakfast and once before bed. Also floss your teeth daily. Avoid using alcohol-based mouthwash after you brush your teeth. Although some people believe that mouthwash keeps their mouth cleaner, it really just dries out the mouth and lips. This can cause your cheilitis to become more severe.

Twice each day, dip 1 finger into a jar of petroleum jelly and spread a generous layer of the jelly across both of you lips. Make sure to smear some of the jelly across the corners of your mouth, as well. The jelly will keep moisture from evaporating from your lips and can help the chapped portions of your lips heal more quickly.

      "content": "Stop licking the corners of your lips if you’re in the habit. Some people tend to poke their tongues into the corners of their lips several times an hour. While doing this may feel good, it’s not helping your lips! Licking your lips too much can actually dry them out, since the saliva takes additional lip moisture with it when it evaporates. In many cases, stopping licking your lips will allow the corners of your mouth to heal and the cheilitis will clear up.

If your child has a case of angular cheilitis, and you notice that they often suck their thumbs, ask them to stop."

      "content": "See a doctor if your cheilitis lasts longer than 1 month. If you’ve been applying petroleum jelly for 1 month and you still have a case of angular cheilitis, it’s time to visit your doctor. Let them inspect the corners of your mouth, and describe your symptoms to the doctor. In some cases, you doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, since cheilitis is technically a skin condition. [7] X Research source Typical symptoms of angular cheilitis include dry, chapped red spots at the corners of your lips (typically accompanied by swelling and cracking) and pain at the corners of your mouth. [8] X Research source In some relatively uncommon situations, angular cheilitis is caused by dermatitis, a skin condition that causes red, itchy patches to appear on your body (typically the scalp)."

In instances where elderly people contract a case of angular cheilitis, poorly fitting dentures are often the cause. If you wear dentures and experience swelling or discomfort around the corners of your mouth, visit your dentist or dentures specialist. They should be able to make a few alterations to the dentures so they fit your mouth better, and the cheilitis should clear up. [9] X Research source The doctor may suspect that your dentures are infected, and that the infection is causing your case of cheilitis. In this case, they’ll swab the dentures and test them for bacteria."

      "content": "Apply an antibacterial cream if you have a bacterial infection. Many cases of angular cheilitis are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria that commonly causes skin problems. If your doctor identifies this as the cause of your cheilitis, they’ll likely recommend that you apply an antibacterial cream that contains active ingredients mupirocin or fusidic acid. Apply a pea-sized dollop of the cream once daily to both sides of your mouth. [10] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source If an over-the-counter (OTC) antibacterial cream doesn’t get rid of your case of cheilitis, your doctor can write you a prescription for a much stronger cream."

If your doctor identifies the underlying cause of your angular cheilitis as a fungal infection , they’ll recommend that you use an antifungal cream to treat the problem. Visit your local pharmacy or drugstore and purchase an antifungal cream. Apply it generously to the corners of your mouth once daily, or as directed on the medication’s packaging. [11] X Research source One of the most commonly used antifungal creams is called ketoconazole. Continue to apply the medicated antifungal cream until the cheilitis clears up. In many cases, angular cheilitis is caused by a fungus called Candida albicans .

To prevent anemia—and to help keep your immune system strong—make sure that you’re consuming plenty of iron each day. Make sure to speak with your doctor before starting to take an iron supplement. Then, you can purchase an iron supplement at your local pharmacy. Take it once daily, or as directed on the packaging. [14] X Research source Foods that are rich in iron include red meat, leafy greens, spinach, broccoli, oysters, quinoa, dark chocolate, and lentils. Adult men should consume at least 8–11 mg of iron each day. Women generally need more, so adult women should take between 15–18 mg of iron daily.

If your case of angular cheilitis is caused by a fungus or bacteria, your body’s immune system plays a crucial role in getting rid of the condition. Zinc and B vitamins are great for your immune system and can help your body cure a case of cheilitis. Talk with a doctor before taking vitamin and mineral supplements. Purchase daily supplements at a health food store and take them as directed on the packaging. Or, eat foods rich in zinc and B vitamins to consume them more naturally. [17] X Research source Adults need to consume between 8–11 mg of zinc each day. Zinc naturally occurs in foods like whole grains, red meat, eggs, dairy products, and seeds. If you’re over 18, take at least 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B daily. [18] X Research source B vitamins occur naturally in many of the same foods as zinc does.

This is especially the case if your angular cheilitis is caused by a fungus like Candida yeast. The yeast feeds off of sugar, so if your lips are often covered in sugar, the cheilitis will probably get much worse.
