[2] X Research source Make sure that you use a different, clean towel for this, so you don’t end up spreading the jock itch to other parts of your body. [3] X Research source Jock itch can spread easily if it touches your skin, which is why it’s important to take extra precautions. Try to clean and dry the affected area at least once a day, or whenever it gets sweaty or wet (like after a tough workout or swim). [4] X Research source Always treat your jock itch as soon as possible. When left untreated, it can linger for weeks (and even months).

Apply a zinc-based barrier cream to the affected skin, like Desitin or Butt Paste —this helps keep the rash from getting moist. If you’re really struggling to keep the skin dry, plug in a hair dryer and set it to the lowest possible heat level. Hovering the dryer a few inches or centimeters away from your skin, blow over the surface until it’s completely dry. [14] X Research source Talcum powder can also help your skin stay dry.

Steer clear of heating pads, as these won’t help with the itching at all. A cool, damp rag or a towel-wrapped ice pack draped over your skin may provide some relief.
