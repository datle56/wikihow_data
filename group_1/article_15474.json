      "content": "Twist the crawfish’s head to separate it from the tail. Pinch the base of the crawfish’s head between two fingers with one hand, and hold the tail with your other. Give the head a twist until it cracks and comes off of the tail. [1] X Research source Choose a crawfish with a big tail since that’s where you’ll find most of the meat."

      "title": "Suck the juices from the base of the head if you want extra flavor.",
      "content": "Suck the juices from the base of the head if you want extra flavor. The head has a really flavorful yellow liquid sometimes called “crawfish butter” that oozes out as soon as you remove the tail. [2] X Research source Place the open part of the head between your lips and suck out all the juices. Tip the shell up to ensure you get every last drop. [3] X Research source Save the head until after you take a bite of the tail meat so you’re able to experience all the flavors at once."

      "content": "Press on the back of the tail’s shell to crack it open. Pinch the shell covering the base of the tail between your fingers. Push the tail fins up, going against the tail’s natural curl, until you hear the shell crack. Remove the shell and discard it. [4] X Research source Keep a trash bag nearby to throw away all the shells as you peel the crawfish."

      "title": "Pull out the middle tail fin to devein the crawfish.",
      "content": "Pull out the middle tail fin to devein the crawfish. Pinch the middle fin at the end of the crawfish’s tail. Slowly pull the fin straight out to remove the crawfish’s vein (digestive tract) from the tail. Immediately throw the vein away. [5] X Research source Sometimes, the crawfish’s vein comes off with the shell. If you pull on the tail fin and nothing comes out from the meat, then the vein is already gone. The vein contains all of the crawfish’s waste, so it has an unpleasant flavor and could contain bacteria."

      "title": "Pull or suck the meat out from the tail.",
      "content": "Pull or suck the meat out from the tail. The tail meat is the most substantial part of the crawfish, and you can eat it right away. Either pull the meat out from the tail, or put your mouth up to the tail to suck out the meat. Try dipping the meat in butter for an even richer flavor. [6] X Research source If you’d rather use the tails in another dish, make a crawfish etouffee. Make rice in one pot and combine onions, garlic, flour, tomato sauce, water, and the crawfish in a skillet. Reduce etouffee to a simmer and serve it over the rice. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Snap the crawfish’s claws apart if you don’t want to waste any meat. Hold the larger part of the claw with one hand. Use your other hand to bend the smaller pincher claw back and forth until it snaps off. Slowly pull the pincher and meat out from the claw. There may not be a lot of meat on the claw, but you’ll still get some if you bite down and scrape it off with your teeth. [8] X Research source If no meat comes out with the pincher, put your mouth against the opening on the claw and suck the meat and juices out."

Set out your outdoor burner and attach its hose to a propane tank valve. Place a large pot on top of the burner so you have a spot to boil your crawfish . [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Get 1 lb (0.45 kg) of crawfish per person. Invite your friends and family to your crawfish boil and take a headcount. If you’re having a really large party, you’re probably safe getting anywhere between 20–30 pounds (9.1–13.6 kg) of crawfish. It may sound like a lot per person, but most of the weight comes from the crawfish shells that get thrown away. [10] X Research source If you're in the Southern US, crawfish is seasonally available in seafood and grocery stores, in addition to crawfish trucks. Check with your local fishmonger to see what they have available since they may have locally harvested crawfish. Many crawfish catchers take online orders for live crawfish. Keep live crawfish in a cooler away from light or heat until you’re ready to boil them."

[11] X Research source Use a wooden paddle or spoon to stir the crawfish around for a few minutes. Empty the water and rinse them again with clean water. Keep cycling through the water until it runs clear, and then transfer the crawfish to another clean container. This process is also called purging the crawfish . Some people add salt to the water to help purge the crawfish, but there’s no added benefit to it. If any dead crawfish float to the top, throw them away since eating them could make you sick."

When it comes to a rolling boil, cut 8 lemons in half and squeeze the juice into the water. Toss in the lemon peels and pour in 1 pound (0.45 kg) of crawfish boil seasoning to help flavor the broth.

Throw the ingredients into a large wire basket that fits inside the pot. Lower the veggies into the water and let it return to a boil. [13] X Research source The veggies will absorb the flavors from the crawfish and seasonings so you have flavorful sides with your meal. Experiment with whatever vegetables you want to add to your crawfish boil. Mushrooms and green beans make excellent choices, but feel free to toss your favorites into the basket."

Let the water come back to a rolling boil for 5 more minutes. When the crawfish turn red and the tails curl up, turn the burner off and cover the pot. Allow the crawfish to sit and cook for another 30–45 minutes so the flavors can absorb even longer."

Allow your guests to sit at the table and eat right there, or hand out paper plates for everyone to use. [14] X Research source Provide extra crawfish seasoning, melted butter, and other condiments for your guests. If you would rather not serve the boil in the traditional Cajun style, pour the vegetables and crawfish into a large dish or use tongs to grab them right out of the wire basket."
