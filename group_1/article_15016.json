      "content": "Spot-treat minor stains to remove them. Ali says, “If the garment itself is fairly clean but there’s a small spot or stain, try to treat the stain itself. If you’re using a stain remover, read the label to be sure it can be used on that type of fabric. For very delicate fabrics, you may be able to remove the stain by dabbing hot water onto the stain, then rubbing the stain out. Just be careful not to damage the fabric.” [1] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Ali adds, “In many cases, friction is enough to get out most of a stain. If the stain is hard-set, try rubbing it with your fingernail or the back of a bobby pin.” [2] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Only use stain remover directly on the stain. If you soak the entire garment in stain remover, you could damage its shape and fibers. Don't use stain remover on suede, leather, or fur."

      "content": "Use a clothing steamer to refresh “dry clean only” clothing. Clothing steamers do more than just get wrinkles out of clothes—the high heat of the steam can actually help kill bacteria on clothes, too. And because it’s so gentle, steaming your clothes is a great option to refresh delicate “dry clean only” fabrics. [3] X Research source To use a clothing steamer , hang up the garment and pull down on the bottom hem while you run the steamer over the fabric from top to bottom. Be sure to carefully follow the operating instructions for your steamer—typically, you’ll need to wait at least 60 seconds for the steamer to heat up before you use it. Also, use purified or distilled water to avoid minerals that can damage the steamer or your clothes. Do not use a steamer on suede, leather, or waxed materials. While you can put the steamer nozzle directly on fabrics like cotton or wool, you should hold it at least 1 in (2.5 cm) from delicate fabrics like silk."

      "content": "Spritz clothes with vodka to kill odors without dry cleaning. If your “dry clean only” clothes are starting to smell a bit musty but you’re not quite ready for a trip to the dry cleaner, try spraying them with unflavored vodka—yes, really! Pour the vodka into a mist bottle —preferably one with a fine mist if you’re treating delicate fabrics—then lightly spritz it onto the garment. [4] X Research source The vodka’s high alcohol content will kill any odor-causing bacteria, and because it evaporates quickly, it won’t damage the fabric. If the garment smells like body odor, focus on the areas where it directly contacts the skin—like the inner lining or around the armpits. Avoid isopropyl alcohol or flavored spirits—these can discolor the fabric. If you don’t want to spray the clothes, sometimes you can remove odors by hanging them in a well-ventilated space to air out."

      "content": "Use a dry cleaning kit to clean several items at once. Purchase an at-home dry cleaning kit , then follow the packaging instructions carefully. There are two kinds of at-home dry cleaning kits—some come with a garment bag that you put the clothing into, and others come with a sheet that you put directly into your dryer with the clothing. When you’re dry cleaning clothes at home , don’t overcrowd the garment bag or dryer—for the best results, you’ll typically clean 3–5 items at a time. Remove the clothing from the garment bag or dryer as soon as the timer goes off to prevent wrinkles. Home dry cleaning works best on items that are only lightly soiled. A stain or two is ok, but if the item is covered in mud or another substance, it's probably better to have it professionally cleaned."

      "content": "Use cold water and a delicate cycle if you use the washing machine. Ali says, “If the care label indicates that dry cleaning is only recommended, you can often wash an item in your washing machine. If you do that, use a delicate cycle and cold or lukewarm water—never hot. And turn the garment inside-out so friction won’t affect the surface of the garment.” [5] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Ali adds, “It’s best to air dry the garment. If you do put it into the dryer, use no or low heat, and check it every 5–10 minutes to make sure it isn’t shrinking or fading.” [6] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Putting delicate garments in a mesh laundry bag may help reduce friction in the washing machine. [7] X Research source Ali cautions: “Washing your clothes at home will damage them over time. If it’s a garment you really care about or something that was really expensive, dry cleaning will help it last longer.” [8] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020."

      "content": "Try at-home methods on simple fabrics like cotton, wool, and rayon. Ali advises, “Before you try to clean a dry-clean-only garment, read the care label to see why it’s labelled that way. If it needs to be dry cleaned because the color will bleed or the item will shrink, try spot-cleaning the item, but don’t put it in the washing machine.” [9] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Clothes made from wool, cotton, polyester, and rayon are often marked \"dry clean only\" because they’re delicate, but you can usually wash them in cold water in your washing machine with no problem. Use spot cleaning, at-home dry cleaning kits, or professional cleaning for delicate materials like linen, silk, and wool, as well as structured garments or clothing with intricate embroidery or beading."

      "content": "Have delicate items and specialty fabrics professionally cleaned. Garments made of silk, leather, suede, velvet, fur, or waxed fabrics need special cleaning techniques that are best left to professionals. It’s also a good idea to have items professionally cleaned if they have delicate beading or embroidery. Other items to have professionally cleaned include: Highly-structured garments like suit jackets. If you try to clean these at home, they will likely lose their shape. Special or valuable items like formal gowns, wedding dresses, and antique or vintage clothing. Garments that bleed dye when you wash them. Having them professionally cleaned can help preserve their color. Heavily soiled items. While you can remove small stains at home, if a “dry clean only” item is heavily soiled, having it professionally cleaned may be the only way to restore it."

      "content": "Dry cleaners wash clothes in solvent instead of water. Ali says, “The reason dry cleaning is called dry cleaning is because there’s no water used. Dry cleaners use a hydrocarbon solvent for cleaning. And because there’s no water being used, the integrity of the fibers is retained.” [13] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Dry cleaners do sometimes wash clothes instead of dry cleaning. They’ll evaluate each garment to see the safest and most effective method of cleaning it.

Some clothing manufacturers label garments as “dry clean only” to indicate that they’re delicate and need to be washed carefully. Since many people won’t take the time to hand-wash these garments or wash them separately in a delicate cycle, it’s easier to label them for dry cleaning to ensure they don’t get damaged in a normal wash. Fabrics like wool, rayon, and cotton can often be washed in cold water without being damaged."
