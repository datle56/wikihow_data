Greater than or equal to is a logical operator, which means the only result it can give is \"true\" or \"false\" depending on if the formula, once filled in with your cell references, is true or not. [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source In the example above, if A1's value was 6,000, the statement AD>=5000 would be TRUE. If A1's value was 5,000, the statement would also be TRUE. The statement would only be FALSE if A1's value was any number less than 5,000."

While you can use logical operators with textual-based data, it may not work as expected. If you're using textual data instead of numerical, try switching to numbers. Otherwise, you may need to use a different function."
