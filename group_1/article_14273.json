Pull the tape measure down to where you want the ends of the window scarf to hang and write down the number. [1] X Research source You could make your window scarf reach down to the bottom of the window only, all the way to the floor for a more dramatic effect, or somewhere in between."

      "title": "Measure across the window and double the number.",
      "content": "Measure across the window and double the number. Stretch your tape measure across the window from frame to frame. Double the number to allow for enough fabric to create a draping effect with your window scarf and write down the number. [2] X Research source If the window is 60 in (150 cm) wide, then your 2nd measurement will be 120 in (300 cm)."

      "content": "Add the measurements together to determine the length of fabric to purchase. Add the first number you got for the length of the window scarf to the second number you got that was twice the width of the window. This will tell you how long a piece of fabric you need to create your window scarf. [3] X Research source For example, if you want the window scarf to hang down 30 in (76 cm) on each side, and the window is 60 in (150 cm) wide, then you should buy 180 in (460 cm) of fabric. 22 in (56 cm) is a good width for a curtain scarf, but it is completely up to you and the look you are going for."

    {
      "title": "Hook the scarf over the ends of the curtain rod on each side.",
      "content": "Hook the scarf over the ends of the curtain rod on each side. Let the middle of the curtain scarf hang down in a “U” shape in the middle of the curtain rod and window. Make sure each side has an even amount of fabric and let the ends flow majestically down. [4] X Research source Try folding your fabric in half before you drape it and mark the middle with a clothespin to make it easier to find the center of the curtain scarf when you hang it. You can pin the curtain scarf together in the corners where the front part overlaps with the sides hanging down behind the curtain rod to secure the window scarf in place."

      "title": "Loop the scarf around the middle of the rod for an extra decorative touch.",
      "content": "Loop the scarf around the middle of the rod for an extra decorative touch. Thread the fabric underneath and behind the curtain rod in the middle, then back up over the top to create a wavy drape in the middle. Hook the scarf on each end of the curtain rod and let the sides hang down evenly. [5] X Research source You can pin the window scarf together on the parts in the middle where it overlaps to keep the shape you created in place."

      "content": "Install scarf hooks at both corners of the top of the window. Measure 3 in (7.6 cm) past the corners of the window frame and make a mark with a pencil. Hold the hooks in place over your mark and mark where the holes will go, then place a screw in 1 hole and screw it in with a drill. Repeat this for each hole, making sure the holes are lined up over your marks, to secure the hooks in place. Installing the hooks 3 in (7.6 cm) past the corners of the window frame will allow the scarf to drape down over the sides of the window."

Measure across the window with a tape measure from 1 side of the frame to the other and make a mark with a pencil right in the middle. Hold a scarf hook over the mark you made and mark where the holes will go, then screw it into place as you did with the corner hooks. You could install more than 1 hook above the middle of the window frame if you want to create more drapes in the window scarf. It is completely up to you and the style you want to end up with."

If you want the window scarf to reach down 30 in (76 cm) from the top of the window on each side, and the window is 60 in (150 cm) from corner hook to corner hook, then get a window scarf that is 180 in (460 cm) long. Use fabric that is at least 22 in (56 cm) for a curtain scarf to create wide enough drapes."

Then hook the fabric over the 2 hooks in the corners and let the sides dangle down. If you have more than 1 hook in the middle, always start with hanging the center of the fabric over the center hook first so that each side is even. You can knot the window scarf around the corner hooks to secure it in place."

Drape another scarf as you normally would from hook to hook, or wrapped around a curtain rod in front of the shorter scarf, to create a layered look. Play with different fabrics to get the look you want. Try a delicate fabric of a lighter color in the back, and a heavier, darker fabric for the front scarf."

For example, you could use gold ropes to tie a dark blue or purple window scarf, or layer a floral-patterned scarf behind a solid white scarf."
