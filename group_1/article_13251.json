      "title": "Consider oral dissolution therapy.",
      "content": "Consider oral dissolution therapy. Your doctor may prescribe a course of ursodiol to dissolve your gallstones without surgery. These treatments are essentially bile acids in pill form. Ursodiol, in particular, is a popular treatment because it is one of the safest common drugs available. Oral dissolution therapy is most likely to be successful in treating small stones (less than 1.5 centimeters in diameter) with high cholesterol content. About 30 percent of gallbladder patients are candidates for this treatment. If you are suffering from pigment stones, you will likely need to pursue other treatment. Oral dissolution therapy is usually minimally successful and used only if the patient cannot undergo surgery.

      "content": "Pursue shock wave therapy. This therapy is often used in combination with oral dissolution therapy, although laparoscopic surgery is now so readily available that shock wave therapy is rarely performed today. This therapy, also called lithotripsy, uses sound waves to break gallstones into more easily dissolvable pieces.

      "content": "Understand that gallstones often recur following non-surgical treatments. Gallstones return in a majority of patients who pursue dissolution treatments. As a result, these treatments are no longer common. Typically they are used for patients who are physically unable to tolerate surgery.

      "content": "Treat your gallstones with plant terpenes. Scientific testing of a proprietary blend of plant-based compounds called Rowachol has produced encouraging results. A six-month course of treatment produced complete or partial dissolution of gallstones in 29 percent of a 27-patient research population. These plant terpenes appear to stimulate bile production by your liver and inhibit the formation of cholesterol crystals. Rowachol also enhanced the effectiveness of other solvent drugs."

      "title": "Consider a gallbladder flush.",
      "content": "Consider a gallbladder flush. Opinions differ regarding the efficacy of gallbladder cleanses and liver flushes. No scientific evidence exists that these treatments are effective [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source , but there are some anecdotal reports of success. Bear in mind that most of the “evidence” produced in your stool following a flush is not actually gallstone, but rather a byproduct of the treatment itself. That said, you may try various options: Fast 12 hours. Then, starting at 7 p.m., ingest 4 tablespoons of olive oil, followed by one tablespoon of lemon juice. Repeat every 15 minutes for a total of 8 treatment cycles. Alternatively, consume only apple and vegetable juice during the day. Then, around 5 or 6 p.m., ingest 18 milliliters of olive oil, followed by 9 milliliters of fresh lemon juice. Repeat every 15 minutes until you’ve consumed 8 ounces of olive oil. Gallbladder flushes often produce pain and diarrhea. By the next morning, you’ll typically pass soft green or brown spheres. Again, these are not usually gallstones, but rather the byproducts of the treatment."

      "content": "Treat the symptoms of your gallbladder disease with herbs or homeopathic remedies. It’s important to note that these remedies will not eliminate your gallstones; rather, under the guidance of a trained professional they may mitigate your symptoms so you can better tolerate the stones already in your system. Green tea, milk thistle, globe artichoke, and turmeric can all support liver and gallbladder function. Again, consult a trained medical professional before undertaking a herbal regimen. Used improperly, these herbs may trigger a gallbladder attack or produce other unwanted side effects. Homeopathic remedies for gallstones include colocynthis, chelidonium, and lycopodium prepared in specific concentrations. Note that there is no evidence that homeopathy is effective."

A number of practices have been linked to lower incidence of gallbladder disease: Consume polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. Eat plenty of fiber. Ingest caffeine as part of your daily diet. Follow a vegetarian diet. Avoid excessive intake of refined sugars such as sucrose and fructose. Some circumstantial evidence indicates eating large quantities of legumes can increase your incidence of contracting gallbladder disease. Consume a minimal quantities of alcohol. Consider eating several one-ounce servings per week of peanuts or other nuts. This has proven useful in studies involving female subjects, in particular.

While obesity is a risk factor for gallbladder disease, you’ll want to eliminate this risk factor slowly through careful weight loss. Slow, steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week is best."
