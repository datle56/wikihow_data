      "content": "Add stones and natural compost to a plant pot. Begin the planting process during autumn. Get a medium-sized plant pot that has drainage holes at the bottom. Layer the bottom of the pot with small stones. Only put enough stones so that you can’t see the bottom of the pot. Then, fill the pot with natural compost. Fill it up almost all the way, but leave about a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of space at the top of the pot. [1] X Research source Natural compost is made out of decomposing organic materials, such as leaves, hay, and raw vegetables. You can use store-bought compost if you do not have homemade compost."

Insert 2 or 3 seeds into the hole. Then, replace the compost and pat it down. After that, water the compost until it appears wet. [2] X Research source"

Wherever you put it, the spot should not receive constant sunlight. Keeping the seeds at a temperature between 65 °F (18 °C) and 75 °F (24 °C). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Protect the seeds with wire mesh if your pot is outside. This will prevent birds and animals from eating the seeds. First figure out the circumference of the top of the pot. Use wire cutters to cut the wire mesh a little larger than the measurement you took. Then, put the wire mesh on top of the pot and fold the wire mesh over the edges. Make sure that it is secure and can’t be easily removed. [4] X Research source"

To speed along the process of germination, you can trick the seeds into “thinking” they’ve gone through the typical dormancy and germination period. A seed may take 2 seasons to germinate naturally, but this process will speed up germination to 90 days. To begin, gather your materials to replicate the summer season. You will need: [7] X Research source A container that can hold hot water and all of your seeds Your seeds Warm or hot (not boiling) water"

If you choose to protect the seedlings until they grow larger, keep the seedlings inside in a sunny area. Keep the seedling inside for about a year, until they reach 15 to 19 inches (38 to 48 cm) tall. Keep the soil damp during this time.

The best time to begin exposure is during early spring. Ideally, put the pot in a place with dappled sunlight. Start by putting the seedlings outside for 2 hours during the day. Then, increase the daily outside time by an hour each day. After a few days, permanently move the seedlings outside. [18] X Research source"

Find a clear location with plenty of sunlight. Dig a hole that is at least an inch deep, depending on the size of the seedlings. Plant the seedlings and cover the hole back up with soil. Plant the seedlings at least 3 feet (91 cm) apart if you are planting multiple trees. [19] X Research source Rake the area so that it is clear before planting the seedlings."
