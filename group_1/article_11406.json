      "content": "Start with hair that's at least 4 in (10 cm). The client's hair should be long enough to be combed straight back and have some height when blow-dried with a round-barrel brush. Depending on the exact size of their head, this should be at least 4 in (10 cm) long. [1] X Research source Keep the texture of their hair in mind. Curly hair will straighten and lengthen a bit when you style it into a pomp. It would be even better if the hair on the sides of the client's head is already cut short. Something around 1 1 ⁄ 2 to 2 in (3.8 to 5.1 cm) long would be great! If your client’s hair is too long, do a rough cut by trimming it down to approximately 4 in (10 cm) on the top, and 2 in (5.1 cm) on the sides. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Create 2 deep side parts that join in a V in the back of the head. Use a fine-toothed comb or a rattail comb to create a deep side part on the left and right sides of the client's head, right where it starts to curve down. Angle the parts so that they connect in the back of the head in a shallow V-shape. Gather the hair between the parts, and secure it with clips. [3] X Research source The side parts will be a little different on each person, but it's typically around the temples. Make the side parts curve down a little so that they connect in a V a little bit above the eyebrows."

      "content": "Shave just under the parts using clippers and a fine-toothed comb. Make sure that you have trimmed off the bulk of the hair first using hair-cutting shears. Hold the comb with the teeth pointing up and angled away from the scalp. Comb it up through the hair until you've caught the hair that's just beneath the first side part. Run the clippers across the comb to trim the hair that's sticking out of it. [4] X Research source Take the guard off of the clippers for this. The comb's teeth will keep the clippers from shaving too close. You can even do this with scissors instead! Start at one temple and work your way along the part until you reach the bottom of the V, then repeat the process for the back. This is the baseline. Make it about the same thickness as the comb, about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm)."

Run the trimmers along the perimeter of the client’s hair, starting at one temple and finishing at the nape, then doing the same for the other side. Be sure to get the sideburns, behind the ears, and the bottom of the nape. [6] X Research source Pull the ears away from the scalp so that you can reach behind them. Detail trimmers are a type of clipper with a narrow point that allows for precision. When doing the nape, hold the trimmers so that they are parallel to the hairline, then pull them away from the hairline. This will give you a crisp edge. For an old-school, rockabilly look, keep the sideburns long. [7] X Research source"

As you are doing this, snip away any stray pieces of hair that are sticking out of the comb. [8] X Research source This is similar to how you cut the hair previously with clippers. You can use this time to create a modern fade by making the hair towards the bottom of the head shorter. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that cutting the back of your own hair can be very challenging. Have a friend hold a mirror up for you so that you can see the back of your head. Make sure that you are using good hairdressing shears and not plain, old scissors."

Next, create a part across the back of the head, 1 in (2.5 cm) above the bottom of the V. Comb the hair below that part down. [10] X Research source The hair should be thick enough to hold its shape above the part. If it keeps covering the part, just clip it back up again."
