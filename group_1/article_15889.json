Eating nourishing, wholesome food when you are hungry helps you stay strong both mentally and physically — creating a good foundation for the healthy mindset needed to enjoy life. Try to eat mainly whole, unprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, etc. In addition, be sure to drink plenty of water each day. A good measure is to take your body weight in pounds and divide it in half: that's how much water you should drink each day in ounces. Example: if you weigh 180 pounds, you'll need to drink 90 ounces of water each day."

If it's really bad, give yourself a couple of days, but promise yourself that no matter how you feel after 3 days are up, you'll get back to work/school and, if necessary, you'll get help.

The more you obsess over wanting to be happy, the more likely you are to focus on how unhappy you are. By placing pressure on yourself to be happy, you're more likely to achieve the opposite. Instead of pressuring yourself to be happy, acknowledge that it's your goal, and then do the things that will help you achieve it — for example, being mindful, being kind to yourself, and exercising regularly. It may help you to make an action plan of how you want to be happier in life. Once you've written down your plan, it may be easier to focus on the steps you need to take to be happy, rather than on achieving the abstract feeling of happiness itself."

Even if someone has done something hurtful to you, it does not benefit you to dwell too much on the pain. You can't control their actions, and you can't force them to make things better for you; you can only control your own actions and emotions. This may sound harsh, but it's actually very positive. It means that you are in control of your own happiness. Don't let someone else think they're in control. Don't give them that power!"

For example, you have to go to a class that you hate, but at least you'll see your best friend there. Part of being positive is believing in yourself. Combat negative self-talk with positive affirmations. Example: instead of saying, “I am so stupid for failing that test”, say “I'll need to study harder next time” or “I am disappointed that I didn't pass that test; what can I do to ensure that I pass next time?” If you can't find the good in something, avoid dwelling on the negativity.

Focus on how the ground feels beneath your feet; how the air feels against your skin; how it feels to breathe and walk; focus on the moment that you occupy right now.

[10] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source One way in which you can build compassion toward others is through a “loving-kindness meditation”: [11] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Sit comfortably, breathe in and out from your heart center (your chest area), and think or say these phrases several times: “May I be free from inner and outer harm and danger. May I be safe and protected”; “May I be free of mental suffering or distress”; “May I be happy”; “May I be free of physical pain and suffering”; “May I be healthy and strong”; “May I be able to live in this world happily, peacefully, joyfully, with ease.” Next, still sitting comfortably and breathing from your chest, move your thoughts to someone you love unconditionally, and send them the same good thoughts. After that, move on to a more neutral person, again reciting the words of loving-kindess, replacing the word “I” with their name. Finally, move on to someone you have difficulty with, or dislike, and again repeat the words of loving-kindess.

When you have a thought, don't just accept it as truth; be curious and ask yourself why you had that thought. You can do the same with others when they express ideas that are new to you or that you may not agree with. When you hear about something you don't know, look it up online, or ask someone to explain it to you. Instead of always eating the same food at your favourite restaurant, try something new — better yet, try a new restaurant! You might even consider finding out how your favourite dishes are made, and then trying to make them for yourself at home."

It involves anything from blocking out your time each day to cleaning up your home and getting rid of things you no longer need. [15] X Research source One great way to gain some control over your day-to-day life is to block out your time in an hourly diary: Choose a diary that shows your entire week over a two-page spread. Beneath each day there should be squares representing at least 12 hours of your day: from the time you wake up to the time you get home from work/school. At the start of each week, block out how you will spend your time each day. Start with the things you must get done and then move down your list in order of priority. Example: 7:00-7:10 a.m. Wake up; 7:10-7:45 do yoga; 7:45-8:30 shower/get dressed, 8:30-9:00 make/eat breakfast; 9:00-9:45 travel to work; 9:45-10:00 settle in; 10:30 check emails; 10:30-12:30 data entry; 12:30-1:30 lunch; and so on. Note that things will not always go as planned, and that's okay. What you block into your diary doesn't have to be set in stone; it's meant to be a guideline to help you gain some control over your time, and meet your goals."

Making an effort to get outside of that routine — for example through socializing or exploring new hobbies (ex., music, films, reading, art, sports) — will help you feel more fulfilled in life. Do things that make you laugh: see a funny movie, watch a comedy special on TV, hang out with funny people, play with a cat or dog, or do whatever it is that gets you laughing.

This doesn't mean forgetting; it's more about letting go of anger. One doctor suggests the following exercise: [17] X Research source Identify someone you're angry with. Don't start with someone with whom you have deep-seated issues; start with someone who will likely be easier to forgive, like that person who cut you off in traffic the other day, or someone who pushed past you in the hallway at school, if you're still holding on to that. Get the anger out. Write your feelings down in a journal; discuss your feelings with friends, a therapist, or other supportive people. Work out whether you want to raise the issue with anyone. Picture the person in your mind, and ask yourself what they might have been dealing with on a person level, for them to have treated you that way. Putting yourself in their shoes will help you view them with more compassion, and may help you to forgive them. Note that this doesn't make their actions okay. You do not have to put up with people treating you poorly. The goal of the exercise is merely to help you release your anger about the event, so that you can move on and feel happier in life."
