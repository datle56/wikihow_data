(Note that if you have the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC, you will be able to find a Clefairy that evolves into a Clefable with a Moon Stone. [1] X Research source ) Moon Stones can be obtained from the Porto Marinada auction, the Asado Desert as sparkling overworld items, or a Pokémon with the ability Pickup. You can also find them as hidden items in South Province Area Three and West Province Area Two. The reward for catching 210 Pokémon in the Paldea Pokédex is a Moon Stone. [2] X Research source"
