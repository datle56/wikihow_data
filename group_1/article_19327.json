      "content": "Begin looking for bagworms during the winter or early spring. Bagworm egg sacks are brown and one and a half to two inches (3.8 to 5 cm) long. They are covered with dead needles, so they appear more noticeable in contrast to the green deciduous needles at this time. [1] X Research source Bagworm sacks can be very hard to find because they look like pine cones. Look through your pinecones to find variations that may be bagworms."

      "content": "Notice areas of dead pine needles or branches. If your tree has begun to turn brown, the bagworms might have killed it already. You will want to try a last effort to rid your entire garden of the worms, so that they don't spread to other trees."

      "content": "Observe new places the bagworms may live. Their silks are transported by the wind. Anywhere the wind blows in your yard is a potential new spot for the moths and a great place to look."

      "content": "Spray insecticide in late May, June and early July. This is when it can kill young larvae. Stop by late July and August when the bagworms are resilient and the insecticide no longer works. [8] X Research source Once September and early October begin, the adult bagworms begin fertilizing their eggs. You should begin the process of handpicking the egg sacks at this time. Adult male bagworms are moths with black wings and brown spots. They die after fertilization. Female bagworms remain inside the sack in their larval state."
