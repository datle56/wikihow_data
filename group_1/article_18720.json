      "content": "Baking soda is slightly abrasive, so it can lift crayon marks from wood. If soapy water didn't do the trick, mix 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking powder with enough water to make a paste-like mixture. Spread the paste on the crayon and scrub it with an old toothbrush. This works well for small marks on cabinets or tables. [2] X Research source Baking soda should still be gentle enough to use on finished wood, but you can always test the paste in an inconspicuous spot first."

      "content": "Mayonnaise and a little elbow grease can remove crayon from finished wood. Mayo works a bit like lubricantâ€”the fats can penetrate the stain, so you can get the crayon out. Just dab a cloth into some mayonnaise and spread it on the crayon. Let it sit for at least a few minutes before you scrub it away. [8] X Research source It's totally fine to use light mayonnaise although you'll need to let it sit longer to have an effect."

Pop on gloves or wash your hands immediately after handling the essential oil. Undiluted essential oil can irritate or damage sensitive skin."
