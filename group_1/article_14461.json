      "content": "Measure out the vertical axis. The vertical axis in a histogram is always for frequency. What measure of time is necessary, though, is up to your data of course (but the numbers will still need to be equally spaced). Just be sure to leave extra room at the top to make your chart easier to read. [2] X Research source If the upper limit of your histogram is 54, for example, you should make the highest number on the axis 60. If the frequency doesn't start until a fairly high number, you can cut out many of the numbers below it. For example, if the first frequency is 32, you can start the chart at 25 or 30."

Then, draw in the bars centered over the data point they represent. Make sure the bars are even and the same width as each other. Generally, histogram bars are supposed to touch, but if you have no results for a particular group, then don't worry about it. [3] X Research source"
