      "title": "Stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "content": "Stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables. Somewhere around 60-80% of an Eclectus’ daily diet should be fresh fruits and vegetables. The majority of the fresh produce should be in the form of tropical and subtropical fruits such as bananas, mango, paw paw, cantaloupe, passionfruit, berries, kiwi, and pomegranate. [2] X Research source Pulses and legumes provide protein for your bird. Try to incorporate some chick peas, lentils, and fava beans into your Eclectus’ daily diet."

      "title": "Add in foods rich in Vitamin A.",
      "content": "Add in foods rich in Vitamin A. Eclectus are prone to vitamin A deficiencies. To help combat this, their daily diet should include foods rich in beta carotenes and vitamin A. Try giving your Eclectus leafy greens and orange-colored produce like: [3] X Research source Red peppers Carrots Sweet potatoes Bok choy Spinach Turnip leaves Papaya"

    {
      "title": "Give them some sprouted grains and seeds.",
      "content": "Give them some sprouted grains and seeds. Around 10% of the Eclectus diet should come from sprouted grains and seeds, as well as treats. Small quantities of brown rice and nuts provide fiber and healthy fats for your bird. Just remember that the sprouted seeds are easier for your bird to digest. [4] X Research source You can purchase sprouted grains, or sprout your own at home. Sprouting takes time and special equipment, though, so read up on the process and prepare to sprout in advance of when your Eclectus will need them. [5] X Research source To properly sprout your grains, soak them first in baby sterilizing fluid, such as Milton or Johnson & Johnson, for 24 hours. Rinse the grains thoroughly. Store them in a cool, dark area for another 24 hours. Rinse them again before feeding them to your birds. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Provide limited pellet foods.",
      "content": "Provide limited pellet foods. The majority of your Eclectus’ diet should come from fresh produce, but around 20-30% can come from pellets. If you choose to add pellets to your Eclectus’ diet, avoid ones with added vitamins and minerals as well as those with preservatives and food dyes, as Eclectus are often sensitive to these. [7] X Research source Some Eclectus owners opt not to feed pellet food to their bird at all. Eclectus do not need pelleted food, but some owners find it a beneficial addition to a mostly produce-based diet."

    {
      "title": "Avoid feeding your Eclectus fatty or processed foods.",
      "content": "Avoid feeding your Eclectus fatty or processed foods. Onions, avocado, walnuts, pasta, and chocolate are particularly dangerous for your bird. In addition, avoid \"human\" foods with artificial flavorings, dyes, or preservatives. Fresh fruits and vegetables are the best foods for your Eclectus. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed your Eclectus daily meals.",
      "content": "Feed your Eclectus daily meals. Since Eclectus need a lot of fresh food, you can’t just fill up their bowl and leave it for the day. Instead, you will need to feed them morning and evening meals. Provide them with meals of fresh fruits and vegetables in the morning and in the evening, and take away any food they have not consumed after an hour or so. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put snacks in foraging treats.",
      "content": "Put snacks in foraging treats. Eclectus like to graze between meals. They also love a good challenge. A foraging toy allows your Eclectus to satisfy its cravings and keep mentally sharp. These toys let you hide treats and seeds in compartments. Then, your Eclectus manipulates the toy to get food as it is hungry. [10] X Research source Pellets and seeds are good treats to put in foraging toys, as they can be left out longer than fresh foods. Be sure to empty all foraging toys before bedtime, though, and clean them daily to avoid contamination."

    {
      "title": "Give your Eclectus something they can chew.",
      "content": "Give your Eclectus something they can chew. In addition to foraging toys, you can help your Eclectus satisfy its grazing instincts by giving them toys they can chew. Cuttle bones let them chew and provide some extra calcium. Chew toys and soft wood perches should also be provided. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fly your Eclectus before meals.",
      "content": "Fly your Eclectus before meals. Since Eclectus fly to forage in the wild, letting your Eclectus out for fly time before meals will encourage them to eat. Let your bird out for at least 30 minutes of out-of-cage time before giving them their meal. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick to consistent times.",
      "content": "Stick to consistent times. Eclectus parrots like routine. Schedule meals so that they are at near the same time every day. You can even schedule their meal times to coincide with yours. Scheduling meals helps keep your Eclectus calm and discourages stress behavior such as feather plucking and excessive chewing."

    {
      "title": "Give treats sparingly.",
      "content": "Give treats sparingly. A treat or two in a foraging toy is a great reward for an Eclectus. These birds are prone to becoming overweight when they stray too far from their fresh fruit and veggie diet, though. Try to give treats sparingly, incorporating one or two of them into seeds and sprouts throughout the day. [13] X Research source If you notice your Eclectus gaining weight, talk to your avian vet about dietary adjustments to help keep your bird friend happy and healthy."
