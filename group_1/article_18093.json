While you can consciously decide to forgive someone, it may take some time to process your emotions and actually come to terms with your situation. [2] X Research source Contrary to the popular saying, you don’t have to “forgive and forget.” While you can forgive someone, it might be harder to forget what they did to you entirely, especially if it really hurt you."

      "content": "What forgiving isn’t: excusing the other person’s behavior. If you have to forgive someone, you were probably really hurt by something they said or did. Just because you forgive someone doesn’t mean that you’re saying their actions were okay or justifiable, and it’s important that you express that as you forgive. [3] X Research source If the person is truly sorry, they’ll change their behavior to try avoid hurting you in the future."

Take time to think through your feelings and your reasoning, to better understand the situation. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You want to resolve your own feelings of anger, confusion, or hurt. You value your relationship with them, and believe that forgiving them is worth it. They've shown a willingness to change their behavior, and you want to try again."

      "content": "Avoid giving someone too many chances. You may choose to forgive someone once, twice, or three times. But if they are repeatedly and knowingly hurting you, or if they have done something extremely terrible, then you should consider protecting yourself. If someone has shown that they will mistreat you again and again, or that they are willing to do you serious harm, then you need to protect your own well-being. [5] X Research source For example, you can forgive an abusive father and choose not to talk to him ever again, because you know he would mistreat you. For example, if your girlfriend yells at you and then apologizes and says she's working on controlling her temper, then you might decide to forgive her and continue dating her. If your girlfriend screams horrible abuse at you, or hits you, then you need to protect yourself and escape the relationship."

Forgiveness is a choice that you make for yourself, so don't let other people's ideas of what you \"should\" do pressure you into doing something that feels premature or just not right. [6] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. [7] X Research source If you aren't ready to forgive someone, you don't have to do it yet.

      "content": "Think about the health of the relationship and how much you value it. This is especially important if the harm done was a big. Is this relationship worth fighting for? Is it usually more good than bad? Do you believe that both of you can learn and overcome this with time and work? Take some time to think it over. If you value the relationship, then use those feelings to help you commit to being brave and facing the issue. If you believe the relationship mostly drags you down, it's okay to decide to part ways or to limit contact. You can forgive them while doing what's best for yourself."

When a conflict has occurred to push people apart, that connection becomes even harder to salvage. If you want to forgive someone, then take the first step in the process by reaching out. This act alone will help you to feel more open and optimistic. [13] X Research source It is always difficult to take the first step, and sometimes you need to give yourself a push.

There are things you can do to move toward forgiveness regardless of whether the person complies. The act of forgiveness is designed to help you in the end.

If you must or want to maintain a relationship with this person, then your behaviors must demonstrate that you are serious.

Your goal is to allow others to feel the impact of your good deeds. Expand your empathy by talking and, most importantly, listening to people outside your social circle. Try to strike up a conversation with a stranger once a week. If talking to a stranger is hard, then try reading blogs of people with different life experiences than yours.
