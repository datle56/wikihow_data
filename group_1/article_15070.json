      "content": "Choose roses with the best blooms for drying. You want a rose which has a nice bloom, but also no moisture or flaws. The moisture will cause molding and the flaws will be exaggerated in the drying process. You can use blooms which have opened a bit, but don't use a rose which is already beginning to fall apart and lose its petals. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim the rose stems to about 6 inches (15.24 cm). You want to trim the stems, but not too short. 6 inches (15.24 cm) is a good minimum, but you can leave more length if you prefer. Remove the foliage from the stems. The leaves will not dry nicely and should be removed. Leaves also hold water and will slow the overall drying process."

Leave at least 2 inches (5.08cm) of stems beyond the rubber band. Continue wrapping the rubber band around the stem until the roses are secure. [2] X Research source You can arrange the roses into a nice bouquet before drying so they are already prepared to be displayed."

      "content": "String a clothesline in a cool, dark place. Find a room which you don't use often, like a laundry room, attic or a utility closet. The space should still have good ventilation to allow the moisture to escape. Stretch a clothes line or rope between 2 points in this room and tie it securely. Make sure it is sturdy enough to hold your roses. You want to choose a dark space. The color of your roses will darken in the drying process, but exposing them to light will increase this color change, while using a dark space will reduce the alteration in the rose color."

Set your microwave to medium heat or defrost. Cook the desiccant for 2-3 minutes or until the color has returned to signify it is ready to use. Remove the bowl from the microwave using an oven mitt. Both the bowl and desiccant will be very hot. Allow it to cool on a heat-safe surface for 24 hours.
