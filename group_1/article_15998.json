      "title": "Decide if both of you are equally invested in the friendship.",
      "content": "Decide if both of you are equally invested in the friendship. A healthy friendship is balanced, with both people equally invested in the relationship. For example, both friends should take time to call each other or make invitations to hang out. [1] X Research source For example, if you are doing all the calling and inviting, it could be a sign that the friendship is unhealthy."

      "title": "Think about whether your conversations are balanced.",
      "content": "Think about whether your conversations are balanced. A healthy friendship is filled with conversations where both friends share their joys, frustrations, and stories. If you have a friend who calls to only talk about her problems, and rarely asks you questions about your life, you might be involved in an unhealthy friendship. [2] X Research source The next time you have a conversation with your friend, pay attention to whether the conversation seems balanced."

      "title": "Make sure you both have individual interests.",
      "content": "Make sure you both have individual interests. A balanced, healthy friendship means both people have individual hobbies, lifestyles, and favorite things that don’t necessarily reflect those of the other person. It’s important to maintain individuality in a healthy friendship, rather than adopting the other person’s views and interests. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Think about how your friend makes you feel.",
      "content": "Think about how your friend makes you feel. Hanging out with friends should bring positivity to your day, elevate your mood, and make you feel good about yourself. If hanging out with a friend makes you feel negative, agitated, or bad about yourself, you should pay attention to this red flag. It could signify that this friendship is unhealthy. [4] X Research source Try making a list of your feelings after hanging out with your friend. In a healthy friendship this list will include positive feelings. Consider how often you and your friend complain when you are together. If your friendship is based on mutual complaining about problems, then it may not be a healthy relationship. Ask yourself—after you've seen this person, do you feel loved and supported, or judged and criticized? Do you feel seen and heard, or do they dominate the conversation and activities?

      "title": "Reconsider overly critical friendships.",
      "content": "Reconsider overly critical friendships. In a healthy friendship, both people support each other. While it’s normal to provide feedback and criticism to a friend, this should not be a hallmark of the relationship. Unhealthy friendships sometimes include constant criticism that is rooted in jealousy and cruelty. For example, if your friend is continually pointing out your mistakes, you might be in an unhealthy friendship. Consider whether you have been making excuses for being mistreated and criticized. If so, then this is a big red flag of being co-dependent. Also, consider if your friendship is keeping you from growing personally or if you are maintaining the friendship due to personal fears. If so, then this is another sign of an unhealthy relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 814 wikiHow readers what’s the strongest indicator someone doesn’t want to be your friend, and only 9% of them agreed that they tease you a lot. [Take Poll] Remember, teasing is different from insulting or criticizing. If your friend’s words or actions hurt, make sure to tell them how you feel to see if they adjust their behavior."

      "title": "Talk with someone you trust.",
      "content": "Talk with someone you trust. Discussing your concerns with an objective third party, such as another trusted friend or a family member may help you to evaluate your relationship. It can be hard to evaluate your relationship once you have been in it for a long time, but someone outside of your relationship may be able to provide objective feedback. They can alert you to things that you may not have been aware of, especially if these things have become normal for you."

      "content": "Make honesty a priority. Being honest with one another is an important part of a healthy friendship. Dishonesty is a sign your friendship might be unhealthy. A healthy friendship is one where both people are genuine, honest, and comfortable being their true selves in the relationship.

After you make your list, write out possible solutions to the issues you identified."

      "title": "Have an honest conversation with your friend.",
      "content": "Have an honest conversation with your friend. Ask your friend to sit down and talk about your friendship. Be honest with your friend about what is bothering you, and why you think the friendship might be unhealthy. Try saying, “Kendra, I really value our friendship, but I feel like our relationship is unbalanced. I’d really like it if you asked me more questions about what’s going on in my life.”"

      "content": "Decide whether you want to mend or end the friendship.

Sit down together and make a list of ways you can both work on making your friendship healthier. Then make an honest effort to do your part.

      "title": "Consider ending the unhealthy friendship.",
      "content": "Consider ending the unhealthy friendship. Deciding to end a friendship can be a difficult decision, even if the relationship is unhealthy.

[12] X Research source Sometimes a simple email will suffice, while other times a conversation on the phone or in person is necessary. Giving your former friend and yourself closure is the respectful way to end an unhealthy friendship."
