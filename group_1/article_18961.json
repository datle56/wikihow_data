      "content": "Decorate your plain diary. [1] X Research source If your diary is a plain notebook, decorate it to make it new and fresh. This will make you more excited to write in your diary each day, and give you a clean slate to think of new ideas for your diary. Cover the diary. A great way to add new flair to a notebook is to entirely cover it with paper or fabric. Lay the notebook out flat on a table on top of the paper or fabric you want to use to cover it. Trace the outline of the notebook on your paper or fabric, and cut it to size. Glue it onto your notebook with craft glue. Use a foam brush to apply the glue to avoid lumps. You can even recycle an old pair of jeans to add a pocket to the cover of your notebook. Use stickers, and draw or paint on your diary to add more personalization."

Learn to love the process, and let whatever happens next happen, without fussing too much about it.” [3] X Research source"
