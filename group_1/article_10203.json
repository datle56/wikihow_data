      "content": "Acknowledge your anxiety and feelings without judging yourself. When you start feeling anxious, you may tend to get upset with yourself that you’re feeling that way in the first place, which in turn makes you more anxious. It’s a vicious shame cycle! Stop the cycle by allowing yourself to feel what you feel in the moment. Acknowledge the feelings and thoughts, and then do your best to let them go. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re heading out to dinner and start to get anxiety about the thought of having to order and eat in front of your friends, internally say something like, “I am feeling anxious about going out to eat. It’s okay that I feel this. I don’t have to let it control me, but I acknowledge that it is there.” This will hopefully help you break the shame cycle and interrupt the anxiety."

      "content": "Use affirmations to help yourself work through a stressful situation. If you find yourself spiraling into panic, it can quickly feel like you are out of control. Affirmations are short phrases you repeat to yourself to focus on positive-thinking rather than negative-thinking. Come up with your own unique phrase or try out one of these: [2] X Research source “I am healthy” “I am safe” “I am strong and calm” “I can find peace within myself” “I accept myself and my feelings” “I am capable of making healthy and positive decisions”"

      "title": "Stop labeling foods as “good,” “bad,” “healthy,” or “unhealthy.”",
      "content": "Stop labeling foods as “good,” “bad,” “healthy,” or “unhealthy.” Focus on viewing all foods in a positive light and try to refrain from following rules about what you will and will not eat. If you can erase the stigma that you’ve associated with certain foods, it’ll free you up to eat more intuitively. [3] X Research source Popular culture and social media can make it hard to see food as just food. If you have a hard time tuning out what others around you (in person or online) are saying about diets and health, stop listening to them altogether. Block or unfollow accounts that promote certain lifestyles, ditch your diet books, and question what message media is telling you about food, your body, and your worth. Overly restricting what you can or can’t eat can make your anxiety around food much worse."

      "title": "Listen to your body and eat things that make you feel good.",
      "content": "Listen to your body and eat things that make you feel good. This takes lots of practice, so don’t get discouraged if it takes you a while to be confident in your food choices. When faced with a situation surrounding food that makes you anxious, choose to focus solely on yourself and what your intuition is telling you sounds good. If that’s a salad, eat a salad. If it’s a burrito, eat a burrito. [4] X Research source This sounds simple but it can be really hard to do. Be patient with yourself and take some time to check in with your body before and after an anxiety-inducing situation. Evaluate what went well and where you’d like to make changes in the future. Learning to trust your body and yourself is a big part of overcoming food anxiety."

      "content": "Be kind to yourself and don’t beat yourself up over feeling anxious. It’s totally normal if your recovery isn’t smooth and if it’s something you have to work through every day. As much as you can, try to not get upset with yourself when you do experience food anxiety. That could make you spiral into feeling even more anxious! [6] X Research source Remember, you can’t control everything, including your anxiety. The goal in recovery isn’t perfectionism, it’s progress. When you start to berate yourself for feeling anxious, pause and count to 10. Take 5 deep breaths, and refocus your attention to the present moment."
