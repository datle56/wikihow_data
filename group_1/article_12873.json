      "title": "Look for difficulty with movement.",
      "content": "Look for difficulty with movement. The tell-tale sign of a dislocation is the inability to move a joint. When a joint gets dislocated, the muscles, tendon, and ligaments that enable movement are dislodged and they will likely lose their function. Dislocations do not always eliminate all movement. Your cat may just appear lame or avoid its usual weight bearing. In some cases, the muscles surrounding a dislocated joint will cause a limb to curl up or move into an unnatural position. This is the case, for instance, with many dislocated hip joints. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Spot signs of swelling or abnormal looking joints. Assess your cat's body regularly in order to spot signs of illness, including dislocated joints. When looking for swelling or abnormalities, it is a good idea to focus your attention on joints that are commonly dislocated in cats. These include: [2] X Research source Knee joints Hip joints Shoulder joints Elbow joints Tail joints"

      "title": "Notice if your cat is in pain.",
      "content": "Notice if your cat is in pain. If your cat is having problems moving and one of its joints looks weird, assess the cat for signs of pain. This can be hard to spot in cats because they usually try and mask their pain. However, if your cat is lethargic, unusually vocal, or it reacts badly to touch, then it is likely in pain. [3] X Research source A cat that is in pain is likely to hide as well. If you haven't seen your cat in awhile and that is unusual, you take the time to look for it to make sure it is okay. Even a calm, friendly cat can bite when it's in pain, so be careful when approaching or handling the cat."

      "title": "Be on the lookout for problems with joints that have been dislocated previously.",
      "content": "Be on the lookout for problems with joints that have been dislocated previously. A joint that has been dislocated in the past is more likely to be dislocated again. This is due to damage that can be done to the muscles and ligaments during a dislocation. Once these parts are damaged, the long-term stability of the joint can be compromised. However, if your cat has had surgical treatment for certain dislocations it may not have further dislocations. For example, if your cat has a ball replacement for a hip dislocation it is not likely to get an additional dislocation. However, it may have lingering stiffness or mobility issues.

      "title": "Take your cat to the vet.",
      "content": "Take your cat to the vet. A dislocation can be a serious medical problem for a cat, so it is important that the cat be seen by a veterinarian quickly. Call your veterinary office while you are taking your cat in. Let them know that you are bringing your cat in for an emergency. If you notice the symptoms of a dislocation while your regular veterinary clinic is closed, it's a good idea to take your cat to an emergency veterinary hospital. You do not want your cat suffering with pain for hours before treatment. This is an emergency situation, and delaying treatment can make it less likely your cat's injury will be repaired properly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Help your veterinarian to assess your cat's condition.",
      "content": "Help your veterinarian to assess your cat's condition. Your veterinarian will likely first ask you about your cat's condition, what symptoms you've seen and when they started. Then, they will likely try to manipulate the joint. This can cause the cat to give a pain response and the veterinarian may even be able to hear the sound of bones that are out of place rubbing against each other. [5] X Research source You may be asked to help keep your cat calm while the veterinarian is assessing your cat's condition and manipulating its joints. However, if the injury is serious and includes other trauma, it may not be appropriate for you to be in the room and you will be asked to wait in a waiting area."

    {
      "title": "Allow veterinary testing.",
      "content": "Allow veterinary testing. If your veterinarian suspects a dislocation or break, they will likely do an x-ray on the cat's joint. This will allow them to see what is going on inside your cat's body. [6] X Research source For most dislocations, an x-ray is all the veterinarian need to confirm their diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have the joint put back into position.",
      "content": "Have the joint put back into position. With many dislocations, the cat will just need to have the bones placed back into the joint. After this is done, the area will be made immobile with a wrap to keep the bones in place while the cat heals. This can be done externally, with what is called a \"closed reduction\" or surgically in what is called an \"open reduction.\" Both of these procedures will require that your cat be put under anesthesia. With an open reduction this is because it is a surgery and with a closed reduction it is due to the pain involved in moving the joint back into position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider replacement surgery for certain types of dislocations.",
      "content": "Consider replacement surgery for certain types of dislocations. There are certain types of dislocations that cannot just be put back into place. For example, cats with hip dislocations often need surgery to repair their joint. This surgery entails the replacement of the ball in the joint, and takes several weeks to recover from. Surgery is an especially good option for those cats with chronic cases of dislocation, such as those related to hip dysplasia."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give post-procedure and post-operative care.",
      "content": "Give post-procedure and post-operative care. Whether your cat undergoes a procedure to put the bones back into place or a surgery to repair its joint, you will need to give it care for several weeks afterword. It is likely that your cat will be prescribed medications, usually pain medications and antibiotics, that need to be given to it on a regular basis. You will also need to restrict the cat's movements. If your cat has its bones re-positioned into their proper place, you will need to keep the area bandaged and immobile for several weeks while the muscles and ligaments repair themselves. If your cat undergoes surgery, you will usually need to keep it in a cage for several weeks to keep the injured joint immobile. Joint dislocations may require several operations to repair if they are especially bad. This means that you will need to nurse your cat several times in order to get it healthy.

      "content": "Reduce the risk of osteoarthritis. Cats that have had dislocations are at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in those joints in the future. To minimize this risk, give your cat dietary supplements that prevent osteoarthritis. These include omega-3 fatty acids, glucosamine and chondroitin. As with all dietary supplements, discuss them with a veterinarian before giving them to your cat."
