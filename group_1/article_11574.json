      "content": "Be aware that Leos come in all shapes and sizes. Ultimately, the key to courtship is to get to know your particular Leo--to calibrate your courtship to his or her specific needs and quirks. Astrology describes certain personality archetypes, but archetypes will only take you so far. Take anything you read with a grain of salt. Astrology is no hard, fast science, and interpretations may vary widely depending on who happens to be writing a horoscope. Use horoscopes as a touch-point for your relationship with a person--not as the only resource. There are many other personality type indices that may give you insight into a lover's mind, including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator [1] X Research source , the Keirsey Temperament Sorter [2] X Research source , and the Five Love Languages. [3] X Research source There are also zodiac signs to take into consideration besides their sun sign, like their moon, rising, and Venus signs.

      "content": "Flirt. Leos can be passionate, physical creatures, and the quickest way to build their desire is to flirt with their attention. Catch your crush's eye from the room, and give him a quick, seductive smile. Look away, wait a while, and catch his eye again. Eye contact can signal that you are interested, and your Leo may take it as a wordless invitation to come strike up a conversation. Find excuses to touch your crush. Brush her arm when you're helping her with something; touch her shoulder, gently, when you get her attention; shake her hand warmly but firmly when the two of you meet. Build physical intimacy with your Leo, and her desire for you may grow. Don't overdo it. Subtlety is king, where flirting is concerned. Don't make anyone feel uncomfortable; if your crush doesn't return your advances, don't force it."

      "title": "Woo your Leo.",
      "content": "Woo your Leo. Leos are known for being passionate, romantic lovers, and they may long to be swept up in a passionate romance. Leos often appreciate romantic gestures. Do something sweet and considerate that you know your crush will appreciate. Buy her flowers; buy him tickets to see his favorite sports team. Something as simple as a handwritten note may show your crush that you care. Don't be afraid to be forward. If your Leo takes the lead, then let it happen and play along. If your Leo does not take the lead at first, he or she may be impressed by your courage if you make a move. Consider simply telling a Leo how she makes you feel. Tell her that she is beautiful and radiant; that she makes your heart beat faster; that you want to take her out this Friday. Love favors the bold."

      "title": "Try to keep up.",
      "content": "Try to keep up. Leos often lead active, exciting lives, and active people tend to look for mates that can keep up with their pace. [5] X Research source If your Leo is into physical activities or sports, show him or her your own athletic prowess. If you go for a hike or a run with your Leo, it is important that you can keep up. Consider letting your Leo win. Don't be afraid to get competitive, but consider playing to your crush's pride by letting him or her take first place. Make it a close race, however, and you'll earn the Leo's respect and attention."

      "title": "Compliment your crush.",
      "content": "Compliment your crush. Leos love attention, and they love to be appreciated for what for they do. Be genuine, but don't be afraid to dial up the flattery. If your crush is creative, compliment him on the things that he creates: songs, paintings, poems, crafts. Make him feel appreciated. For example: \"I love your new song! I've had it stuck in my head since the show last Saturday.\" If your crush is an athlete, compliment her on her athletic feats: tell her how impressed you were to see her win that race or to score that goal. Play to her prideful side. For example: \"Great job at the game on Friday. Those three goals you scored carried the team!\" If your crush is well-dressed or otherwise good-looking, compliment her on her appearance. Leos like to feel attractive, and verbal validation is one of the best ways to make a Leo feel appreciated. For example: \"I like your new hair. Blue really brings out your eyes!\""

      "title": "Get your Leo to open up.",
      "content": "Get your Leo to open up. Leos may present a confident, self-assured public face, but they often harbor secret doubts. If you can establish trust between your crush and yourself, he or she may begin to share these doubts with you--and this intimacy may lead to something more. Do not pry. Be respectful of your crush and her inner world. Remember that trust begets trust: if you begin to share your inner thoughts with your crush, then they are much more likely to reciprocate. Take it slow. Emotional intimacy takes time to build, and you don't want to overwhelm your crush too early in the relationship. Leos can be wary of commitment, and they may not be so quick to dive into a serious relationship. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand that Leos tend to be natural leaders.",
      "content": "Understand that Leos tend to be natural leaders. Stand up for yourself, but be prepared to handle a strong personality. Leos often like to be needed. Don't let yourself become completely dependent upon your Leo, but give him or her opportunities to help out. For example: \"I can't decide what to order--this all looks so good! Can you recommend anything?\" Ask your crush for help with something--help with homework or a project, help carrying something heavy, help deciding something. This will give you an excuse to spend time with your Leo, and it will give him or her a chance to lead."

      "title": "Never stop wooing your Leo.",
      "content": "Never stop wooing your Leo. Leos are often driven by passion and a zest for life. Don't grow complacent in your relationship, and don't stop making romantic gestures. Consider giving your Leo flowers, a favorite food item, or a handwritten note to show that you are thinking of them. It's important to show that you care, and frequent romantic gestures will help keep the Leo's \"attention tank\" full. Be spontaneous, and keep trying new things with your Leo. You may be more likely to keep him or her if you can keep the relationship exciting. Grow together. Keep the relationship going by making it a constant process of improvement. If you become complacent, your Leo may get bored and begin to dream of new horizons."

    {
      "title": "Be attentive.",
      "content": "Be attentive. Leos like to be the center of attention, although they may be happy to let you stand in the spotlight with them. Make sure that your Leo knows that you are listening to what he or she says. Consider putting away the cell phone or closing your laptop screen when you're talking with your Leo. If you are present, engaged, and listening to what she has to say, you will demonstrate that there is worth to her words. Offer feedback. Leos may like to lead, but they also like to play and interact with their partners. If you can keep up with your Leo, you will be more likely to earn her respect."

    {
      "title": "Be secure.",
      "content": "Be secure. Leos can be very attractive, sociable people, and they will often divide their attention into many different projects. If you want to keep your Leo, you will need to be secure enough in your relationship to let him or her explore. Be empathetic, but do not let anyone take advantage of you. It is one thing to accept that your mate keeps a wide range of friends from both sexes, but it is another thing to overlook a cheating partner when you've agreed upon a monogamous relationship."

    {
      "title": "Be loyal and true.",
      "content": "Be loyal and true. Leos respond well to loyalty and honesty. Continually show your Leo that they are the object of your desire. Be clear about your intentions when it comes to friends and acquaintances. Leos may become jealous if they sense that another person is taking their attention away."

    {
      "title": "Communicate.",
      "content": "Communicate. Be clear about your expectations, but be willing to compromise. Leos may be straightforward communicators, but they can also be prideful and headstrong. Stand up for what really matters to you. If you aren't comfortable with something, speak up as soon as possible. Address the issue and do not let it fester. Be tactful. A Leo's prideful nature may lead him or her to flare up with rash emotion during an argument. Leos may not handle criticism well. Empathize. Temper criticism with empathy; show your Leo that you understand where they're coming from, and make them feel validated. For example: \"You make a really good point--I wouldn't have thought of that approach. I'll definitely give it a shot.\""
