      "content": "Cabinets are built-in pieces of furniture with shelves or drawers. These furniture pieces conveniently hold items and are often found in kitchens or bathrooms. They can be designed in multiple ways but are typically anchored to a wall and float above another furniture piece, such as a counter or sink. Cabinets can be made of wood or stainless steel. These storage units are generally big enough to store pots, pans, or bottled hygienic products. [2] X Research source Now, there are instances when a cabinet is not built-in or floating. For example, a filing cabinet. However, this rule is subjective as a filing cabinet is its own entity. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cupboards are freestanding furniture pieces or small rooms with shelves. A cupboard’s purpose is to store things within a room. They can be tall furniture pieces in kitchens, dining rooms, and bedrooms, or small doored spaces under stairs. However, they’re typically tall and extend from the floor to the ceiling in some capacity. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Cupboards are often used to display fine cutlery or dishware, especially if they have a glass door. [6] X Research source Being rather tall, these storage units are typically large enough to hang clothes or bags of food in."

      "content": "In Britain, “cupboard” is often used to describe an American closet. An American may say, “Grab the plate from the cupboard,” while gesturing to a tall rectangular shelving unit with doors in the kitchen. Someone British, however, may point to what an American calls a closet and say, “Your clothes are in the cupboard.” This is because in British English “cupboard” means the American equivalent to “closet” or “wardrobe.” [7] X Research source Take a look at the proper contexts for this word: In American English: “The apples were getting moldy in the back of the cupboard ,” or “Could you bring me the frying pan? It’s in the kitchen cupboard .” In British English: “Can you grab my jacket from the back of the cupboard ?” or “I left your shoes in the cupboard under the stairs.”"
