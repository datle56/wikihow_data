Set the mortar raking tool to a depth of 0.5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) to achieve a consistent depth. Pull back the safety guard from the tool and turn the machine on. Guide the blade along the horizontal lines of the mortar. Continue pushing the blade back and forth until you have removed the mortar to a depth of 15 millimetres (0.59 in). Repeat the process with all of the mortar lines you need to repair. [2] X Research source Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Rent a mortar raking tool or pneumatic chisel from a tool rental company, if necessary. A small chisel and hammer can be used. The smaller the chisel, the less damage you will do to the bricks. Use water and a mask to cut down on the dust that you breathe. Try your best to avoid grinding the brick when you are removing the mortar."

Then, sweep a soft-bristled brush through the ground out gaps in the bricks to remove the dust, or you can also use an air compressor with a blow nozzle for quicker removal. Start at the top of the chimney and work your way down to the bottom. Finish by brushing or blowing over the faces of the bricks to remove any surface dust. [3] X Research source If your brush is getting quite dusty, bang the back of the brush on the ground to shake the excess dust off. Purchase stiff and soft-bristled brushes at a hardware or homeware store."

This will stop the mortar from drying quickly and weakening the chimney structure. [4] X Research source If it’s a hot day the water may dry before you apply the mortar. If so, you will need to re-spray water to the gaps before applying the mortar."

Make small test batches of mortar, scrape a small amount of them onto a piece of white paper, and allow them to dry for a few days. Compare the colors to the original match and choose the one that is the closest match. If none of the sands are the right color, try mixing the different sands to get closer to the original mortar color. [5] X Research source"

Mix the sand and cement powder, using a bricklayer trowel, until they are well combined. Slowly turn the bucket as you are mixing to help agitate the sand and cement. To make 1 bucket of mortar mixture, use 3 heaped trowels of sand and 1 heaped trowel of cement powder. This ratio applies to volume rather than weight. Always mix cement outdoors and wear a mask and gloves. If you buy pre-mixed type \"M\" mortar for foundations or pre-mixed type \"S\" mortar for load bearing walls, they will have 1/4 inch rocks in them that will prevent you from using a mortar bag to apply to the joints. In that case, you can use a pointer tool to push the mortar into the joints. Using a pointer tool is a lot easier than people think."

If the mortar is too thick, add a little bit more water until it is the right consistency. Keep the mixture thick enough so that it can stick to the trowel.

Wrap your dominant hand around the bag at the top point of the mortal pile. Use your other hand to guide the nozzle. Squeeze your dominant hand, at the top of the bag, to push the mortar out the nozzle. Start by squeezing the mortar into the vertical gaps, working from the highest point on the chimney down to the lowest point. After this, fill all the horizontal gaps with mortar. Depending on the size of the area you are repairing, you may need to refill your bag with more mortar. Squeeze the bag hard enough so that the gaps are slightly bulging with mortar. Don’t worry if it drips a little, or looks untidy as you can fix this later. [9] X Research source"
