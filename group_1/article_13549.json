      "content": "A sauna can help you lose water weight, but it’s not a long-term solution. The heat from a sauna makes you sweat and increases your heart rate, both of which can help you lose a few pounds of water weight. However, you will regain the weight as soon as you drink water and rehydrate yourself. So, using a sauna can supplement your weight loss plan, but it isn’t an effective long-term strategy to permanently lose weight.

Ultimately, the best way to lose weight is to eat a balanced diet , exercise regularly, and maintain a healthy caloric deficit .

      "title": "Loss of water weight",
      "content": "Loss of water weight The main way saunas help you lose weight is by getting you to sweat. Your body naturally retains water, which makes up a portion of your total weight. Sweating removes some of this water from your body, which can help you lose a few pounds of weight. [3] X Research source However, this weight loss isn’t permanent—as soon as you rehydrate yourself, you gain back the water weight."

      "title": "Increased heart rate",
      "content": "Increased heart rate The high temperatures in a sauna cause your heart rate to increase, as your body is working harder to keep you cool. In the sauna, your heart rate can jump up to levels similar to getting moderate-intensity exercise (like a brisk walk or riding a bike). [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source An increased heart rate from exercising helps you burn more calories, which can help you lose weight. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source So, saunas might help you lose a few calories and contribute to your weight loss goals. Due to the high temperatures, you typically burn more calories sitting in a sauna than you burn at rest. Note : There is only clear evidence that saunas help you lose water weight, which is temporary. Research is still limited on whether saunas can help you burn fat.

In fact, saunas can help relieve feelings of anxiety and tension. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Because increased stress and cortisol levels are linked to weight gain, it’s possible that regularly relaxing in a sauna can help you relieve stress and achieve your weight loss goals. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you’re stressed, your body releases the hormone cortisol. This lowers your metabolism and causes you to crave fatty, sugary foods, which can lead to weight gain. So, relaxing can boost your metabolism and help you make healthier food choices."
