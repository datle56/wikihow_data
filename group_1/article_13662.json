      "title": "Start with long, brushed hair.",
      "content": "Start with long, brushed hair. This style is what Arwen wore while saving Frodo from the Ring Wraiths in The Fellowship of the Rings. Arwen has long hair—so the longer your hair is, the better. You can leave your hair wavy or straight. If you have short hair, use a black or dark-brown wig, preferably a lace-front one. If your hair is too thin or not quite long enough, add some hair extensions that match your hair color. [1] X Research source If you have very curly hair, consider straightening it slightly to get a more wavy texture. Make sure there are no knots or tangles in your hair before you start braiding it. If after washing your hair is tangled, apply a detangler and cautiously comb your hair. Start from the tips and work slowly towards the roots."

      "content": "Gather a triangular section of hair from the top of your head. Create two deep side parts, one on either side of your forehead. Angle them towards the back of your crown, joining them in a V-shaped point. Gather everything within that V into a bun and secure it with a clip. [2] X Research source Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to make the parts nice and clean."

      "title": "Split the section in half, then cross the right side over the left.",
      "content": "Split the section in half, then cross the right side over the left. Part the gathered section in the middle, like creating a center part. Pull both sections towards the back of your head, then cross the right side over the left, making an X. Be careful not to mix these into the rest of your hair. [3] X Research source If you are doing the style yourself, hold the bottom section between your teeth. If you are doing the style for someone else, have them hold the bottom section in front of their face."

Gather a thin strand of hair from the outer edge of the left section, then cross it over to the inner edge of the right section. Repeat the process for the right side. Keep braiding like this until you run out of hair, then secure it with a clear hair elastic. [5] X Research source If you are doing this on your own hair, angle the braid back so that it doesn't sag. [6] X Research source If you want to create her Rivendell style, braid about three-quarters of the way down."

      "content": "Set the style with hairspray, if desired. Once you have the three fishtail braids done, you are good to go. If you want to, however, you can mist the hair on the top of your head with hairspray to ensure that the hairs lay smooth. Don't tuck your hair behind your ears, however; you want the hair at your temples hanging in front of them. This will hide the seams from the elf ears, if you are wearing them. For her Rivendell style, slip a silver circlet over your head to finish the look. You can also purchase a replica circlet and use that instead."
