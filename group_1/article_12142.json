      "title": "Unroll the crepe paper to the desired length and cut.",
      "content": "Unroll the crepe paper to the desired length and cut. Each streamer needs to span from the center of the room to an outside wall. In order to achieve a dramatic drape, the streamer must be a few feet longer than this distance. Just to be safe, you may want to overestimate how long the streamer needs to be. This will allow you to adjust the drape of the streamer. You can always trim it later. While you can measure this distance, you may find it easier to cut one streamer as a reference. With a friends help, unroll the crepe paper from the center of the room to an exterior wall. Adjust the drape of the streamer and then cut. Use this streamer as a guide."

    {
      "title": "Repeat.",
      "content": "Repeat. Continue to add streamers to your hula hoop until it is completely covered. The streamers may overlap slightly. You can create a pattern with the streamers or attach the different colored crepe paper randomly."

      "title": "Suspend the hula hoop from the center of the ceiling.",
      "content": "Suspend the hula hoop from the center of the ceiling. The attachment method you use depends entirely on the ceiling. The most convenient installation method involves tying the hula hoop to a light fixture or a beam. If these options aren’t available to you, get creative. You can also hang a hook from your ceiling to suspend the hula hoop from. When you hang the hula hoop, make sure the staples used to attach the streamers are facing up. Use fishing line so your guests don’t see the string."

      "title": "Attach the streamers to outer walls or ceiling.",
      "content": "Attach the streamers to outer walls or ceiling. Pull one streamer at a time to the edge of the room. Adjust the drape of the streamer and then secure it to the outer wall or ceiling with a piece of scotch tape. Repeat until each streamer is draped across the ceiling. When it is done, the ceiling will be hidden by streamers."

      "content": "Determine the dimensions of your back-drop. Before you assemble the back-drop, measure its length and width. Mark the dimensions of the back-drop with a light pencil mark, chalk, or a piece of tape. [1] X Research source The back-drop may be as large or as small as you’d like—it will really depend on the space you’re using and how you intend to capture the back-drop on camera. Ask yourself the following questions: Do you want to take full-body shots or will the pictures be from the waist up? How tall are your guests? How many guests do you want in one picture?"

Roll a single streamer along the top edge of the back-drop in a straight line. Cover the two small vertical pieces of tape on each end in the same manner.

Attach each end of the tape directly to the wall. This piece of tape will prevent your streamers from moving. [3] X Research source If you want the streamers to move with the breeze, don’t tape the streamers to the wall. This will provide you with a less structured, and perhaps more whimsical backdrop."

You can add two small vertical streamers to each corner so that it matches the top."
