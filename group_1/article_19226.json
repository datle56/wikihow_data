      "content": "Use a DIY lip brightening scrub. Dull, colorless lips are usually the result of dead skin buildup. Many people regularly exfoliate their face, but forget their lips. Scrubbing your lips not only removes the dead skin to reveal new skin beneath, it increases circulation to bring more color to your lips. Try a homemade brightening scrub using the following ingredients: [1] X Research source 1 teaspoon (5 g) sugar 1 teaspoon (5 mL) honey 1 teaspoon (5 mL) lemon juice A few drops of rose water"

      "content": "Try a DIY lip serum to lighten your lips. Certain ingredients produce mild irritation in your lips to make them look healthy and bright.

      "content": "Try an exfoliating brush. If you don't feel like making a scrub, use an exfoliating face brush or loofah on your lips. Simply wet them first and massage your top and bottom lips until all the dead skin has been sloughed off. When you're finished, your lips should feel fresh and invigorated.

      "content": "Use a moisturizing balm. Finish your routine with a good lip balm that will trap moisture inside to keep your looks looking shiny and healthy. Steer clear of balms with chemicals that can dry out your lips; instead, look for balms that contain all-natural ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil and beeswax."

      "title": "Use beetroot.",
      "content": "Use beetroot. Bright red beets have a lot of color, and it's easy to transfer it to your lips to make them appear pinker. Simply make a paste of beetroot powder and water. Apply this to your lips and let sit for at least 5 minutes before wiping it off with a paper towel. Be sure to moisturize after you use the paste. [3] X Research source You could also cut a beet into an inch-long piece and rub it over your lips. Do this for about 5 minutes to get a good stain that sets into your lips. Then moisturize with a layer of clear lip balm. Wear gloves when you do this or your fingers will get stained as well."

      "content": "Do a fruity lip stain. Strawberries, raspberries, cherries, pomegranates: there are so many choices when it comes to fruity lip stains! Take your favorite fruit and rub it on your lips for a few minutes. Alternatively, dip a cotton ball in red-colored fruit juice and rub it on your lips. Don't forget to seal in the color with a clear lip balm. [4] X Research source Strawberries and raspberries will produce a lighter color than cherries and pomegranates. If you loved popsicles as a kid, you probably already know that berry-flavored frozen treats can also do the trick! Take your time eating a red popsicle and let the dye give your lips a deep pink stain."

      "title": "Try pink lip balm.",
      "content": "Try pink lip balm. If you want a subtle, natural look, pink lip balm is the way to go. Look for a tinted lip balm that adds a thin layer of color with each application. As a bonus, tinted balms nourish your lips every time you use them, keeping them moist and plump as well as colorful. Tinted balms look darker with each application. If you want a brighter pink look, apply more than one layer. Tinted lip gloss is another good choice if you want a slight pop of color, but nothing too extreme."

      "title": "Choose pink lip stain.",
      "content": "Choose pink lip stain. This is another natural-looking choice that lasts a bit longer than balm. Lip stain actually dyes the top layer of skin and blends with your natural skin tone to make it look a bit pinker. Look for a lip stain in the hue you want, then experiment applying just enough to achieve the perfect color. The more layers you apply, the darker the color will be. To keep lip stain from washing away, seal it in with a layer of clear lip balm."

Use a lip balm with SPF 15 or higher to keep your lips looking pink.
