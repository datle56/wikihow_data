[1] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. The first step to multiplying fractions is to line them up so that their numerators and denominators are next to each other. [2] X Expert Source Mario Banuelos, PhD Associate Professor of Mathematics Expert Interview. 11 December 2022. If you're multiplying the fraction 1/2 by 12/48, then the first thing you want to do is multiply the numerators, 1 and 12. 1 x 12 = 12. Write the product, 12, in the numerator of the answer.

Now, you'll just have to do the same thing with the denominators. [5] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. Multiply 2 and 48 to find the new denominator. 2 x 48 = 96. Write this answer in the denominator of the new fraction. Therefore, the new fraction is 12/96. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Simplify the fraction . The last step is to simplify the result if it can be done. To simplify a fraction, you have to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of both the numerator and the denominator. The GCF is the largest number that can be evenly divided into both numbers. [7] X Research source In the case of 12 and 96, 12 happens to evenly divide into 96. So, divide 12 by 12 to get 1, and divide 96 by 12 to get 8. Therefore, 12/96 ÷ 12/12 = 1/8. [8] X Research source If both numbers are even, you can also start by dividing them both by 2 and keep going. 12/96 ÷ 2/2 = 6/48 ÷ 2/2 = 3/24. Then you may notice that 3 goes evenly into 24, so you can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3 to get 1/8. 3/24 ÷ 3/3 = 1/8."

Now, find the reciprocal of 18/20 which is 20/18 and change the division sign to a multiplication sign. So, 1/2 ÷ 18/20 = 1/2 x 20/18. [9] X Research source"

If you multiply the numerators, 1 and 20, you get the result of 20 in the numerator. If you multiply the denominators, 2 and 18, you get 36 in the numerator. The product of the fractions is 20/36. 4 is the largest number that is evenly divisible by both the numerator and the denominator of this fraction, so divide each by 4 to get the simplified answer. 20/36 ÷ 4/4 = 5/9.
