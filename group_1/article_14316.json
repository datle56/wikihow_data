Adjust your gear's parameters in the pop-up window, and click \"Apply\" when done. Be sure to check the \"Live Preview\" box to see the effect of your parameter changes in real time. From this same tab, you may render a \"rack gear\" if your design calls for it. If you are content with the rendered gear, feel free to start customizing and coloring it as is!"

The hole for the axis is another circle aligned to the center and subtracted from the wheel. Other gears coupled with this first one must have similar teeth, so use the Gear plugin and change only the number of teeth, or duplicate your first gear and adjust each copy accordingly. You may want to increase the complexity further by adding some parallel gears, which may have their own parameters (as long as they are not coupled with the initial gears). [1] X Research source"

Of course, metallic is not a color. it is created by light reflection, so we need a multi-stop gradient (a gradient with more than two colors). A metallic gold should contain a succession of lighter and darker shades of yellow, and maybe also a bit of orange. A metallic bronze should be yellow with a shade of green (copper oxidation is green). A metallic steel should contains greys. A metallic chrome is also made up of more reflective shades of grey (more contrast, from almost black to almost white), while silver includes less reflective greys."
