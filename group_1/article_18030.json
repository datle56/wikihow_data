      "title": "Place a square piece of paper on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Place a square piece of paper on a flat surface. “It doesn’t have to be special origami paper. It can be printer paper, copy paper, really any paper available,” Sato says. Place the origami paper on a hard, flat surface in front of you. If you don’t have a square sheet of paper, making one is simple: Orient a rectangular sheet of paper so that the shorter edge faces you. Fold the bottom right corner up to the opposite edge, then unfold. Do the same action with the bottom left edge of the paper. Fold the top of the paper down, creating a crease across the paper where the other 2 creases meet the paper’s edge. Use a pair of scissors to cut across this crease."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold and unfold the paper in half diagonally, twice.",
      "content": "Fold and unfold the paper in half diagonally, twice. Take 1 corner of the square paper and fold it so that it meets the opposite corner. Crease the fold with your thumb. Then, unfold it and do the same thing to the other 2 corners, creating 2 creases diagonally across the paper that form an “X.” [1] X Research source If you followed our instructions to make a square piece of paper out of a rectangular sheet, skip this step—you already have these folds. Homayoon tells us that this version of an origami cube is also known as a “water bomb,” since you can fill it up with water and throw it like a water balloon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over, then fold and unfold the bottom edge upward.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over, then fold and unfold the bottom edge upward. Flip the paper so that the creases point upward, like a tent. Then, grab the bottom edge of the paper and fold it up to the top edge. Crease it with your finger, then unfold it. [2] X Research source Sato recommends creasing with your fingernail, a ruler, or a butter knife to achieve a nice, crisp crease."
    },
    {
      "title": "Collapse the square into a triangle along the creases.",
      "content": "Collapse the square into a triangle along the creases. Now, you have 3 creases: 2 diagonal, and 1 horizontal. Push the two halves of this horizontal crease together, so that they touch, and so the paper naturally folds along the diagonal creases, creating a triangular, tent-like shape. Flatten the tent-like shape along the existing creases. [3] X Research source Homayoon says, \"I take the top edge and fold it down to the bottom edge, then I tuck the corners in.\" This is known as a “water bomb base,” and is the starting fold for many origami projects."

    {
      "title": "Fold the topmost bottom right corner up to the top corner.",
      "content": "Fold the topmost bottom right corner up to the top corner. Your triangle has 2 “layers” with flaps. Homayoon says to take the bottom right corner of the top layer and fold it up to the top of the triangle. This makes a smaller triangle in the center of your paper. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the right corner of the resulting triangle to the center line.",
      "content": "Fold the right corner of the resulting triangle to the center line. Take the right corner of this new small triangle and fold it to the left, so that the point meets the centerline of the paper. You’ve made and even smaller triangle now! [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slip the top flap into the new triangle.",
      "content": "Slip the top flap into the new triangle. Grab the triangular flap at the top of your piece of paper. Bring it down toward the small triangle. Notice how this triangle has a pocket. Homayoon says to tuck this top flap into the pocket so that it’s snug, and gently crease it so that it stays."

      "title": "Repeat steps 5-7 for the left side.",
      "content": "Repeat steps 5-7 for the left side. Repeat the last 3 steps, this time on the left side of the project, so that the left and right sides mirror each other. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Flip the paper over and repeat steps 5-8 on the other side. Turn the paper over and repeat the last 4 steps on the other side, so that your paper no longer looks like a triangle, but instead looks like a small hexagon, with 6 sides. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold and unfold the top and bottom triangular sections toward the center.",
      "content": "Fold and unfold the top and bottom triangular sections toward the center. Take the top corner of the hexagon and fold it down so the point touches the center, then unfold it. Do the same with the bottom triangular section, folding it upward, then unfolding it. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pick up the paper and spread each flap.",
      "content": "Pick up the paper and spread each flap. Hold the paper's bottom point and spread out the 4 edges so that they fan out, and your paper shape becomes 3D, says Homayoon."

      "title": "Blow into the hole at the bottom point until the cube takes shape.",
      "content": "Blow into the hole at the bottom point until the cube takes shape. Now, gently put your mouth to the hole at the bottom of the 3D shape, and blow into it, like you’re blowing up a balloon. The paper with inflate, and your origami cube is finished! [9] X Research source You may need to pat and push the cube with your fingers to shape it up a bit after inflating it. Do this gently, without crushing the paper."

      "content": "Gather 6 square sheets of paper in 2+ different colors. This version of the cube is made of 6 different pieces of paper. Customize your cube by mixing and matching as many colors as you want. Sato tells us that if you don’t have square paper, “it’s easy to make a square from regular paper.” Just check out our tutorial."

[10] X Research source We’re folding each piece of paper into a separate, identical unit called a “Sonobe module.” Sonobe modules are used to make many different origami shapes, including a cube."

Take the top corner of the right flap, which rests along the vertical center line of the rectangle, and tuck it under itself, so that it looks like a triangle was cut out of the top of the flap.

      "content": "Tuck the triangle flaps of 2 modules into the pockets of 1. Notice how each module has 2 triangles on either side. Each module also has triangular “pockets” near the center. Take a module, and tuck one of its triangular flaps into one of the pockets of another module.

Fold upward along the lines of this central square so that it creates a 3D box shape. As you do, tuck each triangular flap into the corresponding pocket that it meets as you fold it.
