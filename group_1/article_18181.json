      "title": "Hand-wash your piece if it’s stained or creased.",
      "content": "Hand-wash your piece if it’s stained or creased. Washing your finished cross stitch piece isn’t totally necessary, but many people prefer to do it if there’s a stain on the front or if the aida is very creased. If you do want to wash your cross stitch, fill a shallow dish with lukewarm water and 2 drops of mild dish soap. Soak your project in the soapy water for about 5 minutes, then dump out the soapy water and refill the dish with fresh water. Let your piece soak in the fresh water for another 5 minutes. [1] X Research source Don’t scrub or rub your project while it’s submerged. Scrubbing or rubbing harshly could damage your stitching, and it may cause your colors to bleed. If you do choose to wash your cross stitch, be sure that you used color-fast floss or thread. Otherwise, your colors may bleed."

      "title": "Lay the project flat on a towel to air dry completely.",
      "content": "Lay the project flat on a towel to air dry completely. Lay a kitchen towel down on a flat surface, then take your project out of the water and place it on the towel. Be sure to let it dry completely, which could take up to 8 hours depending on the size of the project. [2] X Research source If you’d like to, you can gently blot your project with a clean towel once you take it out of the water. However, avoid any harsh scrubbing, or else you could damage your threads."

      "title": "Iron your project on low heat.",
      "content": "Iron your project on low heat. Ironing is a crucial step before framing: it gets rid of lumps and bumps so your piece sits flat. Spread your cross stitch out on an ironing board, then gently go over the front and back 2 to 3 times until it’s completely smooth. Keep the iron on low heat, and don’t use a steam setting as you iron. [3] X Research source If you washed your piece, make sure it’s 100% dry before ironing. Otherwise, you could damage your cross stitch."

      "content": "Cut a piece of cardboard down to the size of your frame. Open up your frame and pull out the piece of glass inside of it. Trace around the glass and cut the piece of cardboard down to size. [4] X Research source Try to use thin but sturdy cardboard, like that from a cereal box. Thick cardboard may make your project too bulky to frame. Your frame may come with a piece of cardboard inside already. If so, you can just use that."

    {
      "title": "Center the cardboard onto the back of your project.",
      "content": "Center the cardboard onto the back of your project. Lay your cross stitch down on a flat surface with the front face-down. Place the piece of cardboard on the back, getting it as close to the center as you can. [5] X Research source It’s okay if your cardboard isn’t 100% centered right now, because you’ll be able to make adjustments later on. Just get it as close as you can to make things easier on yourself."

      "title": "Thread a needle with sewing thread.",
      "content": "Thread a needle with sewing thread . In the lacing method, you use sewing thread to sew the back of your piece tightly around the cardboard. Pick out a sewing thread (any color will do, since it will be hidden behind your project), and thread it through a sewing needle. [6] X Research source Sewing thread is ideal here, because it’s stronger and sturdier than embroidery floss."

      "title": "Sew the right and left sides together over the cardboard.",
      "content": "Sew the right and left sides together over the cardboard. Start near the bottom of the cardboard, and insert your needle into the outer edge of your cross stitch piece. Pull the needle through and across the back, then insert it into the left side of the piece. Keep sewing back and forth until you reach the top of the project, then tie your needle off. [7] X Research source Space your stitches about 1 cm (0.39 in) together or less. The closer your stitches are together, the more secure your project will be. Take a look at your cross stitch and see if it’s still centered. If not, adjust the piece to center it before moving on."

    {
      "title": "Sew the top and bottom together over the cardboard.",
      "content": "Sew the top and bottom together over the cardboard. Thread your needle again, then insert it into the bottom of your project. Bring your needle up over the back of your piece, then grab the top of the piece and insert your needle through it. Just like you did earlier, keep working back and forth until you’ve sewn the bottom to the top. [8] X Research source Once you’re done, cut the thread and tie a knot in it. The back of your piece might look a little messy, but that’s okay! It will be hidden inside of your frame."

      "content": "Insert your cross stitch into your frame. Place the glass piece back inside of your frame if you haven’t already. Settle your cross stitch behind the glass, then put the back on your fame. You can now hang up your cross stitch to display it for all your guests to see. [9] X Research source If you used a thick piece of cardboard, the back may not fit on your frame, and that’s okay. You can cover the back with a piece of paper using glue, or you can simply leave the back exposed. Since it will be up against the wall, no one will see it."

Use the glass from the frame as a guide to cut your cardboard down to size. [10] X Research source Use a thin piece of cardboard to avoid making your project too bulky. If your frame came with a sturdy piece of cardboard inside, feel free to use that."

Stick a pin into the edge of the cardboard to hold the aida in place. Then, do the same thing with the bottom of the piece. [12] X Research source It’s okay if your cross stitch doesn’t seem secure yet, because you’ll be adding a lot more pins."

Do this around the top, bottom and both sides of your piece to secure it. [13] X Research source When you’re done pinning, you’ll still have some excess fabric on the back to deal with. Don’t worry—you’ll be taking care of that in the next step."

Use pins to attach the edge of the aida to the back of the cardboard. Fold the corners over themselves and use more pins to keep them in place.
