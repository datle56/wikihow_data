      "content": "Stand in a circle with the other dancers. This dance is traditionally done with everyone standing in a circle, with enough space between each person so that people can move around without bumping into one another. You should have about an arm's length between you and the people on either side of you. However, if you're performing the dance for an audience, then the dancers will all stand facing the front, in multiple staggered rows if necessary, so everyone can see your moves."

Simply place that right foot out in front of you and let it hang a few inches from the floor or just move it out in front of you and point your foot on the floor. You can keep your hands on your hips or at your sides. Most people like to sing the song along with doing the motions, so you can join the singing! This can get your energy up and make it easier to remember what moves to do next."
