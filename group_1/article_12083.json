There are many passages in the Bible that address grief and the death of children that you can include in your message: “For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Romans 8:38-39 [5] X Research source “Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.

      "content": "Islam In Islam, all children go to Jannah when they die to be taken care of by Ibrahim (AS) and his wife Sara (AS). According to Hadith, children prepare a place in Jannah for their parents and don’t rest until they have been reunited. [8] X Research source “We set off, and we came to a verdant garden, in which were all the colors of spring, where there was a man who was so tall that I could hardly see his head in the sky. Around the man was the largest number of children I had ever seen…As for the tall man who was in the garden, that was Abraham. As for the children who were around him, these are all the children who died in a state of fitrah.” [9] X Research source Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “When a person’s child dies, Allah says to His angels, ‘You have taken the child of My slave.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘You have taken the apple of his eye.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘What did My slave say?’ They say, ‘He praised you and said “Innaa Lillaahi wa Inna Ilayhi Raaji’oon (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return).’ Allah says, ‘Build for My slave a house in Paradise and call it the house of praise.’” Riyad as-Salihin 922, Book 6, Hadith 29 [10] X Research source Abu Hassaan said: I said to Abu Hurayrah, “Two sons of mine have died. Will you not narrate to us a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) that will comfort us in our loss?” He said: “Yes, their children are the little ones of Paradise, and one of them will meet his father – or his parents – and take hold of his garment – or his hand – as I am taking hold of the edge of this garment of yours, and he will not let go until Allah admits him and his father to Paradise.” Sahih Muslim 2635, Book 45, Hadith 198 [11] X Research source “Innaa Lillaahi wa Inna Ilayhi Raaji'oon. To Allah we belong and to Him is our return. I know Samy is being taken care of in Jannah , Alhamdulillah that we were blessed with knowing him.” “May Allah grant you peace in your patience. I don’t know why He has asked you to endure such pain, but I hope you can take solace knowing Jordan is playing in the garden, taken care of, and waiting to bring you into Jannah .” “You will see Adnan again, inshAllah, he is waiting for you in Jannah . I can’t imagine the pain you’re enduring right now, but every minute of patience is a minute closer to seeing him again.” “I hope to support you in your grief, the Prophet (SAW) said his grief would crush mountains, and cried for the loss of his son. Allah (SWT) does not want you to hold this pain inside of you, alone. I want to be there for you, to be a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen. I am so sorry, and inshAllah you will see your son again.”"
