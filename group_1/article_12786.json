      "content": "Organizing your wardrobe will make looking through your clothes much easier. Take out everything and put it on your bed. If something no longer fits or you just don't like it anymore, then put it in a plastic bag ready to take to a charity shop. There's nothing wrong with getting rid of unwanted clothes. [2] X Research source If you find clothes which are too badly ripped, damaged, stained or worn for someone to wear or ever look good again, use them as rags or put them in the bin. You could fold jeans, dresses or skirts in one area and hoodies, jumpers, t-shirts and vests in another."

      "content": "It's a perfect opportunity to seek out some bargains and find pieces you love. Don't feel that you have to go to really expensive stores- TXMAXX, Primark and New Look are all great as they have loads of clothes, shoes etc, as well as some great jewelry. Shop wherever you want, and you can buy anything. Some great things to own as essentials are below, as long as some others which are just for fun but will add a real interest and look to your wardrobe.

Jeans- boot cut, wide leg or skinny. [5] X Research source Hoodies- like jumpers and cardigans, they come in bright colors and are casually cosy. Jumpers- forget heavy, itchy uncomfortable sweaters- a colorful, stretchy one in either V/round necked is much better. Cardigans- so cardigans may not be your idea of fashion, but have you considered long ones? They are simple but elegant. T-shirts/shirts- some basic, well-fitting ones in colors like navy, grey, white and black. [6] X Expert Source Cassandra Sethi Personal Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 31 August 2021. You could get some with really cool pictures or patterns which look great on everyone. A pair of comfortable trousers- not jean and not sweatpants! Proper trousers are versatile and can be dressed up or down. [7] X Expert Source Cassandra Sethi Personal Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 31 August 2021. Dresses/skirts- they don't have to be plain or boring! Dresses with a plain top but a ruffle/any other effect skirt look amazing, and you can choose from classic styles to more modern trends. Skirts don't come in just plain black or cotton- how about a colorful pattern? One big print? High or low waistband? They aren't essential but for a party or glamorous event, they are a good choice. Pyjamas- still look good at nighttime! A pair which are quite heavy should be worn in winter but for spring/summer when its getting a bit hotter, a lighter pair are good to have as spares. Find a pair with a really sweet design. Underwear- should fit perfectly, and not be boring! There are lots of of knicker and sock styles, and bras should be supportive and so you can't feel them very much, i.e. not too small or too big."
