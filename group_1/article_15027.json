      "content": "Drain out any standing water located in the wall. Depending on the severity of the water damage, your wall may contain a significant amount of standing water. To check, drill a small hole into the wall about 2 in (5.1 cm) off the ground and see if water comes out. If any does, drill small holes along the wall to drain the water. Keep your holes about 2 in (5.1 cm) off the ground and space them so that they are between 16 and 24 in (41 and 61 cm) apart. Before creating your holes, locate the studs inside your wall. For the best possible results, drill in the area between these spots."

      "content": "Turn on your house's A/C to reduce the humidity in the air. If the moisture in your wall is coming primarily from the humidity in the air, try turning on your house's central air-conditioning system. Warm air retains more moisture than cool air, so chilling your room will lower the humidity significantly and make it easier to dry out the wall. [7] X Research source If you don't have a central A/C system, try purchasing a portable or window unit."

      "content": "Open up your house to increase air circulation. To help replace your house's old, moist air with fresh, dry air, try opening up any doors and windows located near the moisture damaged area. This will increase air circulation around the damp wall, speeding up the drying process. Do not open your windows and doors if you're using a dehumidifier. For the best results, use this method during the day while the sun is out. This method may not work if you live in an extremely humid area."
