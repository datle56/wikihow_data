      "content": "Grind up 1 tsp (5 g) of flaxseed with a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Grind whole flax seeds up before you eat them so your body can more easily digest the nutrients contained within. The shells themselves aren’t particularly beneficial, and make it harder for your body to get at the good stuff inside the seeds. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Grind your flax seeds to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle, food processor, or even a coffee grinder, then set them to the side. Or, grind more flaxseed than you think you’ll need, then store the ground flaxseed in a sealed container to use within 3-4 days. If you have pre-ground flaxseeds , then don't worry about grinding them up again. This only applies to whole flaxseeds."

Add 1 tsp (5 g) of ground flaxseed into 1 cup (250ml) of water and stir it gently for just a few moments to prevent it from bunching up. Then, let it sit until it takes on a gel-like consistency. [4] X Research source Warm water works best, as it tends to draw out more nutrients, but go ahead and use cold water or place the glass in the fridge if that’s more enjoyable for you to drink. [5] X Research source Or, soak the flaxseeds overnight. This is better for mixing the water into other recipes than for drinking straight, as it tends to be much more gel-like and has a much stronger flavor."

[6] X Research source Or, if you don't mind having a little crunch in your drink, feel free to leave the larger flaxseed bits in the water. Add 1–2 tsp (4.9–9.9 mL) of honey or lemon juice, if you’d like a tastier drink. If you plan to use the water in blended drinks, leave the flaxseeds in, as these will be ground up and disintegrate in the blender. Store flaxseed water in the fridge for 1-2 days, though it’s best to drink it as soon as it's ready to avoid spoiling."

[9] X Research source If you'd prefer to not have grounds in your tea, strain them out before you start to drink it. Drop a tea bag in the hot water as well to mask some of the flaxseed flavor. Herbal teas such as peppermint or chamomile work best, and have a well-known relaxing effect. Lemon tea or ginger tea are known to be good for your health as well."
