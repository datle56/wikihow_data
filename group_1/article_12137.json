      "content": "Cut out labels to create a simple organizing system. Sometimes, the best way to decorate a container is to simply label it, especially if you need to use it in a professional environment. Cut a piece of single-colored construction paper into a thin strip, then write a label on it in clear, bold letters. Fix the label to your container using tape or glue. To make your labels pop, glue them to a slightly larger piece of colored paper before putting them on the container."

      "title": "Add lettering to create labels and messages.",
      "content": "Add lettering to create labels and messages. For larger containers, craft lettering may be a good option. If your letters come with adhesive backs, apply them as is. If they don’t, use a small amount of glue to keep them in place. Along with names and standard labels, letters can be used to write: A motivational message for containers holding school supplies. A favorite quote or book passage for a media box. A joke label, like the word ‘Zoo’ for a container filled with stuffed animals."

      "content": "Add ribbon to your container. Ribbon and similar trims can give your container a more elegant feel.
