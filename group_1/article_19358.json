      "content": "Get filler injections. Dermal filler is injected directly into your cleft chin to fill in the visible gap. This raises the skin over your cleft and leaves you with a smooth, even chin immediately after the injection. The results are not permanent as filler typically lasts 6 to 12 months, so you need to keep receiving injections to maintain your results. [1] X Research source The timespan between injections depends on the type of filler you use and how quickly your body metabolizes the filler. [2] X Research source The most common side effects are bruising and soreness, which typically only lasts for a few days. [3] X Research source Most clefts can be filled in with 1 to 2 syringes of filler, with each syringe costing around $600-$1,000. The type of filler you use, your location, and the provider you go to will determine your cost. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a fat transfer. Your own fat can act as a natural filler to immediately fill in your cleft chin and smooth the area over.

      "content": "Some people claim facial exercises can soften a cleft chin. Face yoga is a popular technique where you use your fingers and hands to pull and sculpt areas of your face to massage and strengthen your muscles. While there is no solid evidence that face yoga can get rid of your cleft chin, some people report that it has helped reduce its appearance. Chin massage : After washing your face, apply a facial oil to your hands. Clench your fist and starting at the bottom of your chin, roll it upwards, making sure it presses into your cleft. Complete this exercise daily, repeating it several times. This may reduce the tension of your muscles and smooth out your cleft. Tongue exercise : Place your tongue to the left side of your mouth and push out, keeping it there for 30 seconds. Repeat this on the right side of your mouth and the front. This exercise claims to reduce your cleft by relaxing your lower jaw muscles, which work harder than your upper jaw and may be the cause of your cleft."
