Lift chairs, tables, TV stands, and other smaller items, and take them to another room. If you have large heavy items that are difficult to move, such as couches or bookcases, you should put small pieces of aluminum foil under their feet. [1] X Research source"

Use a carpet cleaning solution, and spray it over the affected area. Wait for fifteen or twenty minutes. Blot the stain out with a damp cloth or sponge, but do not rub. [2] X Research source If you do not have a spot cleaning solution on hand, you can use shaving cream. Spray the cream onto the stain, and wait 30 minutes. Blot it away, and spray the spot with vinegar. Wipe away any leftover residue. You can make your own spot cleaning solution by mixing 1/4 cup (75 g) of salt, 1/4 cup (100 g) of Borax, and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of vinegar. Put the paste on stained areas, and wait until it dries before you vacuum it up. [3] X Research source If you don’t have Borax, you could use baking soda or washing soda instead."

      "title": "Rent or buy a carpet cleaner.",
      "content": "Rent or buy a carpet cleaner. A carpet cleaner is a special machine that looks like a vacuum, but it uses steam and special cleaning solution to deep clean your carpets. If you have many rugs and carpets in your home or if you deep clean your carpets more than once or twice a year, you may want to invest in a carpet cleaner. If you’re not ready to commit, you can rent these machines for a day from grocery stores, hardware stores, or even pet stores. Make sure you get a cleaner that you can easily lift or move. Remember that once you fill it with water, the machine will weigh even more. [4] X Research source No matter if you buy or rent a steam cleaner, you will have to purchase the cleaning solution yourself. The cleaning solution is often sold next to the machine itself. You may also be able to find it in the cleaning aisle of the store."

      "title": "Fill the machine.",
      "content": "Fill the machine. You will need to put both water and cleaning solution in the tank. Each brand of carpet cleaner has slightly instructions for this, so be sure to read the manual before you begin. Generally, however, you will add a certain amount of formula to a small tank before adding water to the tank. Some carpet cleaners may also have a separate tank for just water. Once you have filled the tank, you can plug the machine in. Do not plug in the machine before adding the water and cleaning solution. If someone in your home has respiratory issues or if you are uncomfortable with the use of chemicals in your home, you can use a cup of white vinegar instead of cleaning solution in the tank. [5] X Research source Be aware that this may void the warranty on the machine, and you may need to do a second cleaning for the best results."

You want to end at the door, so that you can leave when you are finished without stepping on the clean and wet carpet. [7] X Research source If the carpet is still visibly dirty, let it dry for a few hours, and go over it a second time. If you start by the door, you may find yourself trapped in a corner.
