      "title": "Sort and wash the beans.",
      "content": "Sort and wash the beans. Dried beans are among the most nutritious and affordable foods you'll find in your local grocery store. However, they require a little extra work before you can start cooking them. Start by pouring your beans out on a flat surface and looking for any that are shriveled or discolored. Discard these beans (and, if you find them, any small rocks). Next, drop your beans into strainer and rinse them gently under a little running water. This helps to remove any small imperfections or dirt particles you may have missed. The process for cooking beans is basically the same no matter how much you're cooking at once. The rest of this section will assume you're cooking 1 pound of beans ( about 3 cups dry or 6-7 cups when cooked ), which will feed four or five people easily. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "If you can, soak the beans overnight.",
      "content": "If you can, soak the beans overnight. Drop your rinsed and sorted beans into a large stove pot, cover them with an inch of water, and set them in the fridge overnight. They will soften slightly and absorb some of the water by the next day. They may appear larger and somewhat wrinkled. This is normal. This isn't essential , but it's always a good idea if you have time. Letting the beans soak will shorten their cooking time, help them cook more evenly, and make them slightly easier to digest. In addition (there's no nice way to say this), soaked beans tend to cause less flatulence."

    {
      "title": "Bring the beans to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring the beans to a boil. If you let your beans soak overnight, pull them out of the fridge, drain them, and re-cover them with an inch of water. You can season the beans before cooking. If you didn't soak your beans, transfer them directly to the stove. Heat on \"High\" until the water reaches a moderate boil. For seasoning you could add paprika, oregano, thyme, pepper, black pepper, and/or cayenne pepper. If needed, you can keep the water from foaming or boiling over by adding a dash of vegetable or olive oil. If you are using the garlic, onions, and other optional ingredients above, add them to the water as soon as you begin heating the pot."

      "title": "Reduce the heat and allow the beans to simmer.",
      "content": "Reduce the heat and allow the beans to simmer. As soon as the beans reach a healthy boil, turn the heat to \"Low.\" The boiling should reduce to a gentle simmer. Stir gently. Leave the beans on the stone with the lid on (but tilted to allow the steam to escape)."

      "title": "Start checking for done-ness after about an hour.",
      "content": "Start checking for done-ness after about an hour. Dry beans almost always take a long time to cook. You may stir the beans occasionally every 15 minutes or so, but don't expect them to be anywhere near done before at least an hour or so. At this time, you may check the beans by taking one in your hands and crushing it (after it has cooled, of course). Don't eat red kidney beans that are raw or obviously undercooked. This can cause a temporary condition similar to food poisoning (see \"Tips\" below). If the beans are even a little \"crunchy,\" they aren't done. You want beans that are completely smooth and soft — this texture should be almost \"creamy.\" Be patient. A batch of dry beans can take anywhere from one to four hours to cook completely. Resist the temptation to crank up the heat — this will just make them cook unevenly."

    {
      "title": "Add a little salt when the beans are slightly tender.",
      "content": "Add a little salt when the beans are slightly tender. As soon as you notice the beans start to lose some of their \"crunchy\" texture, add a few teaspoons of salt to the water. This will give the beans a pleasantly savory taste. Make sure that you don't add the salt before this point. Adding it before the beans have started to break down will lengthen the cooking time and make the beans cook unevenly. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cool and store the beans.",
      "content": "Cool and store the beans. Continue stirring and tasting the beans every 10 to 15 minutes. When the beans all seem to have a soft texture without a hint of \"crunchiness,\" they're ready to eat! Let the beans cool in their cooking liquid, then serve or transfer to the fridge (keeping the beans in their liquid). If you think the beans are especially watery, you can drain some of the liquid, but try to avoid pouring it all off. Leaving the beans in their cooking liquid helps maintain their texture and flavor (plus, the liquid itself is flavorful and full of nutrients). [4] X Research source You can even use it as a nutritious base for soups."

      "content": "Prepare the beans for cooking as above. Cooking in a pressure cooker (or a slow cooker, crock pot, etc.) is basically the same as the stove top process, but with a few minor changes. You'll want to start with exactly the same steps as you'd use above: sort and wash the beans, then cover them with water and let them soak overnight if you have time."

      "content": "Count on a much quicker cooking time. Pressure cookers cook beans very quickly compared to ordinary stove top cooking. Most recipes call for anywhere between 22 and 30 minutes of cooking time. [6] X Research source You may want to check for done-ness after about 20–22 minutes and adjust the cooking time accordingly. When the beans are done, release the pressure under cold running water, then drain and rinse the beans. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Check whether the beans are plain or flavored. Compared to dry beans, canned beans are a mixed bag. Some cans contain beans that are \"plain\" except for the preservative fluid they are sitting in. Other cans contain beans that are sitting in a sauce. Some cans even contain beans that are meant to be heated and eaten on their own. A quick check of the label should tell you which type of beans you have. When in doubt about how to use canned beans, check the back of the label. Many will include sample recipes and serving suggestions."

      "content": "Rinse plain beans. Plain canned beans usually come in a clear, slimy brine. This works well for keeping them fresh and it's perfectly safe to eat, but it can taste unpleasantly \"artificial.\" All it takes to get rid of this gross substance is to pour the contents of the can into a strainer and rinse them with cold water for a few seconds."

      "content": "Heat the beans in a saucepan or microwave. Canned beans come pre-cooked, so all you need to do is heat them up. If you're using plain beans that you've just rinsed, add a small amount of water to the container you're heating the beans in. If you're using beans in a sauce, you can usually just heat the beans in their liquid without any extra work. If you're using a microwave, be sure to heat the beans in a microwave-safe container like a ceramic or glass bowl (rather than a metal or plastic one). If you're camping, you can cook a can of beans-in-sauce directly in its can. Simply open the top of the can and carefully place it over your campfire. This is easiest if your fire pit has a metal grate, but if it doesn't, you can just balance the can on a rock near the edge of the fire. Be careful — it will get very hot."

      "content": "Alternatively, add plain beans to other recipes. Since canned beans are already cooked, it's easy to use them in other recipes. If these recipes require cooking, add the beans at the end of the cooking process so they don't over-cook. For cold recipes, you can usually use canned beans as-is. In the section below, you'll find a few recipe suggestions that you can use red kidney beans in. Except where noted, you can use cooked dry beans or plain canned beans interchangeably."

      "content": "Try making chili . This popular, spicy stew is perhaps the most famous recipe for using red kidney beans in the world. Traditionally served with meat (\"con carne\"), chili can be served in virtually endless ways. Try it with an assortment of veggies for a vegetarian treat or pair it with a serving of cornbread for a classic American frontier dish. If you're using dry beans for this recipe, you'll want to cook them until they're most of the way done on their own, then transfer them to the chili pot with the liquid ingredients. This prevents them from over- or under- cooking. If you're using canned beans, add them near the end of the cooking process."

You can also add ham (or ham flavoring) for a classic combination, though sausage, chicken, beef, and other meats work just as well. There's no \"right\" way to make bean soup, so feel free to get creative! Here is a great recipe to get you started. [9] X Research source If you're using dry beans, you can add the other ingredients to the pot the beans are cooking in as soon as they're most of the way cooked. If you're looking for inspiration, a can of diced tomatoes makes a great addition to almost any bean soup. Plus, it will do wonders for the presentation, turning the greyish water to a pleasant brownish-orange."

Drain them, wash them, and toss them together with a little olive oil and salt for a low-calorie salad that's also a great source of protein and fiber. You can try adding chopped red onions, tomatoes, and corn to add tangy flavor, but the great thing bean salad is that it's usually great on its own, too!"
