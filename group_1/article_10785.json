      "content": "Get familiar with Excel. Excel is a spreadsheet software program that allows users to manage data and perform calculations with formulas. Excel spreadsheets are organized by rows and columns. You can install a desktop version of Excel on your Mac or PC. Or, you can use a free online app for your smartphone, tablet or computer. Each of these versions functions a little bit differently. [1] X Research source Excel has been in existence for many years, and every year or so, Microsoft releases a new, updated version. Each of these versions also works a little bit differently. [2] X Research source In Excel, rows run horizontally and are ordered by number. Columns run vertically and are ordered by letter. Each box where a row and column intersect is called a cell. The cell is named according to its row and column. For example, a cell in the fifth row of column D is named D5 (column D, row 5). [3] X Research source Understand the difference between a worksheet and a workbook in Excel. A worksheet is a single spreadsheet. A workbook is an Excel file that contains one or more spreadsheets. Each worksheet in an Excel workbook is in a separate tab. By default, new Excel workbooks have three tabs. You can add more if needed. To make a basic check register, you only use one tab. To create a function for categorizing expenses in a check register, you will use two tabs."

On a PC with an operating system older than Windows 7, begin by clicking on the start menu in the lower left hand corner of your desktop. From the popup menu, click on Programs. From the next popup menu, click on Microsoft Office. Then click on Microsoft Office Excel. At this point you will have a blank excel spreadsheet on your desktop. [4] X Research source On a PC with Windows 7 or newer, click on the Windows icon in the lower left hand corner of your screen. Then click on the Microsoft Excel tile to open Excel. You will see a page with your recent files listed on the left and template options for new documents on the right. Click on the first template option, Blank Workbook, to open a new Excel spreadsheet. To open Excel on a Mac, click on Excel in the dock. Click “File” in the menu bar. Click “Open” and then click “New.” This will bring you to a new, blank spreadsheet."

[5] X Research source Enter the word “DATE” in cell B1 (column B, row 1). This is where you will enter the date of the transaction. Move one cell to the right to cell C1 (column C, row 1). Type “ITEM #”. Here you will enter the check number or the type of transaction, such as “ATM” or “deposit.” Move one cell to the right to cell D1 (column D, row 1). Type “PAYEE.” This is the person to whom a check was made payable or to whom money was paid. Move one cell to the right to cell E1 (column E, row 1). Type “DESCRIPTION.” Record any details you want to remember about the transaction. Move one cell to the right to cell F1 (column F, row 1). Type “DEBIT.” This is where you record money that leaves your account, also known as outflow. Move one cell to the right to cell G1 (column G, row 1). Type “EXPENSE CATEGORY.” You will leave this blank for now. Options for this column will be created in a later step. Move one cell to the right to cell H1 (column H, row 1). Type “CREDIT.” This is where you record money coming into your account, also known as inflow. Move one cell to the right to cell J1 (column J, row 1). Type “INCOME CATEGORY.” As with the expense category column, options for this column will be created in a later step. Move one cell to the right to cell K1 (column K, row 1).
