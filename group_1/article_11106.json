      "content": "Visit the bathroom. Often, people who experience nausea or generalized abdominal pain are simply in need of a bowel movement. Before you try anything else, try sitting on the toilet for a few minutes while leaning forward with your knees drawn up to your chest. This position naturally encourages bowel movement without undue stress. [1] X Research source Don't try to force a bowel movement by straining or pushing. Undue force can cause serious complications such as hemorrhoids. If you have blood in your stool or your vomit, seek medical attention immediately; this is called hematochezia and hematemesis, respectively."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Use a hot water bottle, microwavable compress, or electric heating blanket and place it over your stomach for several minutes. If you don't have any of the items listed above, fill a pillowcase or clean sock with some rice and microwave it for a minute or two. For example, lie on your back with your legs and feet elevated, or crunch your knees to your chest while rocking gently. Elevating your feet will reduce pressure on the abdominal region, release pent-up gas, and relieve discomfort."

      "content": "Let yourself vomit. If you're seriously nauseated, your body might be telling you that it needs to vomit. This unpleasant action may seem like the worst-case scenario, but in fact, it's your body's way of expelling ingested bacteria, viruses, or food which are causing irritation. [3] X Research source Just be sure to visit the doctor if you continue to vomit over several days, as it could indicate a serious underlying condition. If you're nauseated but can't vomit, try nibbling on some soda crackers. Vomiting can cause dehydration quickly, so drink electrolyte-supplemented sports drinks if you're purging more than once. These replenish the sodium and potassium in your body which it needs in order to fight illness."

      "content": "Ingest prunes or other high-fiber foods. A common cause of stomach ache is constipationâ€”your body needs to move its bowels, but something is blocking or impeding this movement. Ease constipation by eating or drinking fiber-rich items such as prunes, bran, or broccoli. Prunes are particularly powerful as they contain the natural laxative sorbitol, as well as packing a mean, fiber-full punch. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If constipation persists after consuming fiber-rich foods and drinks, try a mild laxative such as a water-soluble powder or sennoside-containing tea. A cup of coffee can also stimulate your digestive tract muscles and cause a bowel movement. Don't gulp it down all day long, though. Coffee is a natural diuretic, so too much of it can cause dehydration and exacerbate constipation. [10] X Research source Prune juice is known to help stimulate the bowels and get them moving. Drink a small glass in the morning, and a small glass in the evening to help with constipation."

      "content": "Watch what you eat. If you experience indigestion or heartburn frequently, focus on treating the cause of your indigestion rather than simply addressing its symptoms. Start by monitoring your consumption and meal habits. Seemingly small habits such as eating too rapidly, taking large mouthfuls, or overeating with excessive portions can aggravate your indigestion. [12] X Expert Source David Schechter, MD Family Medicine Practitioner Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Once you've noticed your bad mealtime habits, correct them by eating smaller meals over a longer period of time.
