      "title": "Slow down if you are running and get a side cramp.",
      "content": "Slow down if you are running and get a side cramp. Most side cramps are related to strenuous exercise, like running. Reduce your pace once you feel the cramps. This will give the cramps time to subside on their own. If they don’t subside, slowing down allows you to try different methods to relieve the pain."

      "content": "Apply a light massage to the cramping area. One of the quickest ways to get rid of side cramps is to massage the area with light pressure. Place your hand on the area that hurts, usually just under your rib cage on one side. Inhale and then as you exhale, use your fingers and thumb to lightly pinch or squeeze this area. Apply pressure upward and inward, toward the center of your body. Relax your hand as you inhale and then apply light pressure with your fingers again as you exhale. Continue this light massage for five to six breaths."

      "content": "Take bigger, longer inhales and bigger, longer exhales as you run or workout. Inhaling and exhaling with bigger breaths will allow your diaphragm to relax and relieve pressure on your liver and intestines. [1] X Research source Focus on bringing your breathing into your belly, as opposed to in your lungs. This will help to oxygenate your blood and relieve pressure on your organs. You should also avoid shallow breathing when you working out. Shallow breathing keeps your diaphragm raised and can create more pressure on your ligaments. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Try to synchronize your breathing pattern with your running.",
      "content": "Try to synchronize your breathing pattern with your running. One theory on the cause of side cramps is the rhythm of your breathing as you run affects the level of pressure on the ligaments that connect your diaphragm to your liver. Synchronizing your breath with your movements should help to relieve any pressure on your diaphragm. Determine which side of your body aches. For example, maybe you are experiencing cramps on your left side. Exhale when the foot on the side that doesn’t ache hits the ground. In this example, you would exhale when your right foot hits the ground. Inhale when the foot on the side that does ache hits the ground. In this example, you would inhale when your right foot hits the ground. Maintain this breathing pattern (exhale for the side that doesn’t ache, inhale for the side that does ache) until the side stitch subsides."

Then, raise your arm on the side that is cramping straight up in the air. Lean to the opposite side to stretch the cramped side. Hold the stretch for 2-5 seconds. Relax and repeat the stretch 3-5 times."

While it's always important to eat a varied and healthy diet, these nutrients in particular are essential to your body, and they may play a role in preventing cramps. Bananas, cantaloupes, cooked spinach, potatoes, and mushrooms are all good sources of potassium, while peas, flaxseed, cooked beans, and almonds are rich in magnesium.

      "content": "Don't eat wheat-based foods, like bread or muesli, before you exercise. If you do feel you need to eat or are worried about having less energy during your workout, eat complex carbohydrates like a handful of dried berries or nuts like almonds half an hour before a run or workout. [8] X Research source Complex carbohydrates are good snacks before a run or workout because they are digested in your small intestine and have a faster gastric emptying rate, which means they leave your stomach faster. You then won’t be running or working out on a full stomach."

      "content": "Get medical attention if you experience severe abdominal cramps on your right side, nausea, and vomiting. In some cases, side cramps that are severe, especially on your right side, and occur along with other symptoms can be a sign of a more serious medical condition, including: Appendicitis: Your appendix is located on the right side of your lower abdominal. If your appendix starts to swell as the result of an infection, this can lead to some intense pain on your right side and possibly a fever. Your appendix will need to be examined as soon as possible to prevent a rupture. Treatment includes surgical removal of the appendix and if severe, possible treatment with antibiotics. Ovarian cysts: If you are a woman, severe pain on your right side could also be due to ovarian cysts. These cysts form in your ovary and can cause ovarian cancer. The cysts can be removed through a surgical procedure called a laparoscopy. A doctor would order blood work and possibly an abdominal CT to diagnose you. Other medical conditions that cause similar pain include testicular torsion, ectopic pregnancy, intussusception, intestinal malrotation, and bowel obstruction. Other causes for women include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pelvic cysts, or masses."

Gallstones are stones that form in your gall bladder and can be very painful. But they can be removed through a surgical procedure called a cholecystectomy. Biliary disease is a condition of the right upper quadrant (RUQ). This usually represents itself as right upper quadrant pain due to stretching of the capsule of the liver with inflammation. There can be stones or infection of the biliary tree that leads to this diagnosis. Usually blood work and abdominal ultrasound are used to diagnose this condition. Fever may also be associated. Surgery is the treatment option for this disease as well."

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants itself outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tubes. If an ectopic pregnancy occurs, you will feel pain based on which side the egg has implanted itself. The only treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is to terminate the pregnancy."

Gastroesophageal reflux disease may be causing your abdominal pain. Treatment with antacids may be necessary. Ulcerative colitis is unusual for this type of pain, but it does lead to belly pain with diarrhea and inflammation of the bowel."
