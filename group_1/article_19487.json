You can contract it orally by eating food prepared by an infected host or coming into contact with infected feces. Dog and cat owners, especially, can contract hookworm while handling their pets' feces. [6] X Research source Soil can become contaminated by pet feces, as well.

The dosing for this drug is the same for both adults and children. Take one 400 mg dose of Albendazole for most hookworm cases. If, after two weeks, the lab still finds eggs in your stool sample, you will take a second dose.
