      "title": "Understand that it's not your fault.",
      "content": "Understand that it's not your fault. No matter what you may have done, emotional abuse is never okay. Additionally, it's about the abuser and not about you. No one deserves to be the target of emotional abuse, so don't blame yourself. Remind yourself that what they say is a reflection of them, not you. Say to yourself, \"What they say is not about me.\""

      "content": "Recognize abusive patterns. There may be certain situations in which your parents are more likely to get abusive. You may also notice changes in your parents' mood or behavior right before abuse happens. Learning to recognize the warning signs can help you prepare yourself better or plan to avoid situations where abuse is most likely to happen. For example, if you have a parent who drinks, you may notice that they are more abusive when they have been drinking. You may also notice that particular types of abuse are likely in specific situations. For example, an abusive parent might have a tendency to put you down in front of company."

      "title": "Try to stay calm when abuse is happening.",
      "content": "Try to stay calm when abuse is happening. When someone is emotionally attacking you, it's easy to give in to the urge to yell, cry, or attack back. If your parent begins yelling at you or belittling you, stop and take a few deep breaths and slowly count to 10 in your head before you respond. This will give you a moment to calm yourself and think about what you want to do or say. [2] X Research source If you can, step out of the room for a few moments before you react. Physically separating yourself from the other person can help you get control of your emotions and collect your thoughts. Do your best to ignore what they say to you. Try to create physical distance, but if you can't leave, try turning your thoughts to something you enjoy. You might think over the lyrics of an empowering song that you enjoy, recite a poem in your mind, or go to your \"happy place.\" Remember, their words are false, and it's not okay that you are being spoken to this way."

    {
      "title": "Talk about it with your parents.",
      "content": "Talk about it with your parents. Depending on the type of abuse that is happening, you may be able to say something to your parents about it. Be clear in what you say, and if possible, include examples. Avoid being abusive back to them by name-calling, yelling, or screaming. Instead, talk calmly about your experience and how it affects you. [3] X Research source For example, you might say, “I don't know if you're aware of how mean you get when you drink,” or, “It doesn't feel right to feel so humiliated. I don't want to feel this way. Please speak more kindly to me.” Many verbally abusive parents deny that they are doing it and tell their kid to \"toughen up\" or something similar. If this happens to you, take a deep breath and step away for a few moments. You may not be able to change them, but you can change your reaction to the situation. Remind yourself that you will eventually get to move away from them."

      "title": "Let your parents know that the behavior is not acceptable.",
      "content": "Let your parents know that the behavior is not acceptable. It can be scary to stand up for yourself, but the abuse may never stop if you don't say something. When your parent says something abusive to you or uses the silent treatment, calmly say what you want to or need to say. [4] X Research source For example, say, “I know you don't think I'm doing well in school, but there's no need to call me names or make me feel bad. I am working hard.” If your parent is ignoring you or giving you the silent treatment, you could say, “I know you're mad at me, but we need to talk about it. I want to resolve this instead of ignore it.” Always prioritize your safety. If you don't feel safe standing up for yourself or you think your parents might get violent with you, this might not be the best approach."

      "title": "Express your emotions.",
      "content": "Express your emotions. You may want to talk about how the abuse makes you feel. For example, if you feel worthless or hopeless, express these things. Your parents may not even know you feel this way or how their words affect you. You can have a discussion with your parents or respond after they make a comment. When you express yourself, use “I” statements, and avoid saying things that sound like attacks or accusations. [5] X Research source For example, say, “I don't like feeling blamed. Please don't put that on me.” Say, “I feel so much pressure all around me and I can't handle it. I feel sad that I can't please you even though I want to.”"

      "content": "Minimize time around your abusive parent(s), if you can. Sometimes the best response to abuse is to avoid the abuser. This may be easier said than done when you live at home with an abusive parent or parents. If you can, find ways to minimize your time with the parent when they are being abusive, either by finding a safe space inside your home or by spending time outside your home. For example, if you sense that your parent is starting to become agitated or abusive, you might tell them that you need to get homework done, and go to your room. If you are able, get outside the house for a bit. Go to a park, go for a walk around the neighborhood, or spend some time at a friend's house. Get involved in extracurricular activities or clubs at school that keep you out of the house and away from your parents. These activities could also help you get scholarships to pay for school away from your parents. Find ways to regularly stay overnight with extended family or friends. You might offer to babysit younger cousins, housesit for out of town relatives, or take care of your elderly aunt's yard. Get a part time job so you can be out of the house. This could also allow you to save up money to move out when you're old enough."

A supportive adult may be able to offer suggestions for dealing with the situation, or help get you in touch with a professional who can help you. Keep in mind that some adults are legally required as part of their jobs to report child or teen abuse to the authorities. Your teacher or coach, for example, is required to report abuse. A relative or family friend typically is not. If you're not ready to report the abuse to anyone, or if you don't want anyone to speak to your parents about the situation, let the adult know. Ask them to respect your wishes and keep it private for now."

Be aware that counselors, therapists, and teachers are required by law to report any issues that might be a threat to your safety.

These people are required to report suspected abuse to welfare services to be investigated. Telling one of these people means that someone will likely come and investigate.

Often, emotional abuse results in feeling bad about yourself or feeling worthless or unlovable. None of these things are true. Any time you catch yourself thinking a negative thought about yourself, try to come up with a positive thought about yourself instead. [9] X Research source For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I can't do anything right,” stop and remind yourself of something you've accomplished, like a school assignment you did well on or a personal project that you're proud of. Talk to yourself the same way that you would talk to a good friend when they are feeling down.
