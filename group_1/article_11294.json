This will give you a clearer view of the room to ensure accurate measurements. [1] X Research source Vacuum or mop the floor as well, and throw away any trash or debris covering the ground."

      "content": "Start from the center of the room. Beginning from the center helps you keep the tiling pattern balanced. Mentally divide the room into 4 different quadrants and start measuring in the approximate middle. Finding the center is easiest for square or rectangular rooms. If your room is oddly shaped, start in the approximate middle."

      "content": "Measure the tile layout lines, if desired. If you are adhering many tiles, making layout lines on the floor can help you make the tile patterning even. Use a tape measure to record the length and width of your tile. Make this measurement your guide as you record how many peel-and-stick tiles you will need to cover the floor. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use chalk to mark the layout lines. Beginning from the center of the room and outward, use chalk to record where you will lay out the peel-and-stick tiles. While measuring the layout lines, mark them in chalk to use as a guideline when you cut and adhere the tiles. Make partial lines around the sides and corners of the room so you know what shape to cut certain tiles."

      "content": "Place the peel-and-stick tiles in the room for 48 hours. Leave the tiles in the room for at least 2 days before you plan to cut and adhere them. This will help them acclimate to the room's temperature so the adhesive remains sticky. Do not leave the tiles in extreme hot or cold temperatures, as this can damage the adhesive. Check the tile's installation directions for specific temperature-related instructions."

      "title": "Mark the cutting lines on your tile with chalk.",
      "content": "Mark the cutting lines on your tile with chalk. If you need to adjust your tile's size, make a line for your scissors to follow in chalk. Set a measuring stick on the tile where you want to draw your line and run your chalk across the line for accurate measurements. If you don't have a measuring stick, use another object with a flat and firm side as an alternative."

      "content": "Adjust the tile's sizes later as needed. If, while aligning the sides and corners of the room, you notice that your tiles are the wrong size, you may need to make adjustments. Cut the new tile size with the utility knife and align it with the floor measurements. Adjust the sizing before taking off the tile's adhesive backing. Buy at least 1-2 additional tiles in case you accidentally cut a tile too small."

Roll back and forth over the tile several times, pressing into the pin with your body weight to apply firm pressure. You should roll the tiles one at a time after you adhere them to the floor. If you don't have a rolling pin, you can also step on the tile. Your body weight will help secure the tile in place. [5] X Research source"
