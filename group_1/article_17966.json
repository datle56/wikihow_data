[4] X Research source If you don’t have drawers, professional organizer Julie Naylon recommends putting them in an easy access spot and “getting bins or baskets” to put them in. According to organizational specialist Robert Rybarski, one of the best ways to store underwear is to purchase “ dividers that separate your drawer into sections” and categorize them by color or how frequently you wear them."

Repeat this until the bundle is rolled into itself 3 times. [13] X Research source You are basically reversing the narrow waistband folds you made earlier in the process. This method is perfect if you don’t want your underwear to come undone in your drawer. This folding technique might look a little tricky, but think of it as rolling a pair of crew socks into a ball."
