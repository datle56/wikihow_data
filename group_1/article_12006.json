      "title": "Be polite and direct when addressing an issue.",
      "content": "Be polite and direct when addressing an issue. Don’t beat around the bush when you have a problem with your coworker. It is usually easier to address the problem as soon as it comes up, rather than stew over it or get someone else involved. [1] X Research source Be informal about it the first time you address the person. You could say, “Hey, Jack, I’ve been noticing that you’ve been returning the truck almost on empty lately. Could you remember to bring it back with a full tank next time?” If the behavior continues after you have informally addressed your concern, you may need to ask your supervisor to intervene. Follow your company’s rules on handling employee conflict resolution."

      "title": "Use “I” language to avoid blaming your coworkers.",
      "content": "Use “I” language to avoid blaming your coworkers. It’s important to express yourself in a respectful manner. When discussing issues with a coworker, don’t make them feel defensive when you speak to them. You can do this by using “I” statements. The other person hears your reactions to the situation, not your accusations. [2] X Research source Instead of saying, “We are always waiting on you to get your portion of the work done,” you could say, “When the work isn’t in on time, I get worried that we’re going to miss our deadline. It would be helpful if everyone could meet their deadlines on the agreed-upon day.”"

      "title": "Find a support network at work.",
      "content": "Find a support network at work. You spend a lot of time with the same group of people at work; why not get to know some of them better? Try to make some good connections with others, and develop a network of friends who can help you through your work (and life) frustrations. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Spend your lunch break with your coworkers and get to know them better away from work. Spend a few minutes chatting with your coworkers each day. Invite them to get together after work for dinner or drinks."

      "title": "Keep records of any ongoing problems you may have with a coworker.",
      "content": "Keep records of any ongoing problems you may have with a coworker. If you are dealing with a coworker bullying or harassing you , be sure you are keeping track of all incidents with that person. Record the date, time, what happened, and if there were any witnesses. Be sure to find out what your employer’s protocol is in dealing with coworker conflict, bullying, and/or harassment. Your employee handbook or human resources representative would be a good source of information. Research laws protecting your rights when you are being bullied or harassed by a coworker."

      "title": "Escalate the situation by going to your boss if you need to.",
      "content": "Escalate the situation by going to your boss if you need to. You may or may not get along well with your supervisor, but keep the lines of communication open between the two of you as best you can. Remember that it is part of your boss’ responsibility to ensure that you are in an environment that enables you to get your work done, so don’t feel like you need to keep concerns from them. [4] X Research source If you are having a difficult time communicating and getting along with your boss, you may wish to bring your concerns to your HR department. You could say, “Ms. Jones, I’m coming to you because I’ve been having some problems working with Mr. Roberts lately. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what to do.”"

      "title": "Talk to your boss if you’re doing extra work that you didn't sign on for.",
      "content": "Talk to your boss if you’re doing extra work that you didn't sign on for. Sometimes the job you have is different from the job you applied for. If you are finding yourself taking on additional responsibility, or are doing tasks you do not feel qualified for, bring your concerns to your supervisor. Find a copy of the job description you were hired for and bring it to your boss to talk about it. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source You could say, “Here is a copy of my job description, and here is all the work I am currently doing. I think we need to talk about the expectations for my position.” You could use your additional responsibilities as leverage for a pay raise. You could say, “I think if you expect me to continue to do these additional responsibilities, it may be wise to talk about an increased salary.”"

      "title": "Look for additional training opportunities to advance your position.",
      "content": "Look for additional training opportunities to advance your position. If you feel your job performance would improve with additional training or classes, be proactive in seeking out training you feel would be beneficial. Look for training within your company or in your community (perhaps in a community college or a university extension class), and bring the opportunity to your supervisor’s attention. [6] X Research source You could say, “I found this coding workshop that’s going on at the local college next month. I think this is exactly the kind of course I need to help take my performance to the next level and help me gain a greater understanding of my position. Would the company be able to sponsor me to attend this workshop? Here is the information on it.” You could consider seeking out a mentor within your company to help you better understand your role."

    {
      "title": "Be open to feedback from your boss.",
      "content": "Be open to feedback from your boss. Sometimes work problems can develop when you get little or no feedback on your performance. Take the initiative and ask your boss if they’d be willing to have a conversation with you on how you are doing in your position. Set a meeting for you and your boss to talk, and give them a sense of what you’d like to talk about. [7] X Research source For example, you could say, “I was curious to know how you felt about my performance over the last few months. I think I’ve been taking on more responsibilities, and I wanted to get some feedback on what I’ve done well and what needs improvement.” Don’t beat yourself up over a bad performance review. Look at it as a learning opportunity, asking lots of questions so you can best understand how you can make changes. You could say, “I appreciate you bringing these concerns to my attention. Do you have any suggestions as to what I can do to improve my next review?”"

      "content": "Look into filing a complaint if you're being taken advantage of. If you feel you are being treated unfairly and your problem has not been solved or addressed, you can take steps to have the problem identified through a more formal procedure. If complaint procedures are not spelled out in your employee handbook, find out through management or HR what steps you need to take. [8] X Research source You could say, “John, I’ve taken all of the steps in the employee handbook to follow the chain of command at work, but my concerns are still not being addressed. I want to find out how to file a formal complaint within the company.” If you feel you are being harassed or discriminated against, for example, it may be beneficial to you to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (if you live in the United States).

      "content": "Talk to a supervisor in private if you’re dealing with a personal problem. If you find stress from your personal life creeping into your work life, be upfront with your supervisor without going into too many details. A good supervisor will likely appreciate knowing what is going on. [10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Wait for an opportunity to talk to your supervisor alone and let them know what’s up. You could say, “I just wanted to let you know that I’ve got some issues I'm dealing with at home. I'm handling it, but there may be a few days when I need to come in late next week.” Keep in mind that you're not obligated to disclose health information, but you may need to be a bit more forthcoming if you are dealing with an ongoing health problem. For example, you might say, “I’ve been told by my doctor that I am going to need surgery. I'll need to take a few days off next month to recover. I’ll let you know the exact days as soon as everything is scheduled.”"

Coffee and caffeinated beverages are a mainstay of the office, but too much can leave you feeling anxious and stressed. Limit your intake.
