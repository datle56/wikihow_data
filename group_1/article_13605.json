Water-based paint like acrylic, watercolors, or spray paint will not work at all, especially if you’re painting bathroom or kitchen tile. You can use commercial tile or ceramic paint, oil-based paint, colored epoxy, enamel, or latex paint. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the best brushes for your project. If you are painting an intricate scene or design on your tile, you'll most likely need several different sizes of brushes. If you are painting a large bathroom wall, for example, you can use a larger brush. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Set up your supplies and protect your work area. Lay out cleaning supplies, sandpaper, and protective gear. You'll need to take a few precautions to prevent injury or paint spills in your work area. Lay a tarp down on the floor to prevent paint from dripping on it. Line the edges of your work area with painter's tape. Keep damp rags nearby in case you need to fix any mistakes. Open windows or bring a fan into the room for ventilation. Wear a painter's mask to avoid inhaling fumes. If you're working in the kitchen, move food to another area to prevent contamination."

      "content": "Clean the tile with degreaser and tile cleaner. If your tile is brand new, you can just wipe off the surface. Older tile, especially flooring or bathroom tile, will need to be cleaned thoroughly. Start by using a degreaser, then wash the tile with tile cleaner or soap and water. It’s very important that your tile is perfectly clean, so don’t skip this step! [3] X Research source [4] X Expert Source Crystal Chadwick Licensed General Contractor Expert Interview. 16 March 2021.

      "content": "Sand your tile with 1800-grit paper until it's no longer smooth. You won’t need to sand unglazed tile, but any ceramic that has already been glazed will need to be sanded to provide a rough surface for the paint to adhere to. Use 1800-grit sandpaper to smooth the tile and remove uneven gloss. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply an oil-based high adhesion primer to home surfaces. Oil primers are efficient at preventing stains and holding on to ceramic and/or oil-based paint, but you won’t need to use them for decorative art tiles that won’t be walked on or used. If you’re planning to paint in a high-traffic area, like the shower or the hallway floor, use two coats. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide on your colors or design. If you are painting existing tile in your home, make sure that the colors you choose complement the rest of your design scheme. It is usually best to choose light colors when painting your tile, as dark or bright colors can overwhelm a room. If you’re painting a design, choose one that will be easy for you to do and will look good in your home. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Transfer your design to the tile with a pencil. If you have an intricate design, draw it on the tile with pencil first. Be sure to press the pencil very lightly so that it is easy to hide with paint and/or erase if necessary. You can also practice on paper beforehand."

      "content": "Paint your tile. If you are painting a design, start with the lightest color first to avoid smudges, and let each color dry before starting a new one. If you’re painting a home surface in a solid color, apply the paint in multiple thin layers. It’s usually necessary to do at least 3 layers, especially if your paint color is lighter than the original color. [10] X Research source Painting over the grout is much easier than trying to avoid it, and it isn’t noticeable if you choose a light color."

Apply according to the package directions and let it dry thoroughly before touching your tile."
