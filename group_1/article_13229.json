      "title": "Assess the situation.",
      "content": "Assess the situation. If the battery is extremely hot or smells bad, do not attempt to remove the battery on your own. If the battery is smoking, remove any flammable items nearby and clear out any people or pets in the area. Do not breathe in battery fumes, as they are toxic and can cause injury."

      "content": "Remove the battery, if possible. If your battery is removable, carefully take the swollen battery out of your cell phone. Make sure to handle the battery very gently and slowly to avoid puncturing it, which could cause a fire. [4] X Research source Wear gloves or goggles when handling the battery to avoid injury."

      "content": "Have the battery removed by professionals if you encounter resistance. If the swollen battery does not come out easily, stop what you are doing. Take your cellphone to a local repair shop or electronics supply store, such as Best Buy, to have it removed by professionals. Trying to force out a swollen battery that's stuck in an electronic device can cause the battery to become punctured, which is a serious safety hazard. [5] X Research source You should also take the battery to professionals if it is not removable or if you don't know how to remove it."

      "content": "Place the battery in a fireproof container. If you can't remove the battery from the device, place the entire device in the fireproof container for transport to a professional who can remove it and/or dispose of it. If you don't have a dedicated fireproof container for Li-ion batteries, put the battery/device in a metal container and cover it with sand, if possible. Do not put the battery in a container that can melt or burn (such as plastic or wood). The sand will smother any flames if the battery does catch on fire."

      "title": "Do not store swollen batteries in the freezer.",
      "content": "Do not store swollen batteries in the freezer. Freezing temperatures will not put a swollen battery in stasis. In fact, it could actually lead to the battery lighting on fire when it might not have originally. When cold, metal will contract, and this could lead to the metal components inside the battery to short out. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Contact professionals if you suspect a punctured battery. If you puncture your battery while removing it or notice any discharge that may indicate a puncture, call a professional repair technician right away. If you don't have any repair shops nearby, you can try calling a Best Buy, Apple Store, or other tech retailer for suggestions. Punctured batteries can explode and cause fire hazards, so they should not be handled without professional help."

      "content": "Do not recycle swollen batteries. Many areas have electronic recycling centers that accept old electronic supplies for recycling. While you may prefer to recycle your waste, unfortunately, swollen batteries are not safe to recycle as they cannot be reused. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Handle swollen batteries with great care.",
      "content": "Handle swollen batteries with great care. Be extremely cautious when handling swollen batteries. Never handle batteries with sharp objects, as you risk puncturing the batteries. Never try to force a swollen battery out of a device if it's stuck. If you're unsure how to remove a swollen battery, err on the side of caution and seek help from a professional."

      "title": "Treat a battery fire like any small fire.",
      "content": "Treat a battery fire like any small fire. If you have a fire extinguisher, you can use it to extinguish the fire. You can also cover the fire with sand to smother the flames, douse it in a lot of water to put out the fire, or cover it with a fireproof container (like a metal box) to contain the flames. [9] X Research source If you aren't comfortable handling the fire on your own or the fire is too big to deal with alone, call 911 (or your country's emergency number) and report the fire so the fire department can extinguish it and prevent it from getting worse. If the fire isn't large, you can use a fireproof instrument (like a metal spatula) to move the device or battery to a fireproof surface (like a metal baking sheet or a concrete floor). If possible, transport the fire outside where it can burn off. Never linger around a Li-ion battery fire longer than you have to. The battery can explode, which can cause injury if you're hit by parts of the battery or battery acid."
