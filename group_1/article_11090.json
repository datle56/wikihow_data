      "content": "Check how much your cat is defecating. If your cat is spending a lot of time in the litter box, he may be constipated, but he may instead have diarrhea. Cats will spend a long time squatting in the litter box if they have diarrhea. They may produce only a small amount of feces, which could be misinterpreted as constipation. A healthy cat will defecate about once a day. The cat’s stool should be firm and hold its shape. [1] X Research source Many times, it may appear that your cat is constipated, but there are other conditions that look similar at first. You will need to watch your cat closely to make sure there is not a different problem present."

      "content": "Make an appointment with your vet. If you are noticing your cat is spending a long time in the litter box or if you suspect constipation, take him in for an examination with your veterinarian right away. Your vet will be able to determine if your cat needs medication or a diet change, such as a switch to special high-fiber cat food. [3] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 19 February 2021. Do not leave a constipated cat too long before seeing the vet - it could be a sign of something far more serious than just a passing bout of constipation. The cat can develop many problems from retaining and staining to eliminate stool, including blocked colon and megacolon (an enlarged colon)."

      "title": "Ask your vet if your cat needs medical intervention.",
      "content": "Ask your vet if your cat needs medical intervention. Your cat may need enemas and/or need to be sedated to have feces manually removed. The longer a cat is constipated, the harder the feces become and even more difficult to pass. An enema is a lubricant that is put into the rectum via the anus, to soften the blockage and help the cat to pass it. [4] X Research source The enema may be a a simple micro enema, which is instilled in a similar method to taking a cat's temperature. For more serious constipation, sedation or a general anesthetic may be necessary in order to wash the bowel out to remove the blockage. Occasionally, a tumor may be at the root of the problem and require surgical removal. If the cat develops a megacolon from prolonged constipation, where the muscles of the colon can no longer push feces out of the body, the colon will need to be surgically removed."

      "title": "Administer medication prescribed by your vet.",
      "content": "Administer medication prescribed by your vet. If your veterinarian has prescribed medication to manage the constipation, you may need to use a dropper or syringe to give medicine to your cat. Be sure to have the medication measured and ready before hand. Also have treats on hand for your cat. Give the cat a treat just before giving the medication. Put the cat on a waist high surface like a bed or counter with its hindquarters up against you. Give him lots of reassuring strokes and face rubs. Reach over his head and, with your thumb and second finger, hold his upper jaw just in front of the jaw hinge and press in. Your cat's mouth will open; there might be some paws wanting to interact with your attempts. It is helpful to have an assistant hold your cat's shoulders at the same time. Hold the syringe or dropper in your dominant hand. Gently push the dropper between your cat's back (or side) teeth, getting it to the back of the mouth. Squeeze the medication out. Immediately give the cat more treats to take his mind off of what just happened. If the cat is fighting and difficult to control, wrap him tightly in a big bath towel. When giving liquid medication to your cat, make sure you rinse the dropper or syringe in hot water and dedicate its use to one animal. Discard the instrument after medication is completed."
