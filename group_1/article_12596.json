      "content": "Look for changes in your skin. Skin cancers can cause your skin to change color, making it darker, more yellow, or more red. If your skin changes color, make an appointment with your primary care physician or dermatologist. You may also notice more hair growing or itchy skin. If you have moles, you should watch for any changes in their appearance.

Losing more than 10 pounds is an early sign of cancer of the pancreas, stomach, esophagus, or lung.

These are symptoms of esophageal, throat, or stomach cancer."

      "content": "Watch for common illness symptoms. Some of the earliest symptoms of cancer might seem like symptoms of the common cold, with some key differences. You may notice cough, fatigue, fever or unexplained pain (like severe headache). Unlike common illnesses, you won't feel better after resting, the cough won't go away, and you may not have any sign of infection despite having a fever. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source Pain might be one of the earliest symptoms of cancer you experience. Fever is usually a symptom once the cancer has progressed."

      "title": "Avoid self-diagnosing.",
      "content": "Avoid self-diagnosing. Don't assume that because you've noticed several symptoms, you definitely have cancer. Cancer symptoms can vary a great deal and can be non-specific. This means that many similar symptoms can indicate a number of other health problems ranging in severity. For example, fatigue can mean many things, only one of which is cancer. Instead, fatigue might just be one symptom of a different condition that you're experiencing. This is why a proper medical diagnosis is important."

      "content": "Get screened for breast cancer. Mammograms are x-rays of the breast that screen for lumps. If you're between the ages of 40 and 44, you can choose if you want to get mammograms every year. Women between the ages of 45 and 54 should get mammograms every year, according to the American Cancer Society. If you're over 55, you can continue yearly screening or get them every two years.

      "content": "Test for colon or rectal cancer, and polyps. At 50 years old, everyone should be regularly tested. Ask your doctor if you can be screened for cancer and polyps. This screening relies on getting tested every five years (like a flexible sigmoidoscopy, a double-contrast barium enema, or a virtual colonoscopy) or 10 years (if getting a colonoscopy).

      "content": "Get Pap tests for cervical cancer. Pap tests are important to diagnose cervical cancer, even if you've been vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV). If you're a woman between the ages of 21 and 29, get a Pap test every three years and only get HPV testing if you get an abnormal Pap test result. If you're between 30 and 65, get a Pap test plus an HPV test (called \"co-testing\") every five years. If you don't want to screen for HPV, you can just get a Pap test every three years. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source If you've had a total hysterectomy that wasn't because of cervical cancer, you don't need regular Pap tests. If you're over 65 and have had regular testing with normal results for the past 10 years, you don't need testing anymore. If you have a history of serious cervical pre-cancer, you should be tested for at least 20 years after the diagnosis (even if this means testing past age 65)."

If you're between the ages of 55 and 74, are in good health, and smoke heavily or have a history of smoking heavily, you should have CT scans to look for lung cancer. To decide if you are or were a heavy smoker, determine if you're still smoking and have a 30 \"pack-year\" history. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source You might also be considered a heavy smoker if you have a 30 pack-year history even if you've quit within the last 15 years. To determine your pack-per-year amount, multiply the number of packs you smoke a day by the number of years you've smoked. So if you smoked two packs a day for 20 years, your pack-year is 40.

If you feel like you'd benefit from knowing your genetic risk of developing cancer, talk with your doctor and make sure the doctor knows all of your family and personal medical history.

Since genetic testing can determine if you're at risk for cancer, it can be helpful in deciding how often to get physical exams and screenings. But, be aware that genetic testing can give few answers, be read incorrectly, and create stress and anxiety. It can also cost thousands of dollars.
