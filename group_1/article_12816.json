      "content": "Check the fecal matter. The most common sign of worms is actual worms. Look at your cat’s stool for them. Tapeworm segments often break off and come out in your cat's feces. These segments look like little rice grains. When fresh, they may even move like little worms. [1] X Research source Look for diarrhea. A number of issues can cause diarrhea in cats, but all intestinal worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms could potentially cause runny fecal matter. In other instances, your cat may develop blood from colon and intestinal irritation. Take a bag and collect these worms for your vet to examine."

      "content": "Look out for vomiting. Roundworms can cause vomiting in cats. Cats may even vomit up adult roundworms. They’ll look like spaghetti noodles. Vomiting is also a potential symptom of heartworms. Like with their fecal matter, you should try to collect it into a small bag. Your vet will want to examine their throw up for parasites or signs of other conditions. [2] X Research source Remember that vomiting is not an automatic sign of worms. It could be any number of issues."

      "content": "Keep track of their weight. Cats with intestinal worms or heartworms may experience weight loss. Sometimes, the change may be drastic and other times it might be marginal. [3] X Research source It all depends on the size and quantity of the worms. In other cases, your cat may develop an extended stomach — often called a “pot-belly”. If your cat’s belly has become rounded, it may be suffering from roundworms."

      "title": "Check your cat’s gums.",
      "content": "Check your cat’s gums. Normally, a cat’s gums should be pink. Parasites, like many worms cause gums to turn pale through anemia or sheer shock. If you cat has pale gums, schedule a vet appointment. If your cat has difficulty breathing or is lethargic, seek emergency assistance."

      "content": "Learn what type of worms your cat has. It's important to know the kind of worms your cat has so that you can begin treatment. Your vet will be able to tell you this and prescribe medication and treatment accordingly. Though you don't really need to understand the intricacies of each type of worm, here are the main worms you'll be dealing with: Roundworms are the most common parasites in cats. Nursing kittens can get them from a mother's milk while adult cats can get them from infected feces. Tapeworms are segmented parasites that can often be seen around the fur of a cat's hind quarters. They can be acquired from ingesting fleas. [4] X Research source Hookworms are smaller than roundworms and reside in the small intestine. A cat can be infected from skin contact or ingestion. They are more common in dogs. Lungworms reside in a cat's lungs and are a less common parasite. They can be acquired through ingestion of a host, such as a bird or a rodent. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Heartworms are possibly the most dangerous of all. Mosquitoes bite infected animals, taking little heartworm larvae in with their blood meal. The larvae grow and the next time a mosquito bites into an animal (like your cat), it injects the heartworms into the bloodstream. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Take your cat to the vet.",
      "content": "Take your cat to the vet. Do not think that you can cure your cat on your own — you'll need to take your cat to the vet, who will check your cat's stool sample and confirm the presence of worms. If you can, try to collect a stool sample ahead of time for this test. If your vet suspects heartworm disease, they may take a routine blood sample. [7] X Research source There are many different types of worms and the treatment for one will not work for another, so it's important to know exactly what you're dealing with before you begin a course of treatment. Typically, deworming medication should be administered bi-weekly or monthly. The treatment is not a one-time deal. You may see some web sites that tell you that you can treat your cat \"naturally\" at home with some herbs and spices. Ignore this kind of information and take your pet to an animal health care professional. Take newly-adopted or newly-born kittens to the vet for deworming. This is a routine procedure, whether or not you think that your cat actually has worms. Kittens should be dewormed every 2 weeks from 6 weeks of age until 3 months, and then monthly until they are 6 months old. Adopted kittens should be dewormed immediately, with at least 2 additional treatments two-weeks apart each. Mothers can also pass worms on to their kittens."

      "content": "Give your cat their prescription. Obtain the necessary medication from your veterinarian. You should never try to medicate with over-the-counter dewormers without checking first with your veterinarian, especially with kittens. Though it's most likely that your cat will be given a series of pills, other medications can come in the forms of tablets, capsules, granules, chewables, liquids, and topical treatments. [8] X Research source Do not try to choose the medication yourself; listen to your vet’s instructions for both how and how often the medication should be administered. Once you know what medication you should give your cat and how often you should administer it, it's important to follow the entire course of treatment that has been recommended by your veterinarian. Whether it is oral or topical, you must administer the medication to your kitty for the entire course of the treatment."

This is why it's important to get help from a vet and to give your cat medication exactly as you're instructed to do. Some side effects include diarrhea and vomiting. Talk to your vet about what is and is not expected as a side effect from this medication, and make sure that your cat is reacting appropriately. [9] X Research source"

Pyrantel pamoate and milbemycin oxime are oral medications and selamectin is a topical medication. [10] X Research source In the United States, pyrantel pamoate is available over the counter, and selamectin and milbemycin oxime are available only with a prescription. Selamectin is not appropriate for use in kittens under 8 weeks of age, so young kittens are wormed with oral wormers. [11] X Research source"

In order to make this decision properly, you should weigh the pros and cons. [20] X Research source Are the risks too great?

Cats are fairly well-adept at killing off fleas especially if they are not inundated with them constantly. So focus on where they spend most of their time. Home : Your primary tactic in the war against fleas should be sanitation. Wash all of your cat’s favorite pillows, blankets, and anything else they tend to lay on frequently. You want to wash away fleas, their eggs, and their pupae or young fleas. Thoroughly vacuum your carpet to do the same. If your case is moderate to extreme, consider using a fogger. Make sure you choose a brand that kills fleas and flea eggs. During use, humans and all animals need to clear out of the home for the time indicated on the can. Afterwards, wipe down all surfaces and vacuum again to remove dead fleas/flea eggs as well as leftover toxins. [22] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Yard : Flea control outdoors is much harder. Start by cleaning up organic debris that might harbor fleas like grass clippings, leaves, and straw. Fleas like to hide in dark, moist, and shady areas. Purchase an environmentally safe spray and douse these areas according to the instructions indicated on the product.
