Others will have larger buttons for the larger flush and smaller buttons for the smaller flush. [6] X Research source In some cases, dual flush toilets will have up-and-down levers instead of buttons. If this is the case, look for signs that tell you whether to pull the lever up or push it down (based on whether you have deposited liquids or solids). [7] X Research source"
