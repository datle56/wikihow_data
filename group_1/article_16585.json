      "title": "Find sample forms.",
      "content": "Find sample forms. You can find many quitclaim deeds on the Internet. If you want to use one, then print it off and fill out the requested information. You can also hire an attorney to draft your quitclaim deed. Remember that any form you find on the Internet still must comply with your county's formatting requirements. You should stop into your county Recorder of Deeds office and ask about requirements. If you don't follow them, you may be charged more when you file or the deed might be rejected."

    {
      "title": "Format your document.",
      "content": "Format your document. If you want to type up your own quitclaim deed, then open a blank word processing document. Set the font to something readable—Times New Roman 12 point works for many people. Your county may have specific requirements for the page layout. For example, in Carson County, the quitclaim deed must be on 8.5” by 11” paper and have a one-inch margin on both sides and on the bottom. There must be a 3” by 3” box in the upper right hand corner."

      "title": "Identify the parties.",
      "content": "Identify the parties. With the deed, the owners (the grantors) convey the property to the grantee for money. The amount of money is called “consideration.” You should have an opening paragraph that identifies the parties and states that consideration was given. For example, you could write, “For a valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Melissa T. Banks and Arthur C. Banks hereby remise, release, and forever quitclaim to Andrew X. Smith, of 1111 South Winship Avenue, City, Nevada, the property in [insert county] Nevada, described as….” You should be sure to include the address of the grantee."

      "title": "Describe the property.",
      "content": "Describe the property. You should have pulled the legal description of property, which you could find on the current deed. You then need to insert the legal description onto the quitclaim deed. The legal description is usually stated in metes and bounds. For example, it might read: “Commence at the SE Corner of the East 1/2 of West 1/2 of Section 12, Township 2 East and run E 0 degrees….” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify who prepared the legal description of property. You might have to provide the name and address of the surveyor who prepared the legal description if no prior document has been recorded with that legal description. [5] X Research source For example, if you bought half of someone's property, then that particular portion has not been recorded before. You would need to provide the surveyor's name and address in this situation. However, if you buy someone's entire parcel—and that parcel has been recorded before—then you don't need to provide the surveyor's address. Instead, you can cite the document number from where you got the description."

      "content": "Include an affirmation. In some counties, you will need to submit an affirmation for the quitclaim deed to be filed.

For example, in Esmeralda County, you should include the following: “I, the undersigned, hereby affirm that this document submitted for recording does not contain the social security number of any person or persons.”"

You can find notaries at the courthouse, the county recorder's office, and at most large banks. You should take sufficient personal identification to show the notary, such as a valid state ID or a passport."

      "content": "Visit the Recorder of Deeds and ask to file. Take the completed deed to the Recorder of Deeds. Ask if you need to complete any other paperwork. For example, you probably will have to complete a Declaration of Value form. You should be able to complete all required paperwork at the Recorder of Deeds office. You should also take a self-addressed stamp envelope so that the recorder can return the document. This will speed up the return."
