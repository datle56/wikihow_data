      "content": "Avoid foods and drinks that trigger your symptoms. You may want to keep track of foods and beverages that cause you any problems. Write down the foods you eat and see how you feel about 1 hour of eating. If the food you ate an hour ago is bothering you, you should eliminate that from your diet. [1] X Research source Commonly reported hyperacidity triggers include: Citrus fruit Caffeinated beverages Chocolate Tomatoes Garlic, onions Alcohol Note: Most of these foods have not been studied enough to make a definitive claim. [2] X Research source It's more important to find out what triggers your symptoms than to avoid this exact list."

      "content": "Raise the head of your bed if symptoms interfere with sleep. If your bed allows for it, raise the head of it by 6 to 8 inches. Gravity will keep the acid in your stomach. Don't just pile up pillows, though. These tend to bend your neck and body in such a way that increases the pressure. It will make the hyperacidity worse. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask your doctor if you could benefit from losing weight . If you’re carrying extra weight, losing weight may reduce some of the pressure on your lower esophageal sphincter, keeping stomach acid from leaking through. However, you may not need to lose weight, so check with your doctor before attempting to do so. Then, eat a healthy diet based on fresh produce and lean protein and exercise for 30 minutes per day.

      "content": "Eat smaller meals so you don’t get too full. Decrease the amount of food you eat at any one time. This may reduce the amount of stress and pressure on your stomach. [5] X Research source Switching to smaller plates and bowls may help because it tricks your mind into thinking you’re eating more food than you really are."

      "title": "Eat slowly to improve your digestion.",
      "content": "Eat slowly to improve your digestion. Chew each bite several times, then swallow before taking another bite. This helps your stomach digest food more easily and quickly, leaving less food in the stomach adding pressure on the LES. [6] X Research source You can also slow yourself down by putting your fork down between bites."

      "title": "Check that your stomach isn’t under undue pressure.",
      "content": "Check that your stomach isn’t under undue pressure. Pressure will increase the discomfort of hyperacidity. You can experience excess pressure because of hiatal hernias (when the upper part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm), pregnancy, constipation, or being overweight. [7] X Research source Don't wear clothes that constrict your stomach or abdomen."

Do this anytime during the day, but especially about 20-30 minutes before meals.

For your own comfort, identify situations that you find stressful and exhausting. Find ways to avoid those situations or prepare for them with various relaxing techniques.

      "content": "Try herbal treatments if you have related bowel conditions. None of these are proven treatments. However, if your hyperacidity symptoms are related to ulcerative colitis or bowel inflammation, there's a little evidence that these could help. Do not rely on these as your main treatment. Drink 1/2 cup of aloe vera juice. You can drink this throughout the day, but don't drink more than 1 to 2 cups a day. Aloe vera can act as a laxative. Drink fennel tea. Crush about a teaspoon of fennel seeds and add a cup of boiled water. Add honey to taste and drink 2-3 cups a day about 20 minutes before meals. Fennel helps settle the stomach and decreases the acid levels. Take slippery elm. Slippery elm can be taken as a drink or as a tablet. As a liquid, you'll want to drink about 3 to 4 ounces. As a tablet, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Slippery elm is known to soothe and coat irritated tissues. Take DGL tablets. Deglycyrrhizinated licorice root (DGL) comes in chewable tablets. The taste might take some getting use to. But, it may help the stomach and control hyperacidity. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dosage. You'll usually take 2 to 3 tablets every 4-6 hours."

Tell your doctor about your medical history, when you hyperacidity symptoms started, and what natural treatments you’ve tried. While they may make a diagnosis based solely on your symptoms, they might prefer to do some diagnostic tests first. They may do 1 or more of the following tests: [18] X Research source An upper endoscopy, which sends a camera down your throat to inspect your esophagus and stomach and potentially take a small biopsy. This test is usually painless but you may feel discomfort. An ambulatory acid (pH) probe test, which places a narrow tube down your esophagus to measure acid regurgitation over a 48-hour period. It’s not painful but it may be uncomfortable. An esophageal manometry, which measures the muscle contractions in your throat when you swallow. An X-ray to show your digestive tract. Your doctor will first have you swallow a chalky liquid so your digestive tract is visible on the X-ray."

Follow the dosing instructions on the label to take your antacids, as needed. [19] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Popular antacids include Tums, Rolaid, and Mylanta. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions exactly because taking too many can cause side effects, like diarrhea.
