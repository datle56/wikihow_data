Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots to avoid causing any breakage. Use a detangler spray for hair that has lots of tangles. [1] X Research source If your hair is very frizzy, apply a few drops of hair oil or a dime-sized amount of smoothing cream . For a more defined, frizz-free braid, smooth a quarter-sized amount of hair gel through towel-dried hair before starting the braid."

Hold the left section in your left hand and the right section in your right hand. [2] X Research source For 2 braids (one on each side of your head), part your hair down the middle from the center of your forehead over the top of your head and down to the center of your nape. Choose one side to start braiding first and clip the other side out of the way. Divide the hair on that side into three sections. Smooth your hair behind your ear to start the braid for a sleek, chic look."

If you have trouble holding the sections tight as you start the braid, put your hair in a low ponytail at the center of your nape. Then, divide the ponytail into 3 equal sections before starting to braid. This gives you a chance to practice the braiding motion and still have a tightly woven plait."

If the braid is too loose, it will fall out. If the braid is too tight when you’re done, massage it between your palms or use your fingers to pull gently on the sides after you tie it off.

Leave more if you want a longer tail of hair at the bottom. Hold the end of your braid secure with one hand, and use the other hand to wrap a hair tie around the end of your braid. Make sure that the hair tie is snug; if it’s too loose, wrap it a few more times to keep it secure. Try to use a clear hair tie or one that matches your hair color: black, brown, or beige/blond. If you have dark red hair, go for a brown hair tie. If you have lighter red hair, use a beige hair tie. If you’re doing two braids, repeat the whole process on the other side of your head."

Another option is to add hair accessories, like pretty hair clips , along the sides of your hair. This is a great way to dress up a basic braid. Here are a few more ideas to get you started: In the summer, consider tucking a silk hibiscus or orchid into your braid for a tropical look. Use a clip made from bronze, leather, or wood to match a fall vibe. If it’s snowy out, try a delicate silver clip with clear rhinestones, or go festive with a red and green ribbon for Christmas or a blue and white ribbon for Hanukkah. In the spring, ribbons, delicate flowers , pastel colors, or bright colors are all beautiful choices."

Tuck a silk hibiscus flower into your braid during the summer or wear a hairclip made from leather in the fall. Celebrate with a holiday-inspired look. If it’s Halloween, clip an orange and black bow to the end of your braid. Glue a plastic spider to the center of the bow (before you put it in your hair) for an extra-spooky vibe. Match the hair accessories to your outfit. If you’re wearing an elegant dark blue evening gown with silver embellishments, a delicate silver hairclip with clear/white crystals is the perfect finishing touch. Match your hair decoration to the event. If you’re attending a school rally or sports event, consider wearing a ribbon in your braid that matches your school or favorite team's colors."
