The website http://www.isitcg.com/ divides ingredients into \"Not CG Approved\" and \"Probably OK,\" for instance. If any of the ingredients fall into \"Not CG Approved,\" then you want to avoid that product if you're using CG Approved ones. [2] X Research source \"Probably OK\" means that the ingredients didn't directly match ones on the \"bad\" list or they're on the CG Approved list."

      "title": "Skip products with sulfates in them.",
      "content": "Skip products with sulfates in them. Surfactants dissolve in water and reduce the surface tension on your hair, which helps the product remove dirt from the area. That sounds good, but some surfactants, like sulfates, can also be damaging to your hair, as they strip it of its natural oils. When using the Curly Girl method, avoid products with these ingredients. Look for products that are labeled \"sulfate-free\" to help you choose the best option for your hair. In addition, read the ingredient list to look for sulfates. Even if a product is labeled \"sulfate-free,\" it may still contain sulfate ingredients. That's because the manufacturer is typically referring to more damaging sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Go over the ingredient list carefully to find sulfate ingredients before deciding if a product is Curly Girl approved. [3] X Research source Common sulfates include alkylbenzene sulfonate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate, ammonium or sodium xylenesulfonate, and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. Look for words or endings like \"sulfate,\" \"sulfoacetate,\" \"sulfonate,\" and \"sulfouccinate.\""

      "content": "Avoid products with silicone ingredients that aren't water soluble. These products tend to build up on your hair over time because they coat your hair to give it shine. They keep moisture from getting into your hair, and to get them out, you need harsh products that contain sulfates. Therefore, it's best to avoid them. Read the ingredient list to find ones with endings like \"-xane,\" \"-cone,\" \"-col,\" and \"-conol\" so that you can avoid products that contain them. [4] X Research source Common ingredients that fall into this category include dimethiconol, cetyl dimethicone, dimethicone, cetearyl methicone, and stearyl dimethicone. Use the same rues when buying styling products ."

You're more susceptible to this issue if your hair is coarse, so if you're having this problem, check the ingredient list for proteins.

Pick ones like hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane, dimethicone copolyol, or lauryl methicone copolyol. [7] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. Also look for silicone names that have \"PPG\" or \"PEG\" in front of them. That indicates they're water-soluble. Silicones are used to help detangle your hair, as well as to add shine. [8] X Research source"

These ingredients aren't silicone-based. Certain types of chlorides can help, for instance.
