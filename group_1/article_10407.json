      "content": "Cut out the bottom 7–8 inches (18–20 cm) of the shirt horizontally. Spread the shirt out flat on a table and smooth out any wrinkles with your palm. Grab a ruler and measure 7–8 inches (18–20 cm) up from the bottom of the waist. Cut horizontally across the shirt to turn the bottom portion of the shirt into a single loop of fabric. If you have a really sharp pair of scissors, you can use those. Otherwise, use fabric shears to cut your shirt. You may find it easier to cut the shirt if you have someone pull the shirt in opposite directions to pull the fabric taut while you cut. You can mark your cuts on each side with a marker or fabric pen if you’d like, but the cut doesn’t need to be perfectly straight."

      "content": "Trim a 6–7 in (15–18 cm) rectangle out of the shorter side. Keep the strip of fabric flat and measure 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from the top of the fabric. Then, cut parallel to the long side of the fabric towards the other end of the shirt. Stop once you cut 6–7 inches (15–18 cm). Make a parallel cut on the bottom of the shirt. Then, cut vertically to connect these 2 cuts in the middle of the fabric and remove the rectangular piece. The 2 thinner strips of fabric are used to tie the shirt. The thicker portion of the mask is the part that goes on your face. If you’re struggling to visualize this, just imagine you’re cutting a small rectangle out of 1 side of the larger piece of fabric."

      "content": "Tie the straps behind your head to put the mask on. To put your mask on, lift the top straps up and line the cloth up so that it covers your nostrils and mouth. Tie the top straps over your ears to keep the fabric tight against the bridge of your nose. Then, pull the bottom straps under your ears and tie them tight so that the fabric rests against your chin and covers your mouth. Always wash your mask after each use. You can wash it by hand or in a washing machine with cold water.

This will transfer any germs or bacteria from your hands to the mask and vice versa. Always use the straps to put the mask on or take it off.

Do the same after you take the mask off."

Cotton is the best material for this, but you can theoretically use any type of shirt that you’d like. It also needs to be clean, so wash the shirt if you recently wore it. [5] X Research source This style of face cover won’t offer much protection for others since there will be gaps at the bottom of the mask, but it’s easily the quickest option if you need a quick mask. It’s also a great option if you have a good hat but can’t find your scarf, since it will cover everything below your nose and keep you warm."

Point your blades towards the collar and begin cutting both sides at the same time. Trim the sleeve off of the shirt by cutting in a circle towards the shoulder. [7] X Research source if you want a really baggy face mask, start the cut 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) under the armpit. You now have a single loop of fabric. It doesn’t matter which sleeve you use. They’re symmetrical, so the mask will be the same either way. Since you’re already making 1 mask, you might as well make a backup with the other sleeve if you think it may come in handy later!"

It will be easier to tie the shirt if It is a little big on you and a long-sleeved shirt will make tying it a breeze. This mask is perfect for a ninja costume, but it will also give you the most privacy possible if you’re going out in public. This is likely the best choice if you’re trying to stay warm as well. [9] X Research source Balaclava is a Russian term for a type of head covering where only your eyes are exposed. It’s a little different from a ski mask, where there’s an opening for your mouth. [10] X Research source If you use a long-sleeved shirt, you will have 2 pieces of sleeve hanging down from the back by the time you’re done. If you don’t want anything hanging off of your mask, use a short-sleeved shirt. This is one of the few mask designs that doesn’t involve cutting anything. You will be able to re-wear your shirt after you do this."

Pull the shirt over your head and pull the collar down until it’s resting on the bridge of your nose. Slide both sides of the collar over your ears to hold it in place. Let the rest of the shirt rest around your shoulders and pull the sleeves out to the side.

[13] X Research source If you find it hard to tie the sleeves because you don’t have enough fabric to work with, get a bigger T-shirt. This style of mask won’t offer as much protection from dangerous viruses since it will tend to come loose the longer you wear it. Wash your shirt after wearing it as a balaclava. Even if you are just wearing it as a costume, there may be bacteria or germs built up on the fabric."
