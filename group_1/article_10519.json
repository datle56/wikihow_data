      "title": "Obtain the labels you need.",
      "content": "Obtain the labels you need. Labels come in different sizes and for different purposes, for everything from regular, no. 10 envelopes to legal-sized mailings and CD covers. Get the labels that are best suited for your project and needs. You can buy self-adhesive, pre-cut label printing paper online or at an office supply store. According to Professional Organizer Caitlin Jaymes, printed labels are an excellent organizational aid if you have a lot of paper documents to keep track of. Using typed and printed labels instead of handwritten ones helps ensure that your labels are clear and easy to read."
