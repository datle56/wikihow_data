      "title": "Add a small amount of water to whiskey to enjoy a softer drink.",
      "content": "Add a small amount of water to whiskey to enjoy a softer drink. Although this is a matter of some debate, many people choose to pour a little bit of water into their single malt whiskey to dilute it. This makes the drink less sharp and allows them to experience the whiskey’s more subtle flavors. Add a few drops of water to your drink to see if you like it more. Most people who support adding water to whiskey would encourage you to add your water in small increments and to taste; there’s no set amount of water that you should add to your drink. Although some people insist you should only add distilled water to whiskey, others will tell you that tap water works perfectly fine."

      "content": "Have whiskey on the rocks for a colder, slightly diluted drink. Drinking your whiskey over ice will give you a more chilled and refreshing drink for warmer climates and will slightly numb your palate, making the whiskey a bit more palatable for inexperienced drinkers. The slight dilution of the whiskey caused by the melting ice will also allow you to taste different flavors and nuances in the drink than if you drink it neat. [1] X Research source Although connoisseurs of whiskey debate over whether adding ice to the drink is good or bad, some whiskeys, such as high-proof bourbon, are generally considered to be improved by the addition of ice. If you add ice to your whiskey, aim to only use large ice cubes, as these will take longer to melt and will do a better job of keeping your drink cool."

      "content": "Drink whiskey neat to appreciate the full sensation of its flavor. Drink the whiskey in small sips instead of larger gulps; the high alcohol content may feel overwhelming at first. Once you get used to this effect, however, you’ll be able to appreciate the drink’s flavor and detect the various nuances in your particular whiskey. [2] X Research source These nuances in the flavor may include spicy notes, smokiness, woodiness, or hints of other flavors like vanilla and caramel."

      "title": "Serve whiskey at room temperature for optimal taste.",
      "content": "Serve whiskey at room temperature for optimal taste. Whiskey tastes the best when served at temperatures around 60 to 65 °F (16 to 18 °C). Although you or someone you’re serving may choose to add water or ice to the whiskey, thereby changing its temperature, your whiskey should always start out at room temperature before being served. [3] X Research source If your whiskey was previously kept in a cool or chilled environment, you can simply leave it out on a kitchen counter or bar until it achieves this optimal temperature."

      "title": "Nose the whiskey with your mouth open to detect its different flavors.",
      "content": "Nose the whiskey with your mouth open to detect its different flavors. Nosing whiskey is the act smelling your whiskey while it’s in the glass to appreciate its flavor and aroma before drinking it. In contrast to sniffing wine, you should smell the whiskey in small, sharp sniffs and keep your mouth open as you sniff it to avoid overwhelming and “burning” your nose. [4] X Research source If sniffing the whiskey starts to become unpleasant, take a break and sniff the back of your hand; this will “reset” your nose and allow you to comfortably smell the whiskey again. The best glass to use for drinking whiskey is a tulip-shaped glass; its unique shape allows you to experience the full aroma of the whiskey."

      "title": "Store your whiskey at a constant temperature and out of direct sunlight",
      "content": "Store your whiskey at a constant temperature and out of direct sunlight . Changes in light exposure and in temperature cause chemical reactions in your whiskey that can negatively impact its flavor profile. To avoid these, keep whiskey in a part of your house that remains at a constant temperature and that isn’t exposed to direct sunlight, such as your cellar, basement, or an insulated attic. If an opened whiskey bottle is still ⅔ full, you can expect it to remain good to drink for up to a year, if you store it at a constant temperature and away from sunlight. Be sure the bottle is tightly sealed to prevent more air from entering the bottle and interacting with the whiskey. Once a bottle of whiskey becomes more than 75% air, the whiskey will only be good for about another month."

      "content": "Try a classic Rob Roy cocktail. Combine 3 fluid ounces (89 mL) of Scotch whiskey, 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) sweet vermouth, 2 dashes of bitters, and ice in a mixing glass. Stir the ingredients together, then use a strainer to strain them into a cocktail glass. Finally, twist an orange or lemon peel over the drink and serve. [5] X Research source Some Rob Roy recipes call for specifically orange bitters, while some don’t use any bitters at all. If the drink is too strong, you can weaken it without affecting the flavor by reducing the amount of Scotch to 1.5 fluid ounces (44 mL) and the amount of vermouth to 0.5 fluid ounces (15 mL)."

Then, use a strainer to strain the ingredients into the chilled rocks glass. [6] X Research source The amount of honey whiskey used in this recipe is usually equivalent to 1 shot. Recipes for this cocktail typically call for the use of Drambuie as your honey whiskey."

Then go to a higher level of things like a mudslide using blenders, a French 75, or playing with different flavors."
