      "title": "Plan to divide the rhubarb in early spring or late fall.",
      "content": "Plan to divide the rhubarb in early spring or late fall. Early spring makes it easier to see new growth, but it is more stressful for the plant. This means that the new divisions may have a harder time adjusting and taking root. Late fall makes it harder to see new growth, but it is easier on the plant. This means that the plant is more likely to recover. Alternatively, you can divide the rhubarb during late winter when it is dormant. Make sure that you do this after the last frost.

      "title": "Choose a healthy, vigorously-growing rhubarb.",
      "content": "Choose a healthy, vigorously-growing rhubarb. It is best to divide a rhubarb that is 4 to 5 years old. This ensures that has a lot of growth to work with. You can divide younger rhubarb if you really want to, but make sure that it has a lot of vigorous growth."

      "title": "Avoid rhubarb that looks sick or diseased.",
      "content": "Avoid rhubarb that looks sick or diseased. If you divide a plant that's already sick or diseased, it won't magically get well and turn into a new, healthy plant. It will just grow into a larger, sicker plant. Instead, choose a rhubarb that looks healthy."

      "content": "Ensure that you have clean gardening tools ready. A set of clean spades, shovels, and shears will reduce the chances of your divisions getting infected. Clean your gardening tools with hot water and scrape off any clumps of dirt. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Dig up the root ball with a shovel.",
      "content": "Dig up the root ball with a shovel. Dig into the dirt around the rhubarb with your shovel to loosen the soil. Slide the shovel under the root ball, then push down on the handle to lift it out. Be careful not to cut through the roots, especially those close to the rhizome. The rhizome is the thick part of the stem that grows underground. The roots come off of the rhizome and clump together to form a root ball. The roots can grow at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. It's okay if you accidentally cut the ends of these roots."

      "title": "Find the buds along the stems (petioles).",
      "content": "Find the buds along the stems (petioles). Set the rhubarb down on the ground and note where the buds or new shoots are. They will appear smaller, pinker, and more delicate than the rest of the rhubarb. Depending on the size of your plant, you'll see about 8 to 10 buds. Each bud has the potential to become another plant!"

      "title": "Cut the rhubarb apart so that each segment contains 1 bud.",
      "content": "Cut the rhubarb apart so that each segment contains 1 bud. Find 2 new buds and cut between them with a spade, all the way down to the roots. Pull the 2 halves apart, then repeat the process. Each clump should have 1 rhizome, some roots, and 1 bud. Some will be larger than others. If you take good care of them, however, they all have the potential to grow into strong, healthy plants."

      "title": "Cut off any parts that show rot or decay.",
      "content": "Cut off any parts that show rot or decay. A small amount of rot or decay is normal and not a sign of a sick plant. These parts will appear black or gray, and they will feel slimy or mushy. Cut these off with sharp, clean gardening shears.

Root disease, honey fungus, and bacterial crown rot are more serious. You need to discard all diseased crowns."

      "content": "Plan to plant the divisions between late fall or early spring. For best results, plant the rhubarb in late winter while the weather is still cold. It is best to plant the rhizomes as soon as you finish dividing the original rhubarb. If you can't plant them right away, wrap the rhizomes in damp cloths and store them in a cool, dark place. Try to plant them within the next week or so.

      "content": "Prepare gardening soil that contains 50% compost. This will ensure that the rhubarb gets all the nutrients it needs. Organic matter, such as manure, works the best. If the soil contained a previously diseased plant, remove the old soil and use fresh soil. [5] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Make sure that the planting site is free of any weeds. If the roots were rotten as a result of waterlogged soil, add a layer of gravel to the bottom of the planting site first."

It needs to be big enough to contain the entire rhubarb division, including the rhizome and bud. [6] X Research source You are planting just 1 division for now. You'll have to repeat this process for every division that you want to plant."

      "content": "Cut off any large leaves to conserve energy. Leaves use up a lot of energy, and the new divisions need this energy to put forth new roots and grow. If you find any large leaves on your newly planted division, it is best to cut them off. Once the plant becomes established, you can let the leaves grow. You should leave some of the smaller leaves behind."
