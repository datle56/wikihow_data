      "content": "Build an enclosure. You can use fences, walls, or blocks. If you are using blocks, make sure you build them at least 2 blocks high, otherwise the chickens will escape. Make sure you can get in and out but the chickens can't. Fences are crafted by using 2 sticks and 4 wooden planks. Open a crafting table and place a stick in the middle of the bottom row and another stick on top of it. Place a plank on both sides of each stick, this will give you 3 fences. Walls are crafted by using 6 of the blocks you want the walls to be made of. Fill each slot in the bottom and middle row of a crafting table with a block, they all need to be the same exact type of block for this to work. This will make 6 walls."

      "content": "Gather seeds. You can use wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, melon seeds, and pumpkin seeds. The type of seed you use does not matter. You will want to gather at least 2 seeds, but gathering more will result in more chickens. Wheat seeds can be obtained by breaking wheat plants or grass variants (not the blocks). They may also be found in village chests. [1] X Research source Beetroot seeds can be obtained by breaking beetroot plants, which can be found in some village farms. They may also be found in chests in villages, end cities, dungeons, mineshafts, and woodland mansions. [2] X Research source Pumpkin seeds can be obtained by breaking pumpkin stems. You can also place a pumpkin in a crafting table and turn it into seeds, or shear a pumpkin to get seeds. Pumpkin seeds or pumpkin stems can be found in woodland mansions, villages, dungeons, and mineshafts. [3] X Research source Melon seeds can be obtained by breaking melon stems. You can also put a melon slice in a crafting table to turn it into a seed. Melon seeds or stems can be found in woodland mansions, villages, dungeons, and mineshafts. [4] X Research source"

A cake can be crafted by placing a bucket of milk in each slot in the top row of a crafting table, then placing the egg in the middle of the middle row, and a sugar on both sides of the egg. Fill the bottom row with 3 wheat. You will need 3 buckets, which can be made using 9 iron ingots and a crafting table. Open the crafting table and place an iron ingot on the left of the middle row, 1 in the middle of the bottom row, and 1 on the right of the middle row. Once you have buckets, you can use them on 3 different cows to get 3 milk buckets. Wheat can be obtained by breaking fully grown wheat crops. Wheat may also be found in chests in igloos, woodland mansions, villages, dungeons, pillager outposts, shipwrecks, and underwater ruins.
