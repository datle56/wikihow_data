      "content": "A “flop era” is a slang term for a period of hardship or failure. When you’re in your “flop era,” it means you’re struggling in some way. You might be having a rough patch in your career, dating life, or academic performance at school, for example. A “flop era” can refer to any period when you experience difficulty and setbacks, whether it’s the result of a decision or just bad luck. [1] X Research source A “flop era” can also refer to a relatively unsuccessful time in an artist or musician’s career when their popularity was in decline or their work was considered sub-par. Flop eras are temporary, but they generally refer to a series of events or periods of time (rather than just one unfortunate problem or setback)."

      "content": "The term “flop” originated in the late 1800s. More specifically, while the word itself has been around even longer, “flop” was first used to describe failure around that time. From there, “flop” has gained more popularity as a term that means failure over the last decade (in the late 2000s and 2010s). Then, social media users began describing celebrities' and artist’s careers in terms of their “flop era” around 2020. [2] X Research source For example, you might’ve seen a movie described as a “flop” by reviewers or heard someone say their party was a “flop” if something went wrong during the event. One of the earliest entries for a “flop era” on Urban Dictionary dates back to 2020. It defines the “flop era” as an instance when someone in the entertainment industry loses relevance or when a Twitter (X) mutual starts getting fewer interactions with their posts."

Maybe you’ve been struggling with a super-hard class, feeling sick, or just feeling down for the past couple of weeks. If you feel like you’re definitely in your flop era, you can let your friends know, too—and maybe get a little sympathy or commiseration from them! [3] X Research source “Just failed another test. I’m so in my flop era 😣 ” “In my pjs, unshowered, behind on work—it’s my flop era, people!” Be careful talking about a friend in their “flop era.” You might not want to use that term unless the friend uses it, too, as it essentially means failure or lack of success."

If an artist or musician seems to be getting less popular (or had a period where they seemed to be declining in the past), you can describe that as their “flop era.” Just keep in mind that some fans might disagree or dislike talking about an artist in that way—it really depends on the person!

      "content": "A “flop era” can remind you of life’s highs and lows. When you think about it, everyone has a “flop era” sooner or later—it’s a natural part of life. There are ups and downs, and just because you’re at a low point, it doesn’t mean the highs will never come. Thus, being in your “flop era” can help you accept the fact that life is full of flops and triumphs, and that’s how it should be! [5] X Research source The term “flop era” also implies a bit of humor. By saying “flop” instead of “failure,” it’s like saying there’s something downright ridiculous or even silly about your current era of misfortune. Finding humor in a situation can help you think more positively about the whole thing, so “flop era” might just be a helpful way of phrasing things!"

If you’ve been feeling low and are officially in your “flop era,” consider it a signal that it’s time to go a little easier on yourself. Of course, it’s important to try and break out of that “flop” feeling eventually, but in the meantime, even taking care of yourself and covering the basics in your daily life is a huge step. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source Self-care can mean different things since it includes all aspects of your mental, physical, and emotional health. If you need to prioritize physical self-care, you could take a walk every day or practice good personal hygiene , such as showering, brushing your teeth, and so on. If you need to prioritize mental and emotional self-care, you could take alone time to unwind every day—maybe while reading or taking a long, soothing bath."

      "content": "Put your “flop” in perspective. First thing first: are you really in your flop era? A “flop” is a failure, but depending on what you’re going through, you might not be failing at anything. Say you accept a low-paying job or move back in with your parents after college; some people might consider that “flop era” material. But consider this: if either of those decisions is right for you, you’re not failing at all. [8] X Research source For example, moving back in with your parents doesn’t have to be a “flop.” If it’ll help you get your life on track and save money, it’s just a wise thing to do! Similarly, if you got stressed and burned out from your previous job, something low-paying with fewer expectations might be just your speed, at least until you’re feeling ready for more."

If you’re in a “flop era,” it might feel like you just don’t have what it takes to get things done—when really, you may need to believe in yourself a little more. You can do that by tackling smaller tasks and proving to yourself that you can follow through. For example: [9] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Try setting a few reasonable goals for yourself. Then, follow through and complete them. This can help you feel more in control of your life—and your “flop era.” Make a plan of action for yourself. How can you make some sort of progress in your life? What can you do to feel like you’re pushing through challenges, even in your flop era? Set a simple routine for yourself. If you can do a task repeatedly, day after day, it may boost your sense of accomplishment and motivation. Look for examples of other people’s successes. What did they do to get through a flop era? Can you take inspiration from their behavior?"

Sometimes, your environment can contribute to feeling like you’re in a flop era—news, problems at work, current events, or the people in your immediate circle. Instead of constantly reacting to things beyond your control, focus on what you can do in the moment to make yourself feel better. [10] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source This can be as simple as forcing yourself to wake up on a regular schedule, take walks outside during your lunch break, or make two blog posts per week.

It’s possible to feel like you’re having a “flop era” for a couple of weeks, months, or even years. Just remember—a “flop era” isn’t official; it’s a label you give yourself, which means you can also decide that your flop era is over any time you like. [11] X Research source"
