[1] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Teacher Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. The point-slope formula uses the slope and the coordinates of a point along the line to find the y-intercept. Use the slope in place of m in y-y 1 = m (x-x 1 ). [2] X Research source For example, if you know the slope of the line is 2, then your formula will look like this: y-y 1 = 2(x-x 1 ) ."

Then, add 3 to each side so y is by itself. The final equation for a line in slope-intercept form with a slope of 2 that contains the point (4, 3) is y = 2x-5 ."

The slope-intercept formula of a line is written as y = m x+b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept (the point on the y-axis where the line crosses it).

Follow the order of operations first before moving the rest of the numbers to the other side. Leave b on one side of the equation to solve it. [9] X Research source In our example, the formula currently reads 8 = 1(3)+b. Multiply 1 and 3 together to get 8 = 3+b. Since 3 is a positive number, subtract 3 from each side to isolate b.
