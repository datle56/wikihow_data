      "content": "Measure out the length of LEDs you need. The LEDs come in 1 long strip. You can cut off individual LEDs when you need them, but they have to be cut at specific points to work properly. Determine how long your LED strip needs to be before cutting off any lights.

      "content": "Find the cut line on the LED’s copper dots. Look for a pair of copper dots on the back of the LED strip. The copper dots indicate where each light connects to the next one on the strip. You will see a dotted cut line running between the copper dots. Choose the line closest to the LED length you measured earlier. The line is the only place you can safely cut the LEDs. If you cut anywhere else, some of the LEDs won’t work.

      "content": "Align the quick connector with the LED strip. Quick connectors can be purchased along with LED lights and are hassle-free ways of completing the electrical circuit. The LED will have a + and - printed on the back. Line up the connector’s black wire with the - and the red wire with the +. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull the plastic bar 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) off of the quick connector. Hold the connector in 1 hand. Find the small plastic bar, usually colored black, at the end. Pull this bar forward to open the connector. Be careful, as the connector is delicate."

      "content": "Peel back the LED’s adhesive backing 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm). Pull the backing off the LED just enough to expose the copper terminals at the end. If your LEDs don’t have this backing, you will have to cut the plastic off of the terminals. [4] X Research source Use a box cutter or knife to cut into the plastic and scrape it away to expose the terminals. Don’t cut all the way through the LED."

Plug the wires into the connector, then turn the connector’s screws clockwise to hold the wires in place. Plug the power supply cord into the terminal’s other end. [6] X Research source If the LEDs don’t light up, check the connections. Mixing up the + and - wires may be the problem. Otherwise, you may have cut the LEDs in the wrong place."

      "content": "Cut the wires to length and slide them through the cap. You will need a black and red wire, which align with the LED’s terminals. Measure out the length of wire you need to connect the LED to your power source. Leave a little extra length, about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm), on the end of each wire. Slide the wires through the small hole you cut into the cap earlier, not the larger opening."

Touch the soldering iron to the solder on the LED to liquefy it, then attach the wires. Hold the wires in place until the solder solidifies again. Once the solder has cooled, pull on the wires to make sure they are soldered in place."
