    {
      "title": "Crack open the tamarind pod.",
      "content": "Crack open the tamarind pod. Tamarind is often sold in whole pods, which can either be fresh or dried. Holding the tamarind pod in both hands, bend it until it snaps, splitting to reveal the pulp and seeds inside. [2] X Research source If the pods are tough, you can soak them in hot water to soften them before you peel them. [3] X Research source You can find tamarind pods at some Asian supermarkets, or you can buy them dried online. Store tamarind pods in a cool, dark place, like the back of a cabinet, where they’ll keep indefinitely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull away the strings that hold the flesh in place.",
      "content": "Pull away the strings that hold the flesh in place. When you break open the pod, you’ll see strings attaching the pulp to the pod. Grasp these with your thumb and forefinger and pull them away from the fruit. They should pull away easily. [4] X Research source This process is similar to removing the strings from string beans."
    },
    {
      "title": "Break off a piece of the pulp with your fingers and eat around the seeds.",
      "content": "Break off a piece of the pulp with your fingers and eat around the seeds. The flesh of the tamarind is tart. It’s more sour when the fruit is slightly unripe and becomes sweeter as the pod ages. Nibble the flesh from around the seeds, much like when you’re eating a cherry or a grape with seeds that you don’t want to chew. [5] X Research source Keep damp paper towels nearby, since eating tamarind this way can be sticky."
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate 4 cups (950 mL) of tamarind pulp into clumps in a bowl.",
      "content": "Separate 4 cups (950 mL) of tamarind pulp into clumps in a bowl. Use your fingers to break the pulp into large pieces. You can either use tamarind concentrate or the pulp from raw tamarind pods. There is no need to de-seed the tamarind pods first, nor to remove any seeds that might be contained in the tamarind concentrate. [6] X Research source The pulp fibers are attached tightly to the seeds, so it's easier to remove the seeds after you mix hot water into the pulp later in the process. Although most seeds are removed from tamarind concentrate, it’s common to find a few, especially in rustic preparations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix 1 tbsp (20 g) of baking soda and 1 tsp (6 g) of salt in with the pulp.",
      "content": "Mix 1 tbsp (20 g) of baking soda and 1 tsp (6 g) of salt in with the pulp. Stir them together as well as you can. However, since the pulp will still be in clumps, the ingredients won’t be fully combined. [7] X Research source Stir until you don't see any more clumps of the dry ingredients."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of boiling water onto the tamarind and stir.",
      "content": "Pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of boiling water onto the tamarind and stir. Heat the water to boiling on the stove or in the microwave, then pour it over the tamarind pulp. The boiling water will help dissolve the tamarind pulp, allowing the baking soda, salt, and tamarind to combine. [8] X Research source As you stir, the water will be absorbed. Once it's fully absorbed, the tamarind mixture should resemble a thick paste."
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate the seeds once the pulp and water are mixed.",
      "content": "Separate the seeds once the pulp and water are mixed. As the pulp dissolves in the hot water, the seeds will separate, making it easier for you to remove them from the mixture. Take your time removing the seeds to make sure no one bites down on one while enjoying your tamarind candy. Either wait until the tamarind has cooled, or use a fork or other utensil so you don’t burn yourself."

    {
      "title": "Mix in 2 cups (400 g) of granulated sugar.",
      "content": "Mix in 2 cups (400 g) of granulated sugar. The recipe calls for 4 cups (800 g) of sugar in total, but at this point, you only need to use about half of that. Add the sugar, then stir the mixture until the sugar is completely blended into the rest of the ingredients. [9] X Research source If you want a sweet and spicy treat, add in 1/2 tsp (2.6 g) of hot chili powder, such as habanero. However, this is optional. Once you stir in the sugar, the tamarind mixture should be somewhat grainy but still sticky."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the bowl and leave it at room temperature for 12 hours.",
      "content": "Cover the bowl and leave it at room temperature for 12 hours. Tamarind balls take a little patience, but the end result will be worth it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel and let the mixture rest for about 12 hours. [10] X Research source There’s no need to refrigerate the mixture. Just place it somewhere on your counter where it won’t be disturbed."

    {
      "title": "Stir in the remaining 2 cups (400 g) of sugar before you form the balls.",
      "content": "Stir in the remaining 2 cups (400 g) of sugar before you form the balls. Since the texture of tamarind can vary depending on its ripeness, the texture of the tamarind mixture may also vary. If the mixture isn’t firm enough to hold its shape, add more sugar to the bowl and stir it in. [11] X Research source If you need to add more sugar, add it in 1/8 cup (25 g) increments until you reach the desired texture."

      "title": "Shape the mixture into balls with your hands.",
      "content": "Shape the mixture into balls with your hands. Take a small amount of the tamarind mixture in your hands and use your palms to roll it into a small ball. You can make the balls any size you like, but tamarind balls are usually about the size of a golf ball. [12] X Research source Wash your hands frequently while rolling out the tamarind balls, since the candy mixture is sticky!"

      "title": "Let the tamarind balls sit for another 2-3 hours to dry out.",
      "content": "Let the tamarind balls sit for another 2-3 hours to dry out. Once the balls have been formed, they need to rest again for several hours before you serve them. This will allow this sweet and sour treat to develop the perfect texture. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Roll the balls in sugar and enjoy.",
      "content": "Roll the balls in sugar and enjoy. Pour a little granulated sugar onto a plate and roll each ball across the sugar so you have a light dusting on the outside of each treat. Then, set out the tamarind balls and let everyone enjoy a few! [14] X Research source If you have any leftover tamarind balls, place them in an airtight container in the refrigerator, where they’ll last for several days."

      "content": "Add tamarind paste to your favorite curry dish or soup. Tamarind adds a delicious sweet-and-sour flavor to curry, soups, stews, dhal, or chili. A little of the paste goes a long way, so just add a dab during the cooking process. [15] X Research source Tamarind is a common ingredient in Southeast Asia, where it is often used in curries."

      "content": "Glaze savory meat dishes with tamarind concentrate. Tamarind adds a tart sweetness to savory dishes, and since it helps tenderize meat, it’s perfect for using as a glaze. Try it on fish, chicken, pork, or ham for a unique flavor with a global appeal. [16] X Research source Try glazing chicken with a combination of tamarind concentrate and orange juice. [17] X Research source Mix tamarind and honey with some hot peppers for a sweet and spicy ham glaze.

The sour taste of tamarind helps to balance the smoky flavor of whiskey and bourbon. [20] X Research source You can also try tamarind in a gin cocktail. Tamarind juice may not have any added sugar, but the syrup is usually sweetened, so take that into account when you’re planning the other ingredients in your cocktail."
