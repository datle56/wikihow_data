Food poisoning is surprisingly common. Check with other members of your household--if all of your roommates have stomachaches after eating dinner last night, it may be due to food poisoning. If you keep having issues more than a couple of days, it is possible that you may have a gastro-intestinal issue that goes beyond a \"stomach bug\".
