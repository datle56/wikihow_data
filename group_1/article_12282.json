Getting rid of excess packaging materials will leave the steaks less insulated, allowing them to transfer heat faster. [1] X Research source If your steaks have been frozen individually in vacuum-sealed bags, it's okay to leave them wrapped. You can also unwrap your steaks and place them directly in the water bath if you don't have any plastic bags on hand. Doing this shouldn't affect their flavor or texture when cooked.

      "content": "Run hot water in your kitchen sink. Turn on the hot water tap and let it run until it's as hot as it can get. For most household sinks, this will be around 115–125 °F (46–52 °C). The warmer the water is, the faster it will thaw the frozen meat. [3] X Research source The ideal temperature for defrosting steaks quickly and safely is around 100 °F (38 °C). [4] X Research source Some health experts warn against using hot water to thaw meat, citing its ability to promote bacterial growth. However, recent studies have shown that it's perfectly safe, as it takes less time for the meat to thaw than it does for germs to spread."

      "content": "Fill a spacious container with 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of water. Once the water has reached the desired temperature, use it to fill a deep cooking pot, casserole dish, or serving bowl. Be careful not to overfill the container—you'll only need to use enough water to completely cover the steaks. Whatever container you select should be spacious enough to hold all of the steaks you'll be cooking (in terms of both area and depth), along with the water you're thawing them in. You can also use your kitchen sink as a thawing container, assuming you have enough space. Just be sure to clean it out afterwards if it comes into contact with raw meat! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Submerge the steaks in the water. Place the steaks at the bottom of the container, allowing them to sit just below the surface of the water. Leave 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of separation between each steak to ensure that they thaw evenly. [6] X Research source Try not to let loose steaks touch or overlap, as this could add to their overall defrosting time."

      "title": "Let the steaks thaw for 10-20 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the steaks thaw for 10-20 minutes. Most cuts will only need 5-10 minutes to reach the right temperature range for cooking. Especially thick selections may need closer to 20. Leave your thawing container out on the countertop so you can keep an eye on the steaks' progress and pull them as soon as they're ready. [7] X Research source To keep your steaks from reaching an unsafe temperature, avoid leaving them in hot water for more than 20 minutes. Steaks defrosted in a water bath may be even juicier than those defrosted in the refrigerator, since the cold air won't dry them out."

The day before you barbecue, remove your steaks from the freezer and find a place for them on one of the central shelves of your fridge. Don't worry about unwrapping them—it's perfectly fine to leave them the way they're packaged.

[10] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2021. Thicker cuts may require even longer (up to 30 hours, in some cases), since it takes longer for them to thaw in the center. Defrosting steaks in the refrigerator is a somewhat slow process, but it will help them thaw more evenly. [11] X Research source Make a note of the exact time that you place your steaks in the refrigerator. A good rule of thumb is to throw them on the grill no earlier than 12 hours after the time you took them out of the freezer the previous day. Never let your steaks sit out at room temperature. Doing so could give harmful bacteria a chance to move in. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Perform a touch test to see if the steaks have thawed enough. Once your steaks have been in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours, take them out and give them a poke. They should be firm, yet have some give, with a cool external temperature and no visible icing. If you need more assurance that your steaks are a safe cooking temperature, you can temp them by sticking a meat thermometer into the thickest part of one of the cuts. As long as you get a reading lower than 40 °F (4 °C), they're good to go. If your steaks have an internal temperature warmer than 40 °F (4 °C), it may be a good idea to throw them out (and check to make sure your fridge is working properly)."

If that's not an option, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or butcher's paper and slip them in a resealable plastic freezer bag. That way, there will be no danger of ice forming on the surface. [13] X Research source If you're using a freezer bag, squeeze as much excess air out of the bag as possible before sealing it up. Exposure to air and moisture can lead to freezer burn, which can easily spoil the flavor and texture of the meat.

Defrosting steaks in the microwave can make them tough, cause them to cook unevenly, and rob them of their natural juices. [15] X Research source Thawing steaks in the microwave won't actually save you much time—a hot water bath will have your steaks ready for the grill or oven in 5-10 minutes, while most defrost cycles take at least 3-4. [16] X Research source Microwave defrosting also presents the risk of accidentally cooking the outside of the meat, or raising its internal temperature enough to be inviting to bacteria."

You can leave your steaks in the refrigerator for up to 4 or 5 days after thawing without worrying about them going bad.
