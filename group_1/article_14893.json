      "content": "Stick with skim milk if you’re trying to control your weight. Skim, 1%, 2%, and whole milk all have the same vitamins and minerals. The main difference is that skim milk has fewer calories and a lower percentage of fat than the other types of milk. Choose skim milk if you’re trying to control your caloric intake or are actively looking to lose weight. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The percentages in milk refer to the amount of fat left in the milk after it’s been pasteurized. Whole milk contains roughly 3.5% fat. Skim milk has less than 0.5% fat, and may be marketed as “fat-free.”"

      "content": "Select 2% or whole milk if you’re trying to bulk up. If you’re actively trying to gain weight or muscle, drinking 2% or whole milk is the way to go.

      "title": "Opt for organic milk if you’re looking for specific acids and vitamins.",
      "content": "Opt for organic milk if you’re looking for specific acids and vitamins. Organic milk has a higher percentage of omega-3 acids and antioxidants and a lower percentage of omega-6 acids than other forms of milk. These minerals and vitamins have been established to help prevent heart disease and muscle inflammation. Select organic milk if you’ve got a specific set of nutrients that you’re after. [3] X Research source Organic milk typically provides a better ratio of fatty acids for your health. Too much omega-6 and too little omega-3 can potentially increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Read the label carefully on a bottle of organic milk to see if it’s “certified organic.” If it isn’t certified, then it hasn’t been checked by the federal government to confirm its contents."

      "content": "Get a lactose-free milk, like soy or almond, if you’re lactose intolerant. If you’re trying to incorporate milk into your diet but happen to be lactose intolerant, opt for a lactose-free milk. Soy and almond milk are usually fortified to contain a lot of the nutrients and minerals found in traditional milk, so read the label carefully to ensure that a bottle contains the same vitamins and minerals as traditional milk.

      "content": "Have 1 glass of milk a day to get enough vitamin A, calcium, and potassium. While there is some debate about the healthiness of consuming milk every day, drinking at least 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of milk a day can provide you with a number of important nutrients. Milk has a lot of calcium, vitamin A, and potassium, which all aid the body with digestion, keep your bones healthy, and regulate muscles. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source One 8 fl oz (240 mL) glass of milk contains roughly 450 mg of potassium, 35% of your daily value in calcium, and 5% of your daily value in Vitamin A."

Drinking at least 4 fl oz (120 mL) of milk at least 30 minutes after working out can give the body a much-needed boost following some intense physical activity.

The thick base that milk provides helps coat the lining of your stomach and can provide you with some much-needed relief. For some people, a glass of milk can help settle nausea after consuming too much spicy or salty food. [9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Milk has the same effect in the mouth—if you eat something that sets your mouth on fire or makes it hurt, drinking a little milk can help greatly. Stick to skim milk instead of milk with a higher fat percentage. Milk with a higher fat percentage can sometimes make heartburn or an upset stomach worse."

Whether you’re trying to prevent gout or manage a pre-existing case, consuming milk regularly helps reduce the odds that the uric acid in your body crystallizes and causes more problems down the line. [10] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source In recent years, uric acid has also been linked to other cardiovascular and metabolic problems.
