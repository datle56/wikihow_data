Slowly massage around the eye, rubbing in small circles. If you want to make it a regular habit however, you should purchase a vibrating eye roller. [1] X Research source They are relatively inexpensive, limit the transmission of oils between hand and face, and are specifically designed to promote blood flow around the eyes. If you massage with your hands, make sure you have no excess oils in or on your fingers. Otherwise, the exchange of oil may result in skin irritation. You can enhance your eyes by taking care of the delicate under-eye skin. It can give you a brighter and more youthful appearance.

Though not increasing the actual size of your eyes per se, making sure your eyes are as strong as possible is important and shouldn't be overlooked. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Alternate quickly between near and far sight. Purposefully switching between the two quickly will force your eyes to speed up the time they take to adapt. Directional eye exercises will improve mobility and reaction time. Try moving your eyes in different directions. Keep your head locked in one place, then look up, down, left and right. Try moving your eyes as far in each direction as you can. This will maximize the effectiveness of the exercise."

      "content": "Get enough sleep. If you're prone to staying up late at night, you'll know the reddened, dry look of eyes that comes with sleep deprivation. Getting enough sleep is mandatory if you want to maximize the size of your eyes. Eyes need at least five hours per night to properly regenerate.

While moisturizing the area around the eyes is going to improve the look of your eyes the most, the fact remains you should be giving your face a full-blown moisture treatment. This will make you look more vibrant, which in turn will have a beneficial effect on the way your eyes are perceived. Treat your face with a facial moisturizer, and buy an eye moisturizer for the area around your eyes. Eye moisturizers are designed to be very mild, which is perfect for such a sensitive area.

      "content": "Adjust your eyes to dim light. It's a well-known fact that your pupils will adjust according to the amount of light in your line of vision. Being somewhere darker or dimly lit will force your pupils to enlarge so they can trap more light. Going somewhere dark will naturally increase your pupil size as a result, which in turn may increase the apparent size of your eyes. Keep in mind the opposite is true for bright lights, so it's best to avert your gaze from any particular brightness if you want to keep your pupils in check. Some research has suggested that your pupils will contract and dilate when you even think of a different light setting. If you're in a bind where you have no control over the light setting, imagine yourself in a dimly lit space and check to see if it has any effect on your eyes. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an eyeshadow. Eyeshadow is an effective way of attracting attention to your eyes and giving them a look of greater volume. Eyeshadows are good to apply first, as they give the other makeup (like mascara and eyeliner) a coloured foundation. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source The colour and tone of eyeshadow you choose should be determined by the colour of your eyes. What works for one colour might not work for another. Brown eyes are very versatile, and can make just about any colour work. Purple is a great shade for brown eyes. Blue eyes look best with earthier tones like brown or muted grey. Green eyes favour moderate and warm colours. A mild purple or golden brown work very well. The colour of your eyeshadow need not match up with your natural eye colour, but if you do, it will make your natural eye colour pop out."

Because nude eyeliner is barely perceivable, it's incredibly versatile and fits just about any situation.

Using liquid eyeliner, draw the line outwards from the outer end of your eye, ending it with a pointed tip. [14] X Research source Because a cat's eye look is so common and relatively simple, there are lots of different ways you could go about it. Don't forget to create a base first. Use the lightest coloured eyeshadow that matches your skin tone. This will emphasize the effect of the eyeliner, particularly if you're using a dark-coloured eyeliner like brown or black.

They open up your eyes and give them a greater frame than you would muster with natural lashes. Apply some glue to the back line of the lashes, and place it snugly behind your natural lashes. Though it may not target the eyes directly, false eyelashes give the look of opening up your eyes."

      "content": "Smudge a white shimmer around your eyes. [17] X Research source Like a focused white eyeliner, a white shimmer will give your eyes a look of alertness. Draw white eyeliner around your eyes and gently smudge it until you have the look of a graceful cloud around your eyes. Make sure the liner is evenly spread, fading out by the point it reaches your eyebrows. A white shimmer is typically reserved for more glamorous occasions, but if you're daring you might try working it into a casual look. Getting a good shimmer may take a few times if you're not used to it. If it's not something you've tried before, the interesting new looks you get from it will be worth the challenge. Other tinted highlighters can also be used in the inner corners of the eyes to make them pop and appear larger."

Eyelashes are the natural frame of your eyes, and curling them will attract more attention to that part of your face. Curled lashes will also increase the wideness of your eyes. Using an eyelash curler, start at the base of your lashes and hold the curler for three seconds. Don't curl for any longer than that, as you'll risk hurting your lashes."
