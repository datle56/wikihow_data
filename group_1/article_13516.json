      "content": "Apply a volumizing product to freshly-washed hair before drying it. Start with freshly-washed hair. Apply a volumizing mousse to your hair, from roots to ends, then blow-dry your hair. Point the nozzle downwards to ensure that your hair dries sleek and smooth. If you have limp hair, it would be a good idea to add a root lifter in addition to the mousse. Alternatively, place a round brush beneath a section of hair, over-direct the hair at a 90 or 135 degree angle at the roots, and then continue blow drying down the strand as usual. Apply a light misting of light to medium-hold hairspray to your hair after you dry it. This will help the curls stay better."

Curl it with a 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) curling iron, holding the rod horizontally. Hold the iron for a few sections, then release the clamp on the iron. If your hair doesn't hold curls well, stick with a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) curling iron. For gentle waves, use a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) curling iron."
