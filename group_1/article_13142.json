      "content": "Use a wall-mounted clothing rack to display your clothes. You can purchase a clothing rack that you can hang on your wall by either nailing it or screwing it in place with a power drill. Choose a rack that is large enough to suit your needs and hang it so it’s even and securely fastened to the wall by driving the nails or screws all the way into the wall. Put your clothes on hangers and hang them from the rack. [3] X Research source Don’t hang the rack too high or you won’t be able to reach it.

Put your clothes on hangers and slide the hangers into the links of the chain to display them. [4] X Research source You can display the clothes at a greater height so people can see what you have available. Make sure the clothes are hanging at too great of a height of you want people to be able to remove them from the chains. You can find chains at hardware stores, home improvement stores, and online."

      "content": "Measure and mark the mounting locations. If you’re installing racks to drywall, locate and mark 2 wall studs you can use to mount them to. For any other materials, choose the height you want the rack to be and mark the location, then use a ruler or tape measure to measure the second mounting site, and draw a straight line between them with a pencil so the racks will be even. [5] X Research source You can use a ruler, level, or straight edge to draw the straight line."

A flange fitting is a metal pipe fitting that is designed to fit 2 pipes together, but you can use them to mount your racks to your walls! Place the flange fitting over the 1 of the mounting sites you marked and use a power drill do drive 1 inch (2.5 cm) screws into each of the screw holes of the fitting. Then, attach the other flange fitting to the wall in the same fashion. [6] X Research source You can find flange fittings at hardware stores and online. If you’re drilling into a tile or concrete wall, drill pilot holes first, then drive the screws into the holes with a power drill."

Screw-in the pipe nipple into the flange fittings so you can attach additional pipes to form your wall rack. [7] X Research source Screw the pipe nipples into each of the flange fittings. You can find pipe nipples at hardware stores, plumbing supply stores, and online. Make sure the nipples are firmly secured in the fittings."

You can connect the 2 flange fittings to form a clothing rack by attaching a pipe elbow to 1 of the pipe nipples, sliding a length of steel pipe into it, and then securing the pipe by adding a pipe elbow to the other pipe nipple. The pipe will be held securely between the 2 pipe elbows. [8] X Research source To fit the length of pipe, insert it into 1 elbow first, then attach the second pipe elbow to the other end of the length of pipe and pipe nipple. Choose a length of pipe that measures the distance between your 2 flange fittings. You can find 90-degree pipe elbows and 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) pipe at hardware stores, plumbing supply stores, and online."

Place the hangers so the clothing hangs at an angle so you can see what it looks like without having to sift through them. [9] X Research source You could also lay a board across the pipes and place folded clothes on them to display them."

Find a stud with a stud finder and mark its location with a pencil. Then, locate the adjacent stud and mark it with a pencil as well. [10] X Research source You can also locate studs by knocking lightly on the wall and listening for a higher, more solid sound that would indicate that a stud is behind the wall. If you have a plaster wall, use a stud finder to locate studs behind the thick surface."

[13] X Research source Drive the screws all the way into the wall. If your mounting brackets came with screws, use them to install the brackets.
