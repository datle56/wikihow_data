      "content": "Create a cool and unique caption that matches your eccentric vibe. A “quirky” post can be a photo of a crazy outfit, a selfie taken in a reflection of a spoon, or something completely random and unexpected. Here are some captions for people who consider themselves slightly offbeat or unconventional: Be back never. Fluent in sarcasm. Hey Siri, skip to Friday. Young, dumb, and broke. Running late is my cardio. I love men without the “n.” I’m just here for the snacks. Don’t follow me, I’m lost too. I put the “pro” in “procrastinate.” I’m not weird, I’m limited edition. Being this funny is a full-time job. Friday, my second favorite F word. Hashtags kind of look like waffles… When you’re downie, eat a brownie. The only marathons I run are on Netflix. I’m not lazy…I’m on energy-saving mode. Why fall in love when you can fall asleep? Taking life one awkward moment at a time. If you scroll past this, I didn’t do my job right. I’m on a seafood diet. When I see food, I eat it. I don’t need a motivational quote. I need coffee. Another gorgeous day ruined by responsibilities. You can’t make everyone happy. You’re not pizza. I might not be perfect, but at least I’m not a potato. I like my coffee like I like my ex…I don’t like coffee. When you’re wearing Nikes but you just can’t do it 😵‍💫 People are like Oreos. The good stuff is on the inside. The first 5 days after the weekend are always the toughest. People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!"

There are no rules when it comes to captioning your photo, so be as wild, unhinged, and hilarious as you like! Here are some great caption ideas for guys: How’s the view? Suns out, guns out. I’m a real life meme. No shirt, no problem. It’s the next Bachelor. Pathetic but aesthetic. Whatever it is, I didn’t do it. Let’s taco ‘bout how funny I am. When nothing goes right, go left. I do a thing called, “what I want.” I got back with my EX…Box 360. You’re the 9 to 5. I’m the weekend. Fear the beard, embrace the weird. You can't spell awesome without ME. My life’s a joke, but at least I’m funny. Games + Snacks + My Bed = Heaven Why does my food look better than me? Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate.

      "content": "Use an inside joke or playful banter to come up with the perfect caption. Humor is the heart of any good friendship, and we’ve all had moments where our friends make us laugh so hard we can’t breathe. Here are some funny captions to express love to your besties and show your followers just how close you are: We’re the same kind of weird. We should have our own reality show. You’re the charger to my dying phone. Socially acceptable is for other people. Our vibe: chaos and unhinged memories. We don’t make sense, but we make laughter. Partners in crime, minus the crime…most times. Our friendship is tighter than our jeans after brunch. We have it all—love, laughter, and terrible decisions. Best friends share one heart…and maybe one brain too. Good friends are hard to find and even harder to get rid of. Friendship: when you can insult each other and still share food. Friends are like bras—close to your heart and there for support. Yes, we know how obnoxious we are together. No, we don’t care. When life gives you lemons, chuck them at your friends and laugh. Our friendship is built on trust…and roasting each other every day. You know you’re best friends when you both hate the same people. They say friends are the best therapy, but I don’t think it’s working… If you aren’t slightly embarrassed by your friends, are they really your friends? We’ve been friends for so long that I can’t remember which one of us is the bad influence."

      "content": "Make your selfie stand out with a witty joke or one-liner. If you want to draw attention to your post, drop a funny caption that matches your facial expression or pokes fun at the concept of taking selfies. It’s a great way to set yourself apart from the “long hair don’t care” and “woke up like this” crowd, plus makes you seem more relatable. Here are some hilarious ideas: My evil twin. Take 739247. Savage, not average. I have no selfie control. 50 shades of exhaustion. Serving face, no refunds. New look, same mistakes. I call this hairstyle “I tried.” I came, I saw, I contoured. One mental breakdown later… PSA: I did not wake up like this. Mentally in the South of France. I can’t believe it’s not Photoshop! The bags under my eyes are Gucci. Done chasing because I’m the catch. Looks like you’re lacking vitamin ME. A selfie a day keeps the doctor away. I got 99 problems, but a bad angle ain’t one. Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth. It took 45 tries to take this photo. You’re welcome. Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s the Paris filter. Face card never declines, but my credit card might. Behind every great selfie is a bestie who approved it. God knew I would be too powerful if I had social skills. If only my bank account was as full as my camera roll… I’m not saying I’m the best, but I’m definitely in the top 10 😙 They call it a “selfie” because “narcissistic” is too hard to spell."

Whether you’re uploading a selfie with your besties or a blurry group shot from the weekend, let your friends know how much they mean to you. These funny captions are filled with love and humor, and are perfect for any occasion: In squad we trust. Besties for the resties ♾️ We put the “we” in “weird.” We put down our food for this. Cupcakes in a world of muffins. We’re sharing one brain cell 🤪 We’re proof that chaos can be cute. This is why we can’t have nice things. Friends = therapists you can drink with We came, we saw, we made it awkward. Friends who slay together, stay together. 🚨 Hot mess express coming through 🚨 Powerpuff Girls, but make it dysfunctional. We’ll apologize to our neighbors tomorrow. If I don’t post a picture, did it even happen? They know where the bodies are buried 🔗 We don’t need a filter, just group therapy 💀 How could you not double tap these faces? 🥹 You can’t sit with us…unless you bring snacks. The best memories come from the worst ideas. Proof that friendship is just hating the same stuff. When first comes to worst, the squad comes first. Friends buy you lunch. Best friends eat your lunch. I would never let my best friends do anything stupid…alone. We tried to be normal once…the worst 5 minutes of our lives! Powered by caffeine, bad jokes, and questionable life choices 🔋 True friends don’t judge each other. They judge other people together. Best friends don’t care if your house is clean. They care if you have wine."

No matter how long you’ve been dating, these captions will make your partner feel wanted and put a huge smile on their face: Thank you, Tinder. Dumb and dumber. It’s a love-hate thing. Sponsored by Hinge. Life sucks. You don’t. Swiped right, now it’s for life 🤞 You had me at “let’s grab tacos.” I love you even when I’m hungry. World’s most annoying couple 🏆 I love you like Kanye loves Kanye. My favorite hobby is annoying you. Here’s to being my partner in wine. Thanks for being my unpaid therapist. Not McDonald’s but he’s/she’s lovin’ it. We go together like Netflix and snacks. With great love comes great expenses. I miss you more than my GPS misses a turn. One of us is always right, and the other is him. I love you more than coffee and that’s saying a lot. It wasn’t love at first sight, but we turned out alright. Thank you for being so good at killing spiders 🥹💓 We both like taking long romantic walks…to the fridge. I found someone who loves me as much as I love pizza. He’s not perfect, but at least he’s not from my hometown. Relationships are like a walk in the park…Jurassic Park 🦖 Together, we’re a masterpiece. Individually, we’re a hot mess. Sometimes I look at my girlfriend and think…damn, she’s one lucky woman. If we were on a reality show, we’d definitely be the couple that argues over the aux."

Whether you’re a new member or a soon-to-be graduate, there are tons of funny captions that reference drinking, partying, and the bond of brotherhood/sisterhood. Here are some creative options to help you get started: Saturdaze. Big time rush. Lagar than life. Rise and Stein! C’s get degrees. Sip happens, bro. No GPA, no problem. Bad day to be a beer 🍺 Sisters before misters 🎀 When in doubt, rage it out. Stay positive, test negative! Raging now, regretting later. This week was really a rush. Is it a frat house or a zoo? Yes. If there’s no beer, I’m not there. Born to frat, forced to graduate. I came, I saw, I don’t remember. One nation, under the influence. Does this shirt make me look frat? We make every hour a happy hour. It’s not alcoholism when you’re in college. You’re either a fart smella or a smart fella. Just trying to remember if I took that final 🤔 Built on beer, bad ideas, and brotherhood 🤝 Weekend forecast: 100% chance of sending it. Mom said I’d never use Greek, now look at me. Brotherhood is just another term for hangovers. Legend says we’re still waiting for the pizza guy. Pledges were harmed in the making of this post. When life gives you lemons, spike the lemonade 🍋 Peak physical condition: carrying a keg up the stairs. Our chapter has 99 problems, but good vibes ain’t one 💅 Call me Cuervo cause I don’t believe in what these Jose 🍹🍋‍🟩"

      "content": "Try to craft a caption that’s short, silly, and snappy. According to Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. After a few lines of text, Instagram hides the rest of your caption, so include the most eye-catching (or out of pocket) details at the beginning. Most users won’t read a lengthy caption, so when in doubt, keep it simple. Have fun experimenting with emojis to add more personality and character! Include questions in your caption to increase engagement . For instance, you could caption your post with “Does this shirt make me look frat?” or “Who wants a kiss under the mistletoe?” Gasper also recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption. Gasper also recommends “coming up with five or six different captions” and choosing the best one. If you’re not sure about which one to use, reach out to a friend or family member and ask for their opinion."
