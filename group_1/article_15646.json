    {
      "title": "Position your stencil on your light box.",
      "content": "Position your stencil on your light box . If you do not have a light box, you can use any transparent surface with a bright light behind it. You can try a window, glass table or clear plate with a flashlight or bright light behind it. The objective is to be able to see the outline of your stencil through the paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the cardstock on top of the stencil.",
      "content": "Place the cardstock on top of the stencil. The light from the lightbox will shine through the stencil so that you are able to trace around it with ease. To keep the cardstock stationary as you work, tape the stencil to the front of the cardstock or tape it to the lightbox."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the lightbox on and emboss your card by hand.",
      "content": "Turn the lightbox on and emboss your card by hand. Use your stylus or embossing tool, and apply pressure around the interior edges of the stencil. You do not need to press over all the open area, as pressing along the edges will create the embossing. With the embossing stylus pen, trace the edges of the shape that are lit by the lightbox. The fine point of the stylus is ideal for small areas, while the larger side is great for large areas. Using the embossing tool to trace around the stencil’s edges will cause the paper to stretch and subsequently achieve the raised, embossed effect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the cardstock for embossing.",
      "content": "Prepare the cardstock for embossing. Set your large piece of scrap paper, like a place mat, in front of you. Place your cardstock in the middle of the scrap paper. Lay out your cardstock so the surface you want to emboss on is faced upward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press the rubber stamp you chose lightly onto the embossing pad.",
      "content": "Press the rubber stamp you chose lightly onto the embossing pad. Look at the stamp to make sure the surface of the stamp is completely covered with the embossing solution from the pad. Firmly press the stamp onto the desired spot on the cardstock. Find a happy medium with the amount of ink you use to cover the surface of the stamp. Too much ink can make the design appear blurred once stamped onto the paper. To ensure a crisp image, carefully lift the stamp straight up. Clean the stamp by wiping any leftover embossing solution off with a damp rag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stamp the paper with your coated stamp.",
      "content": "Stamp the paper with your coated stamp. When pressing the stamp against the paper, make sure that level pressure is applied firmly to the stamp’s back to ensure an even application. Follow the stamping up with embossing powder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sprinkle embossing powder over the stamped location.",
      "content": "Sprinkle embossing powder over the stamped location. Make sure all the embossing solution is completely covered. Lift the card so any embossing powder that did not adhere to the stamped area can fall to the paper below. You may need to lightly tap the card. Return this unused powder to its container to be used again. Sit your card back down. Use your paint brush to dust off any embossing granules that remain on the card outside the stamped design."
    },
    {
      "title": "Emboss the design onto the paper with your heat gun.",
      "content": "Emboss the design onto the paper with your heat gun. Plug in your heat gun and hold it a couple inches away from the card. Move it around above the powdered area. The heat will begin to transform the powder into a raised, shiny coating. Pay attention not to get the heat too close to the card or hold it in one place too long as it can scorch the card and ruin the embossing. Be careful not to burn yourself with the heat gun or with the finished embossed design. Allow it to cool for at least 30 seconds before touching it."

      "title": "Set up your work station.",
      "content": "Set up your work station. You will need an embossing machine, an embossing folder, and a piece of cardstock or watercolor paper with measurements of 4 ¼” x 5 ½” so that it fits the embossing folder. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Emboss your card with the embossing machine.",
      "content": "Emboss your card with the embossing machine. Place the embossing folder at the entrance of the embossing machine and crank it through the machine. The roller applies pressure to the paper or cardstock, which creates raised areas onto the paper from the embossing folder. [2] X Research source Get your cardstock situated. Place your card face side down over the stencil. Check to make sure you have both the stencil and the card aligned as you desire. For a deep impression of the stencil, pass the embossing folder through the machine two to three times. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove the embossed paper or cardstock.",
      "content": "Remove the embossed paper or cardstock. Take the embossing folder from the machine and lift it open to reveal the completed embossed paper. If you are using cardstock, consider adding more character by sanding the cardstock with sandpaper to reveal the cardstock’s lighter core. This can add a new design element to its appearance."
