      "content": "Tap the shells to check if the oysters are still alive. Oysters should be frozen, eaten, or cooked alive to prevent the spread of foodborne illness. When you tap on a live oyster, it will hold its shell tightly shut, or it will close it if it’s opened. Sort through the oysters individually, carefully checking each one.

      "title": "Wash the shells thoroughly under cool running water.",
      "content": "Wash the shells thoroughly under cool running water. Before you freeze the oysters, you should wash the shells to rinse away any sand or pieces of shell that might be present. If you like, you can gently scrub the outside of the shell with a stiff-bristled brush to remove any dirt. By washing the oysters before you freeze them, they’ll be ready to shuck and cook as soon as you thaw them out. This will also help preserve their texture better than washing them after they are thawed."

      "content": "Place whole oysters in moisture-resistant bags in the freezer. The shells will protect the oysters from being damaged, so you can just toss them into a resealable plastic bag, then place the bag into the freezer. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source This is a great method for freezing oysters if you don’t have very many of them; however, it’s not the most efficient if you are storing a large quantity."

      "content": "Store the oysters in the freezer for up to 3 months. After 3 months, you run the risk of your oysters becoming freezer-burned. When you're ready to thaw them out, place the bag of oyster shells into your refrigerator for about 24 hours. [3] X Research source Use a permanent marker to write the date that you froze the oysters on the bag before you put it into the freezer so you don't forget how long it's been."

      "title": "Tap each oyster to make sure it's still alive.",
      "content": "Tap each oyster to make sure it's still alive. A live oyster has a muscle that it uses to hold its shell tightly closed. If a live oyster is open, tapping on its shell should cause it to slam shut. If it stays open, the oyster has already died and you should throw it away. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source Oysters should always be shucked, eaten, or frozen while they are still alive to prevent exposure to a natural bacteria that can cause serious illness or even death."

Run the knife along the top edge of the oyster to free it from the shell, then break the top shell away.

When you’re eating oysters raw, you usually slurp this liquid up with the oyster. By saving the juice, you can add it to whatever recipe you make with your oysters when you thaw them out, and you’ll get even more oyster flavor in your dish.

You might have to work the knife back and forth a little before you can twist it, but by twisting and prying, you should feel the oyster pop as the shell releases.
