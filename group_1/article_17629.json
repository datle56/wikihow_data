      "title": "Tap the mouthpiece with your hand to knock out loose debris.",
      "content": "Tap the mouthpiece with your hand to knock out loose debris. Turn the harmonica so the side you blow into is facing your hand. Pick it up and give it a few solid taps against your palm. You can then blow into the hole to see if it works again. [1] X Research source To figure out what holes are blocked, play your harmonica. When you blow into a blocked hole, you won’t hear the full sound from it. Saliva is the most common cause of blockages. If you play your harmonica regularly, you’re bound to end up with moisture problems. Clear your harmonica out right after playing it to prevent blockages from forming."
    },
    {
      "title": "Breathe rapidly over the blocked hole to help air dry it.",
      "content": "Breathe rapidly over the blocked hole to help air dry it. Raise the harmonica to your lips as if you’re going to play it. Focus on the hole you’re clearing. If multiple holes aren’t working, deal with them one at a time. Inhale and exhale as quickly as you can 3 to 5 times to clear out the remaining moisture. [2] X Research source When you’re done, play the harmonica to test it out. If it still doesn’t work, then something is still blocking the reed. If the harmonica sounds a little better when you test it, repeat the treatment. Sometimes, tapping and blowing into it a few times clears out lingering debris."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a toothpick to scrape out any debris still inside the harmonica.",
      "content": "Use a toothpick to scrape out any debris still inside the harmonica. The hole most likely has something solid, like hair or pocket fuzz, in it. Take a small toothpick and gently poke it into the blocked hole. If you’re able to see anything inside there, pull it out with the toothpick. Hold the harmonica down at an angle to shake out the loose debris. [3] X Research source Blockages from solid debris are common in harmonicas, especially if you carry them around in your pocket and other places where they aren’t well-protected. Play the harmonica afterward. If it still doesn’t sound right, you may have to open it up to remove the blockage."

      "title": "Unscrew the cover plates for better access to the reed holes.",
      "content": "Unscrew the cover plates for better access to the reed holes. The cover plate screws are small, so try using a flathead screwdriver from an eyeglass repair kit. Your harmonica has a metal plate on its top and bottom sides. Each plate has a pair of screws on it. Turn them counterclockwise to remove them, then take off the plates and set them aside. [4] X Research source You can get eyeglass repair kits online or from eye care stores. Otherwise, most hardware stores carry mini flathead screwdrivers."

      "title": "Clean the remaining debris out of the holes with a toothpick.",
      "content": "Clean the remaining debris out of the holes with a toothpick. Blockages are much easier to see and access with the plate covers off. However, be gentle. A toothpick won’t usually damage the reed, but it’s better to be careful. Scrape off the stuck debris, then shake or lightly tap out the rest into your hand. After you’re done, place the cover plates back over the reeds, replace the screws, and turn them clockwise to secure them. [5] X Research source If you’re really struggling with a harmonica that is in bad shape, you could also unscrew the reed plates to dig into the reed. However, the reed is delicate, so it’s better to avoid taking everything apart and usually isn’t necessary anyway."

      "title": "Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the cover plates.",
      "content": "Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the cover plates. Remove the metal plates on the harmonica’s top and bottom sides. Each plate has a screw on its left and right edges. Turn the screws counterclockwise to remove them. Once the screws are gone, pull the plates off the reed. [6] X Research source If your harmonica sounds clear but doesn’t work unless you blow softly into it, the reed is no longer centered. It happens over time from frequent use or when you bump your instrument against something solid. Remember which side is the harmonica’s top and bottom. Many harmonicas have numbers on the holes, so, when 1 is on your left, the harmonica is positioned correctly. The #1 hole makes the lowest sound when you blow into it."

      "title": "Place a wooden toothpick inside a hole on the mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Place a wooden toothpick inside a hole on the mouthpiece. The yellow plates on the top and bottom are the reeds responsible for how your harmonica sounds. To adjust the sound, slide the toothpick into one of the holes you blow into on the harmonica’s front. Then, move the tip of the toothpick up until you feel it resting against something solid. If you push it up, you will be able to see the part of the reed moving when you look down on it from above. [7] X Research source You may notice scratches on the reed near where it connects to the plates. These are normal. They are created when the reed was made, so they aren’t a sign that your harmonica needs to be replaced."

    {
      "title": "Pull the reed up if it doesn’t work when you blow into it.",
      "content": "Pull the reed up if it doesn’t work when you blow into it. Press against the reed very gently to avoid damaging it. Give it about 5 soft nudges towards the lower reed plate. If the harmonica didn’t make much sound when you blew into it, this will fix the problem. [8] X Research source The top reed plate is for blow notes, or what you hear when you blow into the harmonica. Be sure to adjust the reed with caution. Pushing it too hard can break it. It’s a delicate but very important part of your instrument!"

      "title": "Push the reed down if the harmonica didn’t work when you inhaled.",
      "content": "Push the reed down if the harmonica didn’t work when you inhaled. Place the tip of the toothpick over one of the holes on top of the upper reed plate. Use the tip of the toothpick to nudge the reed. Move it up to 5 times to adjust the sound. Lowering the reed fixes sound issues when you play draw notes. [9] X Research source Draw notes happen when you breathe in while playing. The bottom reed is responsible for them."

      "title": "Blow into the harmonica to test its sound.",
      "content": "Blow into the harmonica to test its sound. Place the cover plates back on the harmonica. Instead of screwing everything back together, hold the plates there. Then, play each note. Inhale and exhale hard for each one. If the sound is still off, pull the cover plates back off to make additional adjustments. [10] X Research source Test the harmonica after each adjustment so you don’t move the reed too far. Gradual adjustments are best."

      "title": "Reassemble the cover plating when you’re done fixing the harmonica.",
      "content": "Reassemble the cover plating when you’re done fixing the harmonica. Place the cover plates back over the reed plates. Make sure the top cover is on top. The screw holes in the covers will align with the ones on the underlying plates when this happens. Then, insert the screws, turn them clockwise to secure them in place, and store your harmonica until you’re ready to play it again."
