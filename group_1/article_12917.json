      "title": "Round nails are filed to mimic the natural curve of your fingertips.",
      "content": "Round nails are filed to mimic the natural curve of your fingertips. They have soft, curved edges without any sharp corners, and they resemble the natural shape that your nail actually grows in. This option is a classic, so it’s perfect if you’re looking for something that’s simple, elegant, and timeless. It looks especially good on short to medium-length nails. [1] X Research source To do it yourself: Use a nail file to file around the natural shape of your nail, making sure the top edge is smooth and rounded, without any sharp corners. [2] X Research source Best for: Everyone, but especially people with shorter fingers, wide nail beds, or people who want a low-maintenance shape."

    {
      "title": "Oval is an elongated version of round nails.",
      "content": "Oval is an elongated version of round nails. Like round nails, the top edge is filed to create a curved, rounded look with no sharp edges. The main difference is that oval nails taper down to a slightly narrower point, so they appear more oval or egg-shaped, rather than perfectly round. [3] X Research source This style has a lengthening effect, which can be super elegant-looking, and it also works on slightly longer nail lengths than the round shape does. To do it yourself: File your nails so that the edges are rounded and curved, like you would for the round shape, but file the sides so that they’re narrowing down to a slimmer point, like an egg. [4] X Research source Best for: Everyone, especially people with short or wide nail beds or who want to elongate the look of their fingers and hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Square nails have straight sides and a blunt edge at the top.",
      "content": "Square nails have straight sides and a blunt edge at the top. They have sharp corners as well. Square nails are a versatile and classic option, but they can make your nails look a bit shorter. Because of this, they look especially good with medium to long nail lengths, and they also suit people who have naturally long fingers. [5] X Research source To do it yourself: File the top of the nail into a straight edge, so that it forms sharp corners where it meets the sides. [6] X Research source It’s also a good idea to keep your nails a bit longer than you might otherwise if you’re doing a square shape at home—you can always file them down more if you decide you want to, but you can’t add more length if you realize they look a bit too short! Best for: People with long and slender fingers or narrow nail beds."

    {
      "title": "Squoval nails are a mix of square and round nails.",
      "content": "Squoval nails are a mix of square and round nails. They have the straight edge of the square nail shape, but the corners are filed so that they’re softer and slightly rounded. This shape is the perfect middle ground if you like the drama of a square shape, but you want it to look more natural. It also looks great on all nail lengths, from short to medium to long. [7] X Research source To do it yourself: File the top of your nail into a straight line, like you would for the square shape. Next, file the corners until they’re softer and slightly rounded, rather than sharp. [8] X Research source Best for: Everyone."

      "title": "Almond nails narrow down to a slightly pointy (but still rounded) peak.",
      "content": "Almond nails narrow down to a slightly pointy (but still rounded) peak. The sides gradually slim down as they reach the top of the nail, just like the shape of an actual almond. They’re similar to oval nails, but they’re a bit more slender and pointed. [9] X Research source This shape has an elongating effect, so it's a very elegant and feminine choice. To do it yourself: File the sides of the nail down to a narrower peak, making sure the edges are rounded and slightly ovular (but slimmer and pointier than typical oval nails). [10] X Research source Best for: Everyone, especially people who want to elongate their fingers or hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stiletto nails narrow down to a dramatic pointed tip.",
      "content": "Stiletto nails narrow down to a dramatic pointed tip. Like almond nails, the sides are slim and taper down to form a peak, but the peak is much sharper. This nail shape is super dramatic and striking, so it’s an awesome choice if you want to make a statement with your manicure. [11] X Research source To do it yourself: File the sides of the nail down until they form a pointed tip at the top. Best for: Anyone who wants to make a bold and dramatic statement. One word of warning: This nail shape is more prone to breakage, so it might not be the best choice if you’re going to be doing hard work with your hands in the near future. It also looks best on longer nail lengths."

      "title": "Almondetto nails are a mix between the almond and stiletto shapes.",
      "content": "Almondetto nails are a mix between the almond and stiletto shapes. If you like the classic look of almond nails but you want something slightly more dramatic (without going crazy), this could be the perfect shape for you! It’s basically an almond nail, but with a slightly longer length and a slightly more pointed tip. This style looks best on long to extra-long nail lengths, so it works perfectly for a fancy or more formal nail look for a special event. [12] X Research source To do it yourself: File the sides of each nail down until they form a slightly narrow peak, but make sure it’s not super pointy. If the top looks too sharp, file around it gently until it’s slightly softened and more rounded. Best for: Anyone with long nails."
    },
    {
      "title": "This shape tapers down like stiletto, but the top is more square.",
      "content": "This shape tapers down like stiletto, but the top is more square. Think of the top of a coffin or the tip of a ballerina’s pointe shoe, and you’ve got this shape. The sides are filed so that they’re almost narrowing to a point, but then the top of the nail is filed into a straight, square edge. This shape looks best on long to extra-long nail lengths, and it’s the perfect choice if you like the drama of stiletto nails, but you want something slightly less sharp. [13] X Research source To do it yourself: File the sides of your nail so that they’re narrowing down as they reach the top. Then, file across the top of the nail so it’s straight, forming a square-like shape. [14] X Research source Best for: People with long nails, long fingers, and/or angled cuticles. Some people consider ballerina and coffin nails to be the same shape, but some consider ballerina to be a slightly more rounded version of coffin nails, with corners that are slightly less pointy."

      "title": "Lipstick nails are filed in a diagonal slant.",
      "content": "Lipstick nails are filed in a diagonal slant. As the name suggests, this shape mimics the slanted edge you see when you open a fresh tube of lipstick. This striking and eye-catching shape looks good on both long and short nails, and it’s a great choice if you want something a little more unique. [15] X Research source To do it yourself: File each nail at a diagonal angle, so that the right side is longer and forms a point, just like the shape of a new lipstick bullet. [16] X Research source Best for: Everyone who wants to experiment with an edgy style."

    {
      "title": "This nail shape flares out so that it’s actually wider at the top.",
      "content": "This nail shape flares out so that it’s actually wider at the top. The edges taper outward so that the top edge of the nail is wider than the base of the nail, kind of like an upside-down triangle. [17] X Research source This shape is super fun and dramatic, but it can be a bit clunkier to work with, so proceed with caution if you need to do a lot of delicate tasks with your hands. This shape usually requires acrylic nails, rather than your own natural nails, so it isn’t really possible to file them by yourself at home (unless you know how to do acrylics by yourself). For most people, you’ll likely need to head to the salon for a flared nail shape. Just let your nail artist know you want flare or duck bill nails, and they’ll know what to do! Best for: Anyone with long fingers or who wants to try a bold look."

      "title": "Edge nails have straight sides, then the tip forms a triangular shape.",
      "content": "Edge nails have straight sides, then the tip forms a triangular shape. The sides of the nail run parallel with each other at first, then they sharply angle to form a pointed tip, like the shape of an arrowhead. [18] X Research source Oftentimes, if this shape is done on an acrylic manicure, the artist will also form a ridge down the middle of the nail for an even more dramatic look. These nails definitely make a statement, so they’re an awesome choice if you’re looking for something especially eye-catching! To do it yourself: Keep the sides of your nail straight, then choose a point to start filing each side diagonally to create the triangle-shaped tip. Best for: Anyone with strong and long nail beds. For the full effect with the ridge down the middle, you’ll need to head to a nail salon for an acrylic manicure."

    {
      "title": "Arrowhead nails are a slightly shorter version of stiletto nails.",
      "content": "Arrowhead nails are a slightly shorter version of stiletto nails. They form a pointy peak just like stiletto nails, but the tip is much less elongated. This nail shape is a great choice if you want the drama of stiletto nails, but you want to keep them at a shorter length. Because they’re slightly shorter, they’re also a bit more durable than regular stiletto nails, which is great if you need to do some more difficult tasks with your hands on a day-to-day basis. To do it yourself: File the sides of your nails so they angle to form a pointy tip. Best for: People with wider fingers or who want a more practical version of the stiletto nail."

    {
      "title": "Consider your finger length.",
      "content": "Consider your finger length. If you have shorter fingers, you might want to go for a style that naturally elongates them, like almond or oval, to create the illusion that they’re slightly longer. On the other hand, if you have longer fingers, you can often handle angular or striking shapes, like square or ballerina/coffin. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at your nail bed width.",
      "content": "Look at your nail bed width. For narrow nail beds, rounded or ovular shapes can make the base of your nails appear a bit wider, which helps create balance. On the flip side, if you have wider nail beds, you may want to opt for an elongating and slimming shape, like almond, stiletto, or ballerina."

    {
      "title": "Take your job and/or lifestyle into account.",
      "content": "Take your job and/or lifestyle into account. If you do a lot of work with your hands on a daily basis—whether that be building things at your job or changing baby diapers at home—you might find it easiest to opt for a shorter nail shape like round, square, or squoval. These nail shapes are easier to maintain and less prone to breakage, so they’re great options if your hands tend to get banged up, or if you need to do intricate, delicate tasks."

      "title": "Go with something that suits your personal style.",
      "content": "Go with something that suits your personal style. Take a look at your wardrobe and try to think of the type of manicure that would complement your style best. For example, if you have a super classic, elegant sense of style, a timeless shape like almond, oval, or square might be perfect for you. On the other hand, if you have a super edgy or bold sense of style, you may want to go for an equally dramatic nail shape, like stiletto or coffin.

      "content": "What nail shape is most feminine? When it comes to picking a more girly look, Rubie tends to opt for rounder shapes. “I like to do more of a rounded look, or oval,” she says. “I just think it looks prettier and a little bit more feminine. Square nails are fine, but personally, I prefer a rounded oval shape for a more feminine kind of elongated look.”"

      "title": "How can you do a professional-looking mani at home?",
      "content": "How can you do a professional-looking mani at home? “Have the right tools,” says Rubie. “You want to have your own set of manicuring tools, which you can buy online in a kit: your clippers, your nippers, a nail pusher, a cuticle pusher, a file, nail polish remover, cotton, and then a good selection of polishes.” Beyond a good manicure kit and tons of polishes , Rubie also recommends investing in a good base coat and top coat for a truly professional-looking finish. And, of course, Rube says it’s important to experiment and enjoy yourself. “Get creative, watch tutorials, and have fun with it!”"
