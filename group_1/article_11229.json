      "content": "Use a hammer and chisel to cut flagstone when accuracy of cut or straight lines are not important. [1] X Research source A hammer and chisel is best to cut or shape flagstone for small projects that do not require accurate cuts, such as a small garden path or a decorative step or bench top. If you use a saw to cut every flagstone in the project, the cuts are going to look extremely clean, which might not be the desired result. If you don't need a too exact cut, you can use the chisel end of a masonry hammer to score the flagstone instead of using a chisel and a hammer."
