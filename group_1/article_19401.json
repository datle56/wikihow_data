      "content": "Avoid dehydration. The most common complication of diarrhea is dehydration, which can be dangerous. Be sure to drink water, broth, and juice consistently throughout the day. Even if you can only take small sips at a time, it's important to replenish the fluids you lose through diarrhea. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Drinking water is good, but be sure to also drink broth, juice, or some sports drink, too. Your body needs electrolytes like potassium and sodium.

[3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Suck on ice chips if you are too nauseated to drink anything.

      "content": "Use painkillers with caution. You can try taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen and naproxen) to help reduce fever and ease the pain of stomach cramps. However, in large doses or with certain conditions these medications can cause irritation and damage to the stomach. Only take these medications as prescribed or indicated on the bottle, and avoid them if: Your doctor prescribed you a different medication, or you take another NSAID for a different condition. You have liver or kidney disease. You've ever had stomach ulcers or bleeding. You're under 18. Consult your doctor first, or before giving aspirin to a child or teenager. Using aspirin to treat viruses (including the flu) in kids and teens has been linked to a potentially life-threatening illness called Reye's Syndrome.
