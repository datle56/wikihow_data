Write 756 above 32, making sure that the ones and tens columns of both numbers line up, so that the 6 from 756 is above the 2 in 32 and the 5 in 756 is above the 3 in 32, and so on. This will make it easier for you to visualize the long multiplication process. [1] X Research source You will essentially begin by multiplying the 2 in 32 by each of the numbers in 756, and then multiplying the 3 in 32 by each of the numbers in 756. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The \"bigger\" number means the one with the most digits (numbers)."

The product of 6 times 2 is 12. Write the ones digit, 2, under the units, and carry the 1 over the 5. Basically, you write down whatever number is in the ones digit, and if there is a number in the tens digit, you will have to carry it over the number to the left of the top number you just multiplied. You'll have a 2 directly below the 6 and the 2. [2] X Research source"

Really, this is similar to doing the standard long multiplication, but splitting up a number into ones and tens allows you to do a bit more of the math in your head and to avoid multiplying and carrying too much. Either method will yield the same results, and it all depends on which one works more quickly for you."
