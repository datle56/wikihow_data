The truth is though, this won't work—and it may even push him away. You're awesome, so give him the space to realize that on his own. [2] X Research source You deserve to be with someone who's sure they want to be with you. Instead of pressuring him, channel your energy into something positive. If you feel an urge to pressure him, redirect your attention. Pick up a creative project of yours, get some work done, or phone a friend. And remember, when you avoid pressuring him, it serves your own happiness. Put yourself in a position where any relationship that forms will be with someone who’s thrilled to be exclusive with you."

If you feel frustrated, take deep breaths and pick up an activity you love. Along the way, take action to ensure you stay positive (because you deserve to feel good!). [3] X Research source If you’re feeling disheartened, get support from friends. Offer to buy your pal a cup of coffee and ask them to let you talk things out. If you experience self-doubt, add positive affirmations into your routine. Look in the mirror and recite empowering words: “I am worthy of love.” Meet your negative thoughts with perspective: “Exclusivity is a big commitment. It makes sense that he's taking his time, and it’s good that I’m respecting his needs.”"

When he asks you to come to his open mic, award ceremony, or birthday party, make sure you’re there to cheer him on. Offer your help when he’s struggling with a personal issue.

Enjoy your freedom and have some fun (if that’s what you want!). [8] X Research source Do what feels right to you. If you only like dating one person at once, more power to you. But if you do want to date, keep playing the field. Dating is about discovery. Before you're exclusive, feel free to keep on exploring what's out there!
