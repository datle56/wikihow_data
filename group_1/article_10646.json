      "content": "Assemble your materials in an outdoor area free of flammable items. It’s incredibly important to take serious safety precautions when working with fire—otherwise, you could set your home on fire or severely injure yourself. Find a place outside to do this trick, and look for a clear area without any brush or anything else that could catch fire. Keep a bucket of water handy in case you need to extinguish flames quickly, and make sure you also have adult supervision. [1] X Research source While not required, you may choose to perform this trick while wearing gloves. Opt for an old leather glove or lined garden glove that’s tight-fitting with a hard palm surface. While flame-retardant gloves are better to protect yourself from being burned, they will often extinguish the flame before it lights. Regular cloth gloves, on the other hand, can absorb the lighter fluid and increase the possibility that you’ll accidentally light the glove on fire and burn yourself."

      "content": "Ball up one hand, leaving a small gap between your fingertips and palm. Make a fist, but leave enough space in the middle of the fist to comfortably insert the end of the lighter. Keep your fingers relatively tight, so the butane won't escape when you release it into your palm, and use your thumb to cover up the gap on the top of your fist (where your index finger meets your palm). Try to imagine you were holding water in your palm and keeping as much of it as possible from escaping—this should give you the proper hand positioning."

      "content": "Insert the top of the unlit lighter into the bottom of your fist. Put the flame-end of the lighter into your hand, pushing it gently into the hole at the bottom of your fist. Insert the lighter far enough so that the butane will escape into and stay into the pocket created by your fist. The trick won’t work if the lighter is simply being held at the edge of your palm—it needs to be fully inserted into your fist. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the ignition button down for about 5 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the ignition button down for about 5 seconds. To start the trick, hold down the red button on the lighter to release the butane gas. Do not strike the flint by rolling the thumb-roller—just depress the red button for approximately five seconds. [3] X Research source Five seconds is long enough to give you enough flammable gas but short enough for the resulting fireball to be relatively brief (and less dangerous). Different performers of this trick will hold down the button for longer or shorter, depending on the gas flow of the lighter and the size of the fire they want to create. To be on the safe side, it's best to hold it down for around five seconds. If you eventually get more comfortable handling the lighter, you could then try to create a bigger fireball if you’d like. You could hold the button down for 10-12 seconds. But when you're first starting out, go small. This is a dangerous trick, and you don't want to get in over your head!"

      "title": "Remove the lighter from your fist and light it.",
      "content": "Remove the lighter from your fist and light it. After you've counted to five, you need to move quickly so the butane won't evaporate. Keeping your fist tightly closed, hold the lighter about 1 foot (300 mm) away from your fist, then strike the flint by rolling your thumb over the roller and holding down the gas button again. Do not strike the flint (or light the lighter) while the lighter is still inserted into your fist. This is extremely dangerous."

      "title": "Bring the flame toward the opening in your fist and open your fist.",
      "content": "Bring the flame toward the opening in your fist and open your fist. Quickly bring the lit lighter toward your fist, while simultaneously opening your palm one finger at a time, starting with the pinkie. This step has to be done very quickly in order for it to work. If done correctly, the butane that’s been trapped in your fist will ignite and quickly burn up, and you'll be able to \"control\" the fireball by quickly opening your hand to display it. [4] X Research source The timing for this trick takes some practice. You want to \"fan\" your fingers away from the lighter, raising your pinkie first, then your ring finger, and so on to completely open your fist. If you open all your fingers at once, the butane may not ignite. If you don't open your fist at all, however, you risk burning yourself. Under no circumstances should you leave your fist closed while bringing the flame to it."

      "title": "Gather hand sanitizer, gloves, and water onto a flameproof surface.",
      "content": "Gather hand sanitizer, gloves, and water onto a flameproof surface. The idea of the trick is to spread a small patch of sanitizer on a surface and light it, creating a small layer of blue flame that you can very quickly run your finger through and put out immediately. First, find a suitable flameproof surface on which to work: you need to go outside to do this trick, preferably on a very flat patch of concrete far away from anything flammable (e.g., small twigs, sod, bits of paper). You need to be very careful that nothing will catch on fire but the sanitizer. Prepare your safety items, like flame-resistant gloves and a bucket of water, and set them next to your work surface. Lastly, buy a flammable variety of hand sanitizer . Look on the label for “ethyl” or “isopropyl” alcohol—if you have the wrong type of hand sanitizer, this trick will not work. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread a thin layer of sanitizer on the concrete and ignite it.",
      "content": "Spread a thin layer of sanitizer on the concrete and ignite it. Squirt a small amount of sanitizer on the concrete and thin it out evenly with your finger. Wipe the sanitizer off your finger to make sure that there's no chance your fingers will light prematurely. Then, use a lighter to ignite the goo so that it glows with a gentle blue flame. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that this blue flame may be somewhat difficult to see. It's best to do this trick at night so that you can see the glow better, but make sure it’s still light enough out so that you can see what you’re doing properly. Do not cover your hands with sanitizer and then light it—this will burn your hands severely and be extremely dangerous. The trick only works because of the speed at which you do it, not because the hand sanitizer is safe. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Run a finger quickly through the sanitizer.",
      "content": "Run a finger quickly through the sanitizer. If you do it quickly, you can scoop up a bit of the sanitizer that's on fire, and it will look momentarily like your fingers are aflame. As soon as you do this, though, you don't have much time to admire it, because you'll burn yourself if you leave it on for more than a second or two . [8] X Research source You should feel some heat, or a strange sensation like hot-and-cold. Hand sanitizer usually has a cooling feeling, which may trick you into thinking it's hot. Either way, you won't have enough time to really feel anything, because you will only swipe your finger through, look at it for a second, and put the flame out."

      "content": "Put the flame out by snapping your wrist forcefully. The best way to kill the flame is by snuffing it out with a forceful flick of your wrist. [9] X Research source Blowing on it with a sharp gust can just move around the sanitizer, making it possibly dangerous. It can't be stressed enough: you need to put the flame out as soon as you touch it or you'll burn yourself. [10] X Research source Keep water close by and dunk your hand in it, if necessary. Do not let the fire burn up all the alcohol, or you risk serious injury."

In order to avoid any damage or injury, proceed through these steps only in the company of an adult who has experience managing fire. Wear a pair of safety goggles and prepare a fire extinguisher and a bucket of water in case something catches fire. Find an indoor space in which to do the experiment. Avoid doing the trick outdoors, as even a small amount of wind could blow the flame onto your face and burn it. Make sure there are no flammable items in the vicinity of your workspace. If the ceiling in the room you’re doing the trick in is low, sit on a chair to ensure the flame won’t get too high and reach the ceiling."
