If you’re just starting out, it’s best to select “Economy” or “Regular.” For example, the Economy option costs $20 per card while the Regular option costs $50 per card. Each different service level will have a different maximum value that you can declare for your item. The higher the service level, the more you'll pay for each card, but also the more you'll be able to declare for each card. Select “Next” to move on to the next page."
