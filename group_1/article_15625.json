    {
      "title": "Include a clear, detailed subject line.",
      "content": "Include a clear, detailed subject line. Start your A+ email with a relevant, straightforward subject line that avoids vague phrases and isn’t too lengthy. Remember, your professor is probably managing a huge inbox, and the more time you cut down for them, the more grateful they’ll be to you. [1] X Research source Don’t say: “Message from a student in Psych 104,” “Need an extension,” or “Hello from Randy Bernard!” Instead, say: “Extension Request for Psych104, Paper 2: Randy Bernard”"

      "title": "Keep your email concise.",
      "content": "Keep your email concise. When you’re nervous to email a professor, you may feel tempted to ramble or overshare. And while that’s totally understandable, avoid it if you can. Your professors are busy, and they’ll appreciate you getting straight to the point. Provide just the info they need to know, and once you’ve completed your email, go back and edit it for concision. [2] X Research source Don’t say: “I’m just genuinely so, so sorry. I can’t believe I turned this in late, and you have no idea how long I prepped for this assignment. I really am so sorry that I missed the deadline, and you should know that I will do my best in the future, even when I have tech issues, to not let this happen again.” Instead say: “I apologize for turning in this assignment late. Know that I take my work seriously and I’ll do my best to avoid this in the future.”"

    {
      "title": "Use a professional tone and be polite.",
      "content": "Use a professional tone and be polite. Even if the two of you have chatted casually in person, it’s always best use a formal tone in an email . Then, make sure to be as courteous as possible throughout your email as well. [3] X Research source Use a formal greeting. “Dear Professor James,” and “Professor James,” are perfect. “Hey,” and “Hi,” are too informal and should be avoided. Same goes for your signoff—choose a formal phrase. “Best,” and “Sincerely,” are great picks. Remember to use “Please” and “Thank you,\" too!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apologize for your late assignment.",
      "content": "Apologize for your late assignment. Show your professor that despite this late assignment, you take their time seriously. If you explain your situation or ask for an extension without this crucial element of your email, you may unintentionally signal to your professor that you’re ungrateful. This could hurt your relationship and increase penalties on your assignment. So instead, say you're sorry: “I apologize for my late assignment. I know you're busy, and I don’t want to waste your time.” “I’m sorry for this late paper, especially because it communicates a lack of care and concern for my grades that I don't feel is accurate.”"

    {
      "title": "Ask for an extension if you need one.",
      "content": "Ask for an extension if you need one. If you had something come up and, with a little more time, you could have your assignment fully fleshed out and turned in, ask to move the deadline back. Professors get these requests constantly and can’t necessarily accommodate everyone, so make sure to be honest, clear, and thoughtful. Ruiz recommends showing your professor what you've already completed, especially if you've done the assignment but need to make revisions before turning it in. “If I had an extra 48 hours to complete this assignment, I’d be able to fully explore and structure my insights for this term paper.” “I would greatly appreciate an extension on this project. With a little more time, I could turn in my very best work and learn even more from this assignment.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Include helpful context.",
      "content": "Include helpful context. Without oversharing, explain to your professor why the initial deadline might not work for you. Explain the hurdles that got in the way of you completing the assignment on time, but don’t go into too much detail. If your lateness is due to mental illness, follow the same rule: be honest but brief. “Last night, my dog had a bar of chocolate without me realizing. I’ve spent the entire evening with her at the vet.” \"To be entirely honest, I've been dealing with some mental health issues that are seriously affecting my schoolwork.\" Avoid lying. If you're granted an extension and the truth comes out later on, you could face major consequences."

      "title": "Take responsibility instead of avoiding blame.",
      "content": "Take responsibility instead of avoiding blame. It can be so hard to do this, especially when some things were genuinely out of your control. But trust that if you accept responsibility, you're more likely to get what you're asking for. In all likelihood, your professor will admire your maturity and professionalism! Don’t say: “Honestly, it was out of my hands entirely. I’m a victim of circumstance, and that’s why my assignment is late.” Instead say: “It's true that I didn’t plan for this to happen. That being said, if I’d started earlier, this wouldn’t have been an issue. So I know, ultimately, this is my fault. I take full responsibility.”"

    {
      "title": "Say that it won’t happen again and you take school seriously.",
      "content": "Say that it won’t happen again and you take school seriously. Especially if this was just a fluke occurrence, let your professor know that you will not make late work a habit. Explain that typically, you’re organized and responsible and you care about your education. “This isn’t like me, and in the future, I promise to do better.” “I take my schoolwork very seriously. If it weren’t for my dog’s illness, I would have made getting this assignment in my top priority.” Remember to actually follow up on your promises. If you're turning in late work every single week, your professor is less likely to work with you if you need an extension. Ruiz says there are a few ways to keep yourself motivated when doing schoolwork. One way is to set a reward for completing your work, and stay honest with yourself if you didn't earn the reward. Another suggestion Ruiz has is to study with a friend. \"It is ok to get off task at times but give yourselves a goal to achieve by the end of your study session,\" Ruiz says."

      "title": "Attach relevant documents.",
      "content": "Attach relevant documents. Maybe your assignment was late because you had a personal medical emergency—in this case and in similar situations, it may help to provide proof through medical documentation. There’s no need to attach tons of docs, but if you can strengthen your case with one or two official notes, email receipts, or medical records, this can only help your case. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Have a backup plan.",
      "content": "Have a backup plan. Even if you’ve asked for an extension, start your work anyway. It’s totally up to your professor whether or not they’ll shift the deadline, and some schools have strict policies around late work. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst. Definitely get moving on that paper, and if the deadline hasn’t passed yet, do your best to finish in time! [5] X Research source If you're far behind on homework, Ruiz suggests taking a weekend and designating it as a \"homework retreat.\" \"Schedule out an entire weekend to get all school and homework assignments completed until you reach the desired outcome,\" Ruiz says. \"This will allow you to be level with the classroom once you return the following week.\" Don't forget to schedule in breaks, snacks, and rewards!"

Though I know our next project isn't due for another 2 days, I'm emailing to say that I would greatly appreciate an extension. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience. The truth is, I've been struggling through some mental health issues and schoolwork has been taking longer than usual for me lately. With this in mind, I should've budgeted for more time, so I take full responsibility. I take my education very seriously, and in the future, I'll do my best to make sure this doesn't happen. Below, I've included a note from my doctor. Thank you so much for your consideration and for taking the time to read my email. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

It's made it difficult to finish my schoolwork. I should've emailed you beforehand, but I thought I could get everything done when I was better. That was poor judgment on my part, and I take full responsibility. Below, I've included a note from my doctor. Again, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

I recognize that if I’d been more responsible and started earlier, this issue wouldn’t have resulted in a late assignment. I’ll be sure to start earlier in the future. I would love to chat in person or complete any makeup work that you think would be appropriate. Please let me know, and I’ll get started right away. I appreciate your time. Best, Clifford Kuznetzov"

      "title": "You could get a deadline extension for your assignment.",
      "content": "You could get a deadline extension for your assignment. You know what they say about best-laid plans—maybe you budgeted enough time to do your assignment, but something totally out of the blue disrupted your schedule. This could be a family illness, emergency, or tech issue, but whatever the cause, you might suddenly realize that you won’t have enough time to finish. Policies around extensions differ from school to school, but by writing an A+ email, you can only help your chances. Generally, professors only give you an extension under extenuating circumstances, like a major accident. Ruiz explains that they're going to be less inclined to extend an assignment if you had competing priorities, like work. Professors are people too, and they want to help! Especially if you don’t have a history of late work, when you plead your case, they may be more forgiving than you’d expect."

      "content": "You might limit the number of points docked on your assignment. If you’re turning in an assignment late and worry about penalties, then emailing to offer some context can be extremely helpful. Without your explanation, your professor might assume that you didn't care enough to turn in your assignment on time. But if you explain what got in your way, they may go a bit easier on you. Especially if you had a major, unforeseen factor pop up in the final moments before submitting your assignment, you may be able to explain and limit your punishment."

      "content": "Your professor will know that you take school seriously. Maybe time simply got away from you—you don’t have an excuse to explain, but you still want your professor to know that you’re sorry. All professors are different, and you never know. [6] X Research source By offering a respectful and honest apology for your late assignment, you can improve your relationship with your professor, earn their respect, and possibly limit your late assignment’s penalties. Remember, your professor wants you to succeed, and they're there to support you! Don't be afraid to ask them for assistance or suggestions if you need the help."
