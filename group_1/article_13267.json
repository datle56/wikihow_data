      "content": "Consider the motivation for social avoidance. An autistic person may experience confusion and sensory overwhelm in social situations, and may be less interested in seeking out social activity. (This varies.) A socially anxious person does not experience sensory issues, and withdraws for fear of being judged. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Autistic people may also be nervous in social situations. This is usually because they have had bad experiences, such as misinterpretations and bullying. Autistics struggle to guess what others are thinking, which can be stressful, and may result in social mistakes. [4] X Research source People with social anxiety can read faces and body language just fine, but may experience cognitive distortions such as \"She's laughing because she thinks I'm a fool.\" [5] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness.

However, an autistic person will still have their unique habits regardless of whether they're feeling anxious.

They may worry about being judged by others, facing embarrassment, and dealing with rejection. These fears are persistent, regardless of whether others are judging them or not. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Autistic people may have some concerns about socializing, but these are usually related to past mistreatment. For example, if bullies are stopped and the autistic person makes some good friends, the autistic person won't be so nervous around those friends. Someone with social anxiety may experience physical symptoms of anxiety in social situations; they might feel tense, shaky, nauseous, sweaty, have trouble catching their breath, or feel their heart racing.

They don't have the needed social skills. People with social anxiety have the skills, but become too scared to use them. Their fear of socializing makes it difficult to use the skills they already have. [10] X Research source In a social situation, someone with social anxiety might have shaky hands, blush, not make eye contact, and stammer or stutter. Their mind may go blank, making it difficult for them to carry on a conversation. As a result, they may appear to have poor social skills, when the reality is that they're anxious.
