How much of your scalp can you see in an area the size of a square inch? You’re not counting individual strands, but you can get a sense of how dense your hair is by how much skin you can see. Thick density : If you don’t see much scalp at all, you have thick hair density. Medium density : If you see some scalp, you have medium density. Thin density : If you see a lot of scalp, you have thin hair density."

Compare your hair to the shapes of the letters L, O, I and S. L : Your strand looks like the letter L, with right angles, bends and folds. This is kinky, zigzag pattern hair. O : Your strand resembles the letter O or spirals into several Os. I : Your strand is straight with little to no curves or waves, resembling the letter I. S : Your strand is wavy and curves back and forth like the letter S. Combination : Your strand might have a combination of two or more of these letters. If this is the case, check a few more strands of hair from all over your head to see if one of the letters is more dominant."
