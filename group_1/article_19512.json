Always check the label of any spray you consider using to confirm whether it is safe for human use. Sprays are a good finishing option but aren’t required. Since lice have such a short lifespan without human contact, washing and vacuuming alone are usually enough to remove them all. If you have pets, check for any potential side effects the spray may cause for them. Lice sprays have been proven effective at killing any lice present on your mattress but it is not a preventive measure. A spray will not stop infestations from reoccurring."
