      "title": "Dismissal typically means you’re expelled from the college.",
      "content": "Dismissal typically means you’re expelled from the college. Most schools make a distinction between an academic dismissal, where a college ejects you for failing to maintain a certain GPA (usually 2.0, which is a “C”), and disciplinary dismissal, where you’re expelled for breaking a campus policy. In most cases, dismissal means you are no longer a student at that school. [1] X Research source Most schools will place you on academic probation after the first semester where you fail to maintain a 2.0 GPA. After 1-2 semesters on probation, you may be dismissed. Make sure you aren’t just suspended. Suspensions are often temporary, and you may be able to simply sign up for classes after the suspension is over. At some colleges, dismissal means you’re only barred for a quarter or two. If that’s the case, you’ll be allowed to re-enroll in classes once the dismissal expires. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Read the conditions of your dismissal thoroughly. Reading that dismissal email or letter that first time can be a bit of a whirlwind, so take a deep breath, collect yourself, and go through it line by line. The school should break down what dismissal entails and when (or if) you’ll be allowed to reapply or fight the dismissal. [3] X Research source If there’s any confusion at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to the dean of student affairs or your counselor. They’ll answer any questions you have."

      "title": "Appeal the decision if you want to stay enrolled.",
      "content": "Appeal the decision if you want to stay enrolled. Every school has an appeals process for dismissed students. If you either don’t agree with the school’s decision or you simply want to stay enrolled, file an appeal. Go to your college’s website and search for info on the dismissal process or contact the dean’s office. Fill out and submit their appeal form. Submit it online or drop it off where you’re directed to take it online. The letter or email explaining your dismissal should contain info on appealing. If you go to a public university, you actually have certain legally protected rights when it comes to due process. [4] X Research source Every school has their own appeals process. Typically, you provide a short explanation of why you deserve to be let back in and provide documentation as evidence (this could entail police reports, doctor’s notes, death certificates, etc.)."

      "content": "Complete the college’s required petition, if they have one. As part of your appeal, you may be required to explain what happened and justify why you think you should be allowed back into school. You may also be required to explain what you’ll do to change things in the future. Take your time to craft a genuine response for each section they ask you to fill out. Show humility, and be honest. [5] X Research source Were you overwhelmed with stuff going on at home? Did you hit a financial roadblock that required you to work more often, which took away from your schoolwork? You might write, “I recognize that I have failed to live up to Western University’s standards, but I’ve faced some unique struggles this year…” Include a note about why your previous issue won’t be a problem now. You could say, “Luckily, I’ve talked to a tutor who has agreed to work with me on…” or, “I now know not to overload my schedule with…”"

      "title": "Wait for the required amount of time to pass and reapply.",
      "content": "Wait for the required amount of time to pass and reapply. If your appeal isn’t approved, you may simply be able to apply to the school again after a semester or two passes. Refer to your appeals letter and your student handbook to see if it says anything about re-enrolling after a period of time has passed. Most higher education institutions allow students to leave and come back within a certain timeframe, so you may simply be dismissed for that specific period of time. [6] X Research source Every school will have their own rules on this. Some schools will allow you to reapply immediately, while others will ask you to wait at least 1 semester or 1 year. It’s important to note that the odds are high you may not be accepted, but there is always a chance!"

      "content": "Speak to the academic dean to ask for special consideration. Even if you’re told that you’re not allowed to re-enroll and even if your appeal is rejected, you may still be able to get back in by tugging on an authority figure’s heartstrings. Email the dean of academics or schedule an appointment with them and lay your case out. They may simply make an exception for you. [7] X Research source Be honest and don’t hold back information. It may feel kind of embarrassing or humbling to tell someone you don’t really know about your personal business, but it’s your best shot at this point. You might explain that you’ve been dealing with a medical issue that has kept you from maintaining your grades, or walk the dean through a personal issue that has distracted you."

      "content": "Go to community college if you want a stepping stone. Your dismissal may make it difficult to go to another university, but going to community college is an excellent option if you’d like to rebuild your academic record. By bouncing back academically, you’ll have a much easier time transferring to a 4-year university than applying immediately after your dismissal. [8] X Research source A community college will also be a lot cheaper than a traditional 4-year college. If you struggled academically with the university’s coursework, community college could be a lot easier to manage."

If you were dismissed because you genuinely couldn’t keep your grades up, applying to a school that’s going to be a better fit may be ideal. This doesn’t necessarily mean going to a school with a reputation for light on the academic rigor—just a school that’s going to suit your personal needs best! [9] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source You might look for: Smaller class sizes. If you got lost in the crowd at your old school, you may excel at a smaller school where there aren’t as many students. Specialized help for struggling students. A lot of schools will provide free tutoring, academic help, or peer study sessions for students who need help. Less extreme standards. If you attended a private institution or ivy league school, you may find college easier if you go somewhere a little more laid back. A school overseas. If local drama was keeping you from succeeding, you may find it easier to excel in a more isolated environment."

[11] X Research source While you aren’t technically transferring, you normally have to fill out a transfer application if you want your old coursework to count at your new school. Include as much extracurricular activity as you can on your application. The dismissal may not be a huge deal if you’ve got lots of volunteering or student activity under your belt. If you were dismissed after a single semester and didn’t pass a single class, you may want to use the “new student” application."
