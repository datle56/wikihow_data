      "content": "Put your sharps in a sturdy, plastic container. Sharps disposal containers are often provided when you buy new sharps. If you don’t have one, order a container online or from a hospital, medical company, or pharmacy. Or use something made of strong plastic like an empty bleach bottle or laundry detergent bottle. The container must be leak-proof and have a lid that cannot be punctured by the sharps. [1] X Research source Sharps disposal containers come in all shapes and sizes, including smaller travel sizes. Clear plastic containers like milk jugs won't work as sharps containers because they are too thin and can be punctured. Don't use glass containers, either, since they break easily.

      "content": "Screw the lid on and seal it with duct tape when the container is 3/4 full. Make sure the lid is secured tightly. Then take a strip of duct tape and wrap it around the lid, sealing any space that might be left between the rim of the lid and the bottle itself. This adds another layer of protection to prevent any hazardous materials from leaking out.

Drop boxes, on the other hand, may look like metal kiosks similar to a mailbox that you simply open and place your container inside. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source In the United States, the states where these drop boxes are most common are California, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin. [6] X Research source Some cities require hospitals to accept sharps disposal containers. However, in other areas, hospitals or doctor’s offices may only take containers from their own patients.
