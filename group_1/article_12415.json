As of March 2020, there are 7 different forms you can use to exercise your data privacy rights. Your specific rights, however, vary depending on where you live."

      "content": "Avoid using the de-index request form. If you don't live in the EU, the UK, Switzerland, or California, you'll need to request removal by email. Clearview AI provides a form for the general public that you can use to have specific images removed from the Clearview AI database, but only under a set of convoluted circumstances. The de-index form can only be used if Clearview AI has a photo in its database that you've taken down from the web. However, to make your request, you have to first know that Clearview AI has the photo. Then, you also have to know the URL for the photo (before it was taken down). Essentially, to use this option, you would have to copy the URL for every publicly available photo of you on the internet, then remove those images. After confirming removal, you could the provide the old URL to Clearview AI using the automated de-index request form."

Even though these forms ask you for the same information, make sure you choose the right form so the company will respond appropriately to your request. If you live in California, you can opt-out of the service completely, request access to the data the company has on you, and request that all data be deleted. It's probably a good idea to do all 3. If you only request that your data be deleted, you have no way of knowing what data the company had, and the company still has the right to potentially get more data on you in the future. Similarly, if you live in the EU, the UK, or Switzerland, you can object to your data being collected, look at the data collected on you, and request that all data be deleted. For maximum privacy protection, you want to do all 3."

Clearview AI claims not to maintain any other information about individuals, such as names or addresses â€” the company officially stores only photos. For this reason, you must submit a clear image of your face so that Clearview AI can map your face and find all the photos in its database that match yours. [2] X Research source The company states on the form that the photo you submit for the purposes of your request, along with any information gathered as a result, will be deleted from its database as soon as your request has been completed."

[3] X Research source The company states that your email address is not retained after your request is completed. However, if you want to be extra-cautious, you might want to create a new email address to use only with Clearview AI. After your request is complete, you can deactivate that address."

[4] X Research source If you don't live in a jurisdiction that protects these rights, Clearview AI might decline your request. However, you'll still be on record for protecting your data privacy rights. Even if you're not a resident of California, you can use the sample forms available on the website for the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) at https://epic.org/california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa/ . Simply remove any references to California and California law."

[5] X Research source Clearview AI maintains that it doesn't keep these photos, or any information obtained from them, after your request has been processed. However, just to be on the safe side, send a photo that is already accessible by the general public on the internet."

Because you can send anyone's picture to Clearview AI, if you want to see your file, the company requires you to prove that you are the person in the photo. After you scan your ID, it's a good idea to black out the ID number and your birth date. You might also want to black out your last name. [6] X Research source This step is only necessary if you're requesting access to your file. If you're requesting that the company delete all of your data, it will delete all of the photos that match with the photo you sent. However, you'll have no way of knowing what photos they had."
