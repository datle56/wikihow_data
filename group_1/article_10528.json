      "title": "Find a can or metal container.",
      "content": "Find a can or metal container. It should be able to hold 4-6 ounces of baby oil, along with a bit of balled-up cotton. Try using a clean, empty boot polish can. If you don't have access to a pre-made container: use a sharp implement to shear a 12-ounce aluminum can in half, and use the bottom half as your container. You may be able to buy a boot polish can from the prison commissary. [1] X Research source If you can't find boot polish, look for another suitable can that you can buy. It's important that you don't arouse suspicion from the guards, so don't buy a can of something that you would never normally use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put cotton inside the can.",
      "content": "Put cotton inside the can. If you have access to cotton, ball it up inside the can as a \"wick\" to help ignite the baby oil. Make sure to leave at least a bit of the cotton dry and oil-free so that it will be easier to light. Use cotton balls, if you can, or tear a small strip of cotton from a shirt or pillowcase. If you don't have cotton, you can use paper or tissue paper in a pinch – anything flammable. Try cutting the sleeves off your shirt. This way, you can use the cotton without arousing suspicion or completely ruining the shirt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Douse the cotton with baby oil.",
      "content": "Douse the cotton with baby oil. You should be able to buy this oil from the prison commissary. Use enough baby oil to completely saturate the cotton, and make sure not to spill. You will burn this oil to create a black, sooty powder: the base ingredient of your tattoo ink. In the absence of baby oil, you may be able to use petroleum jelly or another petroleum-based substance. Do not melt poly fiber plastics, as these chemicals will irritate your skin. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Build a \"soot collector\".",
      "content": "Build a \"soot collector\". Find a flat, clean piece of metal that will fit over the opening of the can without covering it completely. If you can't find anything else, try cutting a sheet from the top half of the aluminum can, then pressing it until it is flat. This piece will collect the sooty powder so that you can mix it into ink."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make fire.",
      "content": "Make fire. Use a lighter or matches, if possible. If you are in prison, however, you may not have access to a traditional fire-starter. Find a way to make fire without a lighter . You will need fire both to make the ink and to disinfect the needle. Try \"popping a socket\". Open up an electrical socket, then hold a pencil tip and a wire up to the charged interior. This will create a spark. Hold a piece of paper or tissue against the spark until it catches flame. [3] X Research source Be very careful when handling flame. On one hand, you might badly burn yourself or start a fire that you can't control. You also run the risk of attracting the attention of the guards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Burn the baby oil and cotton.",
      "content": "Burn the baby oil and cotton. Use the cotton (or paper) as a wick: light a dry corner of the flammable material, and let it ignite the oil. Arrange the metal sheet or \"soot collector\" so that the smoke hits it. As the baby oil burns, the metal sheet will blacken with soot. Let the baby oil burn until it is spent, and let the metal cool before handling it directly. Be prepared to burn the baby oil several times. The burning process does not produce a lot of powder, so you may need to burn the oil several times until you have enough to harvest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Save the black powder.",
      "content": "Save the black powder. Use a paper or plastic card to scrape the black powder from the metal sheet. Do not use a razor or another metal scraper to remove the soot – the metal might leave shards in the powder, which will then wind up in your skin. Start by scraping the powder onto a clean, smooth surface or a white piece of paper. Do not expose the powder to any moisture until you're ready to mix your ink. The metal sheet and canister will be hot from the flame. Do not handle the metal directly until you've given it time to cool. Avoid using a credit card to scrape soot from hot metal, as the edge of the card might melt into the powder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the tattoo powder into a small cap or container.",
      "content": "Put the tattoo powder into a small cap or container. Many prison tattooists use a clean toothpaste cap. Fill the cap about halfway with the sooty powder, and leave enough room in the container to mix in water. If you collected the soot on a sheet of paper, you can fold the paper and let the soot slide directly into the cap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add water.",
      "content": "Add water. Mix the soot with a drop of clean water. Be very sparing with the liquid-to-soot ratio; a bit of water goes a long way. Start with a small dose, and mix the soot together with the water in the toothpaste cap. Consider adding a bit of clear, scentless baby oil to thicken the mixture. Remember: the soot is much harder to come by than water or baby oil. It is a limited resource. Be very careful with your mixing so that you don't need to make more soot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Finish mixing the ink.",
      "content": "Finish mixing the ink. Stir the soot-and-water mixture until it is about the consistency of a pen's ink. If anything, the ink should be slightly thicker. Adjust the portions of each ingredient until the texture is just right. To thin your ink, add a dash of water or baby oil. To thicken it up, add more soot."
