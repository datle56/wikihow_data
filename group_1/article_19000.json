Gaining root access is referred to as \"rooting\" your phone. The process varies from device to device, but this guide will let you know how for the majority of Android devices. Note: A Java emulator will not let you view websites built with Java, it will only let you run JAR files. If you want to view websites built with Java, see the next section."
