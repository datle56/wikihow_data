      "content": "Frat flu is a cold college students get after attending a college party. “Frat flu” is a term coined by college students used to describe the sickness they experience after a night of partying. The frat flu is commonly spread at the beginning of the school year and consists of symptoms like a runny nose, congestion, coughing, headaches, and nausea. The frat flu is not an actual medical diagnosis, but frat flu symptoms are no picnic! [1] X Research source According to many doctors, the frat flu is usually just the common cold or an upper respiratory infection."

      "title": "Increased exposure to people",
      "content": "Increased exposure to people Most college students get the frat flu at the beginning of the school year because of the sudden increase in the amount of people around them. With large class sizes, shared living spaces, and crowded parties and social events, students are more likely to interact with someone who has a virus. [2] X Research source Illnesses also have an incubation period in which there are no symptoms, so sick people may go to parties and infect others without even realizing they’re sick."

Because of this, germs can’t escape the area and people are more likely to catch them, especially when they’re all touching the same surfaces and interacting closely all night.

In general, mild symptoms like a cough or a scratchy throat should disappear within 3-4 days. If the symptoms persist, you may have something stronger than the common cold.
