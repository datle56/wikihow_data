      "content": "Fresita is a diminutive version of fresa, meaning posh or snooty. Fresa , which literally translates to the word “strawberry” in Spanish, is a pejorative slang word typically used to refer to the privileged, superficial, and stuck-up children of upper class families in Mexico. Fresita has the same meaning as fresa but includes the diminutive “-ita” to make it feel more affectionate or “cutesy.” Fresita also mainly applies to women and girls, while fresa can describe someone of any gender. [1] X Research source Someone who dresses or acts like they’re part of the upper class may also be called a fresa or fresita , even if they’re not actually wealthy: e.g., “Javi se ve muy fresa hoy, no?” ( Javi looks really fresa today, doesn’t he? ). Not every wealthy person is considered a fresa , however. Fresa people are stereotypically very stuck-up, easily offended, and naive to the realities of society and the “real world.” They’re also known to spend lots of money on flashy things like designer clothes and sports cars and speak in a “posh” dialect of Spanish that incorporates a lot of Spanglish. [2] X Research source While most commonly used in Mexico, fresa is commonly accepted as a slang term throughout Latin America. In Honduras, fresa can also mean that something is “cool” or “nice,” but means “posh” when applied to a person. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fresa may be translated to English as “posh” or “yuppie.” In English, fresa and fresita could mean “elitist,” “yuppie,” “Valley girl,” “preppy,” “posh,” “spoiled,” or “snooty.” English-speakers may also use terms like “city-slicker,” “princess,” or “debutante” to describe the same concept as fresa . However, none of these terms are an exact translation of fresita , and they don’t encompass the full cultural meaning of the word. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Slang terms fresa and fresita likely originated in the 1960s. Although the precise origins of fresa and fresita aren’t known, fresa began to be used in the 1960s to describe women who were of higher socioeconomic standing and deemed as “demure.” [5] X Research source The term became more popular throughout the 1970s and 1980s, eventually generalizing to describe people of any gender. Fresita is a more recent evolution of fresa , seemingly becoming popular on social media apps like TikTok. Kids, teens, and young adults were historically the main supporters of this term, and some of them would even adopt some of the fresa lifestyle to appear like they came from an upper class family. Some sources claim that the slang originated with the 1968 Olympics hosted in Mexico, where the hostesses (or edecanes ) of various sporting arenas were dressed in a strawberry-colored uniform. [6] X Research source These women were usually enrolled in private colleges, making them emblematic of the upper classes, which spawned the term fresa . It’s also possible that fresa was coined in Mexico alongside the English term “preppy” becoming popular in the U.S. as a word to describe wealthy, conservative American teens."

      "content": "Social behavior The stereotypical fresa or fresita person is likely to have a very expensive (or expensive-appearing) lifestyle. They’ll probably act in a very high-maintenance or pretentious way, like refusing to take public transport or shop at second-hand stores. When it comes to their friends, they’ll constantly be texting or communicating with them (on the newest smartphone, of course) and they dedicate a lot of time to curating an upscale, influencer-like image on social media.

[8] X Research source For example, popular fresa brands from recent years include Zara, Ralph Lauren, Abercrombie & Fitch, Reebok, Lacoste, Guess, Puma, Armani, Calvin Klein, and American Eagle.

      "content": "Fresas are known for having a distinctive tone to their Spanish speech. One of the defining characteristics of a fresita is a distinct accent that’s described as la papa en la boca , or speaking as if one has a “potato in the mouth.” [9] X Research source The fresa subculture also notoriously uses phrases and intonations associated with “posh” or “pretentious” people in Mexico, as well as incorporating a (controversially) high amount of English into their speech. [10] X Research source Other key linguistic features of the fresa include: Frequent ‘Spanglish:’ “Te ves super cute ” (You look super cute). “O sea, hello ?” (I mean, hello?). “Eres mi idol ” (You are my idol). Abbreviated words: “Obviamente” → “Obvi” (Obviously). “Literalmente” → “Lit” (Literally). “WhatsApp” → “Wa” (WhatsApp). Question-like intonation: “Pero no lo puedo cre er ” (I can’t believe it) with emphasis on er as if asking a question. Lengthened vowels: “¿De verd aaaa d?” (Re aaaa lly?). Frequent use of “trendy” words: “¿Qué pasa, güey ? Acabo de ver algo súper chido, güey ” (What’s up, dude ? I just saw something super cool, dude )."
