To get a six-pack that's visible, you'll need to have a low body fat percentage. If you have a high body fat percentage, you'll need to lose weight through diet and exercise to get a six-pack. [1] X Research source The best way to calculate your body fat percentage is to do caliper testing. This is a simple, painless test that you can get done at many gyms. If you can't find someone to do caliper testing, you can estimate your body fat percentage at https://bmi-calories.com/body-fat-percentage-calculator.html . However, keep in mind that digital calculators that rely on BMI do not distinguish between muscle and fat. Someone with a lot of muscle will have a high BMI, but may not have much excess fat. If you have a high body fat percentage, work on lowering it by losing weight through diet and exercise. Men need a body fat percentage of around 6-13% to have a six-pack. [2] X Research source Women need a body fat percentage of around 12-20% to have a six-pack. For example, if you're a man with a body fat percentage of 18%, you'd need to lose at least 5% body fat to get a six-pack."
