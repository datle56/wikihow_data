      "content": "Write down what you need to do for the day, week, and month. Even though you may just want to do this in your head, actually writing it down has a huge impact. [3] X Research source Try to be specific and reasonable. For example, don't write 'continue novel' or 'clean house.' Instead, write things such as 'write 500 words' or 'tidy the living room floor.' Small, achievable tasks are best. If you have a big goal in mind, try breaking it down into smaller steps on your list. Don't get too distracted by the list. If list-making is taking more time than just getting down to work, put it aside and start being productive. [4] X Research source If tasks have a deadline, mark them on. This will help you in prioritizing. Prioritize the tasks . A simple numbering system works well - you can decide to either prioritize the tasks that need to get done first, or get particularly hard/long tasks out of the way first. Alternative, you might even opt to start with a few shorter/easier tasks so that you can knock a few off the list quickly."

      "content": "It's a good idea to remove anything that may be deterring you from work. Distractions can include phones, emails, social media, family etc. If you are being distracted every 15 minutes, you will get little work done because it is impossible to get immediately back to work after a distraction. For most people this takes 5 - 10 minutes. Consider letting your family members, coworkers/classmates, or housemates know that you're buckling down to work on something important, so that they won't distract you."

      "content": "Focus on one thing at a time rather than multitasking. Many people believe that multitasking increases productivity, but the truth is tackling things one at a time will allow you to complete more in less time. [7] X Research source Break tasks into smaller chunks if needed. One huge job can seem overwhelming, but if you break it down into sections, it becomes more manageable. For example, \"write an essay\" seems big, but if you start with \"brainstorm ideas\" and \"write a topic sentence,\" each part becomes a much smaller and more achievable goal. As you do each task, check it off your to-do list. This feels great, and can motivate you to keep going down the list."
