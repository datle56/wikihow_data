      "content": "Ensure that you need a copyright. All three of these provide legal protection, but cover different forms of material. If you have created commercial branding or a new invention, rather than a creative work, you may need to apply for a trademark or a patent, rather than a copyright. Copyright covers original artistic work (musical, artistic, literary, or dramatic) and gives the work’s creator the exclusive legal right to reproduce and perform the work. Trademarks are designed to protect commercial brands; they limit use of specific words and designs which describe a specific brand. Patents protect the development of new technology, or improvements made to already existing technologies. A patent limits production and sales of an invention. [2] X Research source"

Every copyrighted work should be marked with the copyright symbol—©—and the copyright owner’s name, followed by the year the work was published. This will let others know that the work is an original creative work, and that they cannot legally reproduce the work or sell a reproduction. Remember that your creative work is still copyrighted, even if it does not have the “©” symbol physically printed on it. The printed symbol serves primarily to remind others that your work has been copyright, and is not theirs to reproduce."

If you become aware that an individual or company is reproducing or selling your copyrighted work without your permission, the correct legal step is to send them a Cease and Desist “Copyright Infringement” letter. The Cease and Desist letter communicates your ownership of the copyrighted work, and asks that the violator cease using the copyrighted creative work. An attorney (or, often, the website of a legal firm) can provide you with a form letter; you’ll need to fill in specific details."
