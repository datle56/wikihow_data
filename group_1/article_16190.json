      "title": "Assemble your materials.",
      "content": "Assemble your materials. In order to extract orange oil in a jar, you will need a mason jar, a zester and some grain alcohol. Because it is largely tasteless, vodka works best for creating orange oil. It will not dilute or overwhelm the orange scent in the finished oil."

    {
      "title": "Remove the orange peels.",
      "content": "Remove the orange peels. The essential oil in oranges, limonene, is largely found in the peel. Because of this, you will want to remove the peels from oranges before making your oil. [1] X Research source You can either cut the peel from the orange with a knife or grind off the peel with a zester. [2] X Research source For best results, avoid cutting off any of the pith. This part of the orange has very little limonene and will make your mixture bitter. If you do not have a zester, you can also use a Microplane, a vegetable peeler, or a paring knife. The amount of oranges used can vary. It depends on how many oranges you have or how much essential oil you want to make."

      "title": "Dry the peels",
      "content": "Dry the peels . Once you have removed the peels, you will need to let them dry. Place them on a paper towel and leave them in direct sunlight until they are completely dry. Depending on the humidity in your area, this can take a couple of days. To accelerate the process, try chopping the orange peels into small pieces (1 in or 2.5 cm). [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Grind the peels.",
      "content": "Grind the peels. After the peels have dried, place them in a food processor. Grind them until they are a coarse consistency. Avoid over drying your peels. This can cause them to lose some of their limonene. [4] X Research source If you used a Microplane or a zester, you will not need to grind the peels further."

    {
      "title": "Warm the grain alcohol.",
      "content": "Warm the grain alcohol. Fill a bowl with warm tap water. It should be warm but not overly hot (around 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 32 degrees Celsius). Place the bottle of grain alcohol in the warm water and let it soak for about 20 minutes. [5] X Research source Vodka works well for this process. You can use cold alcohol. However, warm alcohol will help you get more oil. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the peels with warm grain alcohol and give them a shake. Place the zested or ground orange peel in a mason jar. Pour in enough alcohol to completely cover the orange peels. Once you have covered the grinds, secure the lid and vigorously shake the jar for several minutes. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the mixture sit for two or three days. During that time, you may also want to shake the mixture two or three times a day. You may also consider letting sit longer than a few days. The more you shake it and the longer you let it sit, the more oil you will get from your mixture. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow the alcohol to evaporate. Cover the bowl with a cloth or paper towel and let it sit for a few days. This will allow the remaining alcohol in the mixture to evaporate. Once the alcohol has evaporated, you will be left with orange oil. [10] X Research source Do not let the towel fall into the mixture. It will suck up the oil. Once the alcohol has evaporated, put the remaining oil in a container with a lid."

      "content": "Choose a type of oil. When infusing an oil, you will want to choose something that has a mild flavor and accepts the taste of whatever is being cooked in it. Olive oil is widely available and easy to infuse. However, its own flavor can be too strong. Consider using extra virgin olive, peanut, grapeseed, or avocado oils. These oils all have lighter flavors. [11] X Research source Choosing a lighter oil will help ensure that your oil has the taste and aroma that you want."

The number of oranges used with vary depending on the amount of infused oil you are making. In general, you need about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of zest for every cup of oil.

      "content": "Heat the oil and the zest. Place the orange zest in a small saucepan and cover it with oil. Warm the pan over medium heat for about five minutes or until the oil begins to bubble. Do not let the oil and zest get too hot or it will begin to burn and ruin the flavor and smell.

If you would like it to have a stronger flavor, leave the zest in the oil while it cools and strain it out before bottling. [15] X Research source If you remove the zest during cooling, your oil will have a lighter coloring. If the zest stays in during cooling, you will have a cloudier coloring."

Simply add a teaspoon of orange oil extract to a bottle of Castile soap and you have a great all-purpose cleaner. Because Castile soap is made from plant oils, instead of chemical detergent, it is safe on sensitive skin and biodegradable. Limonene is a natural grease-cutter and solvent. It is particularly effective at cleaning pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils."

Simply dab some around your neck, arms and other exposed areas, and you will notice a decrease in bug bites. You can also place a little limonene oil around the campsite to ward off bugs. [16] X Research source Avoid having limonene around an open flame. It is extremely flammable. In fact, it is so flammable that orange peels make great kindling."
