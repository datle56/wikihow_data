      "title": "Wait until the dog is relaxed and comfortable.",
      "content": "Wait until the dog is relaxed and comfortable. Before you try to put a diaper on your dog, especially for the first time, you want to create a calm environment. Talk to your dog in a reassuring voice, and wait until it seems calm before even start the diapering process. That way, it will be more likely to view this as a positive encounter, making it easier to put on diapers in the future. [1] X Research source If your dog is motivated by treats, you might want to have some on hand to reward your dog for sitting or staying calm while you put on the diaper."

      "content": "Clean the dog's hindquarters with a wipe or damp cloth. Before you diaper your dog, clean the fur around its hindquarters, back legs, and groin. You can use a baby wipe, a dog-friendly wipe, or even just a damp washcloth. [2] X Research source If you cover urine or feces with a diaper and leave it there, it could lead to serious skin irritation or even infections for your pup."

      "title": "Pull the dog’s tail through the hole in the diaper.",
      "content": "Pull the dog’s tail through the hole in the diaper. Gently take your dog’s tail and slip the hole in the diaper over the end of its tail. If your dog isn't used to having its tail handled, it may resist this at first, but wait patiently until the dog calms down, then try again. Push the diaper all the way down until the hole is around the base of the dog’s tail. [3] X Research source If your dog has an especially fluffy tail and the hole isn’t quite large enough, you can widen the hole with scissors. However, remember that the hole needs to fit snugly around the base of the tail."

      "title": "Wrap the diaper securely around the dog’s waist.",
      "content": "Wrap the diaper securely around the dog’s waist. The exact fit of the diaper may depend on the brand you’re using, but in general, you’ll see a longer side that will loop down under the dog’s bottom and stomach, and a shorter side that will rest on the dog’s back. Pull the two sides tightly together. [4] X Research source The bottom half of the diaper should overlap the top half to prevent leaks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fasten the Velcro tabs upward onto the back.",
      "content": "Fasten the Velcro tabs upward onto the back. Unlike baby diapers, which secure in the front, dog diapers typically fasten in the back. Pull the tabs out, then press the Velcro side against the corresponding strip on the back of the diaper. The diaper should fit securely, but not too tightly. [5] X Research source You should be able to slide 2 fingers under the diaper comfortably. Read the manufacturer’s instructions for specific instructions on how to connect the Velcro tabs."

    {
      "title": "Change the diaper every time the dog soils it.",
      "content": "Change the diaper every time the dog soils it. To keep your dog clean and healthy, check the diaper every 1-2 hours, and change it whenever you notice the dog has soiled it. To change it, pull the Velcro tabs until they come loose, then remove and discard the diaper. Clean your dog with a wipe or a damp cloth before replacing the diaper. [6] X Research source Leaving your dog in a wet or dirty diaper for too long can cause serious problems with its skin and fur, including a painful rash called urine scald. Over long periods of time, the dog may even experience severe skin or urinary infections. Protect your health by wearing gloves when you change your dog's diaper. If you don't want to wear gloves, make sure to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and hot water when you're finished."

      "content": "Use an absorbent pad inside of a belly band for a male dog. If you're using a belly band due to a male dog's urinary incontinence, lay the band out flat on a table or another surface. Then, simply insert an absorbent pad, like a maxi pad, into the band, and strap the band around your dog’s waist so his male parts are covered. [7] X Research source Treat the pad the same way you would any other disposable diaper. Change it regularly to prevent urine scald, which is similar to a diaper rash on a baby. If the belly band becomes wet or soiled, wash it according to the manufacturer's instructions. Regularly check the dog’s belly just in front of its sheath for urine scald. If you need to, apply a barrier cream to protect the skin."

      "title": "Add removable suspender straps if you need extra security.",
      "content": "Add removable suspender straps if you need extra security. Some dogs have trouble keeping their doggy diapers on. One option to help counteract this is to clip straps onto the front of the diaper, near the dog’s stomach. Criss-cross the straps over the dog’s chest, then bring them back over the dog’s back and clip them to the back of the diaper. [8] X Research source You can also use diaper pins to attach the diaper to a soft harness. However, do not use regular safety pins, as they can slip open and hurt your dog. If your dog keeps trying to remove the diaper, it may need more exercise and fulfillment in its life. [9] X Expert Source Belgin Altundag Certified Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 11 August 2021"

      "title": "Use a washable cover if you need help preventing leaks.",
      "content": "Use a washable cover if you need help preventing leaks. Washable diaper covers are typically made from a water-resistant material, and they just slip over the diaper like underwear. In addition to helping to keep the diaper in place, these covers also help protect against any leaks if the diaper shifts while the dog is wearing it. [10] X Research source This is especially helpful if your dog tends to chew on the diaper. You may also be able to use a small pair of boy’s briefs, although you may need to use Velcro to adjust the waistband so it will fit. Put the briefs on backward, and pull the dog’s tail through the hole that would normally go in the front."

      "content": "Place a strip of masking tape on top of the tabs if your dog opens them. If your dog is frequently able to scoot, wiggle, or chew enough that the Velcro tabs come loose on the diaper, you may need extra reinforcement. Cover the tab with a small strip of masking tape, but make sure not to get any tape on your dog’s fur. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the tail hole with tape if your dog's tail is short.",
      "content": "Cover the tail hole with tape if your dog's tail is short. If your dog has a docked or very short tail, it may not be able to block the tail hole on the diaper. If you notice your dog’s diaper leaking around the tail hole, get a new diaper and cover the hole with a double layer of masking tape before you put it on the dog. First, cover the hole completely from the inside, with the sticky side facing out. Then, add another layer on top, with the sticky side facing in. By using 2 layers of tape, you prevent the sticky adhesive from pulling on your dog’s fur."

      "title": "Opt for underwear-style diapers for full coverage.",
      "content": "Opt for underwear-style diapers for full coverage. These diapers most closely mimic the ones used for babies, but they’re made to fit the shape of a dog’s hips and narrow waist. They cover the dog’s privates and rear end, and they also include a hole for the tail. Many brands offer separate options for male and female dogs. [12] X Research source You can find disposable dog diapers online or at well-stocked pet supply stores."

      "title": "Choose a belly band style for male dogs with urinary incontinence.",
      "content": "Choose a belly band style for male dogs with urinary incontinence. If you have a male dog and he can’t hold his bladder, or he tends to mark inside of your home, a belly band style diaper might be a good option. These are typically a strip of breathable fabric with a Velcro closure. [13] X Research source If your dog also has fecal incontinence, this is not a good option. You can find belly bands online or at pet supply stores. If you have a small dog, you can also make your own by cutting the toes off of a tube sock."

      "title": "Measure your dog's waist to determine the size diaper you need.",
      "content": "Measure your dog's waist to determine the size diaper you need. Dog diapers are typically sized based on the measurement of your dog’s waist. Use a fabric tape measure to find the measurement around your dog’s waist just in front of its back legs. [14] X Research source This is more accurate than choosing a fit based on weight, since different breeds are shaped very differently, even at the same weight."

    {
      "title": "Look for diapers with Velcro fasteners.",
      "content": "Look for diapers with Velcro fasteners. Most disposable dog diapers feature tabs made from Velcro, rather than a sticky fastener. This is because sticky fasteners will get stuck to your dog’s fur, causing irritation or even hair loss. [15] X Research source You should also look for elastic gathers on the waistband, as this will help secure the diaper around the dog's waist, preventing leaks."
