      "content": "Take a small Sledgehammer or a rock hammer (preferably not a construction hammer, such as a claw hammer) and strike the top center of the geode. A couple of strikes might be required to fully crack open this rock. This is likely to result in the geode fragmenting into more than two pieces, but it is the most suitable method for kids, though not recommended for particularly valuable/rare geodes. Rock hammers are made with reinforced steel, making them stronger than your typical carpenter hammer."
