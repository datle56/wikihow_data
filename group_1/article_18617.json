The friend should be the same sex as your partner. Go around town, and take pictures together. Post the pictures where your ex can see them. This revenge works best if you do some romantic-looking activities together, such as having a candlelit dinner together or walking hand-in-hand through a park"

      "content": "Post pictures of your happiness. Advertise your happiness on social media. Even if you're not feeling happy, try faking happiness for the photos. Post pictures of yourself out with friends having drinks or hiking through the woods. Include smiling selfies with local landmarks or in local museums. Anything that shows you are living a great life is game for posting on social media. [2] X Research source This step shows the other person what they've given up. Plus, faking happiness is one step in moving towards happiness. In addition, try to hide your pain. While this one can be difficult, it can make cheaters upset, as many cheaters are ego-driven, so they want to be in the middle. If you blow up at the person, you're feeding that person's ego. Try calmly breaking up with the person and then getting on with your life. [3] X Research source"

You probably expect anger and sadness, but you may be surprised that you also feel shame and emptiness. You may find yourself annoyed or possessive. You may even feel relief because you have finally figured out what's going on with your relationship. All of these feelings are perfectly normal. The first step in dealing with your emotions is figuring out just what you're feeling. Try spending some time journaling to help you identify your emotions. Discussing it with a friend can also help you figure out what you're feeling. Don't be afraid to talk to a therapist.

[8] X Research source The next step is to see if you can find why the person did what he or she did. That means trying to find compassion for the partner to figure out how he or she got to the point of cheating. [9] X Research source Forgiving the person doesn't mean excusing what he or she did, nor does it mean you must stay with him or her. It does mean you have to think about the person as a person, not as this entity who hurt you. [10] X Research source"

Eventually, the bad karma will get back to your partner in the form of a tongue lashing from a mutual friend.
