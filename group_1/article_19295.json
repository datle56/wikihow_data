When looking for an OTC treatment at the store, make sure to choose a product that has an effective active ingredient, like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Here’s a breakdown of ingredients to look for: Benzoyl peroxide kills acne-causing bacteria and unclogs pores. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It’s a good place to start, since it has a high success rate and works quickly. Look for a benzoyl peroxide topical cream , spot treatment , or face wash at your local pharmacy. Salicylic acid can help unclog pores, shrink pimples, and reduce redness. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Salicylic acid topical treatments and face washes are available at most pharmacies and drugstores. Adapalene gel ( Differin ) is a topical retinoid that's available OTC at the strength of .1%. It helps unclog pores and prevent future breakouts, but it can cause some irritation and dryness at first, so be sure to use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with it. Alpha hydroxy acids remove dead skin cells and reduce inflammation.

Sulfur has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Products like Mario Badescu Cleansing Lotion C and ProActiv Skin Purifying Mask contain sulfur as an acne-fighting ingredient.

[6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, many people find it effective to use a salicylic acid face wash, followed by a benzoyl peroxide cream.
