      "content": "Reframe your mindset about your period. Many people dread the arrival of their period and think of it as something they have to suffer through. During your menstrual cycle, the actual hormones in your brain change and can affect your mood, but you can also consciously change the way you think about your period. [1] X Research source It can be empowering to think of your period as a symbol of adulthood and as natural part of your life. Your first period, called menarche, is often celebrated 'as a young person's entrance into adulthood.' [2] X Research source If you realize that your period can be something that is celebrated, you might stop dreading its arrival and cope with it. Have something to look forward to on your period. For example, you may want to cook your favorite meal on your period, or buy yourself a magazine when you get your period."

      "content": "Keep track of your period. Tracking your menstrual cycle will not only give you a heads-up when your period is due, but it can also help you know when you are fertile and can get pregnant. [3] X Research source Getting your period unexpectedly can leave you feeling unprepared and stressed. You can keep track of the day your period starts and end with a calendar, in a journal, or with an app for your mobile devices. There are several apps, such as Strawberry Pal or Clue, that can help you track your period and set reminders for when your next cycle is about to start. Remember that during your first year, periods are often unpredictable and come at random. They can also skip. This is completely normal. However, after the first year, your period should begin to follow a more regular pattern and be easier to track. Menstrual cycles vary from person to person. They can last anywhere from 21 to 35 days, and your period may last two to seven days. Your period may be regular and occur at the same time each month, or it may be irregular.

It helps you to determine when you are the most fertile, which is important to know whether you want to avoid pregnancy or when you want to become pregnant. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep menstrual products with you at all times. Keep an extra tampon, pantyliner, or pad in your purse, backpack, and car. This way, if you get your period and you do not have access to other menstrual products you are still protected. This is especially important if your periods are irregular and you are not able to accurately predict when your next period will begin. You should also keep some change with you, just in case you are caught off guard and need to purchase a pad/tampon. It’s a good idea to keep a few extra menstrual hygiene products with you so you can offer one to another person if they need one. Wearing period underwear , or a pantyliner can help prevent any leaks if you weren't aware your period has started. You can also get reusable pantyliners."

      "content": "Eat iron-rich foods. During ovulation, which happens 12 to 16 days before your period begins, your body is preparing for a potential pregnancy. Your body releases two different hormones, progesterone and estrogen, which tell your body that it should prepare for pregnancy. [6] X Research source Your metabolism speeds up during this time so you’ll need to eat more calories than you usually do. Eat plenty of iron-rich foods to help offset the iron that you’ll lose right before and during your period. [7] X Research source Meat, beans, lentils, eggs, and dark leafy greens are all good sources of iron. You should continue to eat iron-rich foods during your period. This can help to relieve some period symptoms, like fatigue and cramping. [8] X Research source Vitamin C can improve your body's absorption of iron. Try to eat foods rich in Vitamin C, such as oranges, peppers, and kale, as well."

      "content": "Adjust your diet. During your period, you may find that you are craving different foods. Unfortunately, salty, sugary, and processed foods can make cramping more painful. The foods you eat should be nutritious and give you energy throughout the day. You may be craving a certain treat, like chocolate or ice cream, and it’s okay to give into that craving and have some, as long as it is in moderation. Foods high in potassium, like bananas and leafy greens, can help alleviate bloating naturally. Eat plenty of foods that are rich in calcium, like beans, almonds, and dairy. There is, however, evidence showing that having some dark chocolate can help relieve symptoms. Make sure you are still consuming enough calories, or you could end up feeling dizzy or tired."

Not only is it comfortable, but it may be able to reduce your risk of yeast infections. [25] X Research source Stains are less noticeable on darker-colored underwear. Your underwear should be cotton, which allows the area to breathe and is gentler on the skin.

      "content": "Change your menstrual product whenever you feel the need. Pads should be changed every 4-8 hours and tampons should be changed every 4-6 hours. Never leave a tampon in for longer than eight hours; this increases your risk of developing toxic shock syndrome (TSS). You can leave a menstrual cup in for more than twelve hours, and this is the most environmentally friendly option. Changing your menstrual product can help you to feel fresh and more confident that you won’t leak. You may need to change your menstrual product more frequently if you have a heavier flow or if it is the first few days of your period. TSS is a serious and life-threatening bacterial infection. If you begin to have a rash that resembles a sunburn, especially on your palms and soles, a high fever, low blood pressure, or begin vomiting contact a medical professional.
