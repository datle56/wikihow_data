      "title": "Remove the access panel from the front of the dishwasher.",
      "content": "Remove the access panel from the front of the dishwasher. Most dishwashers have an access panel or kickplate on the bottom that covers the water inlet, pump, motor, and hoses. To remove the panel, use a screwdriver and loosen the screws attaching the panel to the unit. Turn the screws to the left (counter-clockwise) to loosen them. Removing the panel will help you find the source of the leak, which may be coming from underneath the dishwasher. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the pump.",
      "content": "Check the pump. The pump and all its components are located under the dishwasher. Use a flashlight to inspect the pump, housing, motor, and the seal or gasket. Check for cracks in the pump or housing, and inspect the seal or gasket for damage. [2] X Research source When there's a problem with the pump or pump components, water will leak from below the dishwasher."

      "title": "Check common leak locations first.",
      "content": "Check common leak locations first. Most dishwasher leaks come from around or under the door, but water may also be leaking from below the unit. Determining the source of the water can help you narrow down the possible causes. [3] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. Run the dishwasher through a normal cycle and watch closely to see where the water is coming from. Water leaking around or under the door could indicate a problem with the gasket, spray arm, or float. Water leaking from under the unit could indicate a problem with the pump, hoses, or water inlet."

    {
      "title": "Inspect the door gasket.",
      "content": "Inspect the door gasket. The gasket is a soft vinyl or rubber seal that makes the unit watertight when the door is closed. The gasket will either be on the door itself (around the sides and top), or on the tub opening. Check this for breaks, cracks, brittleness, or other signs of damage. [4] X Research source Water leaking from the sides of the dishwasher doors usually means there's a problem with the gasket. [5] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. The tub is the interior basin of the dishwasher unit."

    {
      "title": "Check the spray arm.",
      "content": "Check the spray arm. The spray arm is inside the dishwasher, at the bottom center of the unit. This is what sprays the dishes with water during the wash and rinse cycles. Inspect the spray arm for cracks, warping, blockages, or other damage. A problem with the spray arm usually causes water to leak from the bottom of the dishwasher door, where there's no gasket.

      "title": "Check the water level.",
      "content": "Check the water level. The float is a safety device inside the tub that determines the water level and prevents the dishwasher from overfilling. When the dishwasher is in mid-cycle and full, turn it off, open the door, and check the water level. The water shouldn’t be any higher than the heating element in the bottom of the tub. [7] X Research source If the water is higher than the heating element, there may be a problem with the float or float switch. When the float is the problem, water will often leak from the bottom front of the dishwasher."

    {
      "title": "Inspect the water inlet valve.",
      "content": "Inspect the water inlet valve. The inlet valve is also below the dishwasher, and this is what connects the dishwasher to your home’s water supply. It may be a rubber hose, a braided hose, or a copper pipe. When the dishwasher is filling up, check the valve and the connections for leaks, which could indicate a crack or tear. [8] X Research source Leaks or tears in the water inlet valve will come from below the dishwasher."

    {
      "title": "Make sure the hoses and clamps are secure and intact.",
      "content": "Make sure the hoses and clamps are secure and intact. The hoses connected to the pump under the dishwasher allow water to flow from one area of the dishwasher to another, and drain water from the tub. When the dishwasher is running, check the hoses for leaks or drips. [9] X Research source A stray piece of glass or even a rodent infestation can puncture the tubing causing a leak. [10] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. When the hoses crack or tear, or when the clamps come loose, water may leak from the bottom of the unit."

      "title": "Purchase a replacement gasket.",
      "content": "Purchase a replacement gasket. When the leak is caused by a damaged or brittle gasket, you can fix the leak by removing the old gasket and replacing it with a new one. Make sure the replacement gasket you purchase is manufacturer-approved, and that it matches the make and model of your dishwasher. A gasket that’s not made for your dishwasher may not fit properly, and this means it won’t form a proper seal and will continue to leak."

      "title": "Remove the old gasket.",
      "content": "Remove the old gasket. Open the dishwasher door. Start at the bottom left corner, and pinch the gasket firmly with your fingers. Loosen the gasket out of position, and peel it away from the edge of the door or tub. Continue peeling until you have removed the gasket from its position. Pay attention to the orientation of the gasket around the tub or door. The new gasket will have to be installed in the same way. [11] X Research source"

Once it’s clean, rinse the area with clean water. Wipe it dry with a rag and let the area air dry. This will give the new gasket a clean and dry surface to adhere to, and this will ensure a proper seal."

      "title": "Install the new gasket.",
      "content": "Install the new gasket. Warm the new gasket with a blow dryer on a low heat setting. When it’s warm and malleable, fold the gasket in half and locate the center. Start at the top center of the door or tub, and press the middle of the gasket into position. Working out from either side, push the gasket into place. Don’t stretch the gasket as you work."
