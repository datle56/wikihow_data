      "title": "Dress appropriately to suplex.",
      "content": "Dress appropriately to suplex. Clothing that is too loose can get tangled with your practice partner, which could cause injury to either or both of you. You'll want you and your partner to be wearing clothing that allows a free range of motion without being baggy. When doing this move, to perform safely you'll need to grab onto the fabric of your partner's shorts/pants. Clothing that rips easily should be avoided. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose the right practice partner.",
      "content": "Choose the right practice partner. Once you've mastered this move, you'll likely be able to do it with people who are different sizes. To begin with, you should choose someone who is roughly your weight and height. This will make it easier for you to get the hang of the move. People who are significantly heavier than you may be impossible for you to suplex. Those who are too light might not offer enough resistance. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice in a safe area.",
      "content": "Practice in a safe area. It's best to practice this move on a flat, padded surface to best prevent the chance of an injury occurring. Pillows are not recommended, as the padding in these isn't intended to cushion the impact of a fall. You should also make sure your practice area is free of obstacles, like toys, trees, or tripping hazards."

      "title": "Lead into the suplex with a strike.",
      "content": "Lead into the suplex with a strike. The classic setup for the suplex involves your partner being slightly bent at the waist. To get your partner into this position, you may want to pretend to strike them in the gut, so it looks natural for them to be in this bent position. Many pro wrestlers will use a toe kick to the belly to enter this setup.You could also use a fake gut punch to get into position. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Get into the suplex hold.",
      "content": "Get into the suplex hold. Facing your partner head on, take your left arm and put it behind their neck. They should do the same to you. With your free hand, reach down and grab a firm hold of your partner's shorts/pants and have your partner grip your shorts/pants firmly as well. If you or your partner are wearing a belt, this can be a useful handhold. You can also grab a handful of the fabric tightly. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Signal the start of the move.",
      "content": "Signal the start of the move. You should signal to your partner you are about to start the suplex by bending slightly at the knees. The key to smoothly executing this move is to be in sync with your partner. As you bend at the knees, your partner should follow the motion and prepare to spring upwards. Failing to properly signal your partner could result in them being surprised. In this case, you might do serious harm to their neck. Always be ready to stop. If your partner is unsure or doesn't feel comfortable and asks you to let go, you should do so immediately. At this point, both you and your partner should be in a bent position, with your arms firmly around each other's necks, and your free hands gripped firmly onto each other's clothing.

      "title": "Straighten at your waist.",
      "content": "Straighten at your waist. From the knees-bent position you should drive down with your heels and straighten your body until your back until is completely straight. Pull your partner into this upwards motion with the arm gripping their shorts/pants helping to lift them above you. As you do so, your partner should spring upwards. Guide them up over your head in a smooth arc with the hand gripping his shorts/pants. Your partner should remain in a bent position until they have cleared your shoulder and is over your head. Straightening their body before he reaches this position will make it more difficult to perform the suplex. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Follow through backwards in a falling motion.",
      "content": "Follow through backwards in a falling motion. Once your partner is hoisted over your shoulder, all you need to do is fall backwards. Try to do this in a slow, controlled fashion. Falling too quickly can take your partner by surprise or result in injury to them. Both you and your partner should be positioned so that when you fall, you fall flat on the meaty part your back. If you feel that you or your partner are twisted, try to correct this before contact with the ground. Falling heavily while in a twisted position can do serious, permanent damage to your spine. This could result in a permanent injury, like paralysis, so you should exercise extreme caution. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Disengage as you approach the ground. Up to this point, you'll want both you and your partner to have a firm hold on each other. At the halfway point between your upright, vertical position and the ground, you should loosen your hold on each other. This way, if something goes wrong, neither person is applying added pressure.

      "title": "Take a crack at the fisherman's suplex.",
      "content": "Take a crack at the fisherman's suplex. This kind of suplex is very similar to the classic suplex. Get your partner into position with a fake strike to the midsection so he is bent over. Take your arm around your partner's neck and have them do the same to you, as you would normally. Then: Take your free hand behind your partner's kneecap. Lift their leg so it is raised off the ground and bent toward your body. Signal the start of your move by bending at the knees. Have your partner mirror you and prepare to jump into the move. Drive down with your heels and assist your partner up and over your shoulder using the hand you have around his leg. As your partner will only have one free leg, it's important that you assist as much as possible without applying too much force. As you approach the three quarters point to a vertical position, release your partner's leg and loosen your grip. Fall the remaining distance to the ground. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Try the German suplex. This variation follows roughly the same procedure as the classic suplex, though in this variation you and your partner are both facing the same direction. From behind your partner, take your arms and grip them firmly around the waist. Then: Signal the start of the move with a bend at the knees. Your partner should also bend at the knees and prepare to jump. Drive downwards with your heels and guide your partner up and over you as they jump. Make sure you grip them tightly while doing so. Release your partner after they clear the halfway point so they can disengage and land beyond you and not on top of you. Complete your fall. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Attempt a butterfly suplex. This version is a little more dangerous than others, so you should be especially careful. Face your partner head on and perform a fake strike to their midsection so they are bent over. Slide your arms beneath their armpits so that their arms chicken wing off to the sides. Their head should be positioned off to the side. Then: Take a firm hold of your partner's shirt. Bend at the knees to signal the start of the move. Your partner should also bend at the knees and prepare to jump to assist the move. Drive downward with your heels as your partner jumps into the move. Use your hold to help guide your partner, but when he is three quarters of the way above you, disengage. Fall the remaining distance to the ground. [11] X Research source"
