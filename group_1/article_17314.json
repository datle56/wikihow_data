      "title": "...you may be working through intense feelings of passion or anger.",
      "content": "...you may be working through intense feelings of passion or anger. Often, our dreams are trying to tell us things that we cant or won’t realize in our waking lives. Typically, dreams that involve fire are caused by any number of elevated or intense emotions, most commonly growing pains, passion (such as romance or creative energies), or an explosive release of pent-up emotion. [1] X Research source What to do: Examine your dream and ask yourself: What is on fire? How do I feel about it in my dream? Is it dangerous? Sometimes, the thing that’s burning is the object of your emotion. How you feel in your dream is often how you feel about that object in real life. If there’s a sense of danger, it may hint that the dream itself is suggesting a problem in your waking life. If there’s a sense of contentment, it might reflect more positive feelings, like gratitude."

      "title": "…you might be overwhelmed by stress.",
      "content": "…you might be overwhelmed by stress. Whether it’s your personal life, your relationships, or your finances, something is threatening to fizzle you out. The stress is so intense that it’s invaded your own home, where you should feel safe and relaxed, not on-edge. And if you don’t handle your stress soon, you risk burning up. What to do: De-stress in the short term by going for a quick run or meditating , both of which help your body release pent-up energies. [2] X Research source And when your body feels better, so does your mind, which equips you to tackle your problems head-on. Then, try to identify the core problem. What is it that keeps you up at night, or what are you thinking about right before you go to sleep? That’s likely the cause of the dreams, and where you need to direct your energy to solve the issue."

      "title": "…you may have job-related stress.",
      "content": "…you may have job-related stress. It could be that you’re worried about losing your job, or that you got a poor performance review. Or, maybe you’re starting a new job and feel anxious about making a good impression. [3] X Research source At any rate, a fire in your workplace hints at turbulence in your professional life. What to do: Impress your boss by taking the initiative to ask them what you might do to improve, or if there’s anything in particular they’re looking for from a stellar employee. Then, take their advice to heart. Once your performance is on the rise, you might find that your dreams become more lighthearted, too."

    {
      "title": "…you may feel betrayed by someone close to you.",
      "content": "…you may feel betrayed by someone close to you. It’s a literal manifestation of the phrase “getting burnt by someone.” [4] X Research source Maybe you and your partner are arguing and going to bed angry, or maybe a close friend said something less than kind. Whatever it is, your feelings are singed, and now you’re feeling the heat in your sleep. What to do: Take steps to forgive and forget. Tell whoever hurt you that you love them, and that you want to mend the relationship. Or, if it’s too far gone, try to move on from the relationship by focusing instead on your hobbies or interests to put the fiery dreams behind you."

    {
      "title": "…you might feel anxious about something precious to you.",
      "content": "…you might feel anxious about something precious to you. Fire is a destructive force, and it sometimes threatens to destroy things or people you care about in your dreams, either physically or emotionally. [5] X Research source It’s not a bad omen, per se, but it is a reflection of how passionately you care for whatever or whomever the dream-fire threatens. What to do: Check in on your loved ones. Show those close to you that you love them by sending them a letter. You can’t always control what life throws at you, but you can let your loved ones know they mean a lot to you. Or, take stock of your valuable possessions. Whether their value is physical or emotional, make sure you know where they are and that they’re safe, so that you can rest easy at night."

      "title": "…you might be feeling uninspired or bored.",
      "content": "…you might be feeling uninspired or bored. It could be that your creative or artistic pursuits have stalled, or maybe your sex life has hit a wall. [6] X Research source Trying and failing light a fire in a dream may reflect a very specific frustration in your waking life, and no matter how hard you rub those sticks together, you’re just not getting any sparks. What to do: Take a break from what’s frustrating you. Step away from the canvas, or distract yourself from your sex life by focusing on something like exercise instead. There’s not much point in forcing something that won’t come, and often these sorts of things sort themselves out with a little time, anyway. Then, recapture your inspiration by reminding yourself about why you do what you do. For example, you paint to express yourself, or you’re intimate with your partner to express your love for them. Identifying your motivation goes a long way to rekindling it."

      "content": "…it may indicate that good fortune is coming your way. Fire isn’t just destructive, it also lends warmth and light. Likewise, dreaming of a pleasant campfire, warm stove, or entrancing fireplace may symbolize success or good luck. [7] X Research source It might be a financial windfall, career success, or maybe an old friend will turn up unexpectedly. Whatever it is, brace for good fortune. What to do: Stay motivated by reminding yourself of your goals, and don’t stop the hard work just yet! Good things are coming your way, and that hard work will pay off."

      "title": "…you may be dealing with a difficult person.",
      "content": "…you may be dealing with a difficult person. Just like dragons spew fire, some people spew harsh words to get their own way. [8] X Research source It could be an irksome coworker, a headache-inducing in-law, or just some cranky stranger whose words stuck with you as you fell asleep. They’re breathing smoke into your slumber, and you’re having trouble clearing the air. What to do: Focus on the big picture. Ask yourself: Will their words matter in a month? A year? 10 years? They might be a bump in the road now, but you’re driving on past them."

      "title": "…it may mean that you feel trapped or helpless.",
      "content": "…it may mean that you feel trapped or helpless. Forest fires are frightening backdrops to roaring flames. Often, there’s no obvious escape, and they travel quickly. They may indicate a feeling of being surrounded or overwhelmed in your waking life. Something has you cornered, whether it’s your finances, career, or a relationship that’s run its course, and you’re looking for a way out. What to do: Whenever you feel overwhelmed, take a moment to do some breathing exercises . Ten seconds in, 10 seconds out. A clear head is key to taking stock of your situation. Then, ask a close friend or family member for their opinion on your conundrum, or see a therapist to get some valuable outside perspective. Often, someone who isn’t involved can offer invaluable insight."

[10] X Research source And just as a forest fire makes way for new growth, you may soon find yourself learning and growing from your troubles. What to do: Stay positive and see your troubles through by reminding yourself of what you’re working toward. Visualize the worry-free life you want in order to help manifest it."
