The process of pulling out the tick will be the same. If you do not have tweezers, you can use gloved fingers or tissue paper, but this is a more difficult method. Be careful not to squeeze or crush the tick."

There are many things you can do to reduce your chance of a tick bite. Apply an insect repellent containing DEET. If you have children, spray the repellent on for them. Use permethrin on all of your clothing and gear. This is usually available at outdoor stores. Check everyone for ticks after coming inside. Pay special attention to their arms, knees, waist, belly button, ears, and hair. Remember to check pets as well! After coming inside, put your clothes in the dryer on high heat for an hour to kill any ticks that might be hiding in your clothing. Light-colored clothing will let you see ticks more easily. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and boots if possible. Tuck these into one another.
