      "content": "Examine the colour and speckles of the quail's breast. Females will have light-coloured breasts (such as cream or pale brown) with brown speckles. Males, however, will have dark-coloured breasts (such as reddish-brown), and will not have speckles. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Securely hold the quail's body.",
      "content": "Securely hold the quail's body. Make sure not to hold the quail by its legs, as the legs are very fragile. Have a gentle but firm grip on your quail, and then turn it upside-down."

      "title": "Examine the cloaca.",
      "content": "Examine the cloaca. Blow the feathers underneath the tail to expose the cloaca. You may already be able to see a small bulge (if so, it is a male)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press the cloaca.",
      "content": "Press the cloaca. If you can't see a bulge just by looking at the cloaca, place one finger above the opening of the cloaca and put another finger below the opening. Gently press down. If a bulge pops up, then it's a male. White foam may also come out of the cloaca when you press it, which also indicates that it's a male. If there is no bulge and no foam when you press the cloaca, the quail is a female. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Observe the quail's behaviour.",
      "content": "Observe the quail's behaviour. Male quails tend to be more aggressive towards each over whilst the female is more calm. Male quails will attack each over unless they are in a large space with lots of hiding spots. To see if they do attack, place them in a small box (but big enough for them to move around) and watch them for a minute or two. If they are males one should attack the other, if so remove them straight away to prevent serious injuries."

    {
      "title": "Listen to your quail.",
      "content": "Listen to your quail. Male quails will often call to the female quails but sometimes the female has a call that sounds similar in some breeds of quails (usually to call to her chicks). [3] X Research source Male quails will be loud and call a lot during mating season. Whilst calling the male will reach up as if stretching and then call. Male quails are even said to 'growl' during mating season."

    {
      "title": "Watch your quails during mating season.",
      "content": "Watch your quails during mating season. The female often builds the nest and feeds the chicks depending on the breed of quail you have. Sometimes the male will build the nest and feed the chicks so you shouldn't rely on this method. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine the feathers during mating season.",
      "content": "Examine the feathers during mating season. Female quails usually have a loss of feathers on their head and back due to mating. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at the difference between each quail.",
      "content": "Look at the difference between each quail. Male quails usually have brighter and more colourful feathers around their back, neck and head whilst the female quails are usually a plain colour."
