      "content": "Draw 4 boxes on a blank piece of paper. Use a pencil or a pen to draw a cross in the center of a blank sheet of paper, dividing it into 4 different sections. [1] X Research source Use a ruler to get straighter lines. They don’t have to be perfect, but make them as even as possible to get the most accurate results when you play the game."

      "title": "Label each box with a possible answer to your question.",
      "content": "Label each box with a possible answer to your question. Think of the question you want to ask Charlie, then think of 2-4 possible answers to the question, and write each answer in a different box. Or, simply write “yes” in 2 boxes and “no” in 2 boxes, if you have a yes-or-no question. [2] X Research source For example, if your question is, “Will I ever be rich?” you might write answers like, “Soon,” “In five years,” “In 10 years,” or, “Never.” Avoid rigging the game by just writing the answer you want 4 times—that spoils the fun!"

      "title": "Balance one pencil on top of another in the center of the paper.",
      "content": "Balance one pencil on top of another in the center of the paper. Stack 2 pencils on the paper, aligning them along the cross you drew on the paper. [3] X Research source Balance the top pencil so that the ends line up with the line on the paper (so that it’s not pointing to any answer), and so that neither end touches the paper below it. You may have to tweak and adjust the pencil a bit to get it to balance on top of the other."

    {
      "title": "Ask \"Charlie, Charlie, are you there?\" and wait for the answer.",
      "content": "Ask \"Charlie, Charlie, are you there?\" and wait for the answer. Watch the pencils closely for a minute or two. If the top pencil moves at all, it means Charlie has come to answer your questions. [4] X Research source If it doesn’t Charlie doesn’t want to play right now; come back and try again in an hour or two."

    {
      "title": "Ask your question and watch the pencils for an answer.",
      "content": "Ask your question and watch the pencils for an answer. If Charlie responded to your first chant, go ahead and ask your question. Say it loud and clear so that Charlie can hear you. Then, keep a close eye on the balanced pencil. The urban legend states that Charlie will move the pencil to the correct answer. [5] X Research source You may need to ask your question 2 or even 3 times to get an answer. If it doesn’t work, move to a different room, or even outside; Charlie may have wandered away. Record your question and Charlie’s answer with your phone, then upload it to Facebook, Instagram, or other social media with #CharlieCharlieChallenge to show the world your results."

      "title": "Chant, “Charlie, Charlie, can we stop?” when you’re done.",
      "content": "Chant, “Charlie, Charlie, can we stop?” when you’re done. After you have your answer, end the game by chanting, “Charlie, Charlie, can we stop?” to send Charlie back to where he came from (wherever that is). Some say that if you don’t send him away, even if he didn’t answer, you leave the spirit door open for him—or other malevolent spirits—to come into our world and cause trouble. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "The pencil most likely moves because of gravity or drafts.",
      "content": "The pencil most likely moves because of gravity or drafts. Of course, there isn’t actually a demon or ghoul that’s answering your questions. Most likely, the pencil moves because it’s slightly off-balance, and gravity pulls it one way or another. That, or a draft or breeze in the room subtly rotates it toward an answer. Whatever the explanation, it’s just a game, and demons (probably) aren’t going to torment you afterward. That said, it’s more fun to think there’s some supernatural spirit there in the room with you. And who knows, maybe there is!"

      "title": "Some scientists think your own desires might influence the answer.",
      "content": "Some scientists think your own desires might influence the answer. Certain psychologists say that the game may work on what’s called “response expectancy.” Basically, you already know which answer you want, and your body subconsciously manipulates the pencil—either by breathing on it or by disturbing the air with your hands—to move the pencil toward that response.

      "title": "The game is said to have been started by a YouTube video.",
      "content": "The game is said to have been started by a YouTube video. In 2014, a video surfaced on YouTube titled “Jugando Charlie Charlie” that features 2 people holding colored pencils and playing a similar game in Spanish. [8] X Research source Soon after, the game exploded on social media and the #CharlieCharlieChallenge was born, with thousands of users across Twitter, Instagram, and other sites filming or photographing their own challenges and sharing them online. The game, or similar versions of it, has been popular in the Spanish-speaking world for decades, particularly as a schoolyard game similar to “Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board” or “Bloody Mary.” Around the same time the challenge started, a movie titled The Gallows released in theaters. Advertising for the movie used the #CharlieCharlieChallenge for a quick boost, but the movie itself has little to do with the actual trend."

      "title": "Charlie is said to be a “Mexican demon.”",
      "content": "Charlie is said to be a “Mexican demon.” Somewhere along the line, rumors started that the titular Charlie was a figure of Mexican folklore, or a demon, and that the game began in Mexico as a way to talk to this demon. Unfortunately, folklore experts and Mexican reporters say that there’s no record of a “Charlie” anywhere in Mexican folklore, so this claim is probably bunk. [9] X Research source Others say that Charlie was a child killed in a car crash, while still others think he committed suicide. The wildly different stories are probably evidence enough that none of them are true. The rumors probably began because the original video that started the trend, “Jugando Charlie Charlie,” appears to have been filmed in Mexico."
