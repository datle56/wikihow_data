    {
      "title": "Put the point of your pen on the baseline.",
      "content": "Put the point of your pen on the baseline. Most people begin their ampersand at the baseline, in order to start at the bottom tail of the symbol. On ruled or lined paper, the baseline is the bottom of the two lines that make up the writing area. You should start just a tiny bit to the right of where you want the symbol to go."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drag your pen up and to the left to create a diagonal line.",
      "content": "Drag your pen up and to the left to create a diagonal line. Bring the pen up the page to form the almost straight line in the middle of the ampersand. Try to give the line a slight curve that leans left. You can make the ampersand more round by letting your pen curve to the left and then back toward the right, if you prefer that look. [2] X Research source The ampersand will be about as tall as a capital letter, just under the baseline of the line above. For a curved tail at the bottom of an ampersand, put the pen just above the baseline and bring it down and to the left to reach the baseline. Then, bring the pen back up and to the left to form the diagonal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curve the line around to the right, circling back to cross the diagonal.",
      "content": "Curve the line around to the right, circling back to cross the diagonal. This will form a small loop at the top by bringing your pencil around to cross the original line. Your pen will cross the diagonal you made, with the intersection of the town being the bottom of the loop. The ampersand at this point will look like the top half of the number ‘8’ with a smaller top loop. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Swoop the line down and to the left in a large ‘C’ shape.",
      "content": "Swoop the line down and to the left in a large ‘C’ shape. The top loop dives down from the diagonal, curving around to the right to make the large loop at the bottom of the symbol. The bottom of this curved line should swipe against the baseline you started on. [4] X Research source Depending on how you choose to draw this ‘C’ shape, the loop can be wide and angled toward the right, close to the first downstroke and mostly vertical, or some combination of the two."
    },
    {
      "title": "Connect the bottom of the ‘C’ above the base of the diagonal line.",
      "content": "Connect the bottom of the ‘C’ above the base of the diagonal line. Intersect the diagonal line you started with by bringing the curve up to the line. Make sure you cross the diagonal in the middle of the space between the tip of the bottom tail and the place where the top loop begins, otherwise the ampersand will look lopsided and uneven. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Extend the bottom of the curved ‘C’ line slightly past the diagonal.",
      "content": "Extend the bottom of the curved ‘C’ line slightly past the diagonal. As you cross the diagonal, continue to drag your pen up, curving slightly upward if you want a curved tail. This creates the top tail of the ampersand. The end of the ‘C’ should extend just a little bit above the first upstroke, no more than the length of the bottom tail. [6] X Research source You can go further past the diagonal for a more embellished, decorative design."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross the end of the top tail for a serif look.",
      "content": "Cross the end of the top tail for a serif look. Just a single small stroke perpendicular to the tail will work for the serif. In notes or shorthand, you usually won’t need to cross the tail of the ampersand, which extends just past the original diagonal. If you are handwriting a letter or a document others will read, though, you may want to make a serif. [7] X Research source This line should be short and just visible enough to provide some definition to the end of the line. The cross of the original ‘T’ is actually the intersection between the bottom loop and the first upstroke, and not the wide serif some people draw on ampersands."

    {
      "title": "Begin with a backwards ‘3’ shape or a capital ‘E’ in cursive.",
      "content": "Begin with a backwards ‘3’ shape or a capital ‘E’ in cursive. Draw the shape from top to bottom, curving the line twice to make 2 open half-circles that intersect in the middle. You can choose whether to have a straight intersection, like in most print ‘3’s, or a loop that appears like an ‘O’ between the two halves. [8] X Research source Calligraphy ampersands are typically open at the side, based on a capital ‘E,’ rather than a lowercase one, like the standard shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a loop at the end of the bottom line.",
      "content": "Create a loop at the end of the bottom line. Right where your pencil comes up to form the end of the backwards ‘3’ shape, make a loop by curving your pencil to the left and then crossing the line the loop began with. This will make a little loop that extends just past the tip of the original shape. [9] X Research source For an added calligraphic flair, you can add an open figure-eight or infinity sign by bringing the loop up on the other side of the crossed line and curving downward to make an open loop. This stroke creates the crossed ‘T’ of the ampersand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a little loop at the top of the shape.",
      "content": "Make a little loop at the top of the shape. Off the top right tip, you can add a tiny loop by bringing the line down, around, and back up again to cross the original pencil stroke. This is a completely optional stroke, as it will give the ampersand a less formal appearance. [10] X Research source This loop is great for designs that you want to have a care-free, fun tone."

      "title": "For a filled-in look, add lines to the inner edges of the main shape.",
      "content": "For a filled-in look, add lines to the inner edges of the main shape. Connect the underside of the top curve to the intersection line between the two half circles, and vice versa for the bottom curve. The line should be slightly curved inward so that it matches the original curve. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Shade the space between the downstrokes, if you drew them.",
      "content": "Shade the space between the downstrokes, if you drew them. Use your pencil to fill in the gap by repeatedly making shading strokes. The side of a pencil is often better for shading. You should use a pen or marker to make the shading look smoother than pencil strokes. [12] X Research source"
