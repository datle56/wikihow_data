      "content": "Pick an uncooked ham, if you want to cook it yourself. Most spiral hams or honey-baked hams are pre-cooked, meaning you simply have to warm it up in the oven for 10 minutes per lb. (0.45 kg). You may be able to pick between a half-ham roast and a full-ham roast. Cooking times will vary, but preparation is very similar. Cook a 1/2 lb. (0.22 kg) of ham for each person you plan to serve. Increase the amount to ensure leftovers."

      "content": "Excise the skin with a sharp chef’s knife or boning knife. You can cut horizontally, parallel to the meat. Leave some fat on the ham’s surface for flavor. Having the right knife is essential to safe and accurate cutting. A chef's knife, with its long blade measuring between 6-14 inches, is ideal. Make sure your knife is freshly cleaned and sharpened. It can be handy to also have a boning knife. This knife will enable you to get to the pieces of meat closer to bones and joints that can't otherwise be easily detached using your fingers."
