      "title": "Hold a fidget spinner in your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Hold a fidget spinner in your dominant hand. Pinch the finger pads on both sides of your fidget spinner with your thumb and index finger. Pinch it firmly so that it doesn’t slip out of your grip. [1] X Research source The finger pads are the stationary platforms in the middle of your fidget spinner. There is one pad on each side of the spinner. The parts that spin are called prongs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spin it hard with your nondominant hand.",
      "content": "Spin it hard with your nondominant hand. Use the index finger on your opposite hand to spin one of the prongs hard. The fidget spinner will start spinning rapidly. If it isn’t spinning hard, try again. You want the fidget spinner to spin hard while performing this trick. [2] X Research source If you can’t get a good speed going, try switching your hands and use your dominant hand to spin it. For some people, using the opposite hand to spin a fidget spinner is easier."

      "title": "Spread your hands 1–1.5 feet (30–46 cm) apart.",
      "content": "Spread your hands 1–1.5 feet (30–46 cm) apart. Spread your arms apart and keep them level with one another. Turn your free hand over so that the palm is facing the spinning fidget spinner in the opposite hand. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your arm to toss the spinner to your other hand.",
      "content": "Use your arm to toss the spinner to your other hand. Lower the arm holding the fidget spinner a little and move it up quickly to toss the spinner to your opposite hand. Toss it slightly upwards so that you have time to adjust to the fidget spinner as it falls. [4] X Research source Try to lob the spinner so that you don’t have to move your hand to catch it. It will be more impressive and will keep your audience from getting distracted by your arm moving."
    },
    {
      "title": "Catch the spinner between your thumb and index finger.",
      "content": "Catch the spinner between your thumb and index finger. Spread the fingers on your free hand out as the fidget spinner travels through the air. Track it with your eyes and pinch the finger pads with your thumb and index finger to catch it as it falls. [5] X Research source For an added layer of difficulty, try throwing it back to your original hand immediately after you catch it using the same steps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spin the fidget spinner using medium speed.",
      "content": "Spin the fidget spinner using medium speed. This trick is actually harder if the fidget spinner is spinning quickly, so give it a medium spin. Flick it with your finger and level it out so that the prongs are spinning parallel to the floor. [6] X Research source You can spin the fidget spinner by holding it in your dominant hand and spinning it with your nondominant hand. You can also do the opposite if that’s more comfortable for you. You can spin the fidget spinner in the same hand that you’re holding it by using your middle finger to hold the pad on the opposite side of your thumb if that’s easier."

    {
      "title": "Take your thumb off of the spinner and balance it on your index finger.",
      "content": "Take your thumb off of the spinner and balance it on your index finger. Carefully remove your thumb from the top of the spinner. Keep your index finger as still as possible to avoid letting the spinner fall to the floor. Adjust the pad of your finger until the spinner is perfectly balanced in your hand. [7] X Research source Keep your palm facing directly upward to give yourself the best chance of balancing the spinner."

    {
      "title": "Toss it in straight up in the air by lowering and raising your arm.",
      "content": "Toss it in straight up in the air by lowering and raising your arm. Without adjusting your wrist, lower your forearm 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm). Lift it quickly to toss the fidget spinner directly in the air. Keep your eye on the fidget spinner as you’re tossing it. [8] X Research source Don’t move your wrist while you’re throwing it, or you’ll risk sending it flying at an angle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Catch it on your middle finger.",
      "content": "Catch it on your middle finger. When the fidget spinner reaches the highest point in the air, adjust the position of your hand so that you can catch it on your middle finger. Brace your middle finger by putting your ring and index finger underneath it on either side, and lower your middle finger as the fidget spinner lands to brace it and cushion the fall. [9] X Research source If you find yourself dropping the fidget spinner when it lands, try tossing it lower in the air. If you can’t get the fidget spinner to stay straight when you throw it, focus on keeping your wrist firm as you throw it in the air."

    {
      "title": "Toss it back into the air and move it back to your index finger.",
      "content": "Toss it back into the air and move it back to your index finger. Toss the fidget spinner back in the air using the same downward and upward motion. This time, switch back to your pointer finger to catch the fidget spinner. [10] X Research source If you get good at this, you can toss it and switch fingers quickly to create the illusion that you’re making the spinner bounce."

      "title": "Spin the fidget spinner in your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Spin the fidget spinner in your dominant hand. Spin the fidget spinner hard in your dominant hand. Once it’s spinning quickly, remove your thumb from the upper finger pad and balance the spinner on your index finger. [11] X Research source You have to rotate your wrist to perform this trick, so try to balance the spinner on your finger with your wrist at a 45-degree angle."

      "title": "Lower your arm with your index finger still underneath the spinner.",
      "content": "Lower your arm with your index finger still underneath the spinner. Keep the pad of your index in the center of the finger pad and lower your arm. Keep the spinner parallel to the ground as you do this. Lower the spinner 6–12 inches (15–30 cm). [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rotate your wrist around the outside of the spinner.",
      "content": "Rotate your wrist around the outside of the spinner. With your palm facing your body, rotate your wrist around the outside of the spinner in a half-circle. Move your arm slowly, with the forearm pointed directly towards the ground. Stop moving your arm once you feel some strain in your wrist or elbow. [13] X Research source You should reasonably be able to move your arm at least 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) before you feel any strain in your arm."

      "title": "Return your arm to the original position.",
      "content": "Return your arm to the original position. Once you’ve rotated your wrist on the opposite side of the spinner, bring your arm back along the same path to return it to the original position.

      "title": "Start spinning the fidget spinner in your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Start spinning the fidget spinner in your dominant hand. Spin the fidget spinner as you normally would in your dominant hand. Don’t worry about getting a fast spin going. Keep the spinner pinched between your index finger and thumb. [15] X Research source This trick is harder to pull off if you start with the spinner in your nondominant hand, since the throwing motion is kind of hard to get right."

      "content": "Lower your arm and stick your hand out 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) behind you. Slowly move your hand so that it’s sticking out behind your back. Keep it extended out while you readjust your wrist to keep the spinner parallel to the ground. Stick your free hand behind you so that it’s on the opposite side.

Keep your index finger and thumb separated and pinch them down quickly to catch the fidget spinner between the finger pads. [18] X Research source Listen to the sound of the prongs as they spin to give yourself a sense of where it is behind your back as it travels through the air."

      "title": "Get 2 fidget spinners and hold them between your thumbs and middle fingers.",
      "content": "Get 2 fidget spinners and hold them between your thumbs and middle fingers. Use 2 identical fidget spinners so that you have an easier time spinning them at the same speed and catching them. Spin them at the same time with the hands that you’re holding them in by sticking your index fingers between the prongs and flicking them. [20] X Research source If you use 2 different spinners, the weight difference between them can make them hard to catch without dropping."
