      "content": "Choose eyeshadow in a shade of brown or gold. Using an earthy color will accent the brown in your eyes, causing them to look deeper and darker. Look for a brown palette with a range of colors so you can experiment with hues that bring out the best in your eye color. For daytime wear, look for neutral, sandy or milk chocolate tones that accent your eyes without standing out too much. For nighttime wear, look for dark chocolate or shimmery gold tones that draw attention to your eyes."

      "content": "Apply the eyeshadow in layers. If you're using a single color, you can skip this step. If you have an eyeshadow palette with multiple tones, apply it in layers to make your eyes look larger and more striking. Here's how to do it: Apply a medium tone, such as light brown, all over your lid. Blend well up to the crease of your eye. Blend the darkest color, such as chocolate brown, into your crease. Apply the second lightest color, such as light sand, above your crease color and blend into the darker color. Apply the lightest color in your pallet or a creamy white to your brow bone as a highlight. Blend all four colors together neatly and clean up any mistakes."

[1] X Research source To brighten your eyes, use gold eyeliner to line the inner corners of your eyes. For a bolder nighttime look, go for black liner instead of brown. If you're feeling bold and want to really bring out the hazel eyes, apply a deep plum or purple eyeliner instead of black or brown."

      "content": "Apply chocolate-colored mascara. Your eye makeup isn't complete without an application of mascara to lengthen and define your lashes.

      "title": "Choose green eyeshadow.",
      "content": "Choose green eyeshadow. Hazel eyes look beautiful with subtle green eyeshadow, which works to accent the green in your eyes. Look for a kelly or forest green palette with a range of colors so you can experiment with hues that bring out the best in your eye color. Choose greens with warm, rather than cool, undertones. Look for golden greens instead of sea greens, since the gold pairs better with the natural gold undertones in your eyes. If you're having trouble finding just the right green, you can layer green and brown eyeshadow to create an earthy green hue that looks just right with your eye color."

Line your upper and lower lids using either an eyeliner pencil or an eyeliner brush dipped in shadow. Avoid cool-toned eyeliner with blue or gray undertones, since this could clash with your eye color. Go for warm, matte black liner. To brighten your eyes, use gold eyeliner to line the inner corners of your eyes and blend outward with the black liner using a brush. A purple eyeliner can work wonders when paired with the green eyeshadow as well."
