      "content": "Sometimes, a brief (but sincere) apology is the right course of action. According to clinical psychologist Gera Anderson, PsyD, the most important thing is to “acknowledge their feelings and any actions on your part that may have led to those feelings.” If you own up to this in a direct way, without any elaborations or excuses, the apology could come across as more sincere. For example, Anderson suggests something like, “I apologize for the comment I made about your hair. It was unnecessary and did nothing to uplift you.” Here are more examples: “This whole argument was completely my fault. I’m so sorry, my love.” “What I did was wrong, and I apologize from the bottom of my heart.” “I’m sorry for breaking my promise. Please let me make this right!” “I seriously regret the way I acted, and I’m so sorry for hurting your feelings.” “I’m sorry for my careless mistake. I love you, and I hope you can forgive me.” “I’m so sorry for what I said. It was insensitive, and I wish I could take it back.” “There are no words to describe how sorry I am. Please forgive me, love!” “You’re everything to me, and I can’t live without you. I’m so sorry!” “I made a huge mistake, and I’m so, so sorry for hurting you.” “I messed up, and I’m taking responsibility for my actions. I’m sorry, baby.” “You didn’t deserve the way I acted at all, and I’m so sorry for causing you pain.” “I love you so much, and I always will. Please forgive me for this silly mistake!” “I’m so sorry for letting you down. I'm going to do everything I can to earn back your trust.” “Seeing you upset breaks my heart. I’m so sorry, and I promise I’ll make things right.” “I’m so sorry, baby. If you give me a chance, I promise I’ll never let this happen again.\" “I was completely wrong, and I’m going to do everything I can to earn your forgiveness. I’m so sorry, baby.” “I wasn’t there for you when you needed me, and that’s entirely my fault. I’m truly sorry.” “From the bottom of my heart, I’m so sorry for what I said. It wasn’t fair, and I completely regret it.” “I’m lost without you, and I can’t stand the thought of losing you. Can you ever forgive me?” “You’re the best thing in my life, and I hate that I made you think otherwise. I’m sorry.” “You’re so important to me, and I’m going to do everything I can to earn your trust back. I’m so sorry, my love.”"

      "content": "If you want to go all-out, opt for a longer, more thorough message. This is a good idea if the two of you are dealing with a bigger issue, or if you’re apologizing for several past mistakes. He’ll definitely appreciate that you took the time to be honest and vulnerable about your feelings, and that you’re doing everything you can to earn his forgiveness. These examples work well if you’re hand-writing an apology letter, or sending a paragraph over text: “Baby, I’m so sorry for letting you down. There are no excuses for the way I acted, and I truly regret causing you pain. I’m going to do everything I can to make things right between us, no matter how long it takes.” “I’m so sorry for not making it to your art exhibit. I know how hard you worked on it, and I should have been there to support and celebrate you. From now on, I promise to request time off in advance for important events like this. Please forgive me, my love!” “What I said was not cool, and I’m so sorry for speaking so carelessly. You mean everything to me, and I absolutely hate that I made you feel differently. I apologize from the bottom of my heart, and I hope you can forgive me.” “Babe, I’m so sorry for my insensitive actions. I didn’t mean to hurt you, but I did, and I take complete responsibility for it. I love you so much, and all I want is to make it up to you and show you how much you mean to me.” “There aren’t enough words to express how sorry I am. I’ve taken you for granted recently, and it’s completely unfair. You’re the kindest, sweetest, and most loving boyfriend in the world, and I feel so lucky to be yours. I’m going to do everything in my power to prove it to you.” “I’m so sorry I haven’t been there for you enough lately. You’re the most important thing in the world to me, and my actions haven’t been showing that. From now on, I promise to prioritize our relationship and make sure that you never feel this way again. I love you so much.” “My love, I’m so sorry for everything. I feel so terrible about the way I’ve treated you, and there are no excuses for my actions. It kills me that I’ve hurt you, and I want nothing more than a chance to make it right.” “I’m so sorry for everything, baby. I’m so ashamed of the way I’ve acted the past few months, and I want you to know how much I regret it. Our relationship means everything to me, and if you forgive me, I promise to show this through my actions from now on. I love you so much.” “From the bottom of my heart, I’m so, so sorry. You’re the love of my life, and the last thing I ever want to do is cause you pain. I’m taking full responsibility for my mistakes, and I’m going to do everything I can to show you how much you mean to me.” “Baby, I truly can’t stand the fact that I’ve hurt you. I’ve been so careless with your feelings, and you don’t deserve that. You mean so much to me, and if you give me another chance, I’ll do everything in my power to make things right between us. I’m so sorry.” “Sweetheart, I want to apologize for the way I acted. It was completely unfair to you, and I’m taking this chance to own up to my actions and ask for your forgiveness. I know you might need some time to process your feelings, but whenever you’re ready to talk, I’m here.” “To the best boyfriend in the world, I’m so deeply sorry for what I did. My heart aches knowing that I’ve caused you pain, and my deepest desire is to make things right between us. I can’t imagine my life without you, and if you let me, I promise to make our relationship my number one priority from now on.” “I am so sorry for hurting you. My actions haven’t shown it lately, but I love you with all my heart, and you’re the most important person in the world to me. I want you to know I’ve been thinking about the mistakes I’ve made, and I completely understand why they were wrong. From now on, I promise to be more careful with your feelings, and I’m going to do everything I can to be the partner of your dreams.” “I’m so sorry for everything that’s happened. There are no excuses for what I did, and I need you to know how much I regret hurting you. If you give me a chance to make it right, I’m going to do everything I can to prioritize you and show you how much our love means to me. I don’t want to rush you, and I want to give you all the space you need to process, but just know that I’m thinking of you 24/7, and I love you with all my heart.”"

If you’re dealing with something small, like a short argument or an offhand comment that accidentally hurt his feelings, a lighthearted and humorous apology could defuse the tension and get you back on track. Just make sure to still be sincere, even while you’re trying to make him laugh and bring a smile back to his face. For example: “Baby, I’m so sorry I said I didn’t like your favorite song! I love you, so I’ll try to love it too. If you forgive me, I’ll let you play it at top volume in the car for the rest of the month.” “I’m sorry for making that joke earlier. It was insensitive, and I totally get why it didn’t land. I definitely don’t have a future in stand-up comedy (lol). Please forgive me!” “Some days I’m on top of my game, but yesterday was absolutely not one of them. I’m so sorry for letting you down, baby! Let me make things right.” “Babe, I feel like such a doofus. I didn’t mean that comment to sound the way it did, but I totally get why it hurt your feelings. I’m so sorry!” “Please forgive me for everything that happened yesterday. I acted like a complete clown, and not the good, funny kind. I’m so sorry!” “In the words of Justin Bieber, is it too late now to say sorry? It was so stupid of me to make that comment earlier. I wasn't thinking, and I didn’t mean it at all. I hope you’ll forgive me!” “Cue the music that plays when Puss in Boots makes his sad face in Shrek . I’m so sorry, my love! Please forgive me for my silly mistake.” “I’m so sorry for that stupid comment I made earlier. You’re the peanut butter to my jelly, and I hope you know how much you mean to me, baby!” “I’m sorry for that stupid joke I made earlier! It wasn’t funny at all. Comedy has never been my strong suit, and now you totally see why. From now on, I’ll leave the jokes to you.” “Baby, I was being salty earlier, and you didn’t deserve that. Please accept these delicious take-out fries, along with my sincerest apologies.” “One thing’s for sure: you’re the calmer and more level-headed one out of the two of us. I’m so sorry for losing my temper, babe!”"

If you want your boyfriend to truly know how sorry you are and how much you want to repair your relationship, here are some important guidelines to follow as you write your apology message : [2] X Research source Take responsibility for your actions. Own up to the specific thing you did that hurt his feelings, and don’t try to make any excuses or explain away your actions. For example, say something like, “It wasn’t cool of me to miss your band’s performance.
