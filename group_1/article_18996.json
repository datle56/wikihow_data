      "content": "Dampen a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide if the fabric is white. Hydrogen peroxide is very effective at removing stains on white fabrics like cotton, but unfortunately it can bleach or ruin colored fabrics. If you have stained white fabric, wet a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide. [1] X Research source You could also use a clean white rag to apply the peroxide. Regardless of the fabric's color, if the fabric is melted or the burn is completely black, you probably won’t be able to get the scorch marks out. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Dab the hydrogen peroxide onto the stain and let it sit for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Dab the hydrogen peroxide onto the stain and let it sit for 1 minute. Gently press the cotton ball into the fabric until the stained area is thoroughly soaked with hydrogen peroxide. Allow the hydrogen peroxide to penetrate the stain for about 60 seconds so it can get deep into the fibers. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the peroxide out thoroughly with water and repeat, if needed.",
      "content": "Rinse the peroxide out thoroughly with water and repeat, if needed. Bring the fabric to your sink and rinse the stained area out thoroughly. It’s important to remove all of the hydrogen peroxide from the material since the residue can weaken the fibers of the fabric over time. [4] X Research source If the stain persists after you rinse the fabric thoroughly, you can repeat this process as many times as you need to. If the stain is gone, launder the item as you normally would."

      "title": "Dampen a white cloth with white vinegar if the stain is on colored fabric.",
      "content": "Dampen a white cloth with white vinegar if the stain is on colored fabric. For scorch marks on colored fabric, distilled white vinegar is your best bet. Lightly wet a clean, white cloth with distilled white vinegar. [5] X Research source The white cloth allows you to see if the vinegar is actually lifting the stain off the fabric. Keep in mind that melted fabric can't be fixed and black scorch marks probably can't be removed."

    {
      "title": "Dab at the stain with the white cloth until the stain lifts off the fabric.",
      "content": "Dab at the stain with the white cloth until the stain lifts off the fabric. Gently press the vinegar-soaked cloth into the stain and lift it up again. Keep dabbing, stopping periodically to make sure the scorch color is transferring from the fabric to your white cloth. Stop once the stain is fully lifted. [6] X Research source Scrubbing may force the stain deeper into the fibers and make the stain worse, so dab gently. The cloth helps to physically lift the stain off the fabric, which makes the technique more effective than just soaking the item in vinegar. You may need to switch to a different area of the cloth if the first area gets covered in the stain."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the fabric thoroughly with water to remove the vinegar.",
      "content": "Rinse the fabric thoroughly with water to remove the vinegar. Hold the fabric under cold or lukewarm water and rinse out the white vinegar thoroughly. Once the vinegar is gone, you can pop the fabric into the washing machine and clean it as usual. [7] X Research source If these techniques don't work, try soaking the item in oxygen bleach to remove the stain."

Then, measure out the powdered bleach and add it to the warm water. [9] X Research source Use a wooden spoon to gently swirl the water and bleach together."

      "content": "Run the fabric through a normal wash cycle to remove a lingering stain. After soaking the fabric overnight, pop it into your washing machine and wash the item as you normally would. Pull out the fabric after the cycle finishes and examine it to make sure the stain is gone. [11] X Research source If the stain is gone, you can put the item in the dryer. Don’t put the fabric into the dryer until the stain is completely gone or the stain may never come out. If the stain lingers, you can repeat the soaking and washing process again."

Add about the same amount of distilled white vinegar to the bowl and stir the ingredients until the mixture becomes a thick paste. [12] X Research source For example, if your stain is 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, you’ll probably need to use about 1 tablespoon (17 grams) of salt. Regular white table salt works fine for this. Add more vinegar or salt if you need to adjust the consistency."

Pick up some of the paste on the bristles of an old toothbrush. Then, brush the paste onto the stain in a thick layer. Keep picking up and applying more paste, as needed, until the rust stain is completely covered. [13] X Research source For tough stains, gently rub the paste into the stain with the toothbrush so the mixture gets down into the fabric’s fibers. The salt and vinegar paste works on carpet, too.

After half an hour, push a little of the paste to the side and see if the paste fully removed the stain. [15] X Research source If the stain is gone, launder the item like you normally would. [16] X Research source If you walk away at any point, make sure the fabric and paste won’t be disturbed by any pets or kids."
