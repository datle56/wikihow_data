      "content": "Lie on your back with your knees bent and draw in your stomach. Breathe deeply, and imagine pulling your ribs down into your spine. Hold that for a few seconds, then release. Repeat this 8-10 times, up to 3 times a day. [1] X Research source As you get comfortable with this, make the stretch more difficult by lifting your arms over your head. Make sure to keep your back flat throughout the exercise. Once that feels easy, level the stretch up again by lifting your arms over your head and holding one or both legs up."

      "content": "Do curls to strengthen your ab muscles . Lie on your back and bend your knees, then place one hand on your stomach just below your rib cage. Contract your abs until your head and shoulders come off of the floor. Hold this for about 5 seconds, then slowly lower yourself to the floor. [2] X Research source Repeat this exercise 10 times. Because weakened ab muscles may allow the ribs to spread, strengthening your core may help correct the flare over time. Try other core-strengthening exercises like planks , squats , and leg raises ."

      "content": "Relieve pressure with overhead side stretches. If rib flare is causing you discomfort, raise one arm over your head, then bend sideways toward the opposite side. Hold this for a few seconds, breathing deeply, then repeat on the other side. [3] X Research source If the pain is more noticeable on one side, spend more time stretching away from that side. For instance, if you feel the pain on your left side, lift your left arm and bend sideways to the right. This can be especially helpful if you’re experiencing pain due to rib flare during pregnancy."

They’ll evaluate your posture and movement and give you personalized exercises and stretches to work on any particular areas that might be giving you trouble.

      "content": "Rib flare is a condition where the lower ribs protrude outward. Mild cases can be caused by poor posture or muscular imbalances and may be corrected with stretches, exercises, or physical therapy. But if the rib flare is more pronounced, it could indicate that a person’s rib cage is growing abnormally, and medical treatment may be required. [7] X Research source Rib flare can occur on one or both sides. If you have a rib flare, you may also notice other postural issues when you sit or stand, like your shoulders rounding forward and your chest caving in."

      "title": "Rib flare may lead to pain and difficulty breathing.",
      "content": "Rib flare may lead to pain and difficulty breathing. As the ribs shift outward, it can put strain on the muscles and ligaments that hold the rib cage in place, leading to pain and tenderness. Changes in the shape of the rib cage may also make it harder to take full, deep breaths. [8] X Research source These symptoms may be more obvious after periods of high activity. If your rib flare is caused by slouching, be aware that poor posture itself can have some adverse health effects—over time, it can affect your spine and joints and can lead to muscle weakness. [9] X Research source However, rib flare caused by poor posture is correctable."

In some cases, this can crowd the heart and lungs, leading to complications. [10] X Research source As pectus excavatum develops, a child might notice that they feel tired or short of breath when they’re running or exercising, and they may experience chest pain or irregular heartbeats. Pectus excavatum is usually diagnosed during childhood, and any treatments should be under the medical care of an experienced licensed physician."

      "title": "Muscle weakness or tightness",
      "content": "Muscle weakness or tightness If your core muscles are weak, your abs may not properly support your rib cage, allowing your ribs to spread and flare out. On the other hand, if you have muscles that are too tight, like in your shoulders, back, or chest, that tension can cause you to hold your posture in a way that makes your ribs look flared out. [15] X Research source If a muscular issue is causing your rib flare, stretches and exercises will likely be the most effective treatment."

This can make the chest look dented in the middle, and the ribs may flare out at the bottom. Pectus excavatum usually appears during childhood or adolescence. [19] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Mild cases of pectus excavatum may be treated with a vacuum bell device, but if the condition is severe enough to affect the heart or lungs, surgery may be required.
