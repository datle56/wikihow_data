      "title": "Decide how long you want your hair to be.",
      "content": "Decide how long you want your hair to be. The Caesar haircut is the same length all around, typically between 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) long. If you have natural or textured hair, consider going for a \"Dark Caesar\" instead, which is a little shorter. Have reference pictures of the exact style you are going for handy. They can be from a magazine, a print-out, or even on your phone."

      "content": "Put on a hair dressing cape. Some people like to wrap a folded sheet of tissue paper around their neck (like a collar) as well. You don't have to do this, but it will help keep all of those tiny, spiky bits of hair off your clothing and neck."

      "title": "Trim your hair down to a more manageable length, if needed.",
      "content": "Trim your hair down to a more manageable length, if needed. If your hair is long, cut it down until it is a few inches/centimeters long. This will make the Caesar style easier to cut because you won't have as much hair getting in the way. If your hair is already a few inches/centimeters long, you can leave it as-is."

      "content": "Insert your desired guard into your clippers. The Caesar is between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) long, so choose a guard that will give you the right length. A #1 guard will work great for very short hair, while a #4 guard will work better for longer hair. [1] X Research source If you are cutting natural or textured hair for a \"Dark Caesar,\" try a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) attachment or blade."

      "title": "Cut the hair an even length all around, going with the grain of the hair.",
      "content": "Cut the hair an even length all around, going with the grain of the hair. Begin shaving the hair at the top of the head, starting from the back and moving to the front. Do the sides next, also going back-to-front, but at a slight, downward angle. Do the back of the head last, going straight down, from top-to-bottom. [2] X Research source The \"grain\" of the hair is the direction that the hair is growing in. Your hair may not all grow in the same direction. Comb the hair every couple of strokes to get rid of any tiny cut pieces of hair. Leave a 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) strip of hair at the front of your hairline. This strip will be the bangs."

      "content": "Comb the hair forward then cut the bangs. Brush or comb all of the hair on top of the head forward so that it covers the hairline. Cut straight across the bangs, making sure that they are even. If you are doing this by hand, start from the middle of the bangs and slowly work your way to the outer edges. For a Dark Caesar, sculpt the hairline with the clippers instead. Keep your bangs slightly shorter to enhance a Caesar haircut."

      "content": "Even out the hair around the temples and sideburns, if needed. If you left your hair long, you may not need to do this. If you went for a Dark Caesar or cut your hair very short, doing this is recommended because it will give you a cleaner look. Shave away from the hairline, just as before. [4] X Research source"
