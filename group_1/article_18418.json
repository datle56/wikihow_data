      "content": "Notice when you feel your emotions getting away from you. The first step to gaining control of your emotions is to recognize when they’re out of control. Ask yourself what this feels like physically and mentally, then work to identify it in the moment. Catching your emotions when they start to spiral requires mindfulness and conscious, rational thought. Just the recognition alone will start to ground you in the present moment. You might experience physical reactions like a faster heart rate, tense muscles, and rapid or shallow breathing. [1] X Research source Mentally, you might start losing focus, feeling anxious, panicky or overwhelmed, or feel like you can’t control your thoughts. Slow down and focus on one element of your body’s reaction at a time. For example, if you’re suddenly feeling anxious, notice what that feels like in your body: “My heart is beating very fast. My palms feel sweaty.” Acknowledge and accept these feelings as they are, rather than judging them.

Cut off this spiral when you feel it happening by taking several deep breaths to calm down your mind and body. If you can, try a purposeful deep breathing technique for the most effective solution. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source To try this technique, first place one hand on your chest and the other below your rib cage. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose for a count of 4. Feel your lungs and abdomen expand as you fill them with air. Hold the breath for 1 or 2 seconds, then slowly release the breath through your mouth. Aim for 6-10 deep breaths per minute. [4] X Research source If a full 4-count is difficult for you, you can start with a 2-count and work your way up with practice. Just try to make your breaths as deep and even as you can."

      "content": "Focus on physical sensations to recenter your mind. Losing control of your emotions can often come with a loss of self and place; you get wrapped up in your emotions and lose awareness of where you are. To counter this, force yourself to notice things directly around you or physical sensations you’re experiencing. Grounding exercises use most or all of your 5 senses to help root you in the present moment. Speaking aloud is especially important, as it shifts your brain away from your emotions. Coming back into your body and focusing on the present moment can help ground you and stop your emotional spiral. For example, look around and describe aloud what you see. Listen for any sounds you can hear, and state those aloud as well. Notice the smells in the area, and see if you can taste anything on your tongue. You might say, \"The carpet and walls are different shades of blue, and the wall art is abstract with blues, reds, grays, and white. I can smell coffee brewing in the break room, as well as the smell of old file folders.\" Take notice of what it feels like to be sitting in your chair or holding your coffee mug. Notice how your clothes feel, if any muscles are sore or tense. You can focus on something as simple as your hands being in your lap. Brew a cup of hot tea and focus on the sensation of drinking it in this moment. How does the cup feel? How does it smell? How does it taste? Describe it aloud to yourself. Describe a painting aloud, listing as many details as possible. Carry an essential oil blend to smell when you feel stressed. Let the scent overtake you, and speak aloud about what you like about the scent."

Unclench your hands, relax your shoulders, and let the tension out of your legs. Roll your neck and shake out your fingers. Releasing physical tension can go a long way towards steadying your mind. [5] X Research source If you’re having trouble relaxing your body, try a method like progressive muscle relaxation, or PMR. You’ll systematically tense and release your muscles in groups, starting at your toes and working upwards. Falling back on a set method like this can be useful when you can’t focus on finding specific areas of tension."

Close your eyes and imagine it, creating as many details as you can, while breathing slowly and evenly. Let out the tension in your body and let the calmness of your safe place quiet your thoughts and emotions. [6] X Research source Your safe place could be a beach, a spa, a temple, or your bedroom—any place where you feel safe and relaxed. Think about the sounds you hear there, the things you’ll see, and even the smells and textures. If you can’t close your eyes or completely visualize your safe place, try to picture it quickly. Remind yourself of that calm, centered feeling and take a couple deep, quiet breaths. If you’re experiencing a negative emotion while you visualize, imagine it as a physical object that you can remove from your safe place. For example, your stress could be a pebble that you can throw away, imagining your stress leaving your body as you do so."

      "content": "Identify what your actual emotions are. Learning to pinpoint and name your emotions can give you control over them when you feel like they’re running wild. Naming your emotions is actually a skill you may not have learned. Take a few deep breaths, then force yourself to look straight at the things you’re feeling, even if it’s painful. Then, ask yourself what the source of that emotion is, and if it’s covering up for something else that you’re afraid to confront. For example, ask yourself what about taking a major exam is making you so stressed. It might have a big influence on your future, or you feel like you have to do well to impress your family. At the root of your nerves might be a fear that your family’s love depends on your success. Remember that no emotion is “wrong.” Telling yourself not to feel something is a way of hurting yourself even more. Instead, notice the emotion without passing judgment. Accept that the emotion is natural and let yourself feel it. Imagine your emotion as a character who holds that emotion. Then, trace the emotion back to its root cause. Identifying and naming the true feelings behind your emotional turmoil gives you control over them. Now that you can identify the emotion for what it is, you know that it’s just a feeling, and that it doesn’t have to have any real power over you."

They will bubble up and resurface later, so it's important that you let yourself feel your emotions. However, you don't have to ruminate on them. Instead, set aside a block of time, such as 15-30 minutes to get out your emotion. For example, you might call a friend to vent or write out your thoughts in a journal. If you're feeling upset, you might take a moment alone to cry. If you feel the emotion in your body, such as with anger, stress, or envy, you might need to do something physical to work it out. You might go for a short walk or do yoga poses."

This can lead to “ruminating,” a “broken record” thought loop where you obsess about the negative thought or feeling in an unproductive, usually vague, way. Break this cycle by focusing on any specifics of the situation that you can address. [7] X Research source Instead of ruminating about trouble at work by thinking, “Why am I so bad at my job?”, make a list of things that you can address. You might talk with your boss about how to increase your productivity, ask someone more experienced for help, or start trying different stress-management techniques. Work to accept the things that your own efforts can’t address. Letting go of the idea that you need to “fix” or “control” every element of a situation is a way to liberate yourself from stress and emotional turmoil. [8] X Research source"

When you’re ready to decide on a course of action, make sure it’s a conscious choice, not a reaction to another, competing emotion. Think about how you want to resolve this situation and why. What values of yours does this response represent? Does it make sense rationally, too? Think about what your moral principles are. What do you want the outcome of this situation to be? What is the decision you'd be most proud of? Then, ask yourself which course of action is the most likely to result in the outcome you want. For example, if someone insults you, you could do nothing, respond aggressively, or firmly tell them to stop. Ask yourself how you want this situation to end, and how to get there without compromising the things you believe in."

You may feel defensive if you feel stressed, frustrated, or personally attacked. However, it's important to listen to the opinions of others, especially if they're given constructively, without taking them personally. You can cope with defensiveness by reducing the threat in the situation and remaining curious about the thoughts of others. Here are signs of defensiveness: [9] X Research source Refusing to listen to negative feedback Making excuses for failures Passing blame Crossing your arms to shut people out Smiling and nodding to get the person to stop talking Listing reasons why you're right without talking to others Ignoring feedback from others Using sarcasm or criticism of others to deflect from criticism about yourself"

Before the next family gathering, you might engage in relaxing self care before you go, then plan how you will take breaks from your sister throughout the day. You might make plans with another relative to go do something, or you might plan to leave and pick up a dish. Limit how much time you spend with her, and plan a way to leave early, if necessary."

[10] X Research source When you feel ready to address them, first calmly tell them what you’re feeling. Say something like, “I get frustrated when I feel like you’re just trying to get a rise out of me.” Then, address the issue at hand and ask them for their thoughts on it, then listen and respond to what they’re saying.

Take a moment and think about what would happen if you tried the opposite of your usual reaction. How would the outcome change? If it would become positive or productive, try that new method instead of your old one. For example, you might get bothered when your spouse regularly doesn't do the dishes. Instead of starting an argument, challenge yourself to do the dishes yourself, then politely ask your spouse if they could help. If this sounds difficult, start is by changing one small thing at a time. Instead of yelling at your spouse, tell them how you feel in a more neutral voice. If this is still too hard, walk away and take a 5 minute break. Eventually, you can work your way towards changing your reaction for good. [12] X Research source"
