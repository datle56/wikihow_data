      "title": "Security Sticker & Labels",
      "content": "Security Sticker & Labels One of the easiest ways to see if a pair of UGG slippers is genuine is to check for a security sticker. All genuine UGG products made after 2013 come with either a security sticker or a reflective sewn-in label featuring a QR code and holographic sun image that changes from black to white when rotated. [1] X Research source When you scan the QR code with your smartphone, it takes you to a page on the official UGG website that verifies the product is genuine. [2] X Research source This is not available on fake products. A sewn-in security label is inside the left slipper. A security sticker appears on the sole of the left slipper if there’s no sewn-in label. Infant and toddler slippers have an insert with a security sticker inside the box. The security label also features different colors in the serial number and QR code. Some merchandise from Fall 2014 was produced without the holographic sun but still included the security label."

      "title": "“Made in” Label",
      "content": "“Made in” Label Check the “Made in” label inside the slipper or the country of origin. While many believe the popular UGG brand’s products are made in Australia or New Zealand, most are manufactured in China. Products claiming to be made in Australia are not from the popular UGG brand. [3] X Research source Authentic UGG brand slippers are also made in Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic."

    {
      "title": "Sheepskin Lining",
      "content": "Sheepskin Lining Look for authentic sheepskin lining. It can be difficult to tell the difference between faux and real fur , but counterfeit UGGs are often lined with low-quality faux fur made of synthetic fibers. This faux fur is attached to a backing fabric and not directly to the leather. It also tends to break off if you rub it between your fingers. Real sheepskin feels thick, fluffy, and soft. [4] X Research source Real sheepskin isn’t machine washable, so if the slippers are machine washable, they probably aren’t real sheepskin. Real sheepskin is more densely packed than fake with a soft finish, while synthetic materials will have a slightly prickly or “plastic” feel when you rub it between your fingers. Real sheepskin and wool often have no scent or a light lanolin smell when new. Fake products smell strongly of plastic or other synthetic materials. Genuine UGGs are also made with sheepskin attached to the fleece. If there is a gap or additional layer between the leather and the fleece, the slipper is a fake."

      "title": "Soles & Patterning",
      "content": "Soles & Patterning Authentic UGGs have sturdy, flexible soles with logos and a sun pattern, while cheap counterfeits have stiff soles with generic patterning. Real UGG brand slippers have comfortable cushioning. Fakes may have thinner soles with less cushioning. [5] X Research source While real UGGs can have some slight color variations on the side of the sole, fakes may also have an etched line. Real UGG slippers feature a tread pattern that mimics the sun logo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seams & Stitching",
      "content": "Seams & Stitching Check for quality stitch patterns that are straight, uniform, and don’t have any fraying. Low-quality fakes have crooked seams and uneven stitches. The fabric that covers the join between the upper and sole is smooth around the shoe on real UGGs, but fakes may have bumps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Packaging",
      "content": "Packaging Official UGG packaging is very distinct, with the UGG and Sun logos. Products always come in a box, never a bag. The box’s label features an accurate image of the product inside. [6] X Research source A QR code that links to an authenticity statement appears on a label on the outside of the box."
    },
    {
      "title": "Logos",
      "content": "Logos The logos on the packaging, labels, and embossed on the slipper have thin, well-defined letters that overlap slightly, with the middle “G” appearing larger and standing out from the other letters. Compare the suspected fake with the images of the genuine product on the official UGG website to get a good idea of how the real logos look. [7] X Research source Check the logo on your packaging for printing errors or misspellings that signal a counterfeit. As of 2016, UGG no longer includes AUSTRALIA in the logo on the product or packaging. If the product comes with a hanging tag with a logo or advertising “genuine sheepskin,” it’s not an authentic UGG brand slipper. UGG doesn’t use any hanging tags."

    {
      "title": "Pricing",
      "content": "Pricing Because of the quality materials and careful craftsmanship used to create authentic UGG brand products, they cost more than low-quality fakes. While retailers may offer sales on real UGGs, the pricing usually ranges from $95-$130, depending on the style. If you see prices that are significantly lower, they may be fakes."

      "title": "UGG Tasman Slipper",
      "content": "UGG Tasman Slipper The UGG Tasman is a clog-style slipper that’s one of the most popular from the manufacturer. It has a suede sheepskin upper, a foam footbed, and a Sugarcane or Treadlite EVA outsole that’s about ½ inch (1.25 cm) thick. Soft wool lines the insole and inside of the slipper, and a distinctive braid design rings the opening. The UGG logo is heat-embossed on the outside of each slipper."

      "title": "UGG Tazz",
      "content": "UGG Tazz The Tazz style slipper is a platform version of the Tasman made with the same genuine sheepskin and soft wool lining. It has a slightly lower back that also features a loop. The platform height is about 1¾ inch (4.44 cm) thick with a Sugarcane or Treadlite EVA outsole. The UGG logo is heat-embossed on the outside of each slipper."

      "title": "UGG Scuffette II Slipper",
      "content": "UGG Scuffette II Slipper The Scuffette II Slipper is a soft suede house slipper with a sheepskin insole and lining. Unlike the Tasman and Tazz, the outsole is molded rubber that’s about ¼ inch (0.63 cm) thick. An UGG logo is embossed on the outer side of each slipper."

    {
      "title": "UGG Disquette Slipper",
      "content": "UGG Disquette Slipper The Disquette slipper has a platform heel like the Tazz with a Sugarcane or Treadlite EVA outsole. This slipper is a slide style that doesn’t have a back. The platform measures about 1 inch (2.5) thick. The UGG logo is heat-embossed on the outside of each slipper."

      "content": "Review the Contact Us area for legitimate contact information. A contact page without a specific email address or working phone number is a red flag. If they only have a contact form without a phone number or email address, they’re less likely to be responsive to customers having issues, which signals they aren’t really concerned about customer service. [9] X Research source Legitimate retail websites have multiple ways to contact their customer service department. If there is a phone number listed, call it to see if anyone answers. Sometimes fraudulent websites list a phone number that is out of service or not answered."

      "title": "Scan the site for misspellings and bad images.",
      "content": "Scan the site for misspellings and bad images. Websites selling counterfeit products often look less professional than reputable digital storefronts. Scan the product descriptions for bad grammar or misspellings. Look for images that are high-quality and well-lighted. Blurry, low-res images indicate a website is not an official UGG retailer. However, counterfeit sites often use images from the official UGG website, so good images aren’t always a sign of authenticity."
