      "content": "Trust your partner. Some health professionals believe sexual performance anxiety may have some roots in social anxiety. All of the thoughts typically associated with sexual performance anxiety, whether of feeling self-conscious or feeling un-masculine/feminine, boil down to a fear of other people's judgment. Though it will take time and effort, counseling for couples or individual counseling may help you let go of your fears about yourself and allow you to trust your partner."

      "content": "Remind yourself of who you are. One of the frequent causes of sexual performance anxiety is feeling guilty or otherwise bad about the things that pop up in sexual fantasies. The fear is that these kinks will come to define the person, and that he or she will end up acting them out in reality. Experts agree that fantasizing about a particular act or even a particular person does not necessarily mean that there is any real desire to actually act it out in real life. [6] X Research source Be open and honest with your partner about what you like and don't like, and ask your partner to do the same. [7] X Research source It's okay to have sexual fantasies and desires. You and your partner can act out your fantasies safely, through role playing or other strategies for couples.

      "content": "Practice deep breathing beforehand. Take a moment to focus on your breathing before initiating sex. Use that time to clear your head of any thoughts that might distract you or cause you additional anxiety. If you find it impossible to let go of the stresses from that day, try having sex on a less-stressful day instead. Trying and failing when you can't clear your mind will only cause further stress and anxiety.

Sex therapists will often advise a couple to abstain from intercourse until the affected partner can overcome his or her anxiety associated with performance.

Constant mental images of previous failures. Shortness of breath and an inability to control your bodily sensations. Inability in men to experience an erection as a result of such thoughts and feelings, and thus withdrawal from sexual activity (erectile dysfunction). Lack of proper lubrication (among women). Constant, excessive worry about how your will perform. A constant cycle associated with not performing that further debilitates the performance."

While anxiety about sexual performance can certainly be a factor in failure to perform or an inability to achieve orgasm, there could be underlying problems causing these problems. Hormone imbalances could cause problems. If your body is not producing adequate levels of hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone, you may experience a decreased sex drive and an inability to enjoy sex. This can become especially problematic in older individuals. Talk to your doctor about having your hormone levels tested. Reduced blood flow can lead to reduced sexual pleasure and an inability to become aroused.
