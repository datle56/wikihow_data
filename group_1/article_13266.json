Genetics is believed to play a role in both autism and schizoid PD, so if one runs in the family, the individual is more likely to have it. Cold, unresponsive, or neglectful parents increase the risk of schizoid personality, [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source as well as other early-life stressors like severe poverty or frequent illness. [5] X Research source Autism begins in utero [6] X Research source and is never caused by bad parenting. Don't automatically assume that trauma means the person has schizoid PD. Autistic children are at higher risk of abuse and PTSD, at home, in school, and in some compliance-based therapies . Not all people with schizoid PD have bad parents. While bad parenting increases the chances, perfectly good parents can end up with a child with schizoid PD."

      "title": "Consider how much the person is interested in social interactions.",
      "content": "Consider how much the person is interested in social interactions. People with schizoid PD tend to appear aloof because socializing doesn't interest them much. Autistic people often care deeply, but show it differently, and may withdraw because it is overwhelming. Some autistic people want close relationships, but do not know how to obtain them. People with schizoid PD have little or no desire to find love and marry.

      "content": "Consider how the person reacts when praised or criticized. While autistic people may have unique body language , they will almost always react. People with schizoid personality disorder will typically appear indifferent. Some autistic people seem \"lost in their own world\" to onlookers. They see and hear everything, but may not show a visible response. Take into account how much the person reacts to the world in general."

      "title": "Consider whether and how much the person enjoys close relationships.",
      "content": "Consider whether and how much the person enjoys close relationships. Most autistic people have or want close relationships with a few loved ones, such as family or friends. People with schizoid PD tend to be more indifferent and are unlikely to have bonds with people who aren't first-degree relatives. An autistic person may not pick up on subtle social cues like body language. A person who has schizoid personality disorder might over-interpret these things, often in a suspicious way.

      "title": "Think about whether the person learns and grows from social experiences.",
      "content": "Think about whether the person learns and grows from social experiences. Social differences in schizoid PD are caused mainly by a lack of interest, while in autism, they are caused by confusion and lack of skills. An autistic person will learn from new experiences (especially with coaching), thus improving their social skills. Someone with schizoid PD is not interested in learning more social skills. [10] X Research source Personal interview with a psychologist. Not all learning is constructive. For example, an autistic person might learn to suppress their natural stimming, which can lead to emotional problems."

      "title": "Consider the person's developmental timeline.",
      "content": "Consider the person's developmental timeline. Autistic children develop at their own pace, meeting milestones more slowly, more quickly, or out of order. Developmental delay will be present in some or all areas. Unless another disability is present, people with schizoid traits will follow the expected timeline. Look at later milestones as well as early childhood: when did the person learn to swim, ride a bike, cook, do laundry, drive?"

      "title": "Examine the person's interests.",
      "content": "Examine the person's interests. Someone with schizoid PD shows little interest in hobbies and other activities, having no or very few activities they enjoy. Autistic people typically have a few \"special interests,\" which are narrow, intense, and extremely passionate. [11] X Expert Source George Sachs, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. A healthy autistic person can get very excited about their interests while someone with schizoid PD doesn't get emotional. Try striking up a conversation about the person's favorite subject. If they feel comfortable around you, an autistic person will love talking about their passions. Someone with schizoid PD will not be so enthusiastic. Circumstances can affect autistic people's special interests. Illnesses such as depression, or simply being in between interests, may leave them without passion. Compliance-based therapies, bullying, or negative feedback may make an autistic person afraid to share their interests with others. This can make identification harder."

      "title": "Think about whether they show strong emotions.",
      "content": "Think about whether they show strong emotions. People with schizoid PD don't really show emotion, even in situations where most people would get emotional. They tend to seem indifferent. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For autistic people, this varies, especially based on whether they have alexithymia. While some autistic people tend not to get emotional easily, others get emotional in ways others don't understand, and many are highly emotional. Autistic people may have breakdowns when they get overwhelmed by sensory or emotional triggers. A \"meltdown\" happens with an out-of-control emotional display because the person can't cope. A \"shutdown\" causes the person to completely withdraw and struggle to process sensory input. This is not typical in people with schizoid PD."

      "content": "Notice motivation and goals. People with schizoid PD tend not to be strongly motivated. Autistic people vary in motivation levels (just like neurotypicals do) and tend to be highly motivated about things that relate to their interests. [13] X Research source People with schizoid PD usually prefer daydreaming over acting, which may translate to not getting much done. At work, someone with schizoid PD may not care how management perceives them or try hard to get promoted."
