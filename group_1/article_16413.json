      "content": "Use Pedialyte or a homemade solution if the squirrel is dehydrated. Water will work for rehydration, but a pediatric electrolyte solution (like Pedialyte is a better choice. Do not use a sports drink like Gatorade. [1] X Research source You can also make your own rehydration solution by stirring together 1 tsp (5 mg) of salt, 1 tbsp (15 mg) of sugar, and 1 qt (1 l) of warm water. Store this mixture in the refrigerator. Signs a squirrel is dehydrated : If, while gently pinching the baby squirrel’s skin, it remains raised (or “tented”) for more than 1 second, the squirrel is likely dehydrated. Signs a squirrel is not dehydrated : If, while gently pinching the baby squirrel’s skin, it falls quickly, the squirrel most likely isn’t dehydrated.

      "content": "Feed puppy milk replacer to baby squirrels under 6 weeks old. If the baby squirrel doesn’t require rehydration, you can move straight to providing this formula. Or, once you’ve completed the process of rehydrating the squirrel, you’ll also shift to this formula. Make the following mixture: [3] X Research source Combine 8 oz (230 g) of powdered puppy milk replacer , 16 oz (470 mL) of distilled water, and 1/8 teaspoon (2-3 g) acidophilus or plain, full-fat yogurt per 1/4 cup (59 mL) formula. Stir the mixture together thoroughly and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

      "content": "Warm a small amount of liquid and fill a 2 cc (2 ml) oral syringe . Draw up enough Pedialyte, water, homemade rehydrator, or formula to fill a 2 cc (or 2 ml—they’re equivalent) oral syringe (medicine dropper). Dispense it into a small, microwave-safe bowl, and heat it for 5 seconds. Draw it back into the dropper and squeeze a drop on your wrist to test the temperature. If the solution feels cold to your skin, reheat it in the bowl for 5 more seconds. [4] X Research source If it is uncomfortably warm on your skin, wait until it is comfortably warm before feeding it to the squirrel."

      "title": "Draw the appropriate amount of liquid into the dropper, based on age.",
      "content": "Draw the appropriate amount of liquid into the dropper, based on age. Once your rehydration solution or milk replacer formula is mixed and warmed, use the measurement lines on the oral syringe to get the right amount for a feeding. First and foremost, follow the recommendations of the wildlife rehabilitator that you’ve contacted. The general guidelines are as follows: [5] X Research source Under 2 weeks old : Tiny, pink-skinned, eyes-closed babies under 2 weeks of age should get 0.5 to 1 cc (ml) every 2 hours. 2 to 6 weeks old : Open-eyed, fully-furred babies from 2-6 weeks of age should get 2-6 cc (ml) every 3-4 hours. Over 6 weeks old : From about 6 weeks of age until the baby is weaned, feed them 6-8 cc (ml) every 4-5 hours. Baby squirrels under 5 weeks old can go 6 hours at night without feeding, while squirrels that are 5-7 weeks old can go up to 8 hours at night without feeding."

      "title": "Hold the squirrel upright and point the dropper at the roof of its mouth.",
      "content": "Hold the squirrel upright and point the dropper at the roof of its mouth. It’s very easy for tiny, hairless, pink newborns to aspirate the feeding liquid, which can lead to pneumonia and death. Keeping the squirrel upright will make aspiration less likely. [6] X Research source Pick up the squirrel very gently and cradle it just enough to keep it secure. You can use your thumb to help keep the squirrel’s head tilted slightly upward but do so gently. Wash your hands before and after handling the squirrel. Even better, wear latex or thin leather gloves."

      "title": "Dispense the feeding liquid slowly to prevent aspiration or choking.",
      "content": "Dispense the feeding liquid slowly to prevent aspiration or choking. For a hairless, pink baby, place just one drop at a time on its lips. If the baby has fur and its eyes are open, you can place the dropper just past its lips and squeeze 3-4 drops at a time. At a one-drop-at-a-time pace, it may take up to an hour to complete a feeding—so be prepared! [7] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source If the liquid is running out of the squirrel’s mouth or especially its nose, you’re feeding it much too rapidly. Blot off the excess liquid and wait about 1 minute before resuming. If the wildlife rehabilitator has alternate feeding instructions, follow them."

      "title": "Stimulate a newborn squirrel’s bowels after each feeding.",
      "content": "Stimulate a newborn squirrel’s bowels after each feeding. If the squirrel’s eyes are still closed, it will need external stimulation—which is provided in the wild by its mother—to urinate and defecate. After each feeding, gently rub the newborn’s genital and anal area with a cotton ball or cotton swab dipped in warm water until it urinates or defecates. Wipe away the tiny mess with a damp cloth. [8] X Research source Once the squirrel’s eyes are open, it should urinate and defecate without stimulation."

Using gloves, gently place the squirrel in the container. Set the other half of the container (without the nest) on top of a heating pad set to low or medium so the temperature reaches 99 °F (37 °C).

      "title": "Place a feeding block into the squirrel’s enclosure after dropper feedings.",
      "content": "Place a feeding block into the squirrel’s enclosure after dropper feedings. Many wildlife rehabilitators usually recommend packaged squirrel feeding blocks . Don’t worry if the squirrel shows no interest in the feeding block at first. Before long, it will start nibbling on it. Keep feeding the squirrel formula every 4 hours until it shows no interest; it’ll likely lose interest in formula and only want solid food by 7-10 weeks of age. [11] X Research source When you first add the feeding block, also keep a shallow dish of fresh water in the enclosure and replace it at least once daily."

      "title": "Introduce veggies and other healthy foods one at a time.",
      "content": "Introduce veggies and other healthy foods one at a time. After the squirrel has taken to the feeding blocks, start adding small, ripped-up pieces of broccoli, kale, spring mix, or other dark greens. Start with one veggie at a time (kale, for instance), and wait 2-3 days before trying another one. After that, you can offer seeds, small nuts, and cut-up pieces of fruit one at a time. [12] X Research source It’s best to leave the food in the shelter or nest because hand feeding a squirrel can be difficult. Veggies and other foods should supplement the feeding blocks, not replace them. When giving veggies to the squirrel, be sure to add a few pieces at a time. Providing new foods one at a time makes it easier to determine if the squirrel has a bad response to a particular food. Diarrhea is usually the most obvious sign of this."

This is a very challenging transition, however, and you should let an expert handle the process. Contact the rehabilitator for guidance on transferring the squirrel to their care.
