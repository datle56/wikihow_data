      "content": "The most obvious solution, yet one of the best, is to pour yourself a tall glass of water and get to drinking. One of the reasons you feel so headachy, nauseous, and light-headed is because alcohol causes your body to lose lots of water, causing dehydration. Drinking water throughout the day can help you to rehydrate and recover the water you’ve lost. [1] X Expert Source Murphy Perng Certified Wine Consultant Expert Interview. 15 March 2019. This can dramatically improve your headache. While we’ve probably caught you the day after, anytime you can do this before you fall asleep on a night of drinking, you can lessen your hangover symptoms the next day."

These drinks contain electrolytes, which are important for you to replace when you’re dehydrated. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Although it’s tempting to try to wake yourself up with some caffeine, it's better to avoid the caffeinated sports drinks, as they can further dehydrate you and even make the hangover worse. Vitamin packets — or oral rehydration packets — are another great thing to toss into some water for a pick me up."

      "content": "This might sound a little out there, but one study found that people who drank fruit juice had less severe thirst and headache symptoms. This could be because fruit juices are generally high in fructose, which is a sugar that affects your energy and your liver function. Your liver is in charge of processing the alcohol you drank, so juice might improve how quickly your body metabolizes alcohol. Tomato juice, orange juice, and coconut water are all good choices, as are green grape juice and pear juice. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Ginger tea is an excellent way to combat nausea and vomiting. It’s often used by pregnant women when they’re dealing with morning sickness. [4] X Research source One option is to boil several slices of fresh, peeled ginger root in about four cups of water for 5-10 min, then add the juice of one orange, half a lemon, and a half cup of honey. This yummy concoction can provide quick relief from your hangover by stabilizing your blood sugar levels. While it might be tempting to swap in ginger ale over ginger tea, fizzy drinks are a bit iffy for your hangover. Because they’re bubbly, they can increase the pressure you’ll be feeling on your stomach."

      "content": "Ever notice how often you have to pee when you drink? It turns out that when you pee so much, you lose more potassium than normal. Those lowered potassium levels can contribute to tiredness, nausea, and weak limbs, all symptoms you might be feeling right now. Luckily, you probably have some cheap ways to tackle this already waiting in your kitchen. Bananas and kiwi fruits, as well as baked potatoes, leafy greens, mushrooms, and dried apricots are all good potassium sources.

The kind of sleep you get right after drinking may involve less of the REM (rapid eye movement) stage — the part of sleep that actually makes you feel rested. So, it’s natural that your body and brain want a little more rest. In the end, the most surefire cure for your hangover is time, so if you can kill a little bit of that time sleeping — all the better. Make sure that the room is dim or dark: the light can make you feel worse. [11] X Expert Source Murphy Perng Certified Wine Consultant Expert Interview. 15 March 2019."

A multivitamin tablet is a great way to restore those nutrients to your body. Be careful to avoid effervescent tablets, as they might make your nausea worse.
