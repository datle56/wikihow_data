If you want to turn your Windows 10 computer into a wireless hotspot, you'll need to be connected to your network using an Ethernet cable. If you're connected to your network via Wi-Fi, you won't be able to create a wireless hotspot and stay connected to the network with the same adapter. If you have two wireless adapters installed, you can connect to the network with one and create the hotspot with the other. You cannot use one to do both. You will need to have a wireless adapter installed to enable virtual Wi-Fi. Look for a connection labeled \"Wi-Fi.\" This indicates that you have a wireless adapter installed. If you don't have one, you'll need to install one before you can create a wireless hotspot with your computer. You can use a USB adapter or install a network card."
