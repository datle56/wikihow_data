      "content": "Exercise regularly. Not only does regular exercise reduce the likelihood of heart disease and other illnesses, but it has also been shown to treat both depression and anxiety. There are various explanations for why this occurs. First, exercise releases endorphins, a feel-good chemical in the brain that improves mood. It also reduces certain immune system chemicals that cause depression and raises the body temperature, which promotes relaxation. [1] X Research source Regular exercise also helps you get in shape and improve your overall appearance, which for many people, is enough to rid them of their self-doubt. Endorphins help to inhibit your body’s stress response, which lowers your risk for feeling anxious or developing symptoms of panic throughout the day.

Similar to a spring that has to be pressed down harder and harder, your emotions are held down even more by the alcohol.

You may not feel like yourself some time. However, if you continue to feel symptoms of grief long after losing your loved one, you should contact a therapist or mental health professional. Write out what happened and how it made you feel. There are many feelings involved with traumatic events that often need to be expressed. Many times, traumatic events will get compartmentalized and any feelings associated with the event will get pushed aside.
