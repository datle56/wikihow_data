      "content": "Blot an ink spill as quickly as possible. Step one in any ink removal process is blotting. Remove any ink that has not dried as quickly as possible by blotting it away with water-moistened paper towel. Avoid rubbing an ink spill before heavily blotting the area. Repeat the wet-paper-towel-blotting-method several times until no more ink is transferring to the paper towel."

      "title": "Apply rubbing alcohol or hairspray.",
      "content": "Apply rubbing alcohol or hairspray. Rubbing alcohol is one of the best cleaning agents there are. If you already have some hairspray laying around, it will likely do the job just as well. It can be used on laminate, wood, metal, plastic and glass, as well as most other common materials. Fully moisten a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol or hairspray. Squeeze the excess liquid out of the ball. Simply rub an ink stain with small circular motions until it disappears. The cotton should soak it up. Cheap hairspray is just as good as any. It's usually the case that the cheaper the hairspray is, the higher the alcohol content."

      "content": "Repeat the process with a fresh cotton ball, if necessary. Apply firm pressure to the stain while rubbing. However, don't scrub too hard, as you'll risk damaging the finish of the table or desk you're cleaning. Remove ink from metal by applying copious amounts of rubbing alcohol directly to the metal surface of the table. Use a clean cloth to rub the stain away."

      "title": "Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous spot.",
      "content": "Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous spot. Whichever route you go, choose a small, innocuous area to test the method. You don't need to test the ink-removal aspect of the method. Just test the cleaning method to ensure that you will not damage or otherwise mark the surface you're hoping to clean. Don't rub too aggressively, as materials like cotton and baking soda have some abrasion potential and may damage some surfaces. Remember to clean the area from which you remove a stain with a water-dampened cloth or paper towel."

      "title": "Try baking soda.",
      "content": "Try baking soda. Mix baking soda with water until you have enough spreadable paste to cover the ink-stained desk or table. Baking soda can be used on almost anything, including laminate, metal, plastic, wood, and glass. Spread the paste thickly over the stain and rub it in with your fingertips or a toothbrush. Use a clean, damp cloth to gently scrub the are to remove the paste. Don't scrub too aggressively, as this may scratch the surface of various materials. Repeat the steps if necessary. Wipe the area clean with a cotton ball moistened with rubbing alcohol."

    {
      "title": "Use toothpaste.",
      "content": "Use toothpaste. Toothpaste with baking soda in it works especially well. Coat the area healthily and gently smooth the toothpaste over the surface of the stained area. Wipe the toothpaste away with a water-dampened cloth. Wipe gently, so as not to scratch softer surfaces. If any toothpaste remains, wipe it away with a cotton ball moistened with rubbing alcohol. If the table or desk is wood, allow the paste to set for 10-15 minutes. For other surfaces, a shorter period of time will likely suffice."

      "content": "Apply acetone or nail polish remover. The cleaning strength of acetone is so well known it's used to remove nail polish! It will likely readily remove your ink stain as well. [1] X Research source Place a cotton ball on the opening of a bottle of nail polish remover and shake gently to allow the cotton ball to absorb the liquid. Gently rub the ink stain until the ink is lifted. Take extra care when using acetone or nail polish remover. Wear gloves and remember to test the surface for colorfastness. Acetone can be used to clean metal, glass, plastic, and even leather."

      "title": "Opt for spray-on insect repellent or sunscreen.",
      "content": "Opt for spray-on insect repellent or sunscreen. Spray-on applications designed for your skin can also be used to effectively remove ink by seeping beneath the stain itself. [2] X Research source These will work especially well on plastic surfaces. Be sure to test an inconspicuous area, as the varied strength of these products can sometimes damage the surface of a table or desk. Spray a stain until it is fully saturated with the repellent or sunscreen. If the stain is particularly small, apply the spray to a cotton ball and softly rub the stain. Wipe the spray away with a clean, soft cloth. Repeat the steps if the stain does not wipe away too."

      "content": "Remove a longstanding ink stain from wood with mayonnaise. Removing an ink stain that's been around a while, particularly from a wooden surface, will require a heavy-hitting cleaning product. Bring in the mayo. Slater a thick layer of mayo onto the stain and let it set overnight. Wipe the mayo away with a wet paper towel and rinse the wood with another sheet of water-dampened towel. Buff the wood's surface with a cloth and wood polish to go the extra mile."
