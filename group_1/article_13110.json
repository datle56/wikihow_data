      "title": "Determine the best underwear for you.",
      "content": "Determine the best underwear for you. These days, it is easy to find a pair of reusable adult diapers that resemble your regular underwear. The underwear are so discrete that your roommates will be unable to detect them and won't learn of your issue with incontinence. [1] X Research source Do your research before making the purchase. While manufacturers may rate their pull-on underwear as fully absorbent, there are many reviewers who would disagree. Things to consider are the fit, absorbency and style. You may want to purchase a few different pairs prior to leaving so that you can determine what works and what doesn’t ahead of time."

      "title": "Consider incontinence pads or boosters.",
      "content": "Consider incontinence pads or boosters. If you don’t like the idea of relying solely on underwear to keep you protected, consider purchasing incontinence pads or boosters. Boosters aren't typically used on their own; however, they can be used with a disposable brief or pull-up for maximum absorbency. There are boosters available that make it possible for you to get through the day without changing them. If you have a long day of classes or are tailgating at a football game, it may be worth looking into this option! If your incontinence issues are only minor, pads may be your best bet, as they can be worn with different types of underwear including regular (snug fitting) or specialty made underwear."

      "content": "Purchase an extra set of sheets and other bedding. It’s a good idea to have extra sets of sheets on hand for any bedwetting incidents. You’ll want to be able to change your sheets as many times as necessary without having to run down to the laundry room each time. Additionally, there are other great products available, which are waterproof and can protect your mattress. Today you won't have a difficult time finding waterproof products, which keep both you and your mattress dry. The goal is to reduce damage and excessive laundry. [2] X Research source A waterproof mattress pad should be on your must buy list. With the ability to hold up to 6 cups of fluid, pads provide absorbency as well as moisture protection. [3] X Research source You may want to consider vinyl mattress covers, as they lock out moisture and serve as an inexpensive way to add years of life to your mattress. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use sealable plastic bags to dispose of diapers. For underwear and pads alike, sealable plastic bags will come in handy if you’d rather wait to dispose of them in a more private setting. Plastic bags can easily be stored in your bookbag. When you’re in a public restroom, simply place your wet belongings in the bag and back into your bookbag. No one will be the wiser! An environmentally friendly option is a reusable, sealable waterproof bag. You can place the wet products into the bag, dispose of them later and then throw the bag in with your laundry."

      "title": "Don’t forget the cleaning supplies.",
      "content": "Don’t forget the cleaning supplies. Things such as plastic gloves and stain and odor removers will come in handy in a dorm setting. There’s no need to clean in front of your roommate either. Wait until they leave for class to do your cleaning, if you feel more comfortable doing so. You can always explain to your roommate that you’re a neat freak and like things to be clean. Open the windows after using cleaning products. You wouldn’t want the room to smell overwhelming upon your roommates return."

      "title": "Choose loose-fitting clothing to conceal pads and diapers.",
      "content": "Choose loose-fitting clothing to conceal pads and diapers. If you're still concerned about your peers noticing the pad, diapers or underwear you're wearing, choose clothing that doesn't cling. In other words, wearing skinny jeans may not be the best choice for you. However, men can wear looser fitting jeans and go with an untucked shirt, while women can opt for long skirts or tunic shirts. If you're heading to the beach with your friends, women can accessorize with a full or partial cover up, while men can sport board shorts."

      "content": "Take advantage of campus health services. Upon arriving to campus, familiarize yourself with the health services on campus. Healthcare on campus is similar to going to the family doctor, but most campuses provide a wider range of health services to students who are transitioning from being a patient to an independent health consumer. [5] X Research source Inquire about potentially free or discounted products for incontinence. Chances are the nurses on campus have encountered students with similar issues, so don’t feel embarrassed about any questions or issues you may have."

      "content": "Request to have a room with a private bathroom. If you’d like to avoid having to use a public restroom every day, you may want to request a room with a private bathroom. There is no guarantee that the school will be able to honor your request; however, it’s worth asking about. You’ll need to involve your doctor from home in the process. School guidelines for submitting such a request vary, so check with them once you’ve been admitted to see what their policy is. Don’t wait until you arrive on campus to make the request."

      "title": "Inquire about a single dorm.",
      "content": "Inquire about a single dorm. It may be that you feel most comfortable having a space of your own. Again, policies will vary by school, but some require that requests be made yearly for such accommodations. You will also need documentation from your family doctor when submitting the request. Single rooms tend to fill up fast, so make the request early! Consider what living in a single room will mean for your social life. You may also be asked more questions about your medical condition, if you are living alone."
