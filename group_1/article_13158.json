You can utilize either or both methods when you decide to recycle your batteries. [1] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. Keep them separated from other types of batteries. [2] X Research source Even if you decide to just throw your batteries out in the trash, which you can do with alkaline batteries, it’s still a good idea to cover the ends with tape or seal them in a plastic bag—this will eliminate the chance that anyone might come into contact with battery leakage at the waste facility."

Depending on where you live, there could be a few drop-off locations close to your home, or you may need to utilize a mail-in option to recycle your batteries. Find out more by visiting https://earth911.com/recycling-guide/how-to-recycle-single-use-batteries/#recycling-locator . [4] X Research source The recycling locator allows you to pick the specific type of material you’re looking to recycle, so you can specify alkaline batteries to get the most accurate results."

This is especially useful if you work in an office or somewhere where a lot of batteries get used on a daily basis. You can find mail-in programs using the recycling locator tool, or you can purchase a large box from a nationwide program called “The Big Green Box” and fill it with your used batteries. [7] X Research source It does cost money to recycle your alkaline batteries with “The Big Green Box.” The price includes the cost of shipping, handling, and the subsequent recycling that takes place.

While there may not be a recycling facility nearby, there’s a chance that your local community center hosts a semi-annual or annual recycling event. If there isn’t one yet, you could arrange to start one so that people have a safe way to get rid of their batteries. [8] X Research source Contact your local waste management facility to see if you can work with them and your community to organize an event. [9] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. Find a public location that would be willing to host the hazardous waste drive, like perhaps a public library or your local community center. Get volunteers to help you publicize the event and get information out to the community about when the event will be help and what kinds of materials will be accepted."

      "content": "Do the “ drop test ” if you don’t have a voltmeter. This works for AA, AAA, C, and D batteries. Hold the battery about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) above a flat surface with the negative side facing down. Drop the battery straight down. If it bounces, it’s dead. If it lands flat and doesn’t bounce, it’s still good. [10] X Research source Many times, good batteries will actually land and stand up straight without falling over after being dropped."

      "content": "Use a voltmeter to get an accurate reading of the energy level. AA and AAA alkaline batteries should register at about 1.5 volts if they are still good. Turn on the voltmeter and place the red probe on the battery’s positive end and the black probe on the battery’s negative end. The reading will show on the voltmeter. If the reading is less than 1.3 volts, you can go ahead and dispose of the battery. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid pairing old batteries with new batteries to prolong their lives. The performance of whatever product you’re trying to power or charge won’t be as effective as if you were using batteries with the same power level. It could even cause one of the batteries to start leaking or for the good battery to lose voltage faster than it would regularly. [12] X Research source You should also try to avoid mixing different brands of batteries in the same device for the same reason."

      "title": "Keep your batteries organized by brand and voltage.",
      "content": "Keep your batteries organized by brand and voltage. Use a plastic container with multiple compartments. Label each compartment with the type of battery, brand-name, and a “new” or “used” label. Use marker on masking tape so you can easily remove or change labels when you need to. [13] X Research source For example, if you have “X” brand batteries that are both new and used, label one compartment “AAA X Batteries, new” and another one “AAA X Batteries, used.”"
