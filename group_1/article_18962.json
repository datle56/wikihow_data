[2] X Research source When this code is enabled, you will get 99 pieces/units of whatever item is in the first slot of your PC’s Item Storage. Additionally, the item will always stay on the first slot even if you’ve withdrew all of it to you bag. Essentially, you’ll have an infinite number of whatever item is on the first slot."
