      "title": "Unfortunately, no.",
      "content": "Unfortunately, no. Just like your hair and skin color, the color of your iris is genetic. That means that unless you break down your genetic code or cell structure, your eye color cannot be changed permanently without surgery. The color of your eyes is determined by the amount of melanin that your irises contain: very little melanin gives blue eyes, while lots of melanin gives brown eyes. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Many babies have blue eyes when they’re born because their bodies haven't created very much melanin yet."

      "content": "Wear blue contact lenses. Contact lenses can give you the appearance of blue eyes without having to change anything physical. To make sure your contact lenses are safe, visit an eye doctor and get a prescription. If you have glasses, you can get prescription colored contact lenses to wear every day. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Colored contact lenses from home goods or costume stores aren’t safe, and they could damage your eyes. You should always purchase contacts from an eye care professional."

      "content": "Yes, you can use browns, oranges and blues to make your eyes look lighter. When you’re picking out eye shadow and eyeliner, go for softer tones like light brown and baby blue instead of black. It will help bring out the blue undertones in your eyes and make your eye color look both lighter and brighter. [3] X Research source Other complementary eyeshadow colors that can enhance blue eyes include gold, warm orange-browns like peach and copper, red-browns like mauves and plum, and neutrals like taupe or camel. You can also try wearing brown mascara instead of black mascara."

      "content": "Yes, but it’s a very subtle change. When you feel an intense emotion like anger, sadness, or excitement, your pupils might dilate or contract. This change can influence how your eye color looks just slightly, but they might only turn a shade or two lighter or darker. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "No, that’s an urban myth.",
      "content": "No, that’s an urban myth. Some people swear that by mixing honey and hot water and using it as eye drops, you can make your eyes turn blue. However, there is no scientific evidence to back that up, and you can really irritate your eyes that way. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Your iris is in the center of your eyeball, not the surface. Using eye drops won’t help change the color of your eye because you can’t actually touch your iris. The same is true for lemon juice eye drops. You’ll just end up irritating your eyes."

      "title": "Yes, but there are many risks to eye color surgery.",
      "content": "Yes, but there are many risks to eye color surgery. There are 2 surgical options for changing your eye color: a laser surgery and an iris implant. Both of them come with the risk of inflammation, cataracts, elevated pressure inside your eye, and blindness. In fact, the laser surgery isn’t even approved for use in the United States. If you’re thinking of getting surgery, talk to an eye care professional before you make any decisions. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Most eye care professionals will discourage you from getting surgery to change your eye color. It’s too dangerous and not worth the risks."

      "content": "It could indicate a disease or an illness. Changing eye colors might mean heterochromic iridocyclitis (inflammation of the eye), pigment loss, uveitis (inflammation of the middle eye), or trauma. Any one of these things can lead to blindness and health complications, so you should see a doctor right away if you notice anything strange.
