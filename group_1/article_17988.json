How much of one side of the handkerchief you fold over the other depends on the depth of your pocket, and how much of the handkerchief you want to show above the line of your breast pocket. Keep it in mind that there are different procedures and ways for folding your handkerchief to create the Presidential Fold. [2] X Research source The best procedure depends on the relative dimensions of your handkerchief and your breast pocket. The essential goal is to create a shape that matches the dimensions of your pocket."

Ensure that it is the undivided edge along the line of folding that is visible outside your pocket, and not the opposite end with multiple overlapping edges. If your handkerchief is slightly bigger than your pocket, you may need to push it in gently. But after you have snuggled it down to the base of your pocket, smooth it out for a smart and neat look. Ensure that only about a quarter of an inch of the handkerchief appears as a strip with a straight and even edge at the top of your pocket.
