      "content": "Clean and vacuum the floor to ensure that the wood filler will adhere. If there’s a lot of dirt, dust, and other debris on your floor, the wood filler won’t adhere well to the floor. Use a hose attachment to vacuum inside the gaps where you’ll be applying the filler.

      "content": "Find a wood filler that will shrink and expand with your floorboards. Your floorboards will shrink and expand with changes in temperature and humidity over the year, so gaps between the floorboards will also change in size. To account for these shifts, find a wood filler that is elastomeric, or one that can shrink and expand. [3] X Research source Use a solvent-based filler if your wood floor is subjected to large swings in humidity and temperature, as solvent-based fillers are more durable than water-based fillers. Look for a wood filler with a label that indicates that it won’t shrink or crack. Choose a wood filler with a thick, putty-like consistency if you’ll be filling larger gaps."

Pre-mixed wood fillers come in a variety of colors. While no wood filler will be a perfect match for your floor’s color, try to find one that is the closest match. [5] X Research source Many water-based and solvent-based fillers are stainable. Look for fillers with labels that specify that they are “stainable” or “paintable.” [6] X Research source If you’ll be staining your floor after applying the wood filler, choose a filler that is white or a lighter shade than the wood stain you’ll be using."

If you’re nervous about whether the color of the wood filler will match the color of your floor, test it out in an area that will be underneath a piece of furniture or in a closet. Let it sit for a day and then see how it looks. [7] X Research source"

Put wood filler onto your putty knife and then push the filler into the gap. Then, move the putty knife across the gap as if you were painting it with a paintbrush to spread the filler evenly in the gap. [9] X Research source Apply enough filler so that the filled in gap is flush with the top of the wood floor. Scrape any excess filler off the floor once you finish filling the gap."

Different types of wood filler have different drying times, so follow the directions printed on the specific container of wood filler you’re using. Once the wood filler is dry, use a damp, lint-free cloth to wipe excess wood filler off the floor. [10] X Research source Try not to walk on the floor while the filler is drying."

Before beginning your project of filling in the gaps in your wood floor, take accurate measurements so you know how much rope to buy at the store.

      "content": "Buy non-synthetic rope from your local home improvement store. Buy rope of a size that will fit in the gaps in your wooden floor. Since the gaps in your floor will likely vary in width, you’ll probably need to buy ropes of different diameters. Refer to the measurements of the gaps you took in the first step. [12] X Research source If you want to stain the rope to match the color of your floor, buy non-synthetic rope, because synthetic rope won’t take a stain. Look specifically for rope that is made of jute, cotton, or other natural fibers. [13] X Research source"

A plastic putty knife will fit in wide gaps, but a 5-in-1 painter’s tool or other tool may work just as well. Try to get as much loose debris out of the gaps as possible. [14] X Research source Be careful not to scrape or scratch the edges of the floorboards when you’re cleaning out the debris."

      "content": "Dip your rope in wood stain that matches the color of your floor. You’ll want to do this staining work outside or in your garage to prevent the stain from spilling on your indoor floors. First, lay out a large piece of plywood or other surface that you don’t mind getting covered in wood stain to be your work station. Then, put on latex gloves and soak the rope in a bucket full of wood stain for a few seconds. [16] X Research source Use an oil-based wood stain to stain your rope. This can be a messy job, so be sure to wear old clothes that you don’t mind getting permanently covered in wood stain."

Then, place a section of rope on top of the gap, and use your fingers, a 5-in-1 painter’s tool, a plastic spackling knife, or a similar tool to gently press the rope into the gap. Repeat for each gap. [18] X Research source Push the rope in so that the top of the rope is just below the top of the floorboards."

      "content": "Collect fine dust from wood that is the same type as your floor. If you don’t have a piece of wood left over from the initial installation of your floor, try to find sanding dust from a piece of wood that is the same kind and color. Use 100-grit dust or finer. The amount of sanding dust you’ll need will depend on the size of your project. Start with a small amount so you can experiment with the process. Filling gaps with a sanding dust mixture works best with gaps that are less than 5 millimetres (0.20 in) in width."

Stir the mixture with a putty knife or smooth-edge finishing trowel after each time you add cement. Keep adding cement until you get moderately thick paste. Look for a consistency somewhere between Greek yogurt and creamy peanut butter. You can also use wood glue or epoxy instead of wood flour cement as the binding agent."
