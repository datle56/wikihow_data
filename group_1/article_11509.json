While the dandere character archetype is expressionless, shy, and quiet around others, they’re confident and loving around their love interest. When they’re first introduced, dandere characters usually don’t talk to anyone. But, throughout the story, they get closer to their love interest and get the opportunity to open up and build confidence. While they’re often viewed as emotionless and antisocial, danderes really want to make friends!

Dandere characters typically come off as reserved, emotionless, and antisocial due to their shy nature, but they secretly pine for love and friendship.

So, if you hit a point in your story where the distant character turns out to be shy and socially awkward, you’ve got a dandere on your hands. [5] X Research source"

The dandere archetype (although only being named in the early 2000s) has been around since the 70s, with Asuka Mizunokouji from the 1978 anime Urusei Yatsura being considered the oldest dandere in anime and manga. As anime and manga continued to grow as a genre, more and more dandere characters began to appear, like Kaori from the 1989 anime film Akira. Arguably the most popular dandere, Hinata Hyuga, was introduced in 2002’s Naruto manga, further popularizing the dandere character trope. In Urusei Yatsura, Mizunokouji was an isolated woman, which resulted in her being timid and afraid of males."
