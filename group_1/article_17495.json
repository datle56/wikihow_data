      "content": "A twisted hip or shin bone is the most common cause. During pregnancy, children’s leg bones have to twist as they grow to fit inside the womb. If the tibia twists outward or if your hips flex upward, then your feet might point out to the sides as well. While some kids grow out of it when they’re toddlers and start walking normally, you may still have out-toeing as an adult. [1] X Research source A twisted femur called “femoral retroversion” could also cause out-toeing, but it’s most common in obese children. Lie flat on your back with your legs extended. If your knees point out to the side, then the issue is in your hips. If your knees are straight up and your feet turn to the side, then the issue is in your tibia."
