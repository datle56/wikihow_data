      "content": "Go for well-fitting clothes instead of baggy or tight cuts. Resist the urge to cover up with baggy clothes, which can look sloppy and throw off your body’s proportions. Clothes that are too tight are no better. The trick is to invest in clothes that fit you just right. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist Expert Interview. 29 July 2020. If you don’t know your sizes , ask an employee at a clothing store for recommendations. If you’re self-conscious, it may be more comfortable to shop at a men's store that specializes in big and tall sizes. Be sure to choose clothes that fit you right now. You may have to buy new items in the future if you lose or gain weight in the future, but well-fitting clothes can help you look your best in the present."

      "content": "Choose v-neck tops instead of round, crew neck collars. A v-neck collar helps elongate the face and neckline, so look for that collar shape when you’re shopping for t-shirts and sweaters . Crew neck collars, on the other hand, don’t draw the eyes down and can exaggerate a round face shape. Crisp, quality v-neck t-shirts are super versatile. You could wear a v-neck and linen slacks to a barbecue or pair one with a blazer for a business casual look."

      "content": "Look for button-ups with spread collars to complement broad features. The distance between a dress shirt’s collar points is called the spread. When you shop for button-ups, look for shirts with widely spread collar points to balance out a broader face and neck. [3] X Research source Ideally, go for collar spreads wider than a right angle. Look where the collar points meet at the top button and form an angle. That angle should be greater than 90 degrees. Narrow collars look out of proportion with broad features. Next to a narrow collar, a broad face and neck look wider."

      "title": "Stick with straight-legged, medium-rise pants with no pleats.",
      "content": "Stick with straight-legged, medium-rise pants with no pleats. Straight-legged pants can help balance out the proportions of your legs, waist, and stomach. Pants that are as wide at the bottom as at the thigh are especially great if you have a larger midsection but smaller legs. Boot-cut pants with a subtle flare at the ankle could also work, but you generally don’t want to go with full-on bell-bottoms (unless that’s your style!). Tapered jeans (such as skinny jeans) with wider thighs and thinner ankles can make your legs look disproportionately small and exaggerate your midsection. Pleats can add bulk, so choose pants with flat fronts. Additionally, go for longer hemlines, especially if you’re shorter. They can help elongate your body. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure your shorts don’t go past your knees.",
      "content": "Make sure your shorts don’t go past your knees. If you wear shorts, they should fit snugly and fall right around knee level. If your shorts are too long and fall midway down your shins, your lower legs could look small and out of proportion. Your waistline, in turn, would look wider. [5] X Research source When you have more to love, minding your proportions is key. If your legs look disproportionately small, the rest of your body will look larger."

      "title": "Wear 3-button blazers with wide lapels to add structure to your looks.",
      "content": "Wear 3-button blazers with wide lapels to add structure to your looks. Blazers are a great way to give your body shape and polish off a look. Look for jackets with squared shoulders and 3 buttons, which can help lengthen your body. [6] X Research source Keep the middle button of the blazer buttoned. While you want to go with squared shoulders, keep in mind you should avoid shoulder pads. Padded shoulders can add extra bulk. Avoid jackets with thin lapels, which would look out of balance and make you look bigger."

      "title": "Stick with light to medium weight fabrics to avoid adding extra bulk.",
      "content": "Stick with light to medium weight fabrics to avoid adding extra bulk. Cargo pants, hoodies , and bulky sweaters made out of thick fabrics can make you look bigger. Cotton, linen, and other light, natural fabrics are good choices. If you sweat a lot, natural fabrics can also help cool you down and prevent sweat stains. While lighter fabrics are generally preferable, keep in mind you still want your clothes to give your body definition. Fabric that’s too light and clingy won’t drape well over your body.

      "title": "Go for vertical stripes and steer clear of horizontal stripes.",
      "content": "Go for vertical stripes and steer clear of horizontal stripes. Even a faint pinstripe can create a nice vertical line and elongate your body. Vertical stripes can help slim your appearance, but remember that horizontal stripes can make you appear wider. As with any pattern or style, wear stripes in moderation, and don’t wear both striped tops and bottoms at the same time. For instance, you could wear pinstripe pants, a v-neck tee, and a solid blazer to a meet and greet at work. Or you could go to a lunch date wearing a striped button-up and solid slacks."

      "title": "Wear darker tones, but don’t just wear black all of the time.",
      "content": "Wear darker tones, but don’t just wear black all of the time. Solid, darker tones are your best friend! Navy, gun metal, deep green, dark brown, and black are all slimming colors. Lighter colors, on the other hand, can exaggerate size. While darker tones are slimming, that doesn’t mean your wardrobe should be colorless and boring. Add interest to your outfits and go with darker shades of every color instead of just wearing all black all the time. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose neutral solids instead of busy patterns.",
      "content": "Choose neutral solids instead of busy patterns. In general, try to avoid patterns such as tight plaid, small checkers, and anything with prominent horizontal stripes. Shirts with bold, busy patterns can draw attention to your midsection and make you look larger. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Use color combinations to emphasize your body’s proportions.",
      "content": "Use color combinations to emphasize your body’s proportions. Since the eye is drawn to lighter colors and darker colors tend to be more slimming, you can use color combinations to your advantage. For instance, if your legs are thinner than your midsection, lighter colored pants and a darker top can help balance your proportions. [11] X Research source If you’re short and stout, you generally want to avoid bold color contrasts. Avoid, for instance, wearing a black top with light khaki pants. Sharp contrasts create a horizontal line at your midsection, which can exaggerate your belly and make you look shorter. While you want to keep color contrasts minimal if you’re stout, lighter shades on top can draw the eye upward and lengthen your body. For example, try wearing a medium to dark blue v-neck sweater and black pants."

      "content": "Try swapping your belt for suspenders. Wearing suspenders (also called braces) can take getting used to, but many men find them more comfortable and supportive than belts. Suspenders can also create a better silhouette, as belts can divide your body in half and put emphasis on your belly. [12] X Research source Suspenders work particularly well with business casual and dressy attire, and they look great with a sharp blazer."

      "title": "Choose large, simple watches and jewelry.",
      "content": "Choose large, simple watches and jewelry. If you like to wear watches, go with larger, more proportional designs. The same goes for tie clips, rings, bracelets, and any other jewelry you wear. [13] X Research source As a rule of thumb, jewelry should always be in proportion with a person’s body. A giant watch on a thin wrist looks comical, but a hefty watch on a larger wrist looks balanced."

      "title": "Go for wider ties and knots.",
      "content": "Go for wider ties and knots. Look for ties that are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide at the thicker end. Since proportion is so important, wider ties complement a broad chest. Thin ties, on the other hand, can make your torso look larger in comparison. Similarly, thicker knots, such as a Windsor , can balance out a broad neck and face. Recall that a button-up with a widely spread collar is great for broader features. A spread collar also leaves plenty of room for a wide Windsor knot. Be sure that the tip of your tie reaches the upper line of your belt and doesn’t go any lower than the bottom of the buckle."

      "content": "Carry your necessities in a briefcase or bag instead of your pockets. Keeping a large wallet, cell phone, and other objects in your pockets can add extra bulk. To avoid overstuffed pockets and take the focus off of your waistline, invest in a sharp briefcase or messenger bag. [14] X Research source If you’re self-conscious about carrying a bag, don’t think of it as a “man purse!” A briefcase can send an in-charge, put-together message, and a stylish backpack or leather messenger bag is perfect for less formal looks."
