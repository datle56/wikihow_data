      "content": "Loosen the set screws while holding each spring with a winding bar. Position a sturdy ladder to the side of the springs, rather than working directly in front of them, for safety reasons. Put on eye protection and leather gloves. Push a winding bar into the bottom hole of the winding cone on the outside of 1 spring. Use a wrench to loosen the 2 set screws. Keep a firm grip on the bar as the spring will expand powerfully as the screws are released. Repeat on the other side. [2] X Research source If you don’t have winding bars, you can make your own. Purchase 2 pieces of 18 in (46 cm) long metal bar stock with a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) diameter. To ensure the bars fit securely into the winding cone holes, file down the ends. Using a screwdriver, pin punch, or plier handles to unwind the bars could result in serious injury, as these tools aren’t designed to hold the spring in place. Avoid standing on a bucket or chair to reach the springs. Use a sturdy ladder to minimize the risk of injury."

Unwind the spring ¼ turn at a time, moving 1 winding bar to the next open perpendicular position after each ¼ turn. Repeat on the other spring. [3] X Research source"

Then, use a wrench to loosen the set screws on both lift cable drums. Disconnect the lift cables, then slide the cable drums and springs off the torsion tube. [5] X Research source Securing the tube is an essential step that will prevent the tube from moving around and potentially injuring you, so be sure to fully lock the tube in place."

      "title": "Measure the length of the relaxed spring.",
      "content": "Measure the length of the relaxed spring. Unfortunately, you can’t measure the springs while they’re installed as the tension on them would provide you with the wrong measurement. Now that you’ve removed the springs, use a tape measure to find the length of the entire spring, from one end to the other. You’ll need this information in inches to order replacement springs. [6] X Research source If one spring is broken, measure the other one for the most accurate numbers."

      "title": "Determine the inside diameter of the spring and the size of the coils.",
      "content": "Determine the inside diameter of the spring and the size of the coils. Run a tape measure across the opening at one end of the spring. Carefully measure the inside diameter of the spring so you can provide the supplier with this information. Then, use a tape measure to find the length of 10 coils on the spring. Divide the length by 10 to determine the measurement of a single coil. [7] X Research source Coil sizes range from 0.0135 to 0.625 inches (0.034 to 1.588 cm). The standard inside diameter of a torsion spring is 2 inches (5.1 cm). Many torsion springs are 24 inches (61 cm) long. If you suspect the coils are the wrong size, which could be contributing to the issues you’re having with the garage door, use the size and weight of the door to calculate the correct size from a spring weight manual."

      "title": "Order replacement springs.",
      "content": "Order replacement springs. Many manufacturers and distributors only provide torsion springs to professionals, and won’t sell them directly to the customer. Luckily, they are available on the Internet, so search online to find replacement springs. Make sure they match the coil size, length, and interior diameter of the springs you removed. Also, be sure to order both a “left-hand” and a “right-hand” spring as the coils are wound in different directions. [8] X Research source It’s best to purchase double-life springs, which are stronger and last longer than standard springs. It’s worth the extra $50-$60. Ask the supplier for a recommendation on how many times to turn the springs to apply the right amount of tension when reinstalling them."

      "content": "Check for other worn or rusted components. While the tension is off the door, inspect the other components. If you notice any worn or rusted pieces, replace them before installing the new springs. For instance, if you spot a frayed cable, replace it now to avoid taking the door apart again later."

When your new springs arrive, put the new left spring (the 1 with the end facing up and to the left) on the torsion tube, making sure that the stationary cone on the end of the spring faces the center bracket. After sliding the new spring into place, replace the cable drum and insert the torsion bar into the left bearing bracket. [9] X Research source"

Slide the right spring onto the bar and press the bearing into the stationary cone. Connect both of the stationary cones to the center bracket with the nuts and bolts you removed previously. Remove the locking pliers or clamp from the center bracket. [10] X Research source"

Then, attach locking pliers to the torsion tube to secure it in place. Spin the drum to wind the cable into the grooves, then tighten the set screws. Repeat on the other side, leaving the locking pliers in place. [11] X Research source For the door to operate properly, you need the same amount of tension on both sides, so take care to tighten each side evenly."

Use the bars to turn the spring ¼ turn at a time, moving the bars to new holes in the cone as necessary. Follow the supplier’s recommendation for the number of turns to complete. Repeat on the other spring. [12] X Research source Generally, you’ll need 30 quarter-turns for a 7 ft (2.1 m) tall door and 36 quarter-turns for an 8 ft (2.4 m) tall door. Winding the spring too tight could cause it to break and injure you, so be sure to follow the supplier’s recommendation and don’t over-wind the spring."

Tightening the screws more than this could distort or puncture the torsion tube, so be sure to make less than 1 full rotation once the screws touch the torsion tube. [14] X Research source"
