      "content": "Study the pronunciation of Polish vowels. The numbers 1-10 in Polish use a majority of the letters from the Polish alphabet. Ordinarily, each letter in Polish has just one sound associated with it (unlike English, where letters like e, a, s, and many others can be pronounced several ways). A few letters in Polish, including several vowels, can have diacritics (small marks) that change how they are pronounced. [5] X Research source a is like in the \"a\" “cat” e sounds like the “e” in “red” ą , and ę sound like nasalized versions of the a and e sounds i is like “beet” except when it comes before e . The letters ie together have the sound “ye.” ó and u are pronounced the same, like the “oo” in “boot” y is pronounced like the \"y\" in “syllable”"
