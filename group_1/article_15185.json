      "title": "Prepare your fabric and brew your coffee.",
      "content": "Prepare your fabric and brew your coffee. Before dyeing, wash and dry the fabric as you normally would. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the dye from penetrating evenly. The amount of coffee that you should brew will depend on how dark you would like the fabric to be. Stronger coffee will achieve a darker tint. Newly purchased fabrics may be coated with a finishing spray, so it is especially important to follow through with this step. If you are looking to create a darker tint with the coffee, use more coffee or use a dark/very strong roast. If you would like a lighter tint, use less coffee or use coffee that is a light or medium roast. As an alternative to preparing several batches of coffee at home, you can use instant coffee or you can purchase brewed coffee from a local store or coffee shop. This could be significantly more expensive, however."

      "content": "Fill a pot with water. Place the pot on the stove and turn the burner to high. The size of the pot will depend on how much fabric you are dyeing. As a rule of thumb, you will need a large enough pot to completely submerge the fabric in water."

      "title": "Add the fabric to the pot.",
      "content": "Add the fabric to the pot. Once you have turned the heat off and the coffee has stopped bubbling, submerge the fabric entirely into the coffee. Stir it around a bit to make sure any air pockets are eliminated. Since the water just stopped boiling, it may be best to use a wooden spoon, so as not to burn yourself or ruin your utensils."
    },
    {
      "title": "Steep the fabric.",
      "content": "Steep the fabric. The longer your fabric steeps in the coffee, the deeper it will be dyed. You will need to wait about an hour for appreciable, colorfast results, but you can allow a longer steeping time for a deeper tint."

      "title": "Remove and rinse the fabric.",
      "content": "Remove and rinse the fabric. Remove the fabric from the coffee dye and rinse it thoroughly under cold water. Do this until the water runs clear, which will indicate that all of the excess dye has been removed. After rinsing the excess coffee dye, you will be able to accurately tell how dark the fabric has been tinted. If you still want the fabric to be darker after rinsing it, you can steep the fabric again. Once you have achieved the desired tint, prepare a large enough container to hold all of your fabric with cold water and let the fabric soak. You can add vinegar to this cold water bath and let soak for ten minutes to set the dye. [2] X Research source"

You can then dry the fabric on low in the dryer or hang it up in the shade to dry.

      "content": "Wash your fabric and brew your coffee. Before dyeing, wash the fabric but do not dry it. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the rub from penetrating evenly. You will need the used grounds of the coffee that is brewed. A good method to use for this is to use a French Press or use a coffee maker . You can wash the fabric with the rest of your clothes or just wash it by itself, depending on your preference. Be sure to follow the washing instructions of the fabric, if provided. You will need enough coffee grounds to cover the entirety of the fabric that you are dyeing. You may need to brew several pots of coffee for this purpose. Pick a dark roast to dye the fabric darker and a lighter roast if you do not wish for it to be very dark. This is a great way to make use of your used coffee grounds. If you are a regular coffee drinker, you can save the used coffee grounds for this method."

This can be done with a wooden spoon or similar utensil, or you can use your hands for this part. This can be messy so you will want to do this somewhere where it is acceptable to make a mess, such as in a garage. You can also lay down plenty of newspaper to protect the floor or carpeting."

Take your finger, place it in the middle of the garment, and begin turning your finger and hand clockwise. The fabric will start to bunch up as you twist. Be sure to keep the fabric orderly and create a circular shape, like a very wide and short cylinder, similar to the shape of a pie. Once the fabric is shaped like a pie, rubber band it in sections as if you are dividing the pie into eighths."
