      "content": "Ask your doctor for a referral. Once you meet with your doctor about your condition or injury, be sure to ask her for a referral for massage therapy. You must have a referral in order to have your therapy covered by your insurance. Your referral is your only way of proving that medical massage therapy sessions are a medical necessity. For each session of massage therapy you receive will require a valid and current Rx or referral. Your referral must have the following information: start date, number of visits prescribed by your physician, frequency of sessions, and diagnosis codes referencing your injury or condition. The diagnosis codes are the most important part of your referral because you need them to claim the massage therapy sessions with your insurance company."
