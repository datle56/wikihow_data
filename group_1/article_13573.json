    {
      "title": "Choose fabric and thread.",
      "content": "Choose fabric and thread. Smocking can be done using any type of fabric, but it works best if you use thin fabric that doesn't have a lot of stretch. Try thin cotton or linen if this is your first time. Choose embroidery floss in a matching or contrasting color. The stitches are meant to be seen to create a pretty dotted pattern. Smocking gives fabric an elastic quality and makes it more form fitting. You'll need to take this into account when cutting fabric for the pattern you're using. Make it 2 1/2 to 3 times wider than what your pattern calls for. If you'd rather not have visible stitching, choose a regular sewing thread (rather than thick embroidery floss) in the same color as your fabric."

      "title": "Draw a dotted grid on the fabric.",
      "content": "Draw a dotted grid on the fabric. Use a fabric pen or a pencil to draw a grid of evenly-spaced dots covering the area that you want to smock. The grid may be square or rectangular. The dots may be spaced close together or far apart, depending on how many pleats you want to make. A good starter measurement is placing the dots one inch apart, both across and down. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The lines of dots should line up with the grain of the fabric. Be sure your dots are placed in straight lines across the fabric - otherwise your smocking will turn out crooked. You can make your grid using iron-on dots as well, so you won't have to worry about measuring out the dots. Look for smocking patterns in your local sewing store."

      "title": "Thread your needle.",
      "content": "Thread your needle. The first step will be to use a needle and thread to gather the fabric and hold it in place. Thread a needle and tie the end so that it won't pull through the fabric. This placeholder thread will be trimmed away, so it doesn't matter what kind you use. The gathers will later be fastened with decorative stitches, and that's when you can use your pretty embroidery thread."
