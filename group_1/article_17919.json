      "content": "The fly as an animal guide may provide guidance in uncertain times. If you identify the fly as your spirit animal , totem animal , or power animal , it may offer you strength and resilience in times of doubt or major life changes. Like the fly, have faith that you possess the adaptability and speed to embrace the changes life throws your way with nimbleness and grace. [8] X Research source Though the concept of animal spiritual guides is prevalent in Indigenous cultures and traditions, animals as spirit guides are actually common in religious systems across the world. [9] X Research source However, spirit animals (supernatural guides that take the form of animals) are specific to particular Indigenous cultures; if you don't belong to this culture, reconsider claiming a particular animal as your \"spirit animal.\" [10] X Research source A totem animal or power animal is an animal that presents itself to you when you're in need. \"Totem animals\" are also linked to Indigenous cultures and may not be appropriate to claim if you do not belong to one of these cultures. How do you know if the fly is your animal guide? If you see flies frequently or find yourself thinking or dreaming about them often, or if you feel a particular affinity to the fly, it's likely the fly is spiritually connected to you."
