      "content": "Hold the fish by the head and scrape it with a knife or scaling tool . Move against the grain of the scales to remove them. Start at the tail and work your way toward the head. Scale both sides of the fish’s body, including its belly. [2] X Research source You can also use a butter knife to scale a fish. [3] X Research source Consider wearing gloves when handling fish to reduce the risk of being cut by scales. Avoid moving the knife too hard, or you might cut the fish."

      "content": "Lay the snapper on a cutting board and examine its skin for leftover scales. Move the palm of your hand back and forth along the sides to feel stubble, which feels slightly prickly but not sharp. Stubble indicates that the scales are gone, so you should feel it after removing the scales. The fish will also look smoother. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make an incision from the fish’s anus to its jaw.",
      "content": "Make an incision from the fish’s anus to its jaw. Insert a sharp fillet knife into the fish’s anus and bring it all the way to the base of the lower jaw. Be mindful not to push the knife in too deep, or you’ll puncture the intestines, which will emit a rancid odor. [6] X Research source Make the incision deep enough for you to stick your fingers inside to pull the meat back. Make sure your knife is sharp enough to easily cut through the fish without much force. The knife’s handle should be dry when handling it to prevent your hands from slipping."

      "title": "Pull the entrails out of the incision with your hands and a spoon.",
      "content": "Pull the entrails out of the incision with your hands and a spoon. Open up the new cavity and pull its organs out. Use a knife to detach the gill filaments from the base of the head. Scrape out the kidneys, liver, and remaining organs with a spoon. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dispose of entrails by packing them in a double zip-lock bag.",
      "content": "Dispose of entrails by packing them in a double zip-lock bag. This prevents the smell from escaping in your trash, and you also won’t attract wildlife to your area. Put the zip-lock bag in the garbage. Any bear-proof container will work, too. If you don’t have appropriate containers, another option is to bury fish guts in a hole that’s about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) deep. If you’re at a camp, the hole should be 200 feet (61 m) from your camp. Some states don’t allow you to dispose of fish guts in the water, but for areas that do, the guidelines require that you put them in water that’s at least 10 feet (3.0 m) deep or in large rivers. Contact a local land manager to get guidelines for disposing of fish entrails in your area."

Pat dry with paper towels when you’re done rinsing it. [10] X Research source You can also rinse it with salted ice water, because snapper is a salt-water fish. Alternatively, you can wash a fish outside in a bucket of water if it’s an extra slimy fish. [11] X Research source"

Rub your hand across the fillet to find bones. Press the flesh so the bones poke out and remove them with pliers. Pick the bones from the meat in the same direction they’re sticking out. [17] X Research source You can also remove pin bones using a fillet knife to cut down the center line of the fillet and slice the bones out. This will leave a thin triangle cut out of the fillet, making one side larger than the other. [18] X Research source If you feel resistance while pulling out the bones, be gentle but firm. Because the bones are angled toward the head, pull them sideways and up. [19] X Research source"

Grasp the piece of separated skin with your hand or a towel and move the knife between the skin and the meat in a gentle sawing motion. Wiggle the tail skin so it moves the knife along to detach the meat from the skin. [20] X Research source"
