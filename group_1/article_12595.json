      "content": "Anytime you're in a public rental or hotel room. Unfortunately, there's been a rise in hidden cameras placed in rental properties over the last few years. Give yourself peace of mind if you're staying in a new place. Look around and check for anything that looks or feels off. Then, take a few minutes to really search for hidden cameras before you get comfortable. [1] X Research source You can also check mirrors in dressing rooms. Depending on which state you're in, some stores are allowed to put in surveillance cameras ."

      "content": "Yes—you might find a camera with a physical inspection. To spot a hidden camera, spend a few minutes looking around for small holes in the wall or random wires that don't look like they belong. Pay attention to flashing or blinking lights, too. You might look for wires or a small blinking light near along the mirror's frame, for instance. Spy cameras are getting smaller and smaller, so get really close to look for the camera lens."

      "title": "You might find a camera by determining if the mirror is two-way.",
      "content": "You might find a camera by determining if the mirror is two-way . You've probably heard the old trick about touching the mirror. Simply touch the mirror with your fingertip—if there isn't a gap between your fingertip and the reflection, it's probably a two-way mirror. At this point, you can try to take the mirror off of the wall or keep searching for a hidden camera. [2] X Research source Do you see a small gap between your fingertip and the reflection? Great! This means it's a standard mirror and there's nothing to worry about."

      "title": "You can try it, but you might have a hard time pinpointing a camera's reflection.",
      "content": "You can try it, but you might have a hard time pinpointing a camera's reflection. Some people argue that a flashlight, even one on your phone, works to reflect a hidden camera's lens while others say it's too tricky to spot a camera reflection in the mirror's reflection. It's definitely worth a try, though! [3] X Research source If you want to try the flashlight tip, stand really close to the mirror and slowly shine the light over the entire surface, changing the angle as you go. Look for a very small reflection of light that's not coming from your flashlight."

      "title": "Possibly—cameras either need to be plugged in or connected to the wifi.",
      "content": "Possibly—cameras either need to be plugged in or connected to the wifi. Don't feel like physically searching for a camera? Check the wifi network to see if a hidden camera is connected. Run a scanner like Fing or WiFiman, which pulls up all the connected devices . It will also show you the name, hardware, and IP address of each connected device. The scanner may reveal that there's a camera connected to the network. [4] X Research source This tip works best for smaller wifi networks since large networks will show lots of connected devices. Not sure if a listed device is a camera? Sometimes, it can be tricky to tell what an unknown device is. Write down the IP address and run it through a port scanning app, which can give you some useful clues."

      "title": "Camera detecting apps are available, but they have mixed reviews.",
      "content": "Camera detecting apps are available, but they have mixed reviews. You can download an app like Glint Finder or Hidden Camera Detection that emits red light. This can reflect off of a hidden camera lens behind the mirror. Reviewers note that these work best when you're within 3 or 4 feet (0.91 or 1.22 m) of the camera, so it might work well if you're scanning a mirror. [5] X Research source To use the app, open it on your device so your phone emits red light. If you can, turn off the lights in your room and slowly sweep the red light over the mirror. Look for the tiny white reflection of a camera lens."

      "title": "Yes—buy a radiofrequency (RF) finder and hold it up to the mirror.",
      "content": "Yes—buy a radiofrequency (RF) finder and hold it up to the mirror. The RF finder is about the size of a cell phone or walkie talkie and it emits a red light. If you can, turn off the lights in the room and hold the RF finder so the red light shines on the mirror. Look through the circular hole in the tool and try to spot a tiny white light. This indicates a camera lens. [6] X Research source Go slowly when you look at the mirror since the camera reflection will just be a tiny point of light."

      "content": "Bring it to someone's attention right away. If you're staying at a vacation rental, contact the rental company immediately, or speak with the manager if you're staying at a hotel. If you suspect someone broke the law in hiding the camera, call the police and file a report . They'll walk you through what is and isn't allowed under surveillance laws in your state. [7] X Research source If you feel like your privacy was violated, it's totally alright to contact your lawyer, too."
