The full meme says, “Any female born after 1983 can’t cook, all they know is McDonalds, charge their phone, twerk, be bisexual, eat hot chip and lie.” [1] X Research source It’s a silly and ridiculous way of making fun of the habits of young people, and the trends that pop up in newer generations. “Eat hot chip” specifically makes fun of younger generations’ obsession with spicy chips, like Takis or spicy Cheetos. The meme also takes shots at younger people’s promiscuity, obsession with their phones, poor diets, and personal identities. The meme’s become a popular “copypasta,” which is a joke that people love to copy and paste into online conversations."

      "content": "The Bernie Sanders incident In 2020, during Bernie Sanders’ campaign for president of the United States, a Twitter/X user generated a fake video of Sanders reciting the meme. This sparked a firestorm of misplaced outrage, and also a discussion of Sanders’ supposed misogyny. Of course, most people involved in these discussions were fooled by the fake video. The meme itself has often been accused of being misogynistic, since it singles out and makes fun of young women in particular. Some say that the fake video was meant to expose how gullible people are online."

      "content": "Other forms of Eat Hot Chip and Lie The meme isn’t just limited to a goofy and grammatically incorrect sentence. Over the years, people have taken the idea and ran with it, warping it into new forms, like a parody of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, with “lie” at the top of the pyramid, and the other parts of the joke beneath it. Some have made the meme into a daily to-do list, like: “Schedule: 1. Wake up 2. Twerk 3. Charge phone 4. Eat hot chip 5. Lie.”"

      "content": "Use “Eat hot chip and lie” to make fun of a certain type of person. Like any good meme, Eat Hot Chip and Lie is super versatile and remixable, which is exactly what people have done to it on social media. Swap “females” for whoever you want to take a playful jab at, then customize the rest of the meme to fit the profile. For example: “Any dog born after 1900 can’t hunt. All they know is kibble, bark at mailman, chew they toy, scoot, eat table scraps and cry.” “Any student born after 2000 can’t study. All they know is Sparknotes, laptop, ChatGPT, sleep in class, eat ramen, and want to die.” “Twitter users can’t read. All they know is 280 characters, memes, spam accounts, slide into DMs, complain, and sigh.”"

Unfortunately, this genre is also closely tied with restrictive gender roles and white supremacist thinking. “Eat hot chip and lie” is sometimes accused of being a trad meme, given that it complains about a younger generation that no longer upholds “traditional” values."
