      "content": "Windows DDE server is not a virus. DDE is an old technology that allows processes to communicate with each other—this is called interprocess communication, or IPC. DDE was actually superseded by a different IPC technology in 1990, but DDE has been retained in Windows operating systems for backwards compatibility."

      "content": "There are several reasons you might see a DDE server window pop up. This could be due to outdated software, an outdated Windows operating system, software conflicts, a bug or glitch, corrupt system files, or resource limitations. The DDE server window is usually seen when a Windows computer is shutting down. If this window doesn't cause any issues (such as preventing the computer from shutting down), you don't need to do anything, since DDE is a normal Windows function. If a DDE server window is causing problems on your machine, skip ahead to our troubleshooting section."

      "content": "Refresh Windows Explorer. Many times, Windows Explorer is the culprit behind the DDE server windows. This is especially true if you see \"explorer.exe\" in the error message that pops up. To refresh Windows Explorer: Right-click the taskbar. Click Task Manager . Scroll down and find Windows Explorer . Right-click Windows Explorer and click Restart . Your computer may pause for a moment or act strangely while Windows Explorer restarts; this is normal."

To disable this setting: Right-click the taskbar. Click Taskbar Settings . Toggle off the \"Automatically Hide Taskbar\" settings. There are two options: desktop mode and tablet mode. Disable them both if you have them both."

      "title": "Update relevant third-party software.",
      "content": "Update relevant third-party software. You may see a file name in the DDE server error that ends with a .exe . This means the file is an executable file and is more than likely referring to some software installed on your computer. If you can figure out what the application is based on the file name, try updating it. You may be prompted to update the software when you open it, or you may have to manually download and install the update from the developer. If you're not sure, use Google or your favorite search engine to find out what the process is for the app in question. If you can't figure out what the application is based on the file name, use Google or your favorite search engine to look it up. You can also try searching the file name in the taskbar search bar to see if it will direct you to the location of that file."

If you're on Windows 7 or Vista, you can skip the DISM scan and do an SFC scan. To run these scans: Write \"cmd\" in the taskbar search bar and right-click Command Prompt . Select Run as an administrator . Type DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth and press Enter . The DISM scan will take some time to complete, so wait until it is finished before moving on. Type sfc /scannow once the DISM scan is done, and press Enter . The SFC scan will also take some time to complete.

A clean boot means your computer will reboot with only Microsoft software starting at startup. This can help you identify if the error is caused by third-party software. To do this: Type msconfig in the taskbar search bar. Click System Configuration . Go to the Services tab. Check Hide all Microsoft services . Click Disable all . Go to the Startup tab. Click Open Task Manager . Disable any enabled programs. Take note of which programs you disable. Exit the Task Manager and click OK . Restart your computer, then try to get the DDE server error to pop back up. If it doesn't occur, the issue is likely with one or more of your third-party applications. Before using your computer again, go back to System Configuration and re-enable the startup programs you disabled above, then restart your computer again."

As long as you have Windows Security enabled (which you more than likely do, as it's enabled by default and can't be easily permanently disabled), you will be protected from viruses, malware, and online threats. Each third-party antivirus software is slightly different. However, each one should have the ability to switch it off in the application, and you can uninstall them by right-clicking the Windows button, selecting Apps & Features , scrolling until you find the antivirus software, and clicking Uninstall ."
