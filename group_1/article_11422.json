      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. To cut a V-neck, you need a crew neck shirt, a ruler or measuring tape, stick pins, a fabric marker, fabric scissors, and a seam ripper . If you want to sew the collar back on your shirt, then you’ll also need thread that’s the same color as your shirt and a sewing machine or sewing needle. If you’re using a measuring tape, grab a straight edge to help you draw straight lines."

      "title": "Measure how deep you want the V-neck to be.",
      "content": "Measure how deep you want the V-neck to be. Lay a V-neck shirt that you like over your t-shirt as a guide. Mark the spot where you want the point of the V to go with a pin, then fold the shirt vertically in half. Lay it flat on a table and line up the shoulders. Then, use a ruler to measure the distance from the point where the collar meets the shoulder seam to the point of the V. Write down this measurement. If you’re sewing the existing collar to your shirt, the V has to be no longer than 2 inches (5 cm) from the bottom of the collar. If it’s deeper than that, the collar won’t fit around the new V neckline. If you don't have another V-neck shirt, simply eyeball how deep you want the V-neck to be. It's better to be on the conservative side, as you can always make the V deeper later. If you’re having trouble visualizing the V-neck, try on your shirt. Look in the mirror and mark the spot you'd like the point of the V with a pin."

      "content": "Fold your t-shirt in half vertically. Lay your t-shirt face down on the table, then fold one side over to the other. The front of the collar is now on the outside of the fold. Make sure that the neckline, the shoulders, and the arms match up exactly. Then, smooth down all the edges until the shirt is free of wrinkles. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Trace the outline of the V-neck with a fabric marker.",
      "content": "Trace the outline of the V-neck with a fabric marker. Make a diagonal line with your ruler, placing it where the shoulder seam meets the collar down to the middle of the chest. Using the measurements you took in the previous step, mark off the point of the V with a fabric marker. Then, draw a line between the mark and the point where the shoulder seam meets the collar. Flip the shirt over and repeat this step on the other side."

      "title": "Turn the shirt inside out and remove the stitches around the front collar.",
      "content": "Turn the shirt inside out and remove the stitches around the front collar. Unfold your t-shirt, flip it inside out, and lay it flat on the table with the front side facing you. Using a seam ripper , push the tip of the tool under the stitch sewn between the collar and the shirt at the shoulder seam. Pull the seam ripper up to cut through the thread. Continue to cut through the threads until you get to the other shoulder seam. [2] X Research source If you don't have a seam ripper, use a sharp pair of scissors to carefully cut through the threads. Make sure to leave the collar attached to the back of the shirt."

      "title": "Turn your shirt back to the correct side and smooth it on the table.",
      "content": "Turn your shirt back to the correct side and smooth it on the table. Unfold your t-shirt and flip it back right side out. Lay it on your table and press it down to remove any wrinkles. Then, fold the front of the collar backwards so it is away from the front of the shirt. This helps you make a smoother and straighter cut free from mistakes."

      "content": "Cut along the V-neck outline. Starting on one side of the V-neck outline, use a pair of sharp fabric scissors to cut along the marked line. Be careful to only cut through the front side of the shirt. Stop cutting when you reach the point. Then, repeat this process on the other side."

      "title": "Stretch each side of the cut collar along the length of your V-neck.",
      "content": "Stretch each side of the cut collar along the length of your V-neck. To get your collar to reach your new neckline, you have to stretch it out a little. Most crew neck t-shirt collars are made out of a ribbed fabric that stretches easily. Just tug and pull each side of the collar down to the V point to lengthen the collar. [4] X Research source If your collar doesn’t reach all the way to the point of the V, pull and stretch out each side again. If it still doesn’t stretch all the way, your V might be too deep. Just go to your local craft store and buy a ribbed fabric that matches your collar."

Then, stretch one side of the collar along the length of the V, placing a pin between the collar and shirt to hold them together. Continue to stretch the collar along the edge of the V, inserting 1 pin about every 1 inch (2.5 cm). When you get to the point of the V, do the same thing on the other side. [5] X Research source"

Use a sewing machine or a needle and thread to sew about a ¼ inch (0.6 cm) away from the rough edges of the collar and neckline. If you’re sewing by hand , a simple running or back stitch will do the trick. [6] X Research source Just stop sewing when you get about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the point of the V.
