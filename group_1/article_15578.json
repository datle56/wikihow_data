As of 2017, you can only edit reviews within a 24-hour window after the review was posted, and if you are out of that time, too bad; remove the review and start over, if you have a new experience that's reviewable on Yelp. If you need to review a new experience because your recent encounter changed it (either good or bad), write a fresh new review update instead. Editing reviews is for making more minor changes or continuing on the experience that you might have missed from the same experience."
