      "content": "Open the chat window and type \"/locate structure stronghold.\" This command will locate the nearest Stronghold and give you the coordinates for them in green text. [1] X Research source In Creative Mode, commands are automatically available from the start. In Survival Mode, however, commands are blocked, so you'll need to enable them if you want to use this method to find a Stronghold. [2] X Research source In Bedrock Edition singleplayer, go to your Settings menu and access the Game tab. Next, activate the toggle button next to \"Allow Cheats.\" Take caution: once you do this, you'll no longer be able to unlock any achievements in the world you're playing in. For this reason, you may consider opting for the Eyes of Ender method of finding a Stronghold. While playing Java Edition singleplayer, you can opt to allow cheats whenever you set up your world. If you already created the world without enabling commands, open your Settings menu, go to the Game tab, select \"Open to LAN,\" and select \"Allow Cheats.\" Be aware that if you switch to \"Allow Cheats,\" you'll no longer be able to pause your game. Plus, if you're on a network, other people will be able to find and join your game if they want. The good news is you can restore everything to normal simply by exiting the world and then hopping back in."

The second is to type \"/tp\" followed by the coordinates as they appear in the chat window. [3] X Research source Finally, according to Minecraft expert Zac Churchill, you can press \"Fn\" and \"F3\" simultaneously on your computer keyboard to bring up live coordinates. Then, you can manually guide your character to the correct location, matching up the live coordinates to the Stronghold coordinates until you find the right spot."

These dark, lanky foes typically spawn at night, in caves, or in a warped forest biome in the Nether. [5] X Research source While you're in the Nether, find a Nether Fortress and fight blazes to get them to drop blaze rods. Pick up the blaze rods and craft 2 blaze powders out out of each one. [6] X Research source Once you've collected 20-30 ender pearls and blaze powders, combine them to craft at least 20-30 Eyes of Ender (the more, the better). [7] X Research source"

If any of them fall to the ground intact, pick it up and reuse it because these items tend to break easily. You'll need at least 12 Eyes of Ender to access the End Portal in the Stronghold, so preserving your stock is key. [8] X Research source If you throw an Eye of Ender and it moves in the opposite direction (toward you), that's a sign you've gone too far in one direction. At this point, you may need to increase the frequency with which you throw Eyes of Ender to home in on the exact location where they're leading you. When you throw an Eye of Ender and it doesn't float far away, it's close to a Stronghold."

The End Portal is activated by setting an Eye of Ender into each of the 12 blocks surrounding it. That's why crafting plenty of Eyes of Ender to play this part of the game is crucial!

In these chests, you'll often find Enchanted books which will teach you advanced enchantments. You'll also be able to collect books from the shelves in case you want to set up a library at your fortress, or you can trade 4 of them to a Librarian and get 1 emerald in return.

Some of these crossings hold hidden rooms where you can find extra loot. To find the hidden room (if there is one), follow these steps. [12] X Research source As a rule, if you're facing north or west when you enter a 5-way crossing, it most likely contains a hidden room. If you're facing south or east, don't bother looking. You can check which direction you're facing by pressing F3 on your keyboard to pull up your live coordinates. If you're in a north or west-facing crossing, look at the walls to either side of you for a 3x3 block indentation. If you find one, look further down the wall for blocks that don't blend in with the rest of the stone or brick. Dig there, and you'll likely uncover a door to a hidden room."

[15] X Research source Turn on the subtitles and look for silverfish noises. If you're within hearing distance of silverfish, that means you're close to the End Portal.

Open your inventory and type \"end\" into the search bar to pull up the end portal frame and the Eyes of Ender. Place these items in your hotbar at the bottom of the screen and close the inventory window. [18] X Research source Place three end portal frame blocks in front of you, side by side. Then, turn your character 90 degrees to the right or left and place three more blocks. Continue this pattern until you're in the center of a square of a dozen blocks. [19] X Research source Jump outside of the portal frame and drop 1 Eye of Ender in each block. Once the last Eye is in place, the End Portal should turn black. [20] X Research source"
