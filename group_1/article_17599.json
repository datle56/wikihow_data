Your cable to charge an old camera might look exactly like your phone charger, but if they're not compatible, it'll never work! So make sure you're using an Android charger for an Android and an Apple charger for an iPhone, iPad, laptop, or desktop."

      "title": "Make sure the outlet is turned on.",
      "content": "Make sure the outlet is turned on. In almost every house, there's that one switch that apparently does nothing, but it might actually control your outlets. To test this, plug in a lamp, turn it on, then toggle the switch up and down. Did the lamp turn on? Then you'll know if that switch needs to be on for that outlet to work. If you're using a surge protector or power strip instead, check that the switch is on. Make sure the fuse isn't tripped. Go to your fuse box and looked for a switch that's flipped (not like the others). Depending on your country, the fuse box may be a literal box on the wall of your closet, or it can be a wall plug. You can reset the switch in the fuse box to turn it back on. Try a different outlet. Maybe the one you're using doesn't work anymore, so changing to a different outlet may or may not work."

      "content": "Reset the connection or reboot the charging device. If you're using something like a computer, laptop, or tablet to charge your phone, rebooting that other device may fix your charging problem. Resetting the connection might help, so why not give it a shot? All you have to do is disconnect the charger from your phone (or whatever it's charging) and then disconnect it from the power source (the wall or the power adapter). Wait a few seconds, then plug everything back together: the cable to the phone, the cable to the power adapter, and the power adapter back to the wall outlet."

      "title": "Clean the charging and USB ports.",
      "content": "Clean the charging and USB ports. Android and iPhones are similar in that they both stop charging if even the smallest lint cluster or other debris is clogging up the charging port. You can use a can of compressed air, a toothpick, and some isopropyl alcohol to clean it. You can also try cleaning the charging tip on the charging cable. You also want to make sure the USB port on your charger isn't compromised. If it is clogged with lint or other debris, clean it with a Q-Tip or other non-metallic instrument. Make sure it isn't plugged in so you don't shock yourself."

      "title": "Figure out what part of your charger isn't working.",
      "content": "Figure out what part of your charger isn't working. If you're using the USB cable to connect your phone to your laptop for charging, plug it into a wall adapter so you can plug it into the wall and see if charging works. If you can, try multiple wall adapters if the first one you try doesn't work. There are even some outlets that have USB ports, so you can plug your phone's charger directly in instead of using a power adapter. If your power adapter works, but your phone isn't charging, try another charging cable to see if your phone charges. If it does, you've successfully isolated the issue to your original charger cable and can either continue to repair it or buy a new one. Look for lights. On some chargers, like Mac and iPhone power adapters, there are lights on the piece that connects to the wall to indicate that it is getting electricity from the wall. In that case, you know nothing is wrong with the wall or that connection. Now you can focus on fixes that concentrate on the charger and cable itself."

      "title": "Use a multimeter.",
      "content": "Use a multimeter. This will allow you to test each component of your charger individually so you can see where the issue is. Outlet: Connect the probes to the multimeter and set it to AC voltage. Then insert the black probe into the neutral port and the red probe in the hot/positive side of the outlet. The multimeter will let you know what voltage is coming out from the wall. If that outlet works, try the charging cable. Cable: Turn the multimeter's central knob to resistance (Ohms or Î©). Touch the same pin on either side of the cable with the multimeter's probes. If you see 0, the cable is fine. An infinity reading means the cable is broken and needs to be fixed or replaced. Adapter: If the outlet and cable are fine, the last thing you want to check is the power brick or power adapter. Set the multimeter again to AC voltage, plug the power adapter into the wall, and check the contacts (in the USB port) that should be conducting electricity. If you don't see a reading from the multimeter, something is wrong with your power adapter and it should be replaced."

A 2:1 ratio heat shrink tube is cheaper, but it isn't strong enough for a charger. Likewise, your heat gun needs to be precise. You don't want to cast a wide burst of heat that could damage your phone or anything else. Use this method to repair a split or open charging cable ."

[3] X Research source You probably want to use pliers so your fingers are safely out of the way. Pliers also have rubber handles so the heat isn't transferred up the metal to you. When you're done, allow the charger cable to cool for a few minutes."

Use this method to repair a broken connection in the charger cable head (the area right below the port that you insert in your phone). You can use this method on Android and iPhones, but the cable colors will be a little different. Apple chargers always have red, white, green, and black wires. Android chargers may not have these colors, so soldering the correct wires can be a bit of a challenge. If you aren't confident in the wires you should solder, buy a new cable instead."
