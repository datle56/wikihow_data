[3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Perform a normal kegel by tightening your pelvic floor muscles just enough to identify them. [4] X Research source Give them a slight squeeze and hold it for 2 seconds. As you hold, notice where the muscles are located and how it feels to squeeze them. [5] X Expert Source Allison Romero, PT, DPT Pelvic Health Specialist Expert Interview. 2 December 2020. Repeat this exercise until you can contract your pelvic floor muscles easily and without too much thought. At first, it may feel odd if you have never done kegels before, but it becomes more natural with practice."

      "content": "Relax your pelvic floor muscles to allow your pelvic floor to drop. Lie on your back with your feet together and your knees out. This is known as an “adductor stretch,” and helps target your pelvic floor. [6] X Research source Focus on those pelvic floor muscles, tense them for 5 seconds, then release them and exhale as you do so. This will help your pelvic floor drop. You should feel a sensation like your pelvic floor is moving downwards. Let it go completely. [7] X Research source As you breathe , allow your breath to fill your entire chest and belly, and feel them deflate as you breathe out. This is known as “diaphragmatic breathing” and helps to relax the pelvic floor. [8] X Research source Relax your pelvic floor muscles for as long as you are able. While relaxed, count to 5 if this is your first time, and work up to relaxing them for 10 or even 15 seconds."

      "title": "Lift your hips up to improve the stretch if you are lying down.",
      "content": "Lift your hips up to improve the stretch if you are lying down. To intensify the stretch that you get from a reverse kegel, do them while you’re lying down and lift your hips up as you breathe in and release. This allows the pelvic floor muscles to lengthen even more and deepens the stretch. [9] X Research source Aim to keep your torso in a straight line—don’t tilt or contort your hips, but simply raise them off the ground. Remember that dropping your pelvic floor is the same action you use when you urinate or defecate, so relaxing these muscles should feel somewhat relieving."

      "title": "Drop your hips and grab your knees for a more involved stretch.",
      "content": "Drop your hips and grab your knees for a more involved stretch. Another valuable position for relaxing your pelvic floor is the “happy baby” pose. To do this, lie on your back and grab the back of your knees, bringing them to your chest and spreading them a bit wider than your torso. Let your legs and feet relax, and practice your diaphragmatic breathing and pelvic relaxing. [10] X Research source Tense your pelvic floor for 2 seconds while inhaling, then relax while exhaling. Place a pillow or a cushion under your pelvis if it would help to make you more comfortable and relaxed."

      "content": "Kneel with your nose to the floor for an alternate stretch. Kneel with your knees spread wider than your hips, then lean forward and place your nose to the floor, with your arms outstretched past your head. Tense your pelvic floor muscles for a moment, then release them and exhale for 10 seconds to complete the reverse kegel. This is known as the “child’s pose,” and gives you an alternate position to target your pelvic floor, if the others aren’t working for you. [11] X Research source Practice your deep breathing and pelvic contracting as in the other poses, but take special care to keep your body relaxed and loose."

      "content": "Repeat the exercise 10 times and do 3 sets daily. To get the most benefit from reverse kegels, it is helpful to practice them daily. Aim for 3 sets of 10 repetitions of your pelvic floor stretch of choice, and add more reps and sets as your pelvic floor muscles get stronger. [12] X Expert Source Allison Romero, PT, DPT Pelvic Health Specialist Expert Interview. 2 December 2020.

      "content": "Sit or lie down in a comfortable position that works for you. While certain stretches are optimal for performing reverse kegels, you can do them in any position that feels comfortable to you. Sit in a chair, on the floor, or propped up on pillows. Alternatively, lie on your back with your legs flat on the floor, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, or with your legs resting on a sofa or chair. [16] X Research source Keep in mind that you can do reverse kegels anywhere. No one will be able to tell that you are doing them, so feel free to do them while waiting for the bus, during a business lunch, or even in the waiting room at the dentist."
