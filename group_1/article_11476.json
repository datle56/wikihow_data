      "title": "Feel the beat.",
      "content": "Feel the beat. Reggae music usually uses a steady, mid-tempo beat — perfect for newcomers to the style. To start, play some reggae music and try to pick out the beat. As you do this, count along with the flow of the music from one to four. Your counting should match up with the rhythm or \"feel\" of the song — for most reggae songs, this isn't too hard. When you reach four, start over from one again. You should sound like this: \"One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one...\" (and so on.) Reggae music almost always has a strong offbeat rhythm. For our purposes, this usually means that you should hear the steady strum of a guitar or a repeating piano chord between your numbers as you count them. In other words, your counting should sound like this: \"One (strum), two (strum), three (strum), four (strum),\" and so on. If you're having a hard time counting in time with the music, listen to the drums in the song. Most reggae drumming has a strong \"hit\" on beats \"two\" and \"four\"."

      "title": "Move with the \"ridim.\"",
      "content": "Move with the \"ridim.\" Once you've got a feel for the beat of your reggae song, start to move! Start swaying from side to side with the \"ridim\" (\"rhythm,\" in Jamaican patois) of the song. Bob your head up and down and lean from side to side, turning your shoulders as you do so. Try to match up your movements with each beat of the song — in other words, lean right on \"one\", lean left on \"two\", lean back again on \"three\", and so on. Don't be shy — the only way to learn how to dance is to start doing it! When you're comfortable with a basic swaying or leaning motion, try swinging your arms back and forth with the music. You can leave your hands at your sides while you do this, but you can also try bringing your hands up to chest level and moving them rhythmically with the music — it's up to you."

      "title": "Move your hips in a rhythmic motion.",
      "content": "Move your hips in a rhythmic motion. Dancing reggae is all about \"wining\" (\"winding\"). Once you've found the groove of the music and are comfortable with your basic leaning and swaying motion, try moving your hips. To start, roll your hips in a circular, rhythmic, \"hula hoop\" motion along to the beat of the music. Try to match each rotation of the hips to every beat (or every other beat) of the song — this should feel natural. Note that this movement is usually more pronounced for women — men on the dance floor usually use more subdued motion of the hips."

      "title": "Grab a partner or two.",
      "content": "Grab a partner or two. What fun is dancing on your own? Like most other forms of dance, reggae dance is a highly social experience. Try practicing your moves alongside a few other people. Once you start to feel the groove of the song, you should naturally start to split off into groups or partners — don't be afraid to single out someone on the dance floor for one-on-one dancing. Traditional reggae partner dancing is somewhat similar to ballroom dancing, but the partners usually stand close to each other (or with bodies touching) and, obviously, make rhythmic hip movements. Modern reggae dancing may more closely resemble hip-hop or pop dancing and incorporate a female-back-to-male-front stance."

      "title": "Express yourself!.",
      "content": "Express yourself!. The key to reggae music isn't following a strict set of rules — it's all about just relaxing and doing what feels natural. There's no one \"right way\" to dance to reggae music — the way you move to the music should be an expression of how you feel. Approach the dance floor with an open attitude, try to focus on the music, and let your body do the rest of the work. As you express yourself, however, be sure to share the dance floor. In reggae, the dance floor is a public space — something for everyone to enjoy. While particularly good dancers may get the attention of the crowd for a while, they shouldn't hog or command the dance floor."

      "content": "Practice with classic reggae tunes. Need some listening material to get in the reggae mindset? Try listening to some old-school (also called \"roots\") reggae. This classic style is great for reggae beginners because it's usually smooth, medium-tempo, and has a strong back beat, making it extra-easy to feel the \"ridim\" of the song. Below are just a few reggae artists associated with the roots reggae movement that you may want to investigate: [3] X Research source John Holt Culture Israel Vibration The Abyssinians Gregory Isaacs Sylford Walker"

      "title": "Try skanking.",
      "content": "Try skanking . One dance move that's indelibly associated with ska and several other reggae-related musical offshoots is \"skanking.\" Skanking basically looks like a quick, exaggerated marching or running-in-place movement that uses small kicks for every step. Be careful — once you're skanking at a high tempo, it's easy to kick or run into someone if you're not paying attention. To try skanking, use the following steps: Ball your fists up and start marching in place to the tempo of the music, moving your hands up and down as you go. Start sliding your feet back along the floor after each step. This should make it look a little like you're running in place. Start kicking your feet out with each forward step you take, continuing to make your exaggerated marching movements with your arms. When you get it right, your skanking should look a little like a cross between the can-can and an old-fashioned jig."

      "title": "Try the doing \"the rock.\"",
      "content": "Try the doing \"the rock.\" This dance move is remarkably simple — practically anyone can do it. With its slow, smooth movements, the rock pairs best with mellower reggae and dancehall tunes. To do the rock, use the following steps: Begin by grooving and swaying to the music as you normally would. Loosely ball your fists and bring your hands up to your chest. Start to roll each shoulder back to the beat of the song — first the right, then the left, and so on. Continue this leaning, rocking movement, exaggeratedly (but smoothly) rolling your shoulders back with each beat. Roll your hips slightly and make pointing or gesturing hand motions for added effect."

      "title": "Try doing a ragga-style twist.",
      "content": "Try doing a ragga-style twist. Ragga music, a more upbeat, intense variation of reggae and dancehall music, often uses dance moves that are inspired by modern hip-hop dance. This means lots of \"popping,\" \"locking,\" \"dropping,\" and more! For a great go-to ragga dance move, use the steps below: Plant your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Raise your arms out from your sides with your fists and forearms pointing down to the ground. Twist at the waist as far as you can comfortably go to one side. Start to slowly, smoothly twist back in the opposite direction, keeping your arms out as you go. Roll your hips back and forth to the beat of the music in an exaggerated motion as you twist. Repeat back in the other direction or transition into another move when you can't twist any further."

      "title": "Try doing a \"wine up\" dance for a modern twist.",
      "content": "Try doing a \"wine up\" dance for a modern twist. If you've listened to modern dance hits inspired by Jamaican music, you've probably heard this phrase used in the lyrics or shouted over the music as part of an ad-lib. This wine-up dance move, with its provocative, suggestive movements, is intended mainly for women to use (although, if you're a man and you'd like to try it, go ahead!) Use these steps to give it a shot: Plant your feet about foot or two apart and relax your body. Start grooving to the rhythm of the music as you normally would. Place your hands on your hips and start to roll them in a circular motion. As you roll your hips to the front, tighten your stomach muscles, and as you roll your hips to the back, stick them out. If you can, start to open and close your legs to the beat of the music, touching your knees together on each beat (or every other beat). For added flair, throw in occasional swiveling movements of the head and shoulders to accompany your hip and leg movements."
