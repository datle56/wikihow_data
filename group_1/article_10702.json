This will determine the number of ports you'll need. If you have four or less computers that you need to hardwire, you'll just need a router. If you have more than four, you'll likely need to get a switch to extend the number of ports available on your router."

[2] X Research source A router will automatically handle assigning IP addresses to each device on the network, and is necessary if you intend to share your internet connection with all the connected devices. It is highly recommended that you build your network with a router, even if you're not sharing an internet connection. A network switch is like a simpler version of a router. It will allow connected devices to talk to each other, but will not automatically assign IP addresses and will not share an internet connection. Switches are best used to expand the number of LAN ports available on the network, as they can be connected to the router."
