    {
      "title": "Get your Chatroulette user ID number.",
      "content": "Get your Chatroulette user ID number. If you think you were banned from Chatroulette by mistake, you can try to appeal the ban. Although there's no guarantee that you'll be unbanned, it doesn't hurt to contact Chatroulette's support team to explain your side of the situation. You'll need your user ID number to appeal the ban—you'll see this number on the ban notification page that appears when you try to log in. If you're under 18, shared sexually explicit content in the filtered area, expressed violence or hate speech, did something illegal, or spammed other users, it's unlikely that you'll be unbanned."

      "title": "Find your external IP address.",
      "content": "Find your external IP address. Chatroulette bans users by IP address in addition to user ID, so providing your IP address may help you get unbanned. The fastest way to find your IP address is to visit https://www.google.com and search for the phrase what is my IP address? ."

    {
      "title": "Create your appeal.",
      "content": "Create your appeal. There are two ways you can submit your appeal—by emailing support@chatroulette.com or by filling out the contact form at https://support.chatroulette.com/hc/en-us/requests/new . If you use the form, select Appeal Ban as your contact reason. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain why the ban should be reversed.",
      "content": "Explain why the ban should be reversed. In the body of the email (or using the contact form), let the support team know that your IP was banned from the site and state why you believe the ban to be unfair. Make sure to include your User ID and IP address so Chatroulette knows who to unban. You have a better chance of getting the ban lifted if you were legitimately not in the wrong. Some claim that people hit the “Report” button whenever they see someone they do not want to see. For example, this might happen if a man wants to reduce the number of men he sees on the site, or if someone is paired with a user they find unattractive. If you suspect that you were banned for a reason like this, state that in the message. Regardless of the reason you were banned, your best bet is to apologize and promise to behave yourself in the future."

      "title": "Wait for further instruction from Chatroulette.",
      "content": "Wait for further instruction from Chatroulette. It could take hours, days, or weeks for Chatroulette to respond. In the meantime, continue checking the site to see if the ban has been lifted. Chatroulette is under no obligation to lift the ban or reply to your email, no matter how innocent you may be. If the ban is removed, Chatroulette may not notify you by email."

    {
      "title": "Hide your IP address with Tor.",
      "content": "Hide your IP address with Tor. Tor is a web browser that can mask your IP address, making it possible for you to create a new Chatroulette account to get around the ban. Tor also encrypts your connection, making it difficult for other people on your local network (and your ISP) to see which sites you browse. You can download Tor for Windows, macOS, Linux, or Android from https://www.torproject.org/download . Because you can get a new IP address in Tor each time you launch or refresh your settings , using Tor is your best option if you want to keep using Chatroulette at home. Keep using Tor with Chatroulette after creating your new account—if you use your old banned IP address, Chatroulette might make the connection and instantly ban your new account."

    {
      "title": "Use a proxy server.",
      "content": "Use a proxy server. A proxy server or site allows you to browse the web through a third-party server, thereby masking your own IP address like Tor. If you can't install Tor, a proxy is a great option for quickly creating a new account through an unbanned IP address. Though proxy servers might be slower than what you're used to (and they don't encrypt your traffic like Tor), they may be fast enough to use as a temporary workaround. Some popular free proxy service options are VPNBook and FilterBypass . Chatroulette may automatically block the IP addresses of certain proxy sites. You may have to try a few different proxies before finding one that works."

    {
      "title": "Get a VPN service.",
      "content": "Get a VPN service. A VPN, or Virtual Private Network , is a network that allows you to access data from public networks, like the internet, while maintaining the security of a private network. VPNs are like proxy servers except your connection will also be encrypted. Most VPNs cost money, but the price is usually reasonable. Some popular VPN services are ExpressVPN, Norton Secure VPN, and NordVPN."

      "content": "Take your computer to a free Wi-Fi hotspot. If you can find a place with public Wi-Fi access where you won't be disturbing others with video chat, you can create and use a new Chatroulette account from another location."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change your IP address.",
      "content": "Change your IP address. This is usually not an easy task, as your ISP typically assigns you an IP address automatically once your router or modem connects to the internet. Try unplugging your modem and router from the internet for 5 minutes and then plugging it back in. If that doesn't give you a new IP address (and you can't use any of the other suggestions), you can try calling your ISP and request a new IP address."
