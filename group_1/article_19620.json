      "content": "Put a lump of brewer's yeast or sprinkle powdered yeast into a jar of warm water and sugar. The jar must be deep enough to keep the slugs and snails from crawling out. You can also buy containers (traps) designed specifically for this purpose at garden supply stores. [1] X Research source A suggested mixture is two cups of warm water, a packet of dry yeast, and one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar. The salt will help ensure that the slugs and snails die before they have a chance to escape. If you're going to dump the slugs and/or mixture in your garden or compost pile, skip the salt; it'll make your soil too salty. [2] X Research source"

You can leave them in the garden to decompose and contribute to the organic matter of the soil, or put them in a compost pile (either way, crushing them will hasten the process, if you are not squeamish about doing so).
