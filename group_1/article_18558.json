      "content": "Check out trending and viral videos to see what's popular. There isn't a 100% guaranteed formula for viral videos , but you can take a look at what's trending to make a similar video. Tap the magnifying glass in the top right corner to see a list of viral videos under \"You may like\". The trending or viral video topics are marked with a staggered red arrow that's pointing up. After you create a video similar to the ones that you see are trending, make sure to use the right hashtags! Use the same hashtags used in those viral and trending videos to ensure that your video is seen by the same audience."

      "title": "Try to make original videos, not copycat videos.",
      "content": "Try to make original videos, not copycat videos. Since many TikTok users lip-sync to popular songs, an original video will stand out. But don't make videos that are all the same, since that can get boring. A TikTok user who makes original and interesting content is more likely to gain more followers than a TikTok user who only produces unoriginal content. If you're interested in making lip-sync videos, make sure you keep it interesting. You can look at popular artists and mimic elements from them. After you've made a video , help it succeed by adding a caption, hashtags, sound effects, and awesome transitions . Once you have a few videos posted, look back and see which performed better. Which video prompted more comments or interactions from your audience? Which video was watched again and again? You can see what worked and continue making similar videos."

      "content": "If you see a doable trend, follow along! As long as the trend isn't dangerous to yourself or others, you might as well post a video that joins in. For example, the ice bucket challenge earned the video creators lots of followers and tons of views. However, don't let a trend pass you by for too long! If you create a video after a trend has ended, you'll miss out on all the peak interest and views."

      "title": "Collaborate with other accounts to get more followers.",
      "content": "Collaborate with other accounts to get more followers. Their followers are more likely to follow you as well if you collab with a popular influencer. Know that popular accounts get requests to collab all the time, so your request may take a while to get to. If you can't easily collab with someone, stitch one of their videos. When you see a video that you like, tap the share arrow icon, scroll the bottom row to the right, and tap Stitch ."

      "title": "You can see a list of popular and trending hashtags by tapping the search icon.",
      "content": "You can see a list of popular and trending hashtags by tapping the search icon. For example, if the video you're posting features a duet, tag it with #duet . If your video does not feature a duet, this tag is irrelevant and will not get you any views. So make sure you're using appropriate hashtags on your videos! You have the option to add hashtags when you're prompted to add a description to your post. Tap # Hashtags to start tagging. Avoid looking spammy by adding no more than 5 hashtags to your video. More than that and your video could be considered spammy, which might lose followers."

      "title": "This is another easy trick that you can try.",
      "content": "This is another easy trick that you can try. Require anyone who wants to enter that they tag a friend, follow the account, and repost the video. That way, your account gets more eyes from different audiences that have a small chance of following your account. People love free things, so it's easy to gain followers and get your video reposted by multiple accounts if you're offering something that is appealing to your audience."

      "content": "You can buy followers, but beware of scams. Buying followers will get you to 1k easily in no time at all, but there are associated risks, like being shadowbanned or having your account hacked . Purchased followers also do not mean that you have a larger audience because the followers you purchased most likely will not interact with your content . If you just want to inflate the number of followers you have, buying is right for you. But if you want those followers as your audience, purchasing them may not help you."

      "content": "TikTok has a \"Promote\" feature so more eyes will see your content. And that means that you have a better chance of gaining a fair amount of followers. This method will cost you money, but if you wanted to buy followers, this is a more organic and official way. To promote a video, view it after you've posted it, tap the share arrow, then tap Promote , which features a flame icon. From there, tap Customized promotions for other goals > More followers > Next , define your audience or let TikTok choose for you, then tap Next > Next > Pay and start promotion .

      "content": "Don't corner yourself to just TikTok, but branch out to the other communities. You might be missing your followers on Instagram or YouTube by not sharing your TikTok content there. Even a simple post on any other social media platform that says, \"Hey guys, I posted a new TikTok video. Check it out!\" will work to drive views and followers to your TikTok account. Reposting a TikTok video on another platform includes your TikTok username, so your other followers can easily find you between platforms. To share your video from TikTok, tap the curved arrow on one of your videos, and select a social media platform to share it to."
