      "content": "Chart your cycle. In order to determine when sexual intercourse will most likely result in pregnancy, it is useful to know when you are most fertile. Fertility is highest during ovulation, and charting your cycle can help determine when ovulation usually occurs within your cycle. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The first day of your period, mark the number \"1\" on the calendar for that day. The first day of your next period, mark a \"1\" on the calendar that day, and mark the number of days in your last cycle on the day prior. Ovulation (releasing an egg from the ovary) typically occurs during the midpoint of your cycle. For example, in a typical 28 day cycle, ovulation tends to occur on day 14. In a 30 day cycle, ovulation should be expected on day 15. You can begin attempts to get pregnant before the end of your first cycle of course. Obviously, you should quit birth control before you try to get pregnant. Have sex more frequently within a few days of this midpoint to increase chances of pregnancy. Reader Poll: We asked 399 wikiHow readers who've tracked their periods, and 52% of them agreed that the best way to do so is by using a period tracker app or calendar. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Use OPK sticks.",
      "content": "Use OPK sticks. Ovulation predictor kits (OPK sticks) are a commonly-used device that can determine when a woman is ovulating to help time sex. Start using OPK sticks two days before the midpoint of your cycle, and continue using them until you either have a positive result or start your next cycle. Use them once per day. Cheap, generic sticks are usually adequate. They look like pregnancy tests and you can either pee on the wick at the end or immerse it in pee in a cup (read the actual instructions). Try to use the OPK sticks at the same time each day. Ovulation can vary widely between cycles and different women. Mark your OPK test results on the calendar for each day. It's important to know that they detect something called the LH surge (luteinizing hormone) from the pituitary gland in your brain that tells your ovaries it is time to ovulate. It doesn't happen immediately however, the LH surge precedes actual ovulation by 24 to 36 hours. Have sex after a positive OPK test. Because the OPK test will register as positive prior to actual ovulation, you can wait up to 12 hours before having sex. However, having sex early will not decrease your chances of pregnancy, as long as you continue having sex regularly during ovulation."

      "title": "Examine cervical mucous.",
      "content": "Examine cervical mucous. The cervix produces several kinds of mucous, which can be good indicators of fertility. To determine if ovulation is occurring, examine your cervical mucous by inserting clean hands into your vagina, and observing the qualities of the mucous. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Sticky or scant findings indicate you are probably not ovulating yet. Creamy consistency indicates you may ovulate soon. Wet, watery, or stretchy mucous indicates ovulation is likely very close. Very wet mucous that can stretch between your fingers for an inch or more indicates ovulation is right around the corner or in progress. This is the ideal time for intercourse. This type of mucous is like a superhighway for sperm to cruise up into the cervix and reproductive tract. At the cervix, sperm is chemically changed, or capacitized, to enable it to fertilize the egg. This process takes about 12 hours, so in order to co-ordinate actual ovulation with capacitized sperm, wait 12 hours after your positive OPK test before you have sex again. This will time your actual ovulation with the maximum number of live capacitized sperm in your system."

      "content": "Measure body temperature. Basal body temperature is the lowest body temperature a healthy person has during the day. Increases in basal body temperature can indicate the beginning of ovulation. [3] X Research source In order to measure your basal body temperature, you must take your temperature with a basal thermometer (a thermometer with a very fine scale) right after awakening in the morning. During ovulation, basal body temperature increases by 0.1 or 0.2 degrees, and is sustained at this level until the next cycle begins. By regularly charting your temperature, you will be able to predict when you are likely to next ovulate."
