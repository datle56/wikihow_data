      "title": "Consider your skin type.",
      "content": "Consider your skin type. Foundation and concealer both come in a variety of formulas, and some work better than others depending on the type of skin that you have. Oil-free powders and liquids with a matte finish work well for oily and combination skin, while moisturizing liquid and cream foundations with a dewy finish are best for dry skin. If you have normal skin, you can use any formula. [1] X Research source If you have very sensitive skin, mineral foundations, which contain natural ingredients, are usually your best option. They usually come in powder formulas, but you can find liquid versions as well."

      "title": "Consider your skin tone.",
      "content": "Consider your skin tone. Finding a color match isn't just about choosing a foundation and concealer that are as light or dark as your skin; it's also important to get the undertone right. You can either be cool, warm, or neutral. You're cool-toned if your veins are blue and burn easily in the sun, warm-toned if your veins are green and you tan easily, and you're neutral if you have an equal number of blue and green veins. When you're choosing a concealer shade to cover your freckles, match it the skin surrounding the freckles, not the freckles themselves. You'll wind up drawing more attention to the freckles if you use a concealer that's darker than your skin. [2] X Research source If you're having trouble finding the right shade to match your skin tone, ask one of the makeup artists or sales assistants at the store to help. They're usually trained to pick out the right shades, so they can point you in the right direction. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider coverage.",
      "content": "Consider coverage. You may assume that a full coverage foundation is necessary to cover your freckles, but that's not always true. If the rest of your skin is relatively clear, you may prefer a light foundation or even a tinted moisturizer or BB cream to just even out your complexion and then follow up with a concealer over the freckles. If you have other discolorations on your face that you want to hide, a medium or full coverage foundation may be a better option."

      "title": "Test some samples.",
      "content": "Test some samples. Even if you think you've got the formula and color right for your foundation and concealer, you should test it out on your skin to make sure that they really work with your complexion. Department store makeup counters and specialty cosmetics stores, such as Sephora or Ulta, usually have testers of the foundations available, so you can see if it works for you. [4] X Research source When you're testing a foundation or concealer, it's best to apply it along your jawline so you can see how it looks against the color of your neck, which is usually lighter than your face. You don't want to get a harsh line between your face and neck that lets everyone know you're wearing makeup. [5] X Research source Make sure to check out the makeup that you're testing in natural light. Harsh, fluorescent store lighting can cause shadows that make it difficult to tell if a shade really blends into your skin tone. [6] X Research source Even if you don't plan to purchase foundation and concealer at a department or specialty store, it's a good idea to visit a counter to talk to one of the makeup artists. They can suggest shades that work for you, so when you head to the drugstore, you'll have a better idea of what foundation and concealer shades you should be considering. Don't be afraid to ask a sales assistant or makeup artist for a sample of a foundation or concealer before you purchase it. Not only can you check the shade out in different types of light to see if it really flatters you, you can wear the products a few times and make sure that they don't irritate your skin."

      "title": "Use a moisturizer.",
      "content": "Use a moisturizer. You want your skin to be as smooth as possible before you apply any makeup because otherwise, it may cling to rough, dry patches and look cakey. Allow your moisturizer to sink into your skin for at least five minutes before moving onto the next step of your routine. If you have oily skin, opt for a water-based moisturizer that won't clog your pores. [7] X Research source For dry skin, choose an oil-based moisturizer that can effectively hydrate the skin. Thick creams are usually the best choice. [8] X Research source Combination skin usually does best with a water-based moisturizer that's light enough to hydrate without clogging the pores. However, it's a good idea to keep a thicker moisturizing cream on hand for times when you have dry patches too. [9] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, look for a moisturizer that is fragrance- and dye-free to minimize the chance of irritation. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply sunscreen.",
      "content": "Apply sunscreen. While freckles are often hereditary, sun exposure can make them darker, so you want to protect your face from UV rays before you apply your makeup. [11] X Research source Choose a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF of at least 15 that guards against UVA and UVB rays to ensure that you're full protected. [12] X Research source To save time when you're getting ready, you can opt for a moisturizer that contains an SPF, so you can moisturize and protect your skin in one step. When you're using a separate moisturizer, make sure that it's fully absorbed into your skin before applying your sunscreen."

      "title": "Apply a primer.",
      "content": "Apply a primer. You don't necessarily need to use primer everyday, but when you really want your makeup to last and prevent fading that might allow your freckles to show through, it is an important step. It can also fill in pores and fine lines, so your makeup has a smoother, more even look. Use your fingers to apply the primer so you can really work it into your skin. [13] X Research source Just as with your moisturizer, choose your primer based on your skin type. For oily skin, it's best to use an oil-free product that can help minimize shine. Dry skin works best with a hydrating primer that helps illuminate the skin."

      "title": "Apply your foundation.",
      "content": "Apply your foundation. You can apply it with your fingers or a brush, but when you're covering up freckles, it's best to use a sponge to press the foundation into the skin. That's because you'll get more coverage with the sponge. Blend the foundation carefully over your entire face, taking special care along your hairline, the sides of your face, and the jawline. A sponge can soak up liquid and cream foundations, which means you may waste your products. Dampen it slightly before you apply your makeup to keep it from absorbing the foundation. You don't need to worry if your freckles still show through your foundation. You can follow up with concealer."

      "title": "Dab concealer over your freckles.",
      "content": "Dab concealer over your freckles. If they're still visible through your foundation, you'll want to add extra coverage in those areas. To avoid applying too much, it helps to use a small, precise concealer brush that allows you to place the concealer in specific spots. When it comes to blending, your finger is the best tool. That's because the warmth from your skin really helps the concealer blend into your skin."

    {
      "title": "Brighten with blush.",
      "content": "Brighten with blush. Once you've made your freckles disappear with foundation and concealer, your complexion may be looking a little flat, so adding color to your cheeks can help add dimension to your face. Swipe the blush over the apples of your cheeks for the most flattering look. [14] X Research source Avoid blush shades that have a lot of brown in them because they'll be too similar in color to your freckles and give you a muddy look. Opt for pink and peach tones.

      "title": "Add warmth with bronzer.",
      "content": "Add warmth with bronzer. The areas around your freckles can sometimes look a little ashy with foundation and concealer over them, so it helps to put some color back into your face. Choose a matte bronzer that's not too dark. [16] X Research source When you're applying bronzer, think of the places on your face where the sun naturally hit. That means high points like the temples, cheekbones, and nose, not all over."

      "title": "Blend it all together.",
      "content": "Blend it all together. Before you set your makeup, you want to make sure that all of the products that you've applied are completely blended into your skin, so you don't have any harsh lines or streaks on your face. Use a clean brush to lightly go over your entire face and ensure that all of your foundation, concealer, bronzer, and blush are soft and blended. A fluffy powder brush works best for blending makeup across the entire face. Opt for one with synthetic bristles because it will work just as well with powder, liquid, and cream products.

      "title": "Apply a setting powder.",
      "content": "Apply a setting powder. To lock your foundation and concealer in place all day over your freckles, it helps to apply a powder that can absorb oil so your makeup doesn't break down. A colorless translucent powder is usually best. You can use a fluffy powder brush or a puff to carefully press the powder over your foundation and concealer to avoid lifting off any of your makeup. If you have dry skin, powder may not be necessary. If you have combination skin, you may only need to apply powder in your T-zone, which is the area that is usually oiliest. That's the forehead, nose, and chin."

      "title": "Use a setting spray.",
      "content": "Use a setting spray. The final step in your makeup routine should be a setting spray, which not only helps set your makeup but can get rid of a powdery look if you've applied too much. There are setting sprays for all skin types, so choose the best match for your complexion. Hold the setting spray an arm's length away from you, and spray it a few times. Don't apply too much, though, or your makeup may run."
