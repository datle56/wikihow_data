An investment banker on Wall Street will have a different dress code than a young Silicon Valley startup founder. Always err on the side of more formal attire to appear professional and in control; you can seldom go wrong with a good suit. To assert a CEO level of power and status no matter what the industry, a good general rule is to think about dressing to look slightly older than you are. When in doubt, dress in black, grey, white, or navy for a classic look. [1] X Expert Source Cassandra Sethi Personal Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 31 August 2021."

      "content": "Grasp Business vs Business Casual. When your occasion requires it, “business attire” generally calls for a dark matched suit in a solid or subtly pinstriped color, with a white dress shirt, conservative tie, and leather dress shoes. “Business casual” requires a dress shirt and slacks at minimum, with a jacket like a blazer or sport coat optional. For your best bet in a business casual situation, don a jacket and tie and then remove one or both if the atmosphere appears more casual on arrival. [3] X Research source Remember that a CEO can and should dress at or above the level of clients and employees, so it’s okay to be slightly more formal than others at a business casual event."

If meeting with foreign partners or customers, do some research on business customs in their country and make adjustments to your wardrobe—like covering more skin or choosing something more formal, for example—if it would be more appropriate and make them feel more comfortable.

      "content": "Gauge a social situation. Choose slightly less formal attire for a social event associated with your business. If the event doesn’t call for a specific dress code, try a light gray or dark brown suit for daytime events, or simply shed your jacket to stick with your slacks and button-down. You can also opt for more creative “social suits” in lighter colors or vivid patterns if the invitation says “suits and ties for men” (generally acceptable for events like brunches or church outings).

      "content": "Make wearable choices for travel. If you need to make a business trip, keep attire professional but look for fabrics that won’t wrinkle as easily or that advertise anti-wrinkling. For instance, choose a wool suit over a linen suit to travel in. Take off your coat so it doesn’t wrinkle during travel, and even opt for a sweater or more casual slacks if appropriate.

Look for shoulders that lie flat and have the seam match the length of the bone underneath it. Jacket buttons should close without strain and should not make the lapels hang forward or the lower part of the jacket flare out like a skirt. The jacket sleeve length should allow for half an inch of the shirt sleeve to show beyond it. The length of the jacket overall should end at about the middle of your hand with arms relaxed at your sides. Trousers should fall with a small “break” at the top of the shoe, making contact but without more than one wrinkle. The seat of the trousers should fall in a straight line without wrinkles or sags.

      "content": "Pay attention to details. Choose fabric, buttons, lapels, and vents according to weather, functionality, and your preferred style. Wool fabrics can be worn all year round in a medium weight. Opt for cotton or linen suits in hot climates, but note that they don’t travel well because they crease and wrinkle easily. Pick a jacket lining that adds a pop of color or pattern, but still complements the shirts that you wear with it. One-button suits are more contemporary and suit a slighter build. Three-buttons suits work well on men of medium or tall build, and should have the first and middle buttons or only the middle button fastened when standing. Choose a notch lapel, which has a triangular notch separating the top and bottom of the lapel; a peak lapel that has edges pointing up toward the shoulders; or a shawl lapel, which is one long curve without breaks or points. A single vent at the rear of the jacket is common, but double vents provide a contemporary European look."
