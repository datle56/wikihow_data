When you're leaving a toxic relationship, it's typically best not to draw things out—but it's not always easy to just up and leave, especially if you're living with your partner or have kids with them. Think about what you'll need to get out and move on with your life and make sure everything you need is in place before you pull the plug on the relationship.

You want to make sure that you can get out safely and that you won't have to interact with them again."

      "content": "Let your partner know that you are ending the relationship. Choose a time when both you and your partner are relatively calm. Sit down with your partner in a private place with no distractions and tell them on no uncertain terms that you think it's best for both of you to end the relationship. Be clear that you're done and you don't intend to have any further contact with them. [4] X Research source If you're concerned that your partner might threaten you or get violent, you might want to have this conversation in a more public place, such as a park.

I've thought it through, and I want to end it.\""

If you lived together, this might require a little effort or you might need to get friends to come over and help. [5] X Research source When you're leaving a relationship like this, keep in mind that you might not be able to take everything with you. Your safety and well-being are more important than stuff.

[6] X Research source Let your friends and family know that you're going full no-contact as well. Your ex might try to reach out to you through them. If you're concerned that your ex might start trying to hunt you down or follow you around, you might also consider taking out a restraining order .

[16] X Research source Toxic partners can also use this tactic to make you feel trapped in the relationship. They'll make it seem as though you're lucky to have them and no one else would be interested in being in a relationship with you.

They might tell you that it's unfair of you to deny them something that they want."
