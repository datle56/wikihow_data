This particular example is called an equilateral triangle, because all three sides are of equal length. But remember that the perimeter formula is the same for any kind of triangle."

If the sides are measured in terms of a variable like x, your answer should also be in terms of x.

The side of the triangle opposite the right angle is always the longest side, and it is called the hypotenuse. Right triangles show up frequently on math tests, and fortunately there is a very handy formula for finding the length of unknown sides!"

If you know the length of side a = 6 , and the hypotenuse c = 10 , then you should set the equation up like so: 6 2 + b 2 = 10 2 ."

If you are looking for the hypotenuse, simply add the two values together and find the square root of this number to find the length. If it is a side length you are missing, you must do a bit of easy subtraction, and then take the square root to get your side length. [6] X Research source In the first example, square the values in 3 2 + 4 2 = c 2 and find that 25= c 2 . Then calculate the square root of 25 to find that c = 5 . In the second example, square the values in 6 2 + b 2 = 10 2 to find that 36 + b 2 = 100 . Subtract 36 from each side to find that b 2 = 64 , then take the square root of 64 to find that b = 8 ."
