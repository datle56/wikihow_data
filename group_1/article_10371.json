For oily skin, try a mattifying primer. You can also find color correcting primers for skin issues like redness. For example, you can find a green-tinted primer to neutralize redness.

[5] X Research source According to makeup artist Franklin Sanderson, \"You can also use your concealer to cover other imperfections on your skin.\" [6] X Expert Source Frankie Sanderson Makeup Artist & Stylist Expert Interview. April 14, 2020. Do not rub the concealer, as this makes the coverage uneven. If you can still see the dark circles, you could try doing a color correction concealer before applying your foundation and regular concealer. If you have fair skin, apply a peach or apricot concealer to counteract the blue tones prevalent in most under eye circles. For medium skin, try an orange concealer. Dark skin tones can use darker oranges or red. [7] X Research source Consider using a stick concealer. They use a thicker, creamier formula that covers dark areas more effectively. Keep in mind that a stick concealer may trigger an acne breakout on oily skin. If this is a concern, use a liquid concealer. Load your puff up with powder and gently press it under your eyes. This will add a little more coverage and help your concealer to last throughout the day."
