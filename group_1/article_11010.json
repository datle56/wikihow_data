      "content": "A cuddle buddy is someone who offers non-sexual physical affection. Cuddling doesn’t have to be reserved for romantic or sexual relationships—we all need affection and physical touch now and then! Cuddle buddies are people who will give you that, but without the expectation of things progressing further. Your cuddle buddy might be someone you know and with whom you’ve set up some ground rules about the nature of your relationship, but there are also cuddle buddy social events in which you cuddle with consenting strangers. You could also hire a professional cuddle buddy to offer you physical affection, or even become a professional cuddle buddy yourself!"

      "content": "Friends with benefits engage in platonic sexual activity. Part of the point of a cuddle buddy, on the other hand, is that there’s no expectation for sex—just good old-fashioned snuggling up together! A friends with benefits relationship involves sex, but without the emotional intimacy or commitment of a romantic relationship. [1] X Research source Of course, these are the differences in broad strokes—the particulars of a friends-with-benefits or cuddle buddies relationship depend on the people involved and the rules they’ve outlined together. For instance, some friends with benefits may agree not to hang out outside the bedroom to avoid becoming more emotionally intimate and endangering the platonic nature of the relationship. Cuddle buddies, too, may establish rules around what sort of cuddling is allowed—for example, maybe they’d allow hugging"

      "content": "Ask a friend if they’ll be a cuddle buddy. Have a friend you don’t have romantic or sexual feelings for but who you’d love to cuddle with while watching a movie? Consider asking directly if they’d be up for a platonic cuddling arrangement. You could also ask a family member you’re close to if they’d cuddle with you. Some people fall into cuddle buddy-esque relationships with platonic pals naturally, but it’s typically best to be straightforward about your needs, expectations, and boundaries to make sure no lines get crossed. Hey, Jeff, we get along so well, and you’re so friendly and fun, that I was wondering if you’d be interested in a cuddle buddy relationship, where we sometimes cuddle while we’re hanging out but without things moving beyond the platonic cuddle zone? Ally, you’re one of my best friends and I feel so safe with you! Since we’re both pretty physically affectionate people, do you think you’d be down for a cuddle buddy arrangement, where we snuggle but without things escalating any further?"

      "content": "Consider cuddling with a body pillow. While body pillows aren’t the same as real people, snuggling with a body pillow —especially if it’s shaped like a person or animal—can help you feel safer and more secure. Whether you’re missing a person you’re used to cuddling with (like an ex, a partner who’s away, or an actual cuddle buddy), a body pillow can be a solid substitute. Body pillows are also great options for people who’d rather not cuddle with a real person. There are even stuffed animals called Cuddle Buddys that you can personalize with photos of loved ones, to make your stuffed animal snuggle sesh more meaningful."

      "content": "Avoid picking someone you have feelings for. To clarify, that means romantic or sexual feelings, not positive, warm feelings generally (you probably should cuddle with someone who you like and feel safe around!). But picking an ex you’re not over or someone you’ve got a crush on and hope to date someday isn’t advisable. [4] X Research source It’s not just unfair to you to agree to a relationship that can’t give you what you want, it’s unfair to your buddy to agree to be platonic when you’re harboring secret more-than-friends feelings."

      "content": "Agree on ground rules with your buddy. Before embarking on a cuddle buddy journey with someone, set some basic ground rules about what you want from the relationship and what you expect from the other person. Be sure you both clarify exactly what you’re looking for (and not looking for) and what you’re comfortable with, and that you understand the other person’s boundaries. It’s imperative to respect your cuddle buddy’s boundaries and to find a cuddle buddy whom you trust to respect your boundaries as well. For instance, maybe in your cuddle buddy relationship, kissing is allowed, but French kissing isn’t. State this from the get-go and be sure your buddy understands and agrees."

      "content": "Avoid watching sexy movies together. Cuddle buddies often meet up to literally Netflix and chill, but one steamy sex scene can compromise the integrity of the cuddle buddy relationship. As a general rule, avoid movies with explicit sex or anything that might set either of your loins aflame. Maybe this also means not lighting candles or cuddling in your bed or anything that might signify “sexy time.” It’s up to you and your buddy, but be aware of what might trigger sexy feelings or impulses and try to avoid them."

      "content": "Try not to get jealous of your buddy’s other buddies or lovers. You and your buddy might be exclusive, or you might not be. In either case, if jealousy rears its ugly head, it’s a sign you’re feeling more emotionally attached to your buddy than you probably should be. If you find yourself getting possessive of your buddy, take a step back and reevaluate whether you should continue with the relationship. If you get jealous, don’t beat yourself up about it—it happens to the best of us! But like a friends with benefits relationship, the cuddle buddy relationship is most successful when both partners aren’t possessive of one another."

      "content": "Check in with your buddy regularly. Remember that the rules of the cuddle buddy relationship aren’t hard and fast, and your boundaries can change over time to become more or less flexible. Plus, your feelings towards your buddy will likely change over time as well. For these reasons, checking in every few weeks or months (your mileage may vary) to see how your buddy is doing with the relationship and to see if any rules need reevaluating is always a good idea. Try asking something like, “Now that we’ve been doing this for X weeks, I wanted to see how you’re feeling about everything. Any rules need revisiting or tweaked?” If you want to address something, try, “When we first started doing this, I felt fine with lying down and cuddling, but I actually think it’s feeling a little too intimate to me now. Can we just stick to sitting up and cuddling?”"
