Power factor is a ratio representing the real power used to do work and the apparent power supplied to an alternating current circuit, a value ranging from 0 to 1. Therefore, power factor is your real power P, in watts, divided by your apparent power S, measured in Volt-ampere (VA), or: PF = P / S [5] X Research source"

If your circuit is powered by a battery, the current will be DC. [6] X Research source Almost everything in your house will be AC. Outlets, light fixtures, and the like will almost always be AC. In most countries, the electricity provided by utility mains is AC current (also called alternating current).

You will need to know what kind of resistor(s) are part of your circuit and how much resistance they are creating to the electricity flowing through them. Since each circuit will be different (some simple circuits may not even have resistors), you will have to investigate your circuit and locate the resistors for your unique case and their resistance in Ohms (Ω). The wiring your electricity flows through will also have resistance. This will likely be negligible, unless the wiring is very poorly manufactured, damaged, or your circuit conducts electricity over a long distance. The formula for resistivity is as follows: Resistance = (resistivity x length)/area [13] X Research source"
