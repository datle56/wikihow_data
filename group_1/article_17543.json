      "content": "Test out planks that focus on one side at a time, like side or windmill planks. [1] X Expert Source Christopher Carreiro Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 2 March 2021. With enough core strength, it’s possible to switch from straight planks to ones that strengthen one side at a time. Press one forearm side of your body on the ground and lift up so that the side of one foot and one forearm and foot are on the ground and the rest of your body is in the air. Balancing in this position is a great one-sided core exercise. [2] X Research source You can rest your free hand on your upward-facing hip to help balance. Try holding this for a few seconds at first, moving up to 30 seconds or a few minutes as your core strength improves over time. A more intense version of the side plank is to “windmill” one side up while in a straight plank, by lifting one side into the air, returning it to the ground, and switching sides."

      "content": "Do chest presses with one arm to isolate the muscles on either side. To do a one-arm chest press, lift a dumbbell into the air with one arm while laying on a bench with your feet flat on the ground. Be sure to use a lower weight than you would for a normal chest press, as too much weight can cause your arm to give out and fall to one side or the other. [3] X Research source Start with 3 sets of 5 to 10 reps, with 1 minute long rests in between."

      "content": "Try out a Pallof press or single-arm row to work both sides of your core. Both cable-core or “Pallof presses” and one-arm rows allow you to strengthen one side of your core with a simple pulling motion. Pallof presses involve pulling a tied-off cable toward your middle-chest area with the handle held sideways, while a single-arm row can be done on a rowing machine by pulling the handle toward your body with one arm. [4] X Research source Try doing 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps, with 1 minute long rests. If you can do more reps with good form, you should do so. For these exercises, it’s important to keep your arms fully straight at the extended portion of the motion, without locking your elbows, and then pulling the cable in with a simple bend at the elbow."

If your lower abdomen has fat deposits that cover your muscles, while your upper abs are well defined, you can burn the fat with cardio. Fat collects in your lower abdomen naturally, and this area is one of the most resistant to loss of fat, but cardio will help.

      "content": "Do crunches and sit-ups sparingly to avoid emphasizing your upper abs. If your core routine focuses on crunches, you may end up with strong abs in just the upper region of your abdomen. If you are trying to even out the top and bottom halves of your abs, try replacing crunches with exercises that target just one side, like one-armed planks and chest presses, or pulling exercises like Pallof presses and one-armed rows. [7] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 147 wikiHow readers which type of crunches they found most effective for building ab muscles, and 54% of them said elbow-to-knee crunches. [Take Poll] So, they're a good exercise to try to get results without over-training."

In cases like this, where your ab muscles are uneven in their arrangement, there is very little you can do. [8] X Research source The overall shape and position of muscles, like many other aspects of your body, are determined by your genetic code, and cannot be changed.

      "content": "Check whether your lower abs seem to be pushed out. If your upper abs seem fine, but your lower abs seem to stick out, you may have an issue with posture or fat distribution. When you notice this in a mirror, turn to the side without changing your posture to see if you are standing up straight, or if your shoulders are hunched.

Most people have an uneven amount of fat between their upper and lower abdomen, though exercise can help burn the fat."

      "content": "Conduct a bend-over test to see if you have a curve in your spine . In rare cases, uneven abs are caused by a curved spine or misaligned vertebrae, including cases of scoliosis. One way to check for a curved spine is to bend forward as though you are touching your toes and see if your arms hang at different lengths. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In an un-curved spine, your arms will hang down to about the same spot. If you notice a bend or curve in your spine, you should see a doctor to confirm whether your uneven abs are related and find treatment. In addition to being medically necessary, treatment for scoliosis and other spine conditions may correct your uneven abs."

      "content": "Evaluate your exercise and athletic routines to see if they favor one side. If one side of your ab muscles seems bigger than the other, there is likely a reason for the difference. Not isolating each side in your core workouts and spending years playing a sport that emphasizes one side over the other can cause your muscles to develop unevenly. [12] X Research source Sports that can lead to this include golf, tennis, badminton, softball, and baseball. This can be changed by making adjustments to your exercise routine."

Getting into a routine of checking your posture every time you sit down or stand up can give you a chance to correct your posture throughout the day.

      "content": "Strengthen your back and core muscles to help improve your posture. Poor posture is often caused by weak or uneven back muscles, which end up even weaker as you slouch or stand improperly. Planking , bridges, back extensions, and side leg raises can all help set you up for success as you improve your posture. [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Planking involves holding an elevated, straight position with your toes and forearms or hands resting on the ground. Bridges require you to lay on the ground with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Lift your abdomen upward into the air until you form a bridge shape with your body. Back extensions are another on-the-floor exercise where you kick your legs into the air and try to hold them up as vertically as possible, keeping your shoulders flush with the ground."

Having tightness in your shoulder muscles, as many lifters and serious gym-goers do, could raise one side of your body more than the other, giving the appearance of lopsided abs. If your spine seems straight but one shoulder looks raised, consider getting a massage or using a back roller to loosen those muscles. [15] X Research source"
