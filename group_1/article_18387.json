Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker. Bottoms up! Here’s to taking everything in moderation… including moderation. Here’s to hell… that our stay there be as fun as our way there. May we all have the chance to prove that money can’t make us happy! Champagne to our real friends, real pain to our sham friends. May our children have rich fathers and beautiful mothers! A toast to bread! Because without bread, there’d be no toast! As you slide down the banister of life, may you miss all the splinters. Everyone should believe in something. I believe I’ll have another drink!"

Here’s to the temperance supper with water in glasses tall. And coffee and tea to end with—and me not there at all. Drink to a fair woman, who, I think, is the most entitled to it. For if anything drives men to drink, she certainly can do it. A glass in the hand’s worth two on the shelf, so drink it down and refresh yourself! To friends: as long as we are able to lift our glasses from the table. Here’s to our guest—Don’t let him rest. But keep his elbow bending. ‘Tis time to drink—Full time to think tomorrow—when you’re mending. Here’s to the bottle which holds a store of imprisoned joy and laughter!

Simply raise your glass, bottle, or can, and shout out your good wishes. Here are a few funny beer cheers to get you started: Here’s to the ones who love us, the losers who lost us, and the lucky b ***** who get to meet us.* Here’s to the fall of the Roman Empire. May ours be just as memorable. Let’s raise a beer to all the days that end in Y. Beer may be mankind's worst enemy… but the bible says love your enemy. We drank to your health in company. We drank to your health alone. We drank to your health so many times we nearly ruined our own! If the ocean were beer and I were a duck, I’d swim to the bottom and never come up. But the ocean’s not beer, and I’m not a duck. So pass me a bottle and shut the hell up! Here’s to beer, which often makes one see double and feel single. Life’s a waste of time and time’s a waste of life. Let’s get wasted all the time and have the time of our lives. May we get so drunk we think our greatest problems are our greatest assets. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. When life’s a b ** , beer is a must."

      "content": "Stand and raise your glass to draw attention. Unless you’re at a small, intimate dinner party, you’ll probably have to cut through some chatter to get everyone’s attention. The best way to do this is to stand up and hold your glass at about shoulder height. [7] X Research source If standing up and raising your glass doesn’t get anyone’s attention, try saying something like, “I’d like to make a toast,” in a loud, clear voice. Don’t clang anything against your glass. Even though they do it all the time on TV, it’s considered rude in real life. Plus, you might break your glass."

      "content": "Introduce yourself and how you know the person you’re toasting. Introducing yourself and briefly explaining how you know the person you’re toasting gives the rest of the crowd context. Try telling a short story about meeting or spending time with the person you’re toasting. [8] X Research source Just make sure to keep it snappy so you don’t annoy the rest of the people there. For example: “My name is Kim Sorensen. Jessica has been my best friend since we met on the first day of kindergarten, when I tripped and fell face-first into a mud puddle. She helped me up and said, ‘Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone you fell.’ We both looked down at the mud coating my clothes and started to laugh.”"

Then, go ahead and share your favorite funny toast. It doesn’t have to be anything elaborate. Or, if you prefer something simpler, a good toast might be: “May you have a bright and happy future!” “Cheers to the birthday girl!” “To many more years together!”"
