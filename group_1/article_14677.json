Make sure your ladylike outfit fits the occasion and that you feel comfortable and confident in your choice. Wear a pantsuit or tea-length skirt to a meeting or the office. Put on shorts of an appropriate length and a light blouse to run errands during the summer.

It's also a good idea to avoid wearing excessively tight clothing to stay classy. [2] X Research source Exposing some of your back, ankles, or clavicle keeps your outfit classy yet feminine. Try to keep your skirts, shorts, and dresses 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) above the knee or longer. V-neck blouses or shirts are appropriate for work, while an off-the-shoulder top is good for a night out or casual wear."
