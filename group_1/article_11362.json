      "content": "Part your hair to create a triangle in your roots. Take a comb and place the tip of it 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) above your hairline, in the center of your head. You may need to go a bit further back, like 1 in (2.5 cm) or even to the high, flat part of your head where a comb will balance. Then, draw a downward diagonal line from the center of your head to the end of your eyebrow. Then, repeat on the other side. Pull your bangs section towards the middle to separate it from the rest of your hair. [1] X Research source You should have a triangle-like shape with the point a few inches above your hairline. The sides of the triangle should slope down along the sides of your forehead. Comb the triangle of bangs forward and pin the rest of your hair back or put it in a ponytail to keep it out of your face."

      "content": "Dampen your hair if you're trimming grown-out straight bangs. If this is your first time cutting your bangs, it's a good idea to keep your hair dry so you can cut it the exact length that you want it. If you're just trimming your bangs, spritz some water onto them so your hair is going in the right direction and lying flat on your forehead. Try using a flat iron on dry bangs to make them straight. It's important that your bangs don't have any wave to them so you can make a straight cut. Keep in mind that doing this with dry hair will be more accurate, but it may also be more difficult. Mist your hair all over with water to get the best results."

      "content": "Determine the length and angle of your bang. Straight bangs come in different styles, so figure out exactly how you want them to look before you cut them. Some people like their bangs to go straight across their forehead above their eyebrows for an edgier look, and others like longer bangs that angle down as they meet with the rest of their hair.

Gather the triangle of bangs and grasp the hair between your index and middle fingers so it's even with the tip of your nose. Your bangs won't be this long, but it's a good starting point in case the bangs don't look perfect right away."

      "title": "Cut across the hair in front of your fingers in a straight horizontal line.",
      "content": "Cut across the hair in front of your fingers in a straight horizontal line. Make a clean snip across the section of hair. Then, move up 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) and follow the same process to create another horizontal cut. Continue cutting your bangs in 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) increments until you reach the desired length. Use a mirror to check the length and make sure both sides of your bangs are even. If your bangs are damp, comb them gently to avoid stretching the hair. Cut them 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) longer than the desired length because the hair will shrink up when it dries. If you want your bangs to angle downward at the ends, cut straight across from the middle of one eye to the middle of the opposite eye. Once you reach that point, begin to cut at a downward angle. Move to the other eye and cut at a downward angle until you reach the rest of your hair. The angle can be as steep or as subtle as you like. [3] X Research source It can help to gather your bangs and twist them once before you cut the straight line. This creates a rounded edge on both sides of your bangs, so the bangs are shorter in the front and longer on the sides."

Once your bangs are at your desired length, make them look more natural by taking your scissors and making small snips at the tips of your bangs.

If you want your bangs to be super straight and flat, straighten them with flat iron once they're dry. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, dry your bangs with a flat brush. Hold the brush close to your forehead and move it behind the dryer from roots to ends so you aren't adding volume to your bangs."

(In other words, from side-to-side, rather than front-to-back.) If you're looking for thicker bangs, you can draw a part farther back. This separates your bangs from the rest of your hair."

Move the hair on one side of the part towards the middle of your forehead and pin the hair on the side of your head back to keep it out of the way. You should now have a section of hair in the front center of your face that is separated from the rest of your hair. If you already have bangs, you should have a width already determined, so take your preexisting longer bangs and part them towards the middle, also separating them from the hairline."

      "content": "Run a comb through your bangs so they're smooth and straight. This may require you to dampen your hair with a spray bottle if your hair is naturally curly and your bangs have some bounce. Lightly mist your hair with a spray bottle and comb through so that your bangs are flat. If your hair is naturally wavy or straight, cutting bangs in dry hair is best so that you won't cut them too short. Never soak your bangs or make them completely wet. Your hair is longer when it is wet, so when it dries it will be shorter. To avoid cutting bangs that are too short, try to cut your bangs with slightly wet or dry hair. If your hair is very wet before you cut your bangs, blow dry them until they're 80% dry. When blow drying, make sure you are brushing bangs straight down, or in the opposite direction of your part. Don't blow dry bangs downward in the direction they normally would lie. This creates a \"rainbow effect\" in which your bangs have a high arch to them. It's difficult to cut bangs when they are like this, so it's better to create some volume in the opposite direction."

In other words, your hair should be pulled out to the side of your head at a 45-degree angle. Then, bring any other hair you will be cutting out to this angle before cutting. Hold your bangs between your pointer and middle finger and cut the hair below your fingers. If you aren't sure how long you want your bangs, start by cutting at the tip of your nose and ending in a diagonal at the bottom of your ear. This will create long, side-swept bangs. Make sure you are using scissors specifically designed for hair, as this will give you the best cut. If you want shorter bangs, start near the top of the nose, in line with the eye, and cut at a downward diagonal towards the middle of your ear. Always cut bangs longer when you start off -- you can always cut them shorter as you go, but you don't want your first cut to be too short, because there's no way to rewind from there. You can try cutting in 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) increments to make sure you don't cut too much of your bang off."

      "content": "Snip the ends of the bangs to create a softer, more natural look. After you have cut your bangs you may notice that there is a very straight line in your bangs. This tends to look awkward and unnatural, so you may want to give your bangs a little definition. Lift the hair back up to a 45-degree angle and cut parallel to the strands of hair in your bangs, making small snips at the tips of your bangs. If your hair is really thick or you want your bangs to have an even more natural look, you can use a razor made for hair or a hair thinning tool to thin out the ends of your bangs."

You never want to blow dry your bangs by brushing them straight down as this will leave your bangs with little volume. You can also run a flat iron through your bangs by pulling the flat iron upwards at your roots to create volume. You can also blow dry your bangs in the opposite direction of where they naturally fall to make them lay flat and give them a bit of curl at the bottom. As they are close to being dry, flip them back over and blow dry as usual."
