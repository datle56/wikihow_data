If you scrub too roughly, you'll deplete your skin's natural oils, and you'll irritate your acne. Always scrub your chest gently to get rid of dead skin cells. Take a shower every day. If you don't clean your skin, you invite sebum and bacteria to collect on its surface, causing acne. If you have long hair, consider putting it up when sleeping. The oils from your hair can clog pores on your body."

[4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chest acne is often the result of clogged hair follicles or pores, which causes sebum to build up. This ultimately leads to acne. Exfoliating can help in moderation, but exfoliating too much can actually increase acne. Stick to once a week (or even less) to make sure you don’t irritate your skin. Men tend to have chests covered with hair while women tend to wear more tight-fitting bras and tops. Both of these may contribute to chest acne, making exfoliation very important. Make sure to wipe down with a cleansing toilette or toner after excessive sweating during a workout."
