      "content": "Tell close friends and family in person, if possible. Pregnancy is often a special, exciting time, and your loved ones will likely want to celebrate the news in person. This is especially true for your partner, other children, parents , and in-laws, or anyone else who will play an important role in the new baby’s life. Tell them the news directly, or make a fun game of it. You’ll likely feel loved and supported by sharing the news in person. [7] X Research source If you can’t tell them in person, try to arrange a video chat, or send them a personalized card if all else fails. They may feel upset if they find out on social media with everyone else. Consider telling aunts, uncles, cousins, and close friends in person, as well. It’s up to you and your partner to decide who you want to tell in person, so don’t feel like you have to tell a certain person just because it’s expected. Every relationship and pregnancy is unique."

      "content": "Make a general announcement on social media. After you’ve announced your pregnancy to those closest to you, feel free to tell casual friends, acquaintances, and others. Since these relationships are less personal, it’s usually okay for them to find out through a social media post, though you can always tell them in person if you see them. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Include your due date. Whether you’re announcing your pregnancy in person or making a creative social media announcement, it’s a good rule of thumb to include your due date. This can be an exact date, a month, or even the season during which you’re expecting your baby. If you like, feel free to include your sonogram, the baby’s name (if you’ve chosen one), and the baby’s gender (if you want to reveal it)."

      "content": "Use a letter board. If you want to announce your pregnancy on social media but don’t want to be in the photo, a letter board is a great option. Choose a cute or funny quote to write on the board and surround it with cute props, like bibs, baby bottles, or your sonogram photo. Or, have your child or pet pose with the board. Remember to include your due date! [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Tell your partner as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Tell your partner as soon as possible. In most cases, it’s probably a good idea to tell your partner you’re pregnant before you tell anyone else. Let them know that you’re experiencing early symptoms of pregnancy , or wait until you take a pregnancy test to be sure. It’s up to you to choose how and when you want to tell them. [11] X Research source If you want to tell someone else first, that’s okay, too. It’s entirely up to you and what you feel most comfortable with. If you have other kids, tell them after you tell your partner. It’s usually a good idea to tell your parents, in-laws, and other close relatives or friends before making the general announcement."

      "title": "Make the official announcement after 12 weeks.",
      "content": "Make the official announcement after 12 weeks. While you can announce your pregnancy whenever you want, most medical providers recommend waiting until after the first trimester, or around 12 or 13 weeks. At this point, the risk for miscarriage is significantly lower, and if everything has gone okay, there’s a good chance the pregnancy will continue. [12] X Research source Ultimately, announce your pregnancy when it feels right to you. You may want to reveal the news to close family members, like your parents and in-laws, before announcing it to friends and acquaintances. Some people prefer to wait for their first ultrasound to announce their pregnancy. This way, you can use your sonogram photo in the announcement and reveal the gender if you choose to do so."
