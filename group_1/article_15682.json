      "content": "“Emphasized an image” means someone with an iPhone reacted to your image. Android and iOS aren’t perfectly compatible, so this message is a communication quirk that occurs when iPhone users react to an image using the iPhone’s Tapback feature. Basically, your contact reacted to your image with a “!!” emoji. But, since Android doesn’t use the same emojis or reactions, it doesn’t appear correctly on the Android screen. Instead, you’ll see “Emphasized an image” or “Emphasized a video.” [1] X Research source Just to clarify, if you see a message that reads “Emphasized…” in a convo with an iPhone user, they didn’t type that out. This text is an automated response you see when they press the “!!” reaction to a video or image. Why do I see the “!!” on text messages then? For reasons that only Tim Cook could possibly understand, the iPhone reactions work on text-only messages on most newer Android phones. If you’ve got an older phone, however, you may still see “Emphasized a message” when an iPhone user reacts with “!!” to one of your texts."

      "content": "“Emphasizing” correlates to the !! reaction, expressing excitement or shock. If you see that someone “emphasized” an image, this means that they selected the “!!” reaction. If they react with a ❤️ (heart emoji), you’ll see “Loved an image.” If they use a ❓(question mark emoji), you’ll see “Questioned a video.” The “Emphasized” message only appears for the ‼️ (double question mark emoji). The ‼️ (double question mark emoji) is typically used to indicate surprise. However, it could also be used to express urgency. The !! reaction is extremely context-dependent, so take what you know about the person using it into account when assessing what they mean. For example, if you shared a photo of yourself on vacation, someone might use the !! reaction to subtly say “Wow, you look good!” or, “Boy, that looks like a lot of fun!” Someone might also use the !! reaction if you share a video of your family to express joy about how much fun it looks like everyone is having."

      "content": "iPhone users can hold down messages to react to them. This feature is known as Tapback. To use it, simply press the message you want to react to and hold your finger down. Once the Tapback menu pops up, release your finger. Tap on the emoji you’d like to react to, and voila! Your reaction will appear alongside a small animation. [2] X Research source If the person you’re talking to has an iPhone, they’ll see the exact same thing as you do. If the person you’re talking to is on an Android, they’ll either see a modified version of the emoji you sent or they’ll get a short automated text message explaining the reaction (e.g., “Emphasized an image.”)"

      "content": "Yes, Android has a nearly identical reaction system. In Android, tap any message that you’d like to react to and hold the message down with your finger. Wait for the reaction menu to pop up, and tap on the specific emoji you’d like to react with. The other person will see your reaction (and a small animation, depending on the emoji you chose). [3] X Research source Android emoji reactions appear to work perfectly fine on iOS, so any Android reactions should be visible to your iPhone friends."
