Tell him what you’ll do if he crosses your boundaries, and be sure to follow through so he knows you mean it. [3] X Research source For instance, if he regularly raises his voice to you during disagreements, say, “I won’t tolerate you yelling. If you raise your voice, I’ll leave the room, and we can continue the discussion later.” Reader Poll: We asked 212 wikiHow readers, and 57% agreed that the best way to handle your husband saying something hurtful to you is to defend yourself in a respectful but firm way so he knows he can't talk to you like that .

      "title": "Talk to your husband about his behavior.",
      "content": "Talk to your husband about his behavior. Begin an open and honest conversation with him, but try not to come off accusatory, as egoistic people may be more sensitive to criticism. Explain to him in a non-confrontational way that you are unhappy with the direction your relationship is headed. Tell him how his behavior makes you feel, rooting your feelings in “I” language . For instance, “I feel hurt when you insult me.” [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try not to yell angrily at your spouse. Openly discussing your hurt and fears is a more effective communication technique. [5] X Research source If he’s sensitive to criticism, start the conversation with flattery. [6] X Research source For instance, say, \"You are such a great provider and strong presence in this relationship,\" and then go into your concerns carefully. Think about your husband's reactions and moods on a scale from 1-10, with 10 being the most upset and 1 being the most calm. Try to wait to confront him until he is at a 3 or lower to ensure he’s more amenable."

      "content": "Figure out where your husband is coming from. If his narcissistic tendencies are recent, try to find out what happened that made him start acting like this. Step into his shoes to figure out why he's hurting. [7] X Research source For example, if he's injured, or you've just gotten a recent job, he might feel like he isn't adequate enough. Thus, he may be trying to direct attention to himself. If your husband says, \"My life isn't where I hoped it would be,\" respond with something like, \"Maybe not, but we have a lot of good things. We can work on the things you aren't happy with.\" Ask questions to understand where he's coming from, and paraphrase what he tells you to show that you are listening when he talks. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Mirror what he says. If your husband says, \"I feel that no one appreciates what I do,\" respond with, \"I know exactly how that feels. That must be very difficult and hurtful.\""

Reach out to friends and family for support when you need it—but also when you don't. Regularly spending time with people other than your spouse will help you feel more independent and elevate your self-esteem. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Consider establishing a weekly ritual hangout with your good friends—and uphold it, even if your husband tries to get you to stay home to be with him."

When your husband does something—even something small—to show his love or kindness, enthusiastically acknowledge his efforts. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For instance, if he helps you carry the groceries inside the house, say, “Thank you! I’m so lucky to have such a kind and thoughtful husband.” This doesn’t mean giving false praise. People with narcissistic tendencies may crave praise, even when it’s undeserved. Instead, give him real, genuine, effusive acknowledgement—when he deserves it. Over time, he may work harder to earn your praise."

[11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try to reframe requests so that they seem to benefit him or stroke his ego in some way. For instance, if you want to go to a friend's house for dinner, don't say, \"I want to go eat dinner with Bob and Julie.\" Instead, say, \"They really love you; they'd love to have you at dinner.\" Convince him that doing things for you reflects well on him.

To make sure he listens to you, say, \"We each can spend half an hour talking about our days,\" or suggest switching back and forth between stories. When choosing activities on the weekend, frame things where he is the center of attention. If you want to go to the movies, say, \"I know you want to see that new movie, why don't we go see it?\""

Continue to be gentle, compassionate, understanding, and loving. Be honest as you assess his progress. Is he making an honest effort to change? Is he still treating you poorly? Is the relationship worth continuing to give so much of yourself to?"

[14] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source If your husband is resistant to therapy, emphasize that it’s for both of you, not just him: this may encourage him to agree to seek counseling with you. For example, say, \"I'd like to see a therapist to figure out how we can communicate better and enjoy each other's company more. I want to work on our relationship so we can both get what we need.\" This keeps the tone non-accusatory. Try using \"we\" instead of \"you\" when confronting him. This gives the illusion of a shared responsibility and blame instead of making it seem like all his fault. [15] X Research source For instance, instead of saying, \"You hurt me by being selfish,\" say, \"We hurt each other because we sometimes think more about ourselves than each other.\""

But if your husband doesn’t seem willing to try, know that reevaluating your marriage is an option, especially if his behavior towards you is in any way abusive. [16] X Research source If your husband is regularly dishonest, cruel, jealous, controlling, or manipulative, it can be hard to endure being with him. While it’s possible for someone with these tendencies to work through them with patience, hard work, and therapy, if your husband refuses to take responsibility for his treatment of you, it may be worth considering taking a break. Know that taking a break doesn’t mean you must go through with a separation or divorce, but if your partner consistently lies to you, puts you down, or mistreats you in any other way, your safety and well-being are paramount."
