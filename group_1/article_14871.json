      "title": "Dissolve 1 sachet or 1 teaspoon (4.2 grams) of Eno powder into 1 c (240 mL) of water.",
      "content": "Dissolve 1 sachet or 1 teaspoon (4.2 grams) of Eno powder into 1 c (240 mL) of water. Some Eno products—typically flavored commercial alternatives—come in prepackaged sachets. Eno is also available in bulk containers of powder. Regardless of which product you're using, start by filling your glass with water. Now, either dissolve 1 sachet or 1 teaspoon (4.2 grams) of powder into your cup of water. Use room-temperature water for the best results. Don't dissolve your Eno in other liquids, such as juice, as it might not be as effective at fighting stomach acidity."

      "title": "Drink Eno after meals.",
      "content": "Drink Eno after meals. When you experience heartburn or acid reflux, take Eno powder immediately. However, avoid taking Eno before meals as a preventative measure—it's much more effective as a treatment when you're experiencing symptoms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait 2 to 3 hours before taking another dose of Eno powder.",
      "content": "Wait 2 to 3 hours before taking another dose of Eno powder. Try to consume the Eno powder once it has dissolved in the water. After drinking your Eno, take note of your heartburn and acidity. After 2 to 3 hours, take another dose if symptoms persist. If they subside, hold off on dosing until they come back. Although you can wait until the bubbles settle down to drink Eno, you'll miss out on the bloating relief from the gas and pressure burp that they create."

      "title": "Take Eno only 2 times daily for a maximum of 14 days.",
      "content": "Take Eno only 2 times daily for a maximum of 14 days. For persistent heartburn, sour stomach, upset stomach, and acid indigestion take your Eno 1 to 2 times daily to relieve symptoms. If your symptoms persist after 14 days, stop taking Eno immediately and consult your doctor. Remember that Eno doesn't prevent acidity, it just provides relief for it. If your symptoms persist, ask your doctor about ways to prevent acidity for the best results. If you take Eno more than 2 times daily you risk changing your blood pH. This can result in alkalosis due to the alkaline nature of the ingredients."

      "content": "Consult your doctor before taking Eno if you have medical conditions. If you're suffering from a medical condition, taking any kind of medication, or are pregnant or breastfeeding, always consult your doctor before taking Eno. Bring the Eno package to your doctor just in case so they can take a look at the ingredients. If you don't have Eno yet, write down its ingredients—sodium bicarbonate and citric acid, also known as Svarjiksara or Nimbukamlam, respectively—to show to your doctor."

      "content": "Avoid drinking coffee and tea. A fresh cup of coffee or tea might be good for a morning boost, but both increase stomach acidity—especially on an empty stomach—which can lead to indigestion and heartburn. Try to cut them out of your diet to get the most out of your Eno. Try decaffeinated tea or coffee if you have to have a cup. Purchase low-acid coffee to minimize acid buildup."

Some experts believe that heartburn stems from a water shortage, particularly in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Regardless, it's recommended that men drink at least 9 cups (a little over 2L) of fluid each day. Women should drink 9 cups (a little over 2 liters) of fluid each day.
