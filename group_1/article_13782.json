You can use either a yoga mat or a gymnastics mat, but you want a mat that is going to provide some support to your head and neck and necessary cushion for comfort. Lay your mat lengthwise in front of you. [1] X Research source If you are a complete beginner to doing headstands, you can place your mat up against the base of a wall and practice your headstand with the support of the wall. [2] X Research source Practicing your headstand against a wall will help you figure out the different areas in your body that you need to flex and balance to hold a headstand. [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source Extend your thumbs up toward the ceiling. Your hands and elbows should form a triangle shape that’s approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) away from the base of the wall. Tuck your chin downward, and bring the crown of your head down to the mat. Rest the back of your head in your palms, as your crown rests on the mat. [6] X Research source Change your head positioning as necessary until you find a comfortable position. You should always aim to rest on your crown, with your hands supporting the back of your head so you don’t strain your neck."

[7] X Research source As you walk, your buttocks and hips will start to align with your back as you straighten out your core but stay bent at the hips. This movement will lift your shoulders over your ears as your spine aligns straight. [8] X Research source Keep your wrists, hands, forearms, and elbows strong and rooted into the mat. [9] X Research source You might feel like you are going to fall over like you would in a somersault. However, if you are practicing against a wall, the wall will support you and help you gain control so you can find balance."

Bring your bent knees into your chest, and use your core muscles to slowly try and raise your knees and extend your legs straight up out of the tuck. If you are practicing on a wall, you can flex your hips to bring your bent knees up, and place your feet on the wall. [10] X Research source"

[11] X Research source When you are ready to release the headstand, bend at your knees and bring both of your legs down, back to a tucked position in front of your chest. From here, touch both of your toes back onto your mat, slide your feet back, and transition into a stretch also known as a “child’s pose.” [12] X Research source Shift your buttocks over the heels of your feet, and extend your arms straight out in front of you while keeping your hands on the floor. [13] X Research source Hold this stretch for at least a minute so your body can slowly adjust its blood flow. Consider doing a few neck rolls in different directions to relieve any tension in your neck. [14] X Research source"

[16] X Research source Anyone who has never attempted a headstand should first practice against a wall. Practicing against a wall will help you find the initial balance and strength needed to hold a free form headstand."

Tuck your chin and bring your head down to the mat. Rest the back of your head in your palms, while the crown of your head should be contacting the floor.

[23] X Research source You will start to feel less weight from your legs as you walk up toward your body. This is where tight core muscles come in.

[24] X Research source As you lift one of your legs, keep the other one near the ground to first find balance. When your one leg is in the air, gently hop your other leg off the ground, trying to straighten out both legs as much as possible. This is going to require a lot of strength from your abdominal core muscles. Use your core to lift up your legs, and use your arms to support and stabilize your body. [25] X Research source Check your body alignment by saying your name. If you’re aligned, you should be able to say it clearly, how you normally speak. If you can’t speak like you normally do, you may not be aligned correctly, and should come out of the headstand. [26] X Research source If you are practicing against a wall, place your first lifted leg against the wall. As you find balance, lift your other leg up to meet your extended leg. The wall will give you support as you gain stability."

[27] X Research source When you are ready to come down, separate your feet and slowly shift your balance to bring one of your legs back down to the ground. When your foot contacts the floor (or is on the way down), bring your other leg down from the headstand pose and onto the floor. When you completely back on the mat with your head still resting between your hands, straighten out your arms shift your buttocks back to rest on top of your heels. Extend and stretch your upper body to relax and allow the blood in your body to circulate away from your head. In yoga, this is sometimes called a “child’s pose.” [28] X Research source Try and hold this for about a minute so your body can readjust and relax. Consider doing some soft neck rolls after performing a headstand. [29] X Research source This can help prevent stiffness and tension after performing a headstand. If you stand up too quickly after a headstand, you could experience lightheadedness, and even faint. [30] X Research source"
