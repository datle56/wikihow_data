      "content": "Take the bread out and set it on a wire cooling rack. Remove the bread from the loaf pan or baking pan as soon as you’ve removed it from the oven. This is important because bread left in the pan outside of the oven will become moist, soggy, and sponge-like very quickly as the moisture in the pan condenses onto the bread. Place the bread on a wire cooling rack and leave it to cool, or take slices of the bread when warm for a \"hot bread\" treat. [2] X Research source"
