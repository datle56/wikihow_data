      "content": "Choose a long coat with a cinched waist. A stylish coat is essential in winter, but some coats may appear to be too bulky or shapeless to have a feminine feel.

It is best to get a coat that is slightly large on you so that you can wear it over layers. Don’t be afraid to get a coat that makes a statement.

A statement ring or cuff adds extra flair for formal events or nights out. If you're wearing a suit, try bright jeweled cufflinks.

Heels and ballet flats are both versatile and flattering. You may also want a good pair of boots for colder weather. Try to have about 3 or 4 different pairs to match with your outfits. [4] X Research source High heels are the ultimate feminine shoe, and can be worn casually with jeans when you want to femme up an ordinary outfit. If you like comfortable shoes or are a sneaker fanatic, get some pretty sneakers! Look for streamlined designs with exciting colors, such as pastel or jewel tones, sparkles, or patterns. By keeping the sneakers clean, you can make them part of a feminine outfit. Leather boots, whether high or low, heeled or no heels, go great with skinny jeans or leggings in the winter. Strappy sandals are feminine and fun. Look for a pair with flowers, bright colors, or straps that lace up your leg."

      "content": "Dress appropriately for the occasion. Jeans and a t-shirt is a great outfit for doing groceries, but it may not be the right choice for work or a party. Feminine styles tend to emphasize wearing the right clothing to the right event. [11] X Research source If you’re going to a wedding, look to see if it is formal or semi-formal. A sheath dress or pantsuit with heels may be good for semi-formal occasions while a cocktail dress is appropriate for a formal event. In a business context, try wearing a loose blouse with slacks. For casual wear, look for practical and comfortable clothing that is also stylish. Graphic shirts, printed shorts, or jean skirts are all good options."
