      "content": "Notice if your child has gender non-conforming tendencies. Maybe you have seen that your daughter likes to play with toys that are generally considered masculine. Keep in mind that just because your daughter likes to play with trucks does not mean that she is transgender. However, if your child consistently displays a strong preference for things that don’t conform to gender expectations, it could be something to keep an eye on. A child who is different in a few ways might just be gender non-conforming. A child who is different in a lot of ways, and shows extreme unhappiness at being forced to act like the gender they were assigned at birth, is probably transgender. Remember, most notions of gender are stereotypes. Boys are not genetically predisposed to prefer the color blue, for instance. Some children like to dress up as characters of the opposite gender, or to cross-dress during imaginary play (for instance, a boy playing a princess or a girl putting on a play moustache). This on its own doesn't mean the child is trans, however, they may be trans if they only play as characters of a gender opposite to their assigned sex (for instance, if your child was assigned male but only dresses as female characters while playing dress-up and refuses to dress as male characters) or if they insist on dressing as a girl/boy even when not playing."

      "content": "Look for signs along the way. A child who is transgender will usually show many signs of their true gender. Their imaginary play usually suggests their gender, as well as how they want to dress and groom themself. A child may be transgender if they show many of these signs: [1] X Research source Insisting on shopping in the girls/boys section Choosing a masculine/feminine name for themself Preferring friends of another gender Becoming upset over haircuts, if they were born male Asking for shorter/more frequent haircuts, if they were born female Frequently pretending to be book or movie characters of another gender Hating their genitals Looking up to older people of the opposite gender and wanting to be just like them Begging for books or toys that say \"for boys\" or \"for girls\" Wanting to reincarnate as another gender Crying over the gender they were assigned at birth [2] X Research source Being much happier when you let them do something related to the gender they express"

      "content": "Notice signs of unhappiness at being pushed into the wrong gender role. For example, if your \"son\" screams and screams over a haircut because she can't bear having short hair, or if your \"daughter\" cries when told that he can't get clothes from the boy's section, this is a sign that your child may be transgender. Gender is important, so your child may feel (and act) like the world is ending if they have to pretend to be someone they are not. Notice tantrums over haircuts, clothes shopping, wearing/not wearing the color pink/blue, and other decisions. It may feel like fighting your child to get them to conform to gender roles. Pay attention to arguing. For example, if you say \"boys are allowed to wear dresses\" and the child says \"but I'm not a boy in a dress! I'm a girl!\" then the child is probably transgender. [3] X Research source Look for behavior problems, depression, and poor mental health. Children who are forced into the wrong gender role may be very upset and act out. They may also internalize negative feelings, which could lead to emotional trouble years later. Luckily, transitioning can usually fix most of this. Crying over haircuts could also indicate fear. Ask your child why they don't want their hair cut. If they say they're afraid, or that it might hurt, this is probably fear, but if they say they don't want their hair to be short, this might signify being trans."

It’s also pretty typical for young kids to go through phases of pretending to be a different gender. If your child is really consistent in insisting they are actually a different gender, though, this could be a sign that they are transgender. A child who routinely insists upon their gender being different from their genitalia is very likely transgender. Transitioning can help the child's social development, focus in school, and emotional well-being, and may reduce behavior problems. [6] X Research source"

This might mean, for example, that you call your child “Jennifer” and support their decision to wear a dress. Allow your child to lead in this experiment. Don’t pressure them to try things that they don’t want to try, such as being called by a different name. Watch your child during the trial run. Do they seem happier or more confident?

Don't stop a child from being themselves because you aren't comfortable with it. Explain to your child that there are certain social and biological limitations to changing one's sex. A girl who transitions to a boy will not be able to pee in a urinal without a specific device or surgery later in life. It is not currently possible for a boy who transitions to a girl to ever experience menstruation or physically give birth to a child.
