You’ll need these items to catch Reshiram or Zekrom and to battle other characters during the story. Buy any other items you think you might need, like Antidotes, Full Heals, and Ethers."

You have to beat each one in order to go to N's Castle, which is where you encounter Reshiram (Black version) or Zekrom (White version). [1] X Research source After you defeat the last Elite Four member, they tell you to battle the Champion, Alder. When you enter the Champion’s building, N is already there and raises a castle.

      "content": "Enter the Throne Room to confront N. Entering the room starts a cutscene where N calls forth his opposing legendary dragon, either Zekrom if you’re playing Black or Reshiram if you’re playing White. This activates the Light Stone (Black) or Dark Stone (White) in your bag, causing Reshiram (Black) or Zekrom (White) to appear in front of you. [4] X Research source After your legendary dragon appears, N instructs you to catch it and make it your ally so you can battle him. Note : Reshiram and Zekrom are shiny locked in Black and White, meaning they’ll never be shiny. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Interact with Reshiram (Black) or Zekrom (White) to start the battle. Both legendary dragons are at level 50, so make sure your pokémon are around the same level to challenge them. Just lower Reshiram’s or Zekrom’s HP down to the red zone so they’re easier to catch. [6] X Research source Reshiram is a Dragon and Fire-type pokémon that knows the moves DragonBreath, Slash, Extrasensory, and Fusion Flare. Use a Rock or Ground-type pokémon, like Onix or Boldore, since Rock and Ground-type moves are effective against Fire. Zekrom is a Dragon and Electric-type pokémon that knows the moves DragonBreath, Slash, Zen Headbutt, and Fusion Bolt. Ishrak recommends using a Steel-type pokémon, like Metagross, since Dragon-type moves aren’t effective against Steel."

      "content": "Use Ultra Balls to capture Reshiram or Zekrom . Once Reshiram’s or Zekrom’s HP is in the red zone, throw your Ultra Balls to catch them. Because these are legendary pokémon, they have a lower catch rate, so it may take a few tries to capture them. [7] X Research source Don’t worry if you accidentally defeat Reshiram or Zekrom . These pokémon are a required capture in both games. They’ll simply revive themselves right after you defeat them, so you can immediately battle them again."

After you catch Reshiram or Zekrom, you’ll receive a prompt to add them to your pokémon party or send them to your PC boxes. If your current party is full, you can switch out one of your pokémon for Reshiram or Zekrom. [8] X Research source This is important to consider since you’ll battle N right after you capture Reshiram or Zekrom. If you decide to add them to your party, they’ll go into the first slot and go into battle first against N. If your current pokémon isn’t full (i.e., you’re carrying 5 or fewer pokémon), Reshiram or Zekrom will be automatically added to your party."

If you defeat Reshiram or Zekrom and both your pokémon party and PC boxes are full, the legendary dragons will respawn at Dragonspiral Tower. Simply beat Team Plasma in N’s Castle and go to Dragonspiral Tower when you’re done. On the 7th floor, you can try capturing the legendary pokémon again. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "No, you have to trade to get both legendary dragons in one game. You can only catch Reshiram if you’re playing Black, and Zekrom if you’re playing White. To get both legendaries in your game, you need to do a local trade with a friend who has the other dragon. [10] X Research source Unfortunately, Nintendo no longer supports Wi-Fi trading for Black and White. However, you can still do local trades with a friend using C-Gear or the Union Room if they’re in the same room as you. You can trade for the other legendary if your friend has Black and White or Black 2 and White 2—both games are trade-compatible. Unlike previous Pokémon games, the legendary you get is the opposite of the game you’re playing: Reshiram is a white dragon that you get in Black, while Zekrom is a black dragon that you get in White. This illustrates the story themes of yin/yang and opposing ideologies."
