      "title": "Start with the obvious:",
      "content": "Start with the obvious: look in basements, in the trunk of their cars, under beds, on top of shelves. Parents are usually busy and may not have time to hide presents well. If your parents work overtime during the holidays or have a job that is in high demand during the holidays (e.g. department stores or other retail jobs), keep a keen eye out for poorly hidden presents."

      "content": "Examine any suspicious boxes or bags for company or store names as shipped boxes may have a return address. If you wanted something from that company, you can get a pretty good idea of what might be inside."

      "title": "Don't look just at the biggest present.",
      "content": "Don't look just at the biggest present. They may have bought you tickets to a show you really wanted to go to, or bought you a voucher for a shop you really love. Think about what you want. If you want a car, it will be big, but if you want to go to have your ears pierced, they may just give you a card saying that's what you are going to do. Thinking about the size, shape, and even texture of your present can help you if your parents color-code their gift tags."

      "title": "Question siblings.",
      "content": "Question siblings. A classic maneuver. Arrange an exchange of information if you must-this is often the case with older siblings. If you are an only child, question cousins or other relatives. For this route, preparing an exchange of information or a bribe will probably be necessary, as they are probably less likely to want to help you snoop."

      "content": "If still stumped, think about your parents' shopping habits. Did they most likely order your gifts online or did they store-buy? If online, check the order history on their online accounts. Amazon.com keeps lists of all of one's orders-a real jackpot. Most smart parents know what you're trying to do so be VERY sneaky!

For example, if they are thinking about getting you a DVD, they may ask you if your DVD player still works. If they are going to get you a TV, then they may ask you \"Can you plug your [DVD player/Chromecast/whatever] into new TVs?\". Similar clues are very easy to spot for more technical gifts that your parents don't understand as well as you do (but may be obvious for other gifts also), and while a clue like this is by no means a guarantee of the gift, it's usually a pretty good indicator of it."
