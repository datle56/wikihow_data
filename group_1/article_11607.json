      "content": "Get their attention with a light-hearted opening line about their dog. When chatting online or on a dating app, people are more likely to respond to your message if it’s focused on something they said or posted on their profile. They also tend to connect with people who have similar values and interests…like their precious pups! [1] X Research source Try one of these smooth openers to start a conversation on a dating app ! Well, I know we have at least one thing in common... we both think your dog is the cutest ever. I've been swiping left non-stop, but when I saw that pic of you with your dog, I just had to paws. I may be more of a cat person, but for you, I’d be willing to go to the bark side. I love dogs, you love dogs, it’s just me, or is there some real pet-tential here? Heya, I just wanted to take this op-paw-tunity to say how cute you and your dog look in your pics. Heya, howl you doin’? Yikes, sorry, that was a ruff start. Wow, what a fetching photo! How could I possibly not say hello? We seem to be into a lot of the same things, dogs included. We should get together sometime and see what we unleash. Hi, when I saw the pic of your pup, it was im-paws-ible not to swipe right. I don’t want to make the faux-paw of coming on strong, but your dog is so adorable, I couldn’t resist. Just wanted to say hi to you and your adorable dog. I hope I’m not barking up the wrong tree. Sorry, that was ruff. I bet you thought putting a picture of you with your dog on here would make people stop and say hello. Well, mission accomplished. Hi! Your dog’s leash and my dog’s leash should totally get tangled up. You love dogs, I love dogs... is it just me, or could we be the paw-fect match? I may not have a dog in my profile picture, but I'd love to take you and your pup for a walk. I don’t normally make the first move, but there was just something dif-fur-ent about your photos. What’s your dog’s idea of the perfect day? I’d love to make it happen for all of us. Normally, I’m not shy about sending the first message, but when I saw that photo with your dog, it was im-paws-ible to resist. You, me, and our dogs—sounds like the perfect date to me. I think we'd get along as well as two puppies playing in the park. Your dog and I have something in common—we both want to win your affection."

      "content": "Try a silly dog joke to make them laugh. Keep things light – and maybe a little corny – to create a relaxed vibe that makes them feel comfortable talking to you. Many people associate being funny with someone who’s flirting , so it’s a subtle way to rizz them up without coming on too strong. [2] X Research source Try one of these cheesy dog jokes to get their attention and – hopefully! – make them smile. Who's got six legs and just made it to the top of my must-meet list? You and your pooch! What dog will laugh at any joke? A chi-ha-ha! What do you call a magic dog? A labra-cadabrador! What do my dog and my phone have in common? They both have collar I.D. What is a dog’s favorite city? New Yorkie! What do you get when you cross a dog and a calculator? A best friend you can always count on.

A simple hello paired with a confident smile is often the best way to make a good first impression. [3] X Research source However, it doesn’t do much to keep the conversation going. Try one of these lines to get the conversational ball rolling. Our dogs seem to be great friends. Do you think we could be, too? I’ve searched all the dog parks in the world to find you. I must have done something right because you’re a real treat! If our dogs get along, do you think that means we’re meant to be? Is it just me, or does your dog seem to like me? Maybe we should all hang out sometime? Do you think our dogs would mind if we went on a date? I’ve heard that dogs are great judges of character. What do you think yours says about me? What’s your dog’s favorite park? Maybe we could meet there for a play date. Did you win best in show? Because you look like a winner to me. How does your dog like to spend weekends?

Plus, many people say they’re more likely to match with someone who has a dog in their profile pictures. Taking care of a dog is a lot of work, so having one in your pics also makes you seem more appealing, trustworthy, and responsible. [4] X Research source Try to find one where you’re interacting with your dog instead of a face-forward posed shot.

      "content": "Shoot your photos outdoors in natural daylight. Unless you’re an expert with a flash, you might end up with the dreaded redeye when you take a photo with your dog. Taking your photos outside on a cloudy day or during the “golden hour” (just after sunrise or right before sunset) gives you soft, diffused light—the best kind for taking beautiful pup shots without the eye flash. [7] X Research source If you have to shoot indoors, pick a room with even, consistent lighting. Another good inside place to take pictures is near a large window. If a room has white walls, it helps give your photos softer, more flattering lighting. [8] X Research source"

If there’s too much going on in the background, you and your pup may not stand out. A grassy yard is a great background for photos with your dog. Another way to help you and your dog stand out is to have a slightly blurry background.

Use a favorite toy to get their attention and reward them when they obey commands. Just play like you normally would, but keep your camera ready to capture those paws-itively charming moments. Or, better yet, ask a friend to take a few shots of you and your fuzzy friend having the time of your lives. If your dog loves playing fetch or has a signature trick, try to get photos of those, too.

If you notice signs your dog is stressed, like pinned back ears, a tucked tail, or lip licking, it might be time to end the shoot. Keep sessions under 30 minutes so they don’t get tired or over-stimulated."

      "content": "Lower yourself down to your dog's height to take pictures. Whether you’re taking the photos yourself or having a friend act as your photographer, make sure you’re not taking photos of your pet from above. Getting down on their level helps your photos feel more natural. Try different angles to see what looks best! Snap a few pics sitting on your knees, then try lying on your stomach. Then, take some photos from below with you and your dog looking down into the lens. [11] X Research source As you take your pics, make sure the camera focuses on your dog’s eyes—and yours, too!"

They help you learn more about the other person while helping them to feel more at ease. [12] X Research source Try something like, “Your dog is so cute! How did you get them?” This invites them to tell you a story instead of a question with a simple answer like, “What breed is your dog?” Be genuine and authentic when you’re asking questions. Pretending you’re a dog person when you’re not will eventually come out if you hit it off. Even if you’re more of a cat person, you can ask that cute dog person questions about their pooch. Just keep it simple and honest."

They make people feel good by boosting their self-esteem and self-confidence. [13] X Research source But some people have a hard time accepting compliments about themselves. [14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source By focusing on their dog, you indirectly compliment how well they care for their four-legged friend. Say something like, “Your dog is so well-behaved!” or “Wow! Your dog is so friendly.” These imply the person has done a good job training and socializing their dog. Plus, these are compliments about what the person does, which can be more meaningful than compliments about their looks."

Look them in the eyes and give them a big, genuine smile to show your interest. Lean slightly toward them as they speak to help emphasize that you’re focused on them and what they’re saying. [15] X Research source Try to avoid crossing your arms, which can make you look closed off.

Try to avoid using overly sexual terms when flirting with a dog lover. First, making overtly sexual comments can make it seem like you’re only interested in them physically, which can be a dealbreaker. [17] X Research source Second, a dog lover may be even more put off by comments that associate sex with their pet. A few terms to watch out for are: Hot dog: In some contexts, people use “hot dog” to refer to a penis. Dogging: This means watching or performing sex acts in a semi-public area like a park. [18] X Research source A “dogger” is someone who performs the act. Horndog: This term refers to a sexually aggressive person. Walk the dog: “Walk the dog” can refer to masturbation in some contexts."
