If you moved far from your original home, ask friends, family, and old neighbors who are still living there to search for you. [1] X Research source Check any spaces where a cat could hide.

Microchips are implanted by a veterinary professional under the skin over the shoulder blades of the cat. The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and carries a unique code that can be read by a scanner when the hand held scanning device is waved over the pet's body. When the chip is implanted in the pet, the owner provides registration information to the microchip company that will be kept on file until the owner changes that information. The code will be linked to the owner's information through the microchip's database. When the scanner reveals the code, the microchip company can then be contacted with the code and the owner's information will be available. Most veterinarians and animal shelters will check for a microchip for no charge when a stray cat is brought in."
