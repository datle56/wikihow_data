      "title": "Write the problem.",
      "content": "Write the problem. To write the problem correctly, place the divisor, the number that you're dividing into another number, outside the long division bar. Place the dividend, the number that you'll be dividing by the divisor, inside the long division bar. The quotient, or your result, will go on top of the division bar. Remember that for short division to work, your divisor has to be less than 10. [2] X Research source For example: In 847/5, 5 is the divisor, so write it outside the division bar. 847 is the dividend, so place it inside the division bar. The quotient is blank because you haven't started dividing yet."

      "title": "Divide the first number of the dividend by the divisor.",
      "content": "Divide the first number of the dividend by the divisor. When you divide, you are stating how many times one number can fit into another number. For example, 2 can fit into 6 three times (2 + 2 + 2 =6). Continuing with our example, 5 goes into 8 just one time, but it doesn’t evenly divide into 8. We have 3 left over. Write the number 1, the first number of the quotient, on top of the division bar. This leftover number is called the remainder. If you were using long division, you would write out 8 minus 5 equals 3 and then bring down the 4 from the dividend. Short division simplifies this written process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the remainder next to the first number of the dividend.",
      "content": "Write the remainder next to the first number of the dividend. Write a small 3 to the top right of the number 8. This will remind you that there was a remainder of 3 when you divided 8 by 5. The next number you will divide into is the combination of the remainder and the second number. [3] X Research source In our example, the next number is 34."

    {
      "title": "Divide the number formed by the first remainder and the second number in the dividend by the divisor.",
      "content": "Divide the number formed by the first remainder and the second number in the dividend by the divisor. The remainder is 3 and the second number of the dividend is 4, so the new number you'll be working with is 34. [4] X Research source Now, divide 34 by 5. 5 goes into 34 six times (5 x 6 =30) with a remainder of 4. Write your quotient, 6, on the division bar to the right of the 1. Again, keep in mind you are doing most of the math mentally."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the second remainder above the second number in the dividend and divide.",
      "content": "Write the second remainder above the second number in the dividend and divide. Just as you did the first time, simply write a small 4 above and to the right of the number 4. The next number you will be dividing by is 47. [5] X Research source Now, divide 47 by 5. 5 goes into 47 nine times (5 x 9 = 45) with a remainder of 2. Write your quotient, 9, on the division bar to the right of the 6."

      "title": "Recognize that the divisor may not go into the first number of the dividend.",
      "content": "Recognize that the divisor may not go into the first number of the dividend. In some cases, the divisor will be larger than the first number of the dividend and you will not be able to divide. In this case, you will divide into the first two numbers of the dividend. [6] X Research source For example, 567/7. In this case, 7 doesn’t go into 5, but it does go into 56 eight times. When solving this problem, write the first number of the quotient over the 6 instead of the 5 and continue solving. The final answer is 81."

    {
      "title": "Add a zero in the quotient if the divisor does not go into the dividend.",
      "content": "Add a zero in the quotient if the divisor does not go into the dividend. This is similar to the first special case, except this time, you will put a zero in the middle of the quotient. If you encounter a problem like this, simply write a zero in the quotient, and try dividing with the next two numbers in the dividend until the number can be divided. [7] X Research source For example, 3208/8, 8 goes into 32 four times, but does not go into 0. You would add a 0 and then divide into the next number. 8 goes into 8 one time, therefore, the solution would be 401."

      "title": "Practice with some more examples.",
      "content": "Practice with some more examples. The best way to understand short division is practicing with many different types of problems. [8] X Research source Below are a few more examples for you to try out. Divide 748 by 2. How many times can 2 go into 7? Three with a remainder of 1. Write 1 next to the 4. How many times can 2 go into 14? Seven times, evenly. Two goes into 8 four times, evenly; therefore, the final answer is 374. Divide 368 by 8. Eight doesn’t fit into 3, but it does divide into 36. Eight fits into 36 four times with a remainder of 4 (8 x 4 = 32, 36 - 32 = 4). Write the 4 next to the 9. Eight can go into 48 six times, evenly; therefore, the final answer is 46. Divide 1228 by 4. Four doesn’t fit into 1, but it does fit into 12 three times, evenly. Four does not fit into 2, so you must add a zero in the quotient and divide four into 28. Four fits into 28 seven times; therefore, the final answer is 307."
