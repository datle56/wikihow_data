      "content": "The top section of the first page is all up to your personal tastes. Character Name: Choose a good name! Player: This will be your name. Class and level: The class is chosen by you in Chapter 3. The starting level is determined by the DM, but is generally first level. Race: This is chosen by you in Chapter 2. All other features: These are personal choices made by you during character creation. Be realistic. Consult Chapter 6 for advice on how to choose these traits."

      "title": "Take your prepared ability scores and write them into the “ability score” column.",
      "content": "Take your prepared ability scores and write them into the “ability score” column. Write them next to their corresponding ability. This score should include the base score and any additional modifiers (such as a racial bonus). The ability modifier in the next column is calculated by subtracting ten from the ability score, dividing the remainder by two, and rounding down. For example, an ability score of 15 would have a +2 ability modifier (15-10 = 5, 5/2 = 2.5, rounded down = +2). Your DM may have you use the temporary score and modifier columns during your adventure, but for right now leave them blank."

      "title": "HP stands for “hit points,\" which is how much damage your character can take.",
      "content": "HP stands for “hit points,\" which is how much damage your character can take. Speed is how quickly your character can move in a single action during combat. AC stands for “armor class” and describes how hard your character is to be hit by attacks. HP: Your total HP (hit points) is calculated by rolling your class’ hit die (noted in the class description in the player’s handbook) and adding your constitution modifier to it. This is done upon attaining each new level. At first level, however, your character receives the full hit die and constitution modifier worth of points. A rogue, for example, with a hit die of d6 and a constitution modifier of +2 would receive 8 hit points at first level and would roll a d6 and add 2 HP for each subsequent level. Wounds/Current HP: This area will be used to keep track of your characters HP during the game. You can use it to count up damage received or use it to count down your characters HP. In the beginning, you should have full HP. Nonlethal Damage: This area can remain blank, as your character is at full HP. Speed: Your character’s speed is noted under your race in Chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook. Generally, this is 30 feet (9.1 m). Certain things in the game, such as items, encumbrance, or class features, may modify your speed. AC: Your AC is calculated by Armor Bonus (from worn armor), Shield Bonus (from wielded shields), Dex Modifier (Dexterity Modifier), Size Modifier (noted in Chapter 2 under your race), Natural Modifier (attained later in the game, but generally unavailable at first level), Deflection Modifier (AC bonuses through magical items), and Misc Modifiers (anything not covered in the previous categories). Damage Reduction: Consult your DM to determine if your character has any."

      "content": "Touch and Flat-Footed ACs describe special situations in the game. These situations are where an attack simply needs to make contact (touch) or your character is caught unawares (flat-footed). These attacks are generally easier to pull off and are calculated differently. Initiative represents how quickly your character responds to battle and is used to modify a d20 roll to determine turn order in combat. Touch AC: This value is your AC without Armor, Shield, and Natural Bonuses. Flat-Footed: This value is your AC without the Dex Modifier added. Initiative: This value is your Dex Modifier plus any Misc Modifiers (such as the feat Improved Initiative)."

      "content": "Fortitude, Reflex, and Will Saves are used to represent the resilience of a character to certain conditions in the game. Fortitude, for example, is used to show toughness against punishment and poisons. Reflex Saves could be used to avoid a magical explosion. Will Saves could save your character from being mind-controlled by an evil sorcerer. Each of them are calculated by adding up the following numbers: Base Save: This value is located on the corresponding leveling chart of your character’s class in Chapter 3. A level one fighter, for example, has a +2 Fortitude, +0 Reflex, and a +0 Base Will Save. Ability Modifier: This value comes from the corresponding ability. For Fortitude, use the Constitution Modifier. For Reflex, use the Dexterity Modifier. For Will, use the Wisdom Modifier. Magic Modifier: This value comes from any active spells of magical items on your character. Misc Modifier: This value comes from anything not covered in the previous categories (such as feats or racial traits). Temporary & Additional Modifiers: Leave blank for now."

Spell resistance shows how much defense your character has against unwanted magical effects. Grappling is a method of combat in which you grab your foe. Base Attack Bonus: This value is located on the corresponding leveling chart of your character’s class in Chapter 3. A level one fighter, for example, has a +1 BAB. Spell Resistance: This box can be left blank at this time. Your DM will inform you if you need to fill it. Grapple: This value is found by adding your character’s BAB, Strength Modifier, Size Modifier (found under your race in Chapter 2), and any Misc Modifiers (such as from feats or class features)."

Attack: This is the type of weapon being used (sword, bow, etc). Attack Bonus: This is total bonus you will add to a d20 roll to determine the success of your attack. This includes the BAB, corresponding ability modifier (strength for melee or natural, dexterity for ranged), and any Misc Modifiers (such as bonuses provided by the weapon or feats). Damage, Critical, Range, Type, and Notes: These can be found in the corresponding weapon description in Chapter 7.

      "content": "Your character is defined in no small way by the things he or she can do besides attacking. This area is used to keep track of the prowess of your character in performing other actions in the game. Certain skills are class skills (actions your class are proficient in doing) and cross-class skill (actions that come harder as part of your class). Max Ranks: Your characters max class skill ranks will be his or her level +3. The max cross-class skill ranks will be half of the max class skill rank value. Class Skills?: Each box that is next to a class skill of your character should be marked. Check the corresponding class description in Chapter 3 to verify which these are. Blank spaces next to skills: These areas are to specify what the skill is in. For example, one skill may be Craft (Armor) and another may be Craft (Crossbow). Check skill description in Chapter 4 to learn more. Key Modifier: This describes the ability modifier that is important to this skill. Copy the corresponding modifier into the Ability Modifier column. Skill Modifier: This value is calculated by adding up the Ability Modifier, Ranks, and Misc Modifier. Ranks: These are purchased using skill points upon advancement to a new level. Each class gets a certain number of new skill points plus their intelligence modifier. This can be found in the corresponding class description in Chapter 3. A sorcerer, for example, gains 2 skill points plus his or her Int Modifier per level. At first level, this value is multiplied by four. These points may be spent in any skill. One skill point buys one rank in a class skill. One skill point buys half of a rank in a cross-class skill. The total number of ranks in a particular skill may not exceed the values in the Max Ranks section. Misc Modifier: These are additional bonuses from sources other than Ability Modifiers and Ranks, such as racial traits or feats."

The information here can be copied from the corresponding description in Chapter 7 or from your DM in some circumstances. Other Possessions: This area is used for items other than those in the Gear area being carried by your character (this includes all weapons). Use the corresponding descriptions in Chapter 7 to fill out these entries (PG being the page number and WT being the weight of the item), adding up all of the total weight of both Gear and Other Possessions. The bottom section (Loads) is filled in using the beginning of Chapter 9 and your Strength Modifier. Lifts and Push are calculated as noted on the character sheet. Money: This area is used to note how much CP (copper pieces), SP (silver), GP (gold), and PP (platinum) your character is carrying. This is determined by following the instructions in your class description in Chapter 2 or by asking your DM."
