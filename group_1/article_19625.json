[4] X Research source In the morning, remove the leaf and you will most likely find a large number of snails on the underside. Doing this a few nights in a row may help rid your aquarium of vast numbers of snails. Snails can also be picked out of the aquarium as they are seen. This is most effective when there are smaller number of snails. However, since snails are mainly nocturnal it may not make a dent in the problem. When snails hatch, they are quite small and can climb up the sides of the aquarium. Use a small diameter hose like an air pump hose and start a siphon. Just go along and suck the little ones out. It may need to be done more than once to remove them all, though you can pull out 100 in a couple of minutes. Repeat the process in a few hours."
