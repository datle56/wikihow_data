      "content": "Load up on protein and fiber. You've definitely heard it before: to get rid of that stubborn fat and start building muscle, you need protein. The body can burn protein to survive, but it prefers carbohydrates and fats; so when you feed it mainly protein, it will go for the carbohydrates and fats you already have stored. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source That, and protein builds and repairs muscle! [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Fish and chicken are great sources of protein— you generally want to stick to the lean, white meats. Low-fat dairy, beans, soy, and eggs are efficient sources as well. [4] X Research source Aim to make protein between 10% and 35% of your daily caloric intake. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source We are not forgetting fiber! It's slow to digest, helps you feel full, and it acts like a sponge to water and fat. So add beans, whole grains, brown rice, nuts, and berries onto that list of awesome foods to eat for fat loss.

You want to stick to the good fats, such as unsaturated fats and omega-3s. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source The fats that you should keep in your diet should be from fatty fish like salmon, olive oils, avocados, and nuts. However, just because they're good doesn't mean you should overdo it. Always consume any food in moderation. Try to cut down on trans fats and saturated fats. These types of fats are present in foods like cookies, cakes, potato chips, fast and fried foods, red meat, and whole-fat dairy. Fats that are solid at room temperature are full of saturated fat, which you should avoid. This includes butter, lard, and coconut oil.

      "content": "Plan out your carbohydrate intake. This is where things start to get a little confusing. There are very, very different schools of thought when it comes to carbohydrates. There's the Atkins and Keto camps, which say a no-carbohydrate diet is the way to go. Well, sure, that'll get you to burn fat, but it's not super sustainable, and anything that recommends you cut out 60% of your body's preferred energy should be questioned because there can be risks. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Instead, let's consider some other ideas: Carbohydrate cycling . The science behind it is that you have a couple low-carbohydrate days (about 1g per pound of body weight) that get your body into a fat burning state. Then you have a day of high-carbohydrate intake, that gets your metabolism running. [10] X Research source Timed intake. When you eat a larger portion of carbs later in the day, it can spike your blood sugar, and the excess glucose can get stored in your body as fat. To avoid this, try to consume carbohydrates (brown rice, beans, oats, legumes, fruit, bread) earlier in the day.

      "content": "Consider calorie cycling. We've talked about carbohydrate cycling, but there's calorie cycling, too. When you’re restricting your calories, your body may think it’s in danger of starvation, so your metabolism starts to slow down to preserve your weight. Calorie cycling involves having occasional days of higher caloric intake to keep your metabolism up. [12] X Research source Below 1,200 calories per day for women and 1,500 per day for men is generally where starvation mode starts. Your calorie intake shouldn’t fall below these numbers. [13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you're interested in calorie cycling, know how many calories your body needs before you start playing around with the numbers. Factors like your age and physical activity level can affect this. [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source To determine how many calories you should be eating a day to meet your needs and goals, consult with your physician or a registered dietitian. This method is good for those who have plateaued. If you have that last bit of fat you want to lose, give this a shot. [15] X Research source"

And the best way to fight these (if not the only way) is cross training. This basically means doing a bunch of different activities and switching your exercise routine up. [19] X Research source For example, on Monday, you're hitting the pavement, Tuesday you're going for a swim, Wednesday is your day of rest, Thursday is the elliptical, and Friday is cycling. Easy! You could combine activities in one day, too."

You don't have to sit on the couch all day, but do allow your body to heal itself. Weights should only be done back-to-back if you're working different muscle groups (i.e., legs one day, arms and shoulders the next). Cardio, however, can (and should) be done most days of the week."

Always measure your body fat at the same time (for example, Monday mornings) and under the same conditions (before breakfast, after drinking a glass of water, etc).

Some health and gym facilities may offer more expensive forms of testing, such as Bod Pods, water displacement, or DEXA scanning.
