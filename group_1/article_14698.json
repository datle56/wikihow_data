      "content": "Leggings help you cover up and add extra style to an outfit. If your legs are cold or you don’t want to show skin while wearing a skirt or dress, leggings provide the perfect way to stay while giving you another route to bring out your personal style with colors and patterns. They can go with pretty much any length or style of skirt! Avoid wearing leggings alone, as this can be seen as too tight and immodest. Tights or pantyhose definitely work for leg coverage, too, but they can be uncomfortable or made of sheer material."
