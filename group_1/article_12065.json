      "content": "End the relationship safely. You should make it clear that you are ending the relationship with no hope of restarting it in the future. If you feel uncomfortable or fear for your safety, you should end the relationship from a distance or have someone there to help you if the need arises. Do not try to end the relationship while you are at home alone with your abuser. Your attempt may cause his abuse to escalate, and you might be putting yourself in serious danger. Consider breaking up in writing or over the phone, even if that's not how you would normally break up; your safety is more important than social graces. If you feel you must break up with an abusive boyfriend face to face, do it in public, with other people present, and keep the conversation brief. Be short and to-the-point. You can say something simple like, “we cannot be together anymore.” Try to avoid any phrases like “right now,” “at this time,” or “until you change.” You should close the door fully on the relationship."
