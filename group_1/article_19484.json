      "content": "Go for clothing that looks tailored, not tight. Tight-fitting clothing will highlight your hip dips by clinging to your body.

[8] X Research source Fit and flare dresses can give you an hourglass shape while covering your hip dips. Tailored blazers and blouses can camouflage your hip dips without looking baggy."

      "content": "Choose fabrics that won't cling to your body. Loose, flowing fabrics like cotton are the best choice for disguising your hip dips as they fall around your body without clinging to it. Thick, structured materials like denim may also offer good camouflage by holding their own shape outside of your silhouette. Avoid clingy fabrics like spandex and lycra, which will accentuate your hips dips. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source A waterfall cardigan, which cascades down in front and has no buttons to close it, can make a good addition to your wardrobe."

Peplum is a style of dress, top, and jacket that flares out in a bell shape just above your hips, creating an hourglass shape. This design also covers hips dips completely, making them unnoticeable. Shop for chic peplum dresses or peplum shirts, blouses, and blazers to pair with slim-fitting pants or skirts. [11] X Research source Peplum style clothing also camouflages a thicker waist by creating a curvy shape. Make sure the flared part of the clothing is beyond the widest part and drop below the hip dip."
