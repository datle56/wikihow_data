      "content": "Write down terms that describe the person. Words like “cunning,” “manipulative,” and “remorseless” will probably be on the list if they're a sociopath. Understanding the person's characteristics is critical to reevaluating your relationship. Despite their individual variations, sociopaths are likely to be manipulating, pathological liars who get close to people in order to hurt them. [1] X Research source Contrary to some popular beliefs, not all — and in fact, very, very few — sociopaths end up as serial killers. Many aren't violent at all."

      "content": "Look for signs that your relationship is a ruse. A sociopath may not be interested in friendship in the way you understand it. Instead of friendship with you, they may be seeking a loyal follower. They might treat you like a friend only to gain access to your companionship. In these cases, as long as you provide some value to them, they will keep you around. But once they tire of you, you will likely be abandoned. [2] X Research source No two sociopaths are alike, and their motivations, perspectives, and actions can vary widely. You'll have to trust your best judgment in regards to your friend's sociopathy.

      "content": "Don't immediately label a selfish friend a sociopath. Identifying a legitimate sociopath is always difficult, because they are very skilled at hiding their true nature. Signs of sociopathy may blend in with signs of someone who is simply a bad friend, or someone who has little experience with social interaction. Or, your friend may just be incredibly self-absorbed without being a sociopath. [4] X Research source Of course, at the end of the day, a bad friend is a bad friend, actual sociopath or not. Someone who doesn't really care about your feelings and/or tries to manipulate you all the time is difficult to consider a friend. If the friendship doesn't benefit you and make you happy, then it's probably time to re-evaluate the relationship. Also, keep in mind that people with avoidant attachment styles often display traits of an antisocial personality. This may be due to their inability to form relationships. These people may want to form relationships, but they may be afraid or not know how to do so. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "List the times when your friend has used or wronged you. Think back over your relationship and try to identify whether there has been a lack of conscience or guilt on your friend's part. To help clear your thoughts, write down the facts and your feelings for each moment when you felt wronged. There may be trends or correlations.

      "content": "See the true nature of your friendship for what it is. Don't let sorrow or embarrassment cloud what your collected evidence tells you. It's natural to be in denial, as your friend's apparent sociopathy will be hard to swallow. But the sooner you accept the reality of the situation, the sooner you can address it honestly. [7] X Research source You can rightly feel upset if you have been abused and manipulated. But don't feel ashamed — many sociopaths are expert abusers and manipulators and it has nothing to do with you. You are/were a means to an end for them. Your friend may not be a \"friend\" in the normal sense. It's not entirely clear whether a true sociopath can ever really be a friend — some experts say they can't truly experience emotions like caring, while others disagree. You'll have to work out the unique circumstances of your friend and your friendship. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "End the relationship.",
      "content": "End the relationship. Someone who is a true sociopath will not allow their reputation to be discredited and they will do whatever is possible to protect their reputation. Therefore, it is best to avoid accusing them of things or trying to justify your reason for ending the relationship. Instead, just end it. Sociopaths may become verbally aggressive when their integrity is questioned, so it is best to avoid confrontation."

      "content": "Refuse to feel guilty for ending the relationship. A sociopath may seek to make you feel sorry for them as a means to regain power and maintain their image. If you feel sorry for questioning them, they consider this a victory rather than caring about the reasons for your doubt. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Process your emotions with healthy self-care techniques. Whether you have been victimized by a sociopathic friend or simply feel embarrassed that you didn't see the truth, it's normal to experience frustration or even anger. Realizing that your friend may not really care about you can damage your self-esteem and increase stress levels. However, keep in mind that your friend's feelings and behavior towards you are not about you. You can help combat negative emotional and physical symptoms by dedicating yourself to a self-care regimen.

Especially if you are concerned for your friend's well-being, consider talking to their coworkers or other people who interact with them regularly. Do not talk negatively about your sociopathic friend. Instead, calmly explain examples of their sociopathic behavior and ask if other people have noticed the same things. Don't try to tell others what to do with this information — but see if they think your friend may benefit from therapy or other forms of help."

If you can't shake the feeling that you've been duped, used, or violated, strongly consider seeking out the help of a licensed therapist.

      "content": "Break off the friendship completely if necessary. Tell the sociopath to leave you alone. Be assertive, firm, direct, and consistent. Your soon-to-be-former friend may try to manipulate you into changing course via guilt, lies, or other means. [13] X Research source Your best counter to these efforts is to never waver in your decision: “I'm sorry, Ben, I've decided that we can't be friends anymore. It's not healthy for me to be around you.

      "content": "Accept reality. Friendship with a sociopath is possible in many cases. You don't have to stop hanging out with them just because they can't be the ideal friend all the time, unless they are harming you. Even if the friendship doesn't go deeper than mildly pleasant chatting to pass the time, it doesn't mean they're necessarily out to get you. [14] X Research source A sociopath still has feelings — even if they're missing some — and there are cases where a sociopath will connect with a person. When that happens, it is usually to further their own ambitions and it has little to do with you. Just make sure you are not being manipulated. If they are rude or otherwise inconsiderate, let them know. If you enjoy spending time with them and value their company, let them know. Sociopaths are individuals with emotional issues, and they need extremely clear directions regarding emotional concerns."
