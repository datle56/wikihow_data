Depending on where your peaches are coming from, the exact time of that season will vary. In the United States, peaches are traditionally picked during the summer months, but are picked in different places from April to October.

      "content": "Look for ripe peaches. It's best to pick peaches when they're ripe, then eat them in 2-3 days. Store bought peaches are typically less ripe, but will ripen some, left away from sunlight in room temperature for 3-7 days. If peaches are refrigerated, they'll stop ripening, so it's a good idea to put them in the fridge in a paper bag, when they're at the ripeness you're looking for. [3] X Research source Pick peaches at the store that feel heavier than they look, which is a sign that the flesh is dense with juice. Don't squeeze peaches to see if they \"give.\" Ripe peaches will give when you press into them, but that will leave a bruise, which will rot quickly. Ripe peaches often smell quite strongly at the stem, although some peach varieties will smell more strongly than other varieties."

      "content": "Learn about different varieties of peach. Peaches have been cultivated for almost 3000 years, and there are literally hundreds of peach varietals grown worldwide. In the west, most peaches grown have yellow-orange flesh, while Asian peaches tend to be white. [4] X Trustworthy Source Virginia Cooperation Extension Publications and Educational resources from Virginia Tech and Virginia State University Go to source The best peaches to eat? Whatever variety is available locally. Local peaches are often much fresher and juicer, because they're allowed to be more fragile than peaches that need to be engineering for transport. The famous Georgia peach is an \"Elberta\" variety. Other common commercially grown varieties in the US include the June Lady, Flavorcrest, and the Red Top. All peaches are either \"clingstone\" or \"freestone\" peaches, depending on whether or not the pit \"clings\" to the flesh or not. Some hybrid varieties also exist. \"Melting\" peaches are typically clingstone, and are most often sold commercially for eating purposes. When ripe, \"melting\" peaches will be extremely juicy, as if the flesh were melting. \"Non-melting\" peaches will stay much more firm, and are the peaches typically used in canning."

      "content": "Store peaches properly. When you get some peaches, remove the stems and store them stem-end down, on a fabric that will breathe well to help it ripen some. Linen or cotton napkins work great for ripening peaches. Cover the peaches with a thin napkin to keep them ripening. Put them in the refrigerator, loosely packed in a paper bag, or just loose, when the flesh begins to depress slightly and they smell fragrant. [5] X Research source Once refrigerated, peaches usually need to be eaten in a few days. They'll become overripe in less than a week. Never store peaches in closed plastic bags, which promote spoilage. If you want to freeze peaches, it's common to blanch them quickly, then remove the skin with a knife and cut into bite-sized peaches. Store in air-tight freezer bags."

Always rinse your peaches in clean water, rubbing the skin gently with your hands or a vegetable brush, right before you're ready to eat them or prepare them. This helps to remove dirt and bacteria, as well as residual pesticides. [6] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Wait to wash your peaches until right before you eat them. Getting them wet before refrigerating can promote spoilage and bacteria growth. While it's perfectly fine to eat peach skin, you can remove the skin with a paring knife, if you don't like the texture. While peach skin is high in phytonutrients and fiber, many people aren't a fan of the fuzziness."

[7] X Research source Try sprinkling your peach slices with a small pinch of cinnamon or brown sugar for an added little kick. Fresh cream is also an excellent addition.

You may end up smashing the peach and having trouble moving the individual slices if they're clinging to the pit."
