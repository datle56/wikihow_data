Peel off a corner of your screen protector with a credit card and peek underneath—if the screen is safe, just replace the screen protector. If you think the screen underneath the protector is also cracked, don't remove the protector, as it might lift glass away from the phone and prevent you from getting additional use out of it.

If you have an Android and the touch digitizer works but the screen doesn't, you can try connecting the phone to a TV or monitor with an HDMI adapter, which will mirror the screen. You can then mimic the movements on the Android's screen to open backup settings on your TV. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Find out if your phone can be repaired at home. Visit https://www.ifixit.com and search for your phone model. If they have a screen replacement tutorial for your phone, look over the steps and assess whether you could perform them yourself without help. Check the prices for the tools the tutorials require and take a look at the prices for replacement screens for your model. Compare the price of a new screen assembly and tools with a quote from a service provider. For example, the iPhone Pro 12 Max screen assembly costs about as much as an entire out-of-warranty repair from Apple. Now think about buying tools, spending hours on replacing the screen, and then finding out you can no longer unlock your iPhone. Suddenly Apple's repair prices sound a lot better! Check the comments on the iFixIt guides—you'll often find (especially with iPhones) that following tutorials exactly brings up other problems, including broken Face ID and non-working cameras. Not because the guides aren't helpful, but because it's hard to do these repairs if you're not an expert."
