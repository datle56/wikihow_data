You can use the same approach with blackstrap molasses instead of honey."

      "title": "Try herbs.",
      "content": "Try herbs. Some herbs can help with relieving constipation because they act as purgatives. These herbs include senna, buckthorn, cascara, and aloe. Only use these for acute or rare constipation, and only under the direction of a physician such as a naturopath or a medical herbalist. Milder herbs act as bulking agents or as mild stimulants. These include flaxseed, senna, psyllium and fenugreek. There are many commercial herbal teas available. Find the one that you like the best. Don’t forget, you can always add a bit of lemon or honey if that helps it taste better for you. Examples of these teas include Traditional Medicinals Smooth Move Tea and Yogi Get Regular Tea. You can also take senna in a tablet or capsule form. Senna can gently and effectively relieve the pain and discomfort of constipation. Senna is FDA approved for constipation and usually works within eight to 12 hours. Don’t use senna if you have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and follow manufacturer’s directions for use. [4] X Research source You can also try psyllium. Try one tablespoon of psyllium seeds two times a day along with at least two full eight ounce glasses of water. Start out by taking one tablespoon of seeds. If there is no bowel movement within eight to 12 hours, take another tablespoon along with water. If you have asthma or are allergic to psyllium, don’t use this method.4"

      "content": "Increase the fiber in your diet. Try to get about 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is essential for healthy and regular bowel movements. Increasing the fiber in your diet can help prevent constipation and help relieve it when you have it. Foods that contain fiber include: [5] X Research source Fruits and berries. If the fruit has edible skin, like apples, plums, and grapes, make sure you eat those because that is where most of the fiber is. Vegetables. Dark, leafy green vegetables like collard, mustard, and beet greens as well as Swiss chard are very high in fiber. Other vegetables like broccoli, spinach, carrots, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, artichokes, and green beans are high in fiber, too. Beans and legumes. This group includes lentils, kidney, navy, garbanzo, pinto, lima and white beans. Black eyed peas are a high fiber food you can also add. Beans and legumes can cause intestinal gas in some people. If this happens to you, you may want to avoid this source of fiber while you are constipated. Beans and legumes may be best used to prevent any constipation. Whole grains. Whole grains are unprocessed grains, which excludes white grains. Cereals like granola tend to have the highest fiber, but if you are buying boxed cereals, read the label to make sure your choice is high in fiber. Seeds and nuts, such as pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds and almonds, walnuts, and pecans. If you can’t get enough fiber in your diet, consider taking a fiber supplement, like metamucil psyllium seed, or a bulk-forming laxative, like Citrucel, FiberCon, and Benefiber.

      "content": "Eat prunes. Try eating prunes and drinking prune juice . Prunes promote regular bowel movements. Prunes are especially high in fiber and contain sorbitol, a stool-loosening sugar that naturally helps relieve constipation. Sorbitol is a mild colonic stimulant that helps reduce the transit time of stool and decreases the risk of constipation. [7] X Research source If you don't like the wrinkly texture or unique taste of prunes, prune juice may be a better alternative. The juice should start working within a few hours, so it’s important to let one glass pass through your intestines before attempting to drink another, or you may risk diarrhea. Prunes have 14.7 grams of sorbitol per 100 grams, whereas prune juice has 6.1 grams per 100 gram. You will have to drink roughly twice as much prune juice to achieve the same results."

Do the fast walk for about five minutes, and then slow down for another five minutes. The total time walking should be about 10 minutes every hour or so. If that amount of time doesn’t work for you because of other responsibilities, just try to increase the amount of faster-than-normal walking time you do. However, don’t start with the fast walking. Start out slowly for about 30 seconds and speed up every ten steps. It can be a bit uncomfortable, but don’t let that discourage you."

Some people have two to three bowel movements a day, and other people have a bowel movement every other day, and this is normal for them.
