Stay positive and look to lead by example rather than belittle or bemoan. [1] X Research source Take into consideration that they may not even realize that they are mimicking you but is doing so out of a subconscious admiration. Examine your idols and mentors and whether or not you have incorporated any aspects of them being into who you are: how would you want them reacting to you if they knew you were looking up to them? Part of what gives celebrities their value is that they aren’t directly exposed to those they influence whereas you most likely will see the person who is copying you quite frequently.

      "content": "Approach the topic subtly. Acknowledge that someone copying your style doesn’t make you less unique. By acknowledging what makes you unique, you accept that you are your own person and you can then impart the same sense of self-confidence to the person copying you. [3] X Research source Compliment whatever you feel they are copying of yours especially if it is a different take than your own. For example, if you feel that they have been copying the way you wear sneakers with jeans, compliment them when they choose sandals. Realize that they may be extremely insecure and their self-esteem may be fragile or non-existent. [4] X Research source"

Adopting a new style can provide you with an opportunity to evaluate what matters to you and what truly composes your sense of style. Keep your preferences to yourself. If they are copying your style or mannerisms, try to change things up for a period of time. This will force them to look for other inspirations. [5] X Research source Look to other style icons and deconstruct what elements you’d like to adopt as your own; better yet, have a discussion with the person about what style you think suits the both of you individually."

      "title": "Offer help to someone copying you at school or in the office.",
      "content": "Offer help to someone copying you at school or in the office. If someone is copying your work, chances are that they don't fully understand the instructions or their personal schedule has put them behind the deadline and they see you as a reliable source. Politely state that they should be doing their own work because both of you could get into trouble and, more importantly, they are not learning from the given assignment. We all have different aptitudes so be patient with others who have trouble learning something you find easy. [8] X Research source As the old adage goes, “give a man a fish and you’ll feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you’ll feed him for a lifetime.” Rather than give someone complete access to your work, address the problem at its root and find out why they are copying your work. Whether it’s a problem in comprehension or scheduling, identifying why someone is copying your work will avoid any repeat infractions."

      "content": "Confront the person who is copying you. Mention how their actions have negatively affected you and what actions need to take place in order to rectify the situation. Make sure to choose your words carefully and not to escalate the emotions with an angry or elevated tone. Someone who is bluntly mimicking someone else may be sensitive and insecure making them prone to defensiveness when confronted. Say something similar to, “I noticed that you have been wearing very similar outfits to what I have been wearing. You have even bought the exact same shoes and accessories. I can appreciate if you like my fashion sense but shopping lets us express ourselves. Are you aware of what you’re doing?” [12] X Research source Remember people who copy others often have low self-esteem and may be in denial or become defensive. [13] X Research source If their imitation is taking place at work, be professional and courteous so as to ensure your professional status. Make sure not to burn bridges with coworkers by consulting the human resources department to ensure the most professional approach possible based on the company’s standards and policies. Take a deep breath before and during the confrontation. Keep calm when delivering news that the person may see as accusatory. Open body language and a friendly demeanor can help defuse their defensiveness."

      "content": "If they continue to copy you even after you have confronted them, avoid them. Don’t use up valuable emotional and mental resources by dwelling on what you can’t control. Removing yourself from the situation takes a proactive approach in dealing with someone copying you: out of sight, out of mind.

Finding the humor in the situation can help you deal with any stress or aggravation."

      "content": "Seek out trademarks, copyrights, or patents. Trademarks relate to businesses and branding. Protect your invention or discovery with a patent. Get copyrights to written works, creative projects and computer programs. Depending on where you live, there are specific procedures you must take in order to achieve each so it’s best to consult a professional. Getting a trademark does not fully protect you as trademarks may only be good within a certain jurisdiction. Creativity is a mysterious thing and often a difficult area to prove ownership. In America, a copyright is grounded in the US constitution; therefore, do your due diligence if working internationally. Depending on your contribution, you may be awarded different levels of a copyright if working collaboratively. The US Patent and Trademark Office manages trademarks and patents domestically but can also be the basis where international trademarks are registered. Registering with the US Customs may help stop the import of goods that infringe your patent or trademark."
