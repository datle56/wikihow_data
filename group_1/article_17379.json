[3] X Research source Your shade should be 2/3 the height of the lamp base. [4] X Research source If the lamp is too tall for the shade, the harp will be exposed and cause a top-heavy effect. If your lamp is going to sit at eye level, it’s important to make sure the shade will be tall enough to cover the harp."

Installing one doesn’t require tools. All you need to do is screw in the bulb and attach the shade. [7] X Research source An UNO fitting is also recommended for bridge arm floor lamps. UNO fitters can be found on small and medium shades, and rarely on large and oversized shades."

There are different clip-on sizes, so make sure that the one you choose matches the size and shape of your lightbulb. Clip-on lampshades come in different sizes such as bell, conical, coolie, cylindrical, and drum shape. [8] X Research source Hexagonal shades can be paired with rustic rooms.

If the lamp has a round base, you should use a round lampshade. Use a square shade on a lamp with an angular or square silhouette. However, there are exceptions to these rules. [9] X Research source For example, candlestick lamps have many curves and angles, so they can be paired with any lampshade. Pair a round shade with a square lamp that’s sitting on a round table."

With a wider lampshade, the lamp won’t look unbalanced. Vice versa, if the lampshade is decorative, choose a simple base [10] X Research source"
