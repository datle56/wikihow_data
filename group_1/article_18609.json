[1] X Research source It’s usually much easier to exfoliate when your skin is already soft and warm, so it’s important to soak them first. If your feet are feeling sore, add 300 g (1.5 cups) of Epsom salt to your bath. This will help soothe your aching feet and muscles.

If you notice that there are areas on your feet that aren’t getting softer with the pumice stone, take an emery board and rub it gently across these areas. [6] X Research source Foot files are super sharp, and they can hurt your feet if you rub too hard. Start out slowly and then work your way up to shave down your skin. Foot files work great on corns and calluses, too."

Once you get out of the shower or the bath and you’ve exfoliated, pat your feet dry and apply a moisturizer all over your feet. [7] X Research source If you’re prone to athlete’s foot or fungal infections, don’t put moisturizer in between your toes. The moist environment can grow bacteria and fungus. Remember that lotion and cream can make your feet slippery, so be careful if you step onto a tiled or hardwood floor with your bare feet after applying moisturizer!"

[8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source To avoid rubbing the petroleum jelly onto your sheets at night, wear socks to bed.
