      "content": "As you alternate, try to keep the unused pistol in the low ready position between shots. If you fire both pistols in different directions, check in advance that there's nothing that would be dangerous or irresponsible to shoot in the direction you aren't looking. And naturally, shooting in a direction without looking will be very bad for that hand's accuracy."
