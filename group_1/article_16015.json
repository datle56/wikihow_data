Once your Dragonair reaches level 55, it will evolve into a Dragonite. [1] X Research source If you choose to use battle experience, note that Dragonair (and its evolutions) are part of the slow evolution group, which means they take the longest to evolve as they need more experience points to level up. [2] X Research source The reason for this is that Dragonair's final evolution Dragonite is known as a \"pseudo-legendary\" Pokémon. [3] X Research source Pseudo-legendary Pokémon are more powerful than most other non-legendary Pokémon due to having naturally high base stats, which in turn makes them harder to raise."
