      "content": "Keep a clean towel handy. You may not like to think about it, but your bathroom towel is one of the most bacteria-ridden items in your home. Bacteria grows on organic material and in damp places, making your bathroom towel a perfect breeding ground for the bacteria it collects from your skin. Spreading this bacteria can lead to skin infections and illness. Follow these steps to take care of your towels: [1] X Research source Never share towels with other members of the household. Wash towels at least once per week or every 3-4 uses. If you are showering after athletics or a physically demanding job, wash them more often. Wash towels at high heat.

Consider a separate towel for your hair. It is best to use a microfiber towel, or even an old t-shirt, whole or cut into a towel shape. For long hair you can roll it into a turban. Hold your head upside down. Place the long side of the towel along the base of your head at the hairline. Close the towel around your hair and gather it at the top of your forehead. Twist the towel until it has gathered all of your hair and shortened the length of the towel, usually two or three turns. Take this tail you have created over the top of your head and tuck the tail into the edge of the towel at the base of your head."
