      "content": "Hit the % key to turn a percentage into a decimal. When you hit the % button on a calculator, the number will automatically turn into a decimal. For some calculators, you will see this action, while on others, it’ll happen “behind the scenes.” This means you don’t have to do any mental math when doing a percentage conversion! Most calculators have a key with a % symbol; however, more advanced graphing calculators may not have this key readily available. Whenever you use a calculator for percentage calculations, make sure to press the Clear (C) or All Clear (AC) button before starting. You can also use the % key to convert any number from a percentage to a decimal. For instance, if you enter 4% into your calculator, you’ll get the decimal equivalent 0.04. Practice Problem: What is a 15% tip on a $75.32 bill? Find the answer: Enter 15% x 75.32 into your calculator (don’t forget to hit the % button). You should get 11.298, which represents a tip of $11.30."

[1] X Expert Source David Jia Math Tutor Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. To do this, simply divide the percentage by 100. [2] X Research source For example, let’s say you’re at a restaurant and want to tip 15% of your $100 bill. Before finding how much you’ll tip, first turn 15% into a decimal by dividing 15 by 100. This will give you 0.15."

      "content": "Replace the % with a multiplication sign. When working with percentages, the word “of” carries the same meaning as “times” or “multiply.” To find the percentage of a number, multiply the percentage decimal by the number. Therefore, 15% “of” 100, for example, means the same as 15% x 100 or 0.15 x 100. [3] X Research source In our example, this means a 15% tip on a $100 bill is $15."

      "content": "Write your result without a percentage symbol. When you set out to find a percentage of a whole number, your result will be a number and not a percentage. You may begin with a percentage symbol, but when you convert that percentage to a decimal, your answer will no longer have a percentage symbol. [4] X Research source In the example of 15% of 100, the result is the whole number 15."

      "title": "Add percentages as you would whole numbers.",
      "content": "Add percentages as you would whole numbers. Because percentages all represent fractions with a common denominator of 100, you can add a list of percentages without any additional work. When adding, ignore the percent symbol and just add the numbers. Then, put the symbol back in your final answer. [5] X Research source If each of six people draws a portion of the company’s payroll, you can find out how much they represent together by just adding the relative percentages. If their respective shares are 10%, 5%, 8%, 22%, 10%, and 8%, you can just add 10+5+8+22+10+8 = 63 . Those six people make up 63% of the company’s payroll. By contrast, remember that to add fractions , you must work through finding common denominators and converting your fractions to those denominators."

Again, because percentages represent fractions with a common denominator of 100, you do not need to do any additional work to subtract percentages . If you are removing some percentage from an original whole item, represent the whole item with the number 100 (because the whole means 100%). [6] X Research source Suppose you want to calculate an income percentage. 100% represents the entire income from some project, but then you must subtract, for example, 10% for expenses, 12% for salaries, and 25% for taxes. How much is left? Simply use your calculator to perform the subtraction of 100-10-12-25. The result is 53% ."

As Jia instructs, if you have a problem that is initially written as 25% x 30 , just write the 25% as its decimal equivalent 0.25 and conduct the operation. This would be 0.25 x 30 which gives the result of 7.5. [7] X Expert Source David Jia Math Tutor Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. Similarly, if you have a division problem of 200 ÷ 10% , rewrite this as 200 ÷ 0.10 and enter this into your calculator. You will get the result of 2000. [8] X Research source The last result may be surprising, but not every division result will be smaller than the original percentage. For example, dividing by 1/10 is the same as multiplying by 10. Dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2."

      "title": "Divide fractions to convert them to decimals.",
      "content": "Divide fractions to convert them to decimals. If you are presented with any fraction, you can very easily convert it to a decimal number using a calculator. Think of the fraction as a division problem, and use your calculator to divide the numerator by the denominator. Your calculator will give you the decimal equivalent of the fraction. [9] X Research source Suppose you have the fraction 1/2. On your calculator, perform the operation 1 ÷ 2, and the calculator will show the result 0.5. Convert the fraction 1/4 into a decimal by performing the operation 1 ÷ 4. The result is 0.25. For a more complicated example, you can convert the fraction 274/312 into a decimal with the operation 274 ÷ 312. The result will be 0.878. (There are more digits, but for our purposes, we can stop at three.)"

      "content": "Shift the decimal point to convert decimals to percentages. If you have a number that is already represented by a decimal, converting that to a percentage is easy! Because the decimal numbering system is based on factors of 10, you can transform a decimal number into a percentage by simply shifting the decimal point two spaces to the right and adding a % sign at the end. [10] X Research source For example, 1/2 can be converted to the decimal of 0.5. Shift the decimal point two spaces to the right to change this decimal to a percentage. Rewrite 0.5 as 0.50. Then, when you shift the decimal point two spaces, you turn 0.50 into the number 50%. The example of 1/4, which has a decimal equivalent of 0.25, can be turned into the percentage 25%. If your decimal number consists of only one digit, you can add zeros on the right of the number, such as turning 0.5 into 0.50 or even 0.500. These all have the same numerical value."
