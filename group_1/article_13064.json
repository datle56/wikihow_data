      "content": "Turn off the ignition and open the hood. Always turn your car off before you disconnect the battery to reduce the risk of electrocution. Then, look inside your car for a lever to pull that will release the hood latch. Check the side panels near the floor around the driver's seat—that's usually where it is. [1] X Research source In some cars, the battery is actually under the passenger seat or in the trunk . If you're having a hard time finding your battery, check your owner's manual. If you've just been driving, wait 20-30 minutes for the engine and battery to cool before you get started. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Locate the battery and identify the positive and negative terminals. The battery will be a big block with cables coming out of it. Typically the terminals are covered with plastic caps that make it really easy to tell the terminals apart—the positive terminal is covered with a red cap and the negative terminal has a black cap. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If the plastic caps are no longer there, look for the \"-\" symbol to indicate the negative terminal. The \"+\" symbol indicates the positive terminal. Suit up with safety goggles and utility work gloves to protect your eyes and hands. If you're wearing rings or bracelets, it's a good idea to take those off too—it helps reduce the risk of electrocution."

      "title": "Loosen the nut",
      "content": "Loosen the nut on the negative terminal. If you have a socket wrench set handy, compare the sockets to the nut until you find the right size. If you don't have a socket wrench set, no problem—a small adjustable wrench will usually do the trick. [4] X Research source It shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 counter-clockwise turns to loosen the nut enough that you can take the terminal off. You don't need to remove the nut completely."

      "title": "Remove the negative terminal cable.",
      "content": "Remove the negative terminal cable. If there's a lot of corrosion, wiggle the connector around a bit to get it free. Then, push the cable back and away from the battery tray so it won't accidentally reconnect with the battery. [5] X Research source If the cable keeps springing back, cover the metal terminal connector with tape. That way, it won't make a connection even if it does happen to touch the battery."

      "title": "Take off the bracket that holds the battery in place.",
      "content": "Take off the bracket that holds the battery in place. Check out how the bracket works—sometimes they just snap on. If it has nuts, use the same wrench you used to loosen the nuts on the terminals to remove the bracket. Set any parts you've removed somewhere safe away from the car—you don't want them falling down into the engine bay where it would be a pain to get them out."

      "content": "Lift the battery straight up out of the tray. Raise the battery with both hands, keeping it upright and level as you move it. Car batteries have liquid battery acid inside—if it sloshes around it could leak out and cause burns. If you've never handled a car battery before, give it a little test lift first so you can make sure you've got a good grip—at 30 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kg), they're heavier than they look!"

Your local auto parts store will likely have the part you need. If they look fine, just give them a good wipe with a rag or towel so they're clean.

      "content": "Clean the corrosion off the terminals with baking soda. Get a plastic cup of tap water and dissolve 1 teaspoon (7 grams) of baking soda in it. Then, pour it over the terminals and use an old toothbrush or round wire brush to scrub away the corrosion. [8] X Research source If there's a lot of corrosion, let the baking soda solution sit for about 5 minutes to penetrate before you start scrubbing. If you're putting your old battery back in the car, do the same thing with the posts on the battery so everything is clean and corrosion-free. Once the terminals are clean, dry them off and apply a layer of petroleum jelly or anti-corrosion grease to keep future corrosion at bay."

      "content": "Screw the bracket back in place over the battery. Get that bracket you took off to remove the battery and line it up so you can fit the screws or nuts back in place. Then, use the same wrench you used to remove it to put it back. You might be tempted to just leave it off, but the bracket helps reduce the vibrations that can cause your battery to die faster."

Fit the connector over the post and hold it down so that it sits flush against the battery. Then, use your wrench to tighten the nut with clockwise turns. [9] X Research source As a rule of thumb, if there's ever just one terminal connected to your battery at any time, it needs to be the positive one."
