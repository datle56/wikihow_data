      "content": "Name the behavior and state that it is wrong. Clearly state to the harasser the specific thing they are doing and that the behavior is inappropriate. For example, say, “Do not whistle at me, that is harassment,”,\"I am not comfortable by the way you are touching me. Stop! That is harassment\" or “Do not touch my butt. That is sexual harassment.” [1] X Research source Attack the behavior, not the person. Tell them what they are doing that you do not like (“You are standing too close”) rather than blaming them as a person (“You are such a jerk”). Avoid cursing, name-calling, put-downs, and other actions that may escalate the situation unnecessarily. Avoid making statements of opinion such as, “I’d like it if you didn’t touch me.” This can invite further conversation. Provide alternatives if necessary, such as, “You are standing too close. Please give me 3 feet of personal space.”"

      "title": "Tell the person to stop contacting you.",
      "content": "Tell the person to stop contacting you. If the person continues the unwanted behavior, it might be time to break off contact. Tell the person that you expect them to stay away, and that you will no longer be answering correspondence. Be clear that if the person continues harassing you, you will take steps to put a stop to it. [2] X Research source You might say, “Your behavior is making me uncomfortable. Please don’t contact me again. If you do, I will call the police.” Do not get into a dialogue with the harasser, or try to reason with them, or answer their questions. You do not need to respond to diversions, questions, threats, blaming, or guilt-tripping."

      "content": "Voice your boundaries with someone you'll see often. If the harasser is someone you have to see frequently—say, someone at school or someone who works with you—you can still set boundaries that make sense for your situation. Tell the person to stop hanging out by your desk or approaching you at lunchtime, for example. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Stop answering the person's calls, emails, and other messages. If the person tries to get in touch, don't answer their calls, emails, or texts. At this point, you've made your position clear, so if the person continues to contact you, they are explicitly going against the boundaries you've laid out. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the person from your phone and social media accounts.",
      "content": "Remove the person from your phone and social media accounts. This way you'll ensure the harasser no longer has access to you or the information you share with other people. Delete the person from your phone, and set up a block on that number if possible. Unfriend the person from your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other accounts. [5] X Research source There’s a chance the person may try to friend or follow you again using a different identity. Closely screen new connections and verify their identity before accepting any requests. If the person has posted something disparaging about you, you can flag the post and alert the staff (of Facebook, Twitter, etc.) so that the post will be removed."

      "title": "Keep records of the harassment.",
      "content": "Keep records of the harassment. If you continue getting harassed, keep a record of every incident that occurs. At this point, the harasser's actions may be considered illegal, and if they continue you're going to need to get other people involved. Having evidence of the behavior can help your case. [6] X Research source Keep all email and text correspondence you have received, especially regarding any boundaries you’ve set. Note any dates of significance, such as a day you asked for contact to stop, for example, and keep any records to back it up. Write down an account of what has happened, noting the date and place of each incident. Keep the names of other people who have witnessed the harassing behavior in case you need to ask them to verify your account of what occurred."

      "content": "File a report with the police. If the harassment reaches a threatening level and you no longer feel safe, call the police right away. Explain what’s happening and present any evidence you have. Try to stick to the facts in your description. Get the badge number of the police officer who answers your call. Doing so can help you create a better chain of evidence if you have to call again in the future. If you are reporting harassing text messages or cyber activity, it might be best to request an audience with a detective who can investigate such activity. Know that the police are unlikely to do anything at this early point, but creating a formal report helps create a history of your complaint. In some cases, people who harass others may have done it before. If the perpetrator has a pattern of harassing behavior, the police may be more likely to take action."

      "content": "Get a restraining order . You can also get a restraining order to protect yourself and your family from the harasser. You'll need to file a petition for a restraining order, have it served to the person harassing you, and have a court hearing during which a judge will rule on what specific protections the restraining order will provide. You'll then receive restraining order papers that you should keep on hand in case the person ever violates the order. [8] X Trustworthy Source WomensLaw.org Site associated with the National Network to End Domestic Violence aimed at providing free legal resources and aid to survivors of domestic violence. Go to source A restraining order usually specifies that the harasser cannot make contact with you or come within a certain distance of you. If you are in immediate danger, you can get a temporary restraining order that will prevent the person from being able to legally come near you or get in contact with you at least until your court date. Keep detailed records and report each time the harasser violates your restraining order to the police, if needed."

      "content": "Confide in your friends and family. Going through this experience alone is dangerous and frightening. It's important to tell the people in your life that you are being harassed, and that you're fearful for your safety. Be sure to keep people in the loop about where you are on a daily basis so they'll be aware if something out of the ordinary happens. [9] X Research source Tell people you trust if you go out of town or need to miss work. Make sure people know not to give the harasser any information about you.

This may seem like a drastic step, but it could give you peace of mind. Plus, you should always take threats from a harasser seriously—if they’re threatened to harm you, they may try! Reach out to a friend or relative by saying, “I’m afraid to sleep here alone. Would you mind coming over?”"

      "content": "Don't publicize your location and daily habits. If you're an active social media user, it might be time to take a break from publicizing your habits or using the service at all. Even if you deleted the harasser from your accounts, he or she might have a way of checking them through someone else's account. [10] X Research source Don't use FourSquare and other apps that tell people exactly where you are. Turn off the location feature on your phone while using social media apps. Don't publicly say that you're going out of town, or that you'll be alone for a certain amount of time. Try avoiding situations where you might be vulnerable to an attack, such as walking alone at night. It may give you some peace of mind to change your routines a bit every day.
