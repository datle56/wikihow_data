[3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you often overextend your joints, you may develop arthritis over time. Arthritis is a disorder in the joints that causes severe inflammation and pain. To avoid developing this, make sure you aren’t pushing your joints past their normal range of motion too often, or on purpose. Overextending your joints could cause you to dislocate them. Dislocating your joints is painful and can damage the cartilage between your joints. It is common for people with hypermobility to dislocate or partially dislocate joints. This often due to minor trauma or, less often, some people dislocate their joints by minor self-manipulation. If you dislocate a joint, seek medical attention to reset it. [4] X Research source"
