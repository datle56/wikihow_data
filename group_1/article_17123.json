A reverse geocoding tool does the opposite and finds the nearest address for a given set of coordinates. Find a geocoding tool online to get the most accurate address based on your longitude and latitude. Some popular reverse geocoding tools include: [1] X Research source LatLong: https://www.latlong.net/ Texas A&M’s Geoservices department: https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/ReverseGeocoding/Interactive/ GPS-Coordinates: https://www.gps-coordinates.net/"

In the latitude box, enter the north/south coordinate. Include all minutes and seconds to get the most accurate results possible. [2] X Research source Coordinates are listed in degrees, minutes, and seconds. So a coordinate of 44° 56’ 9.816\" S reads as 44 degrees, 56 minutes, and 9.816 seconds. Occasionally, western and southern coordinates will use a minus sign (-) instead of a cardinal direction. You may come across coordinates that list the degree and gives the minutes and seconds as a decimal. Type your coordinates in using whatever format you have in front of you."

These coordinates are also often overlaid on a globe or world map . Longitude and latitude coordinates are so accurate that you cannot find an exact address without using a geocoding tool or digital map.

Latitude refers to a location’s position in reference to the Equator, and it is used to determine how far north or south a location is. The equator is 0°, with the North Pole at 90° N and the South Pole at 90° S. Use the scale on the side of the map to determine how far north or south your latitude is. Start at the Equator, and work your way up or down the horizontal lines on the map until you’ve found the corresponding location on the side of the scale. [10] X Research source On a world map, the guidelines often represent 15° each, so the first guideline above the equator is 15° N, and the second guideline is 30° N. So if your latitude is given as 44° 56’ 9.816‘‘ S, start at the Equator and move down 3 horizontal lines to reach 45° S. Your latitude will be just above this line. Keep in mind, your scale may be different and each line may represent increments of 5, 10, or 30 degrees."

Once you know how far north or south your location is, move to the Prime Meridian, which is the vertical line that runs through Africa and England. This is 0° longitude. Longitude runs in 180 degrees in either direction going east or west. Start at the Prime Meridian and move left or right based on your map’s scale until you’ve located your approximate location. [11] X Research source For example, if your longitude is given as 116° 32’ 8.192\" E, and your scale lists every guideline as 10 degrees, start at the Prime Meridian and move 11 lines to the right to reach 110° E. Then, move halfway to the middle of the 2 guidelines and slightly to the right to get near 116°."

      "content": "Adjust your location 70 mi (110 km) for every 1 degree. For a more accurate approximation, use the map’s scale to determine the distance between your guidelines. Look for a bar at the bottom of the map where it lists the length of each mile or kilometer. Measure this line using a ruler. Then, measure the distance between guidelines to determine how wide and tall each box on your grid is. Adjust your location by moving 70 mi (110 km) for every 1 degree in your coordinate. [12] X Research source For example, if 100 miles (160 km) is 1 in (2.5 cm) on your ruler, you know that each 1/16 of an inch is the equivalent of 6.25 miles (10.06 km) and every 1 mm is equal to 1 mile (1.6 km). If you’re trying to reach 44° 56’ 9.816\" S and you’re at the guideline for 45°, you know that you need to move up 11.2 hash marks on your ruler if you’re using inches and 70 mm if you’re using the centimeter side."

For example, 44° 56’ lists 56 in the minutes position. Multiply 56 by 1.15 mi (1.85 km) to determine how many miles or kilometers you need to add. [13] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Geological Survey U.S. government agency responsible for conducting scientific research on the nation's land, natural resources, and natural disasters Go to source For 44° 56’, this corresponds to 64.4 miles (10,360,000 cm). If 100 miles (160 km) is 1 in (2.5 cm), then move 0.64 in (1.6 cm) based on the coordinate’s cardinal direction. You can only do this if you have a map with a smaller scale. You can get even more accurate by adding 80 feet (24 m) for every 1 second. This can be nearly impossible to get right without a highly-magnified map, though."

Transfer your location to the second map to find the physical address that corresponds with your longitude and latitude. If you’re doing this without the help of a geocoding tool, you’re going to probably be off a few miles or kilometers. This method works best for finding approximate addresses of coordinates."
