      "title": "Leave the room while you plan.",
      "content": "Leave the room while you plan. Do not spend time in areas where mercury has been spilled until you are prepared to clean it up. Close all doors, windows, and vents leading to other rooms of the building, and open windows leading to the outside. Let everyone in the area know that the room is off-limits, or leave a sign on the door. Make special effort to ensure that children stay away. Only turn on a fan if you can blow the air to an outdoor window that does not lead to another residence. If possible, lower the temperature in the room to reduce the spread of the mercury vapor."

      "title": "Call a professional for large spills.",
      "content": "Call a professional for large spills. If more than 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) have been spilled, the spill should be handled by a professional when possible. This is about the size of a pea, or the amount in one mercury thermometer. If the spill is smaller, or finding a professional is not feasible, skip to the next step. Otherwise: Check your local yellow pages or search online for \"Hazardous waste cleanup,\" \"environmental engineers,\" or \"engineering services\" in your area that you could hire. If the mercury was spilled outdoors, phone our local, state, or national environmental response team. In the United States, call 1-800-424-8802."

      "title": "Put on gloves, old clothing, and old shoes, and remove jewelry.",
      "content": "Put on gloves, old clothing, and old shoes, and remove jewelry. Wear rubber, nitrile, latex, or vinyl gloves whenever handling mercury. Wear old clothes and shoes, as you may need to throw them away afterward. Because mercury can react with metals, remove all jewelry and piercings, especially gold. If you do not have a spare pair of disposable shoes, put your shoes in sturdy plastic bags and fix them to your ankle with rubber bands. If you have safety goggles, put them on. This is not vital for cleaning up mercury spills smaller than a pea, but a large spill may require professional-quality eye protection."

      "content": "Sprinkle the area with powdered sulfur (optional). This is not necessary for small home spills, but if you do find a mercury cleanup kit at a hardware store, the powdered sulfur will make the task easier. This yellow powder turns brown in contact with mercury, making detection of small spills easier, and binds with the mercury to make cleanup easier.

      "content": "Place small objects and fragments in a puncture-proof container. Begin by carefully picking up pieces of broken glass or other small objects that have come into contact with mercury. Place these in a disposable puncture-proof container such as a sharps container or glass jar. If no disposable puncture-proof container is available, instead place a zip-locked bag inside a second zip-locked bag, and fold all broken material inside a paper towel before placing in the bag. Leave tiny specks of broken glass alone for now. We'll handle them later."

      "content": "Bag carpet, clothing, or other soft contaminated material. If the mercury has spilled onto an absorbent surface, you cannot save this material on your own. A trained professional may be able to help, but if you are cleaning up the spill at home, all you can do is cut out the affected area and discard it in a double trash bag. Never wash this material, as it can contaminate your washing machine or pollute the water or sewage system.

Wrap the sticky tape around your gloves finger, with the sticky side out, then pick up the contaminants and place the tap inside a zip-locked bag. Alternatively, dab shaving cream onto a disposable paint brush and use the brush to pick up the mercury. Place the paint brush in the bag along with the mercury. Do not apply shaving cream directly to a mercury-contaminated brush."
