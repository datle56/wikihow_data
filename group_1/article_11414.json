      "title": "Find an old or unwanted t-shirt to turn into a crop top.",
      "content": "Find an old or unwanted t-shirt to turn into a crop top. Any t-shirt can be turned into a crop top, but it can never be used as a t-shirt again. Therefore, select a t-shirt that’s old (maybe it’s frayed along the edges) or one that you no longer want as a t-shirt (maybe it’s too large to wear as a t-shirt). You could also purchase a t-shirt (new or vintage) to turn into a crop top. [1] X Research source You’ll be cutting off the sleeves, bottom, and collar of the t-shirt, therefore if these areas are damaged, it will not impact the crop top. As you’ll be removing the sleeves of the t-shirt, you can use either a short-sleeve or long-sleeve t-shirt."

      "title": "Determine how short you’d like the crop top to be.",
      "content": "Determine how short you’d like the crop top to be. Try on the t-shirt and determine how short you’d like the crop top to be. [2] X Research source Use a pencil to mark the approximate line where you’ll need to cut the t-shirt. Once the t-shirt is laying flat again, use your ruler or measuring tape to measure the distance between the bottom of the t-shirt and the line you marked with the pencil. Write that measurement down so you don’t forget it. [3] X Research source If you’re unsure how short you want to make the crop top, start with a longer version first. Test out the longer version and, if it’s too long, make additional cuts to shorten the shirt."

      "title": "Mark a line around the t-shirt to indicate where you should make the cut.",
      "content": "Mark a line around the t-shirt to indicate where you should make the cut. Lay the t-shirt back onto a flat surface. Find the approximate centre of the width of the t-shirt along the bottom seam. Use your measuring tape or ruler up from the centre to the distance you previously determined. Mark that spot with your pencil. Measure the same distance up from the bottom of the t-shirt 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) from each side of the t-shirt and mark with your pencil. [4] X Research source You will not be making a straight cut along the bottom of the t-shirt, therefore you do not need to connect the pencil marks to draw a line."

      "title": "Make three cuts from the bottom of the t-shirt to create the ties.",
      "content": "Make three cuts from the bottom of the t-shirt to create the ties. From the bottom of the t-shirt, make a straight cut up to the middle pencil mark you made. From the same spot on the bottom, make a diagonal cut to the right, up to the approximate location of the right-side pencil mark. Repeat the process on the left side. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Your diagonal cuts should be at an approximate 45 degrees angle from the bottom of the t-shirt. The triangle pieces of fabric left on the front of the shirt will be the ties of your crop top."

      "content": "Cut the rest of the bottom of the t-shirt off. Make a cut from the top of each diagonal to the sides of the t-shirt. Flip the t-shirt over so the front is laying on the table. Cut the rest of the bottom of the t-shirt off along the back of the t-shirt. [7] X Research source If you want, you can make more pencil marks with your measuring tape or ruler along the back of the shirt to ensure you’re cutting in the correct place."

      "title": "Cut both sleeves off the t-shirt along the seam.",
      "content": "Cut both sleeves off the t-shirt along the seam. Lay the t-shirt onto a flat surface, such as a table or counter. Use sharp scissors to cut off both sleeves along the inside of the seams where the sleeves were sewn onto the shirt. In other words, you want to cut the seam off with the sleeves. [8] X Research source Use the sharpest scissors that you have to cut the fabric. Dull scissors may catch on the fabric or not be able to cut through 2 layers of fabric."

      "content": "Remove the collar of the t-shirt along the seam. While the shirt is laying flat, use sharp scissors to cut the collar off the shirt. Like the sleeves, cut the collar off on the inside of the seam such that the seam of the collar is also removed. [9] X Research source Your crop top is what you make it, therefore, feel free to keep the collar of the t-shirt if you prefer."

      "content": "Select an old or unwanted button-up blouse you want to convert to a crop top. The only requirement for this crop top is that the blouse you start with is a button-up. It can be long-sleeved or short-sleeved and can be made of any material. [10] X Research source If you don’t have a button-up blouse at home that you can use to make a crop top, you can purchase an inexpensive button-up blouse at a clothing store or a gently worn blouse at a vintage store."

Use a pencil to mark the approximate distance from the bottom of the shirt where you want to blouse to be cut. Just make one mark somewhere on the blouse. [11] X Research source You may want to ask a friend for assistance with this step. Ask your friend to mark the spot with your pencil while you stand straight."

Use a measuring tape or ruler to measure the approximate distance between the bottom of the blouse and the pencil mark you made. Write this measurement down on a piece of paper. [12] X Research source Err on the side of caution if you aren’t 100% sure how short you want your crop top to be. You can always cut more fabric off later if the crop top is too long, but you can’t make the crop top longer if you cut off too much."

Use your measuring tape or ruler to measure the distance from the bottom of the back of the blouse, based on the measurement you previously wrote down. Make 4 or 5 marks with a pencil along the back of the shirt, then draw a line between those marks. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that the distance from the bottom of the blouse may be different if the bottom of the blouse is not straight. Some button-up blouses have curved ends so they can be tucked into pants. If your button-up blouse is curved at the bottom, measure up from the two side seams and draw a line between those two marks."

Repeat the same process on the opposite side of the blouse. [15] X Research source These diagonal cuts can be at approximately 45-degree angles. The triangle pieces of fabric that are left on the bottom of the blouse can be used as ties when wearing the crop top.

It can be an old tank top, an unwanted tank top, or even a new tank top that you would prefer be turned into a different style. [17] X Research source The style of the tank top doesn’t matter. However, the longer the tank top, the better, as you’ll be using that length to make ties behind your back. Tank tops made of stretchy fabrics will work better than those made of stiff fabric."

Start the crop top conversion process by making a straight cut down the middle of the front of the tank top using your sharp scissors. You want the cut to be made vertically, from the top middle of the front of the tank top to the bottom middle of the front of the tank top.

Try on the tank top to measure that distance or estimate the distance without trying it on. Use a ruler and a pencil to mark a cut line along the entire back of the tank top, from the left side to the right side.

Take the left front side of the top, pull it over your left breast and the right-side fabric, and bring the bottom portion around to your back. Tie the two pieces of fabric together at your back. [21] X Research source If the fabric pieces are long enough, you can tie them into a bow. Otherwise, just make a knot with the fabric."
