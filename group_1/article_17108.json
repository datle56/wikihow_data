      "content": "Adopt a turtle. Contact an animal rescue organization. Run a web search for turtle rescue societies in your area. These organizations recover pet turtles that have been lost, abandoned, injured, or otherwise scattered from their homes. This can be a great way to give a turtle a new home. [2] X Research source You will need to visit a turtle adoption center and prove that you will be a responsible turtle owner. Make sure that you understand what it means to adopt a turtle. These animals require specialized and thoughtful care, feeding, housing, and cleaning."

      "content": "Find a pet store. If there is a pet store near you, stop in and ask about their turtle selection. If you find a pet store that is relatively far away, then call ahead to ask before you make the trek. Be aware that pet stores do not always take adequate care of turtles. If possible, visit a pet store that is well-reviewed, or that a friend has recommended."

      "title": "Make sure that the turtle is healthy.",
      "content": "Make sure that the turtle is healthy. This is especially important if you are buying from a pet store. In general, a turtle is healthy if it is active, social, and responsive to human interaction. It should be mobile and well-fitted to its shell. If you aren't sure, ask a pet store employee – but do not take their words without a grain of salt! [3] X Research source Look for a turtle with bright, clear eyes. Dull, crusty, or pus-filled eyes are a sign that a turtle is infected with disease. Find a happy and active animal. Watch the turtle in its tank: it should move around, swim, and splash. If it is in a tank with other turtles, it should be friendly and sociable around the other animals. Check that the turtle is not overweight or underweight. If its skin sags from its body, then it might be underweight. If it cannot get fully inside of its shell, then it might be overweight."

      "content": "Consider leaving a turtle in the wild. It is one thing to buy a turtle from a pet store or adopt a turtle from a rescue society, especially if you intend to take good care of the animal. Taking a turtle from its natural habitat, however, removes it from access to mates, food, and space to wander. Think about whether the turtle would be better off"

      "title": "Find wild turtles.",
      "content": "Find wild turtles. Look along the banks of small ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Turtles like damp areas with a lot of rocks and hiding spots. Turtles are especially active at dawn on rainy days, and they move around a lot in the heat of late May and June. Know that turtles love to dig. A turtle may bury itself up to its shell in the loose mud of a sandy bank, and it may be hard to spot unless you keep a sharp eye out. Try poking gently in spots where the bank has shifted. If you feel something solid, it might be a turtle shell. Keep your eyes out for turtles in the open: in yards or parks, or crossing the road. If you find a turtle in an unsafe space or an inhospitable environment—such as a road, a hot parking lot, or a very dry area—consider at least moving it to the nearest pond."

      "title": "Catch the turtle by hand.",
      "content": "Catch the turtle by hand. If the turtle is small and easy to reach, then you can simply pick it up by its shell. Expect the turtle to recoil into its shell when you reach for it. Be careful not to shake the animal or injure it in any way. As soon as possible, place the turtle into an open box with water, a bit of lettuce, and plenty of fresh air. Be aware that turtles can bite, and that some can cause serious damage! Do not try to pick up a snapping turtle. It can be done, but it is a risky move. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Build a trap.",
      "content": "Build a trap. Consider making a basic turtle trap if you are trying to, say, catch a turtle that's been living in your garden. First, dig a hole deep and steep enough for the turtle to fall into. Alternately, prop up a shoebox on a stick such that the turtle will knock over the stick and trap itself in the box. Then, bait the trap: use leafy greens, or a smelly fish like tuna. Leave the trap overnight, and check it each day until you catch the turtle. Make sure to poke air-holes in the shoebox! There is no sense in killing the turtle. Place your trap close to where you've seen the turtle. If the turtle is in a pond, make the trap near the shore of the water."

      "title": "Fence in the area.",
      "content": "Fence in the area. If you have lost a turtle in your home or yard, create a solid perimeter that keeps the animal from escaping further afield. Close doors, move furniture, and try to keep a good idea of where the turtle might be. Restrain any large pets that might try to prey on the turtle. This includes dogs and cats.

    {
      "title": "Search for the turtle.",
      "content": "Search for the turtle. Check every room. Turtles can move quickly when they want to do so, and the animal may have roamed further than you expect. Look underneath furniture, and do not make any assumptions about where the turtle might be. Expect it to be most active during the day, and to sleep at night. [6] X Research source Make sure that the turtle hasn't fallen down stairs, or fallen from a high place. Block off these danger zones, if you haven't already. Listen for movement. If you have tile or hardwood floors, then you might be able to hear the quiet scratch of the turtle's claws as it walks."

      "title": "Be patient but proactive.",
      "content": "Be patient but proactive. Try leaving food and water out for your turtle so that it emerges from its hiding spot. Keep that part of the house quiet so that the animal feels safe. Expect a turtle to survive on its own for one to two weeks, indoors – but try to find it as quickly as possible to minimize any danger! Remember: turtles don't usually drink from small dishes of water. They drink water as they are immersed in it."
