    {
      "title": "Prepare for the battle.",
      "content": "Prepare for the battle. The Oceanid is immune to all Hydro attacks, meaning you will need to have party members with elements that react with Hydro. Pyro, Cryo, Geo, and Electro all react with Hydro resulting in vaporize, frozen, crystallized, and electrocharged, while Anemo, and Dendro are all ineffective in fighting the Oceanid. You will also want a character that can regenerate your other characters' health, such as Noelle. If you do not have a character that can regenerate HP, then you will need a lot of food, and you will need to pay attention very closely. Select characters of the highest level to deal the maximum damage. This is because of the timed nature of the battle; if you are unable to defeat the hydro mimics within a certain period of time, a whirlpool will emerge underneath, draining your current character's health until it is down or until it explodes. This cannot be avoided."
