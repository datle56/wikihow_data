      "content": "Lay out an old towel or blanket. On a surface you don’t mind denting (a garage floor, a carport, etc.), lay out an old towel or blanket. You may wind up having to throw this item away, so make sure it is not a new or favorite item. The thicker the fabric is, the better. Ideally, the fabric will be able to remain intact when faced with glass , jagged metal, and other broken parts. A solid wool or cotton throw will work well, while you should stay away from linen."

      "content": "Set aside a sledgehammer. Once your stage has been set, grab a sledgehammer. A sledgehammer will be easy enough to wield and heavy enough to damage all of the complex components that make up your computer. [1] X Research source Sledgehammers come in various sizes and weights. If you are nervous about holding a 10-pound (160 oz) hammer, you can likely find a 3-5 pound (48-80 oz) one at your local hardware store."

      "title": "Place a second blanket over the computer.",
      "content": "Place a second blanket over the computer. Place a second blanket or towel on top of your computer, lining the edges up with the bottom fabric as much as possible. This fabric , too, should be something you have no desire to save, because it may need to be thrown away. If you have one thin blanket and one thick, place the thicker one on top. A thin blanket or towel may unravel if it is hit directly with a sledgehammer."

      "content": "Hit the computer through the blanket until every piece is broken. Now the fun part!

      "content": "Clean up after yourself. Once your computer has been destroyed, make sure you properly dispose of all of the pieces. Batteries, for instance, should never be thrown in your dumpster, but should be disposed of according to your city’s codes. Electrical parts are similarly tricky, and should be handled with care. Most municipal sites have information regarding disposal practices. You can also contact your city or county’s waste management department for disposal instructions."

      "content": "Wipe your hard drive of all personal information. Remove all of your personal information by reformatting your hard drive, transferring your files to an external hard drive or USB drive and then deleting them, or having your hard drive overwritten. Transferring and deleting your files is the easiest way to wipe your hard drive, and requires no outside help. It is not the most secure method of removal. Reformatting your hard drive can be done by going into Windows Disk Management, right-click on the volume that you want to format, and choose Format. Using File Shredder is the DIY way to overwrite and format a disk. Make sure to do it on a different computer, as it will also delete system files, basically like if you just got a new drive. Overwriting your hard drive is typically done by a computer professional or some helpful third-party software for a fee. If your computer has a lot of personal or financial information, this may be the safest option."
