      "content": "Come up with an idea. How about drawing a character from your favorite website? One great place to start is trying to draw a WeeMee from WeeWorld.com When you draw the face first, don't add a nose, just do a simple black outline. Then, draw the features. Don't use colored pencils, just your main writing utensil. Then, add the clothes, and hairstyle. Remember to use your imagination! Erase any unwanted lines. Now color with artist utensils, such as paintbrushes, colored pencils, crayons, etc. Remember to add some detail to your character, make it pop out."
