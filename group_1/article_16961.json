The numbers next to these headers are your Mac’s private IP address and your router’s private IP address, respectively. You can also see your IP address by clicking on the TCP/IP tab on the left side of the Details window. This tab displays additional information too, such as your IPv6 address (a longer IP address that contains a mixture of numbers and letters). For earlier versions of macOS, find your IP address by going to Apple menu > System Preferences > Network > Your Connection > Advanced > TCP/IP . You’ll see your Mac’s IP address next to the IPv4 header and your router’s address next to Router ."

It may look like an IPv6 address (a long string of numbers and letters in groups separated by colons)."
