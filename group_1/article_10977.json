Let's say you're working with the equation 2 / x = 10 / 13 {\\displaystyle 2/x=10/13} . You would then multiply the left numerator 2 by the right denominator 13. 2 ∗ 13 = 26 {\\displaystyle 2*13=26} . Jia reminds us that you can only cross-multiply 2 fractions if there’s an equals sign between them. If they’re on the same side of the equals sign, you can’t cross-multiply them."

It doesn’t really matter which pair of numerators and denominators you start multiplying first as long as you multiply both numerators by the denominators diagonal from them. [1] X Research source Another way to think of cross-multiplication is by using this formula: if you have the equation a / b = c / d {\\displaystyle a/b=c/d} , you would multiply them out to get the equation a d = c b {\\displaystyle ad=cb} ."

      "content": "Solve for the variable x. Start by finding the greatest common factor between 26 and 10x. This is the largest number that divides exactly into both numbers. In this case, since both 26 and 10x are even numbers, they can both be divided by 2; 26 / 2 = 13 {\\displaystyle 26/2=13} and 10 / 2 = 5 {\\displaystyle 10/2=5} . You're left with 13 = 5 x {\\displaystyle 13=5x} . Then, to get x by itself and find its value, divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, 13 / 5 = 5 x / 5 {\\displaystyle 13/5=5x/5} , or 13 / 5 = x {\\displaystyle 13/5=x} . [3] X Research source If you'd like the convert the fraction to a decimal , start by dividing both sides of the equation by 10 to get 26 / 10 = 10 x / 10 {\\displaystyle 26/10=10x/10} , or 2.6 = x {\\displaystyle 2.6=x} ."

Then, distribute the 4 to get 4 x + 12 {\\displaystyle 4x+12} . [4] X Research source To distribute the 4 into the equation (x + 3), multiply each part of the equation by 4.

Combine the x terms with each other on one side of the equation and the constants (the numbers without x) on the other side. [6] X Research source Combine 4x and 2x by subtracting 2x from both sides. Subtracting 2x from 2x on the right side will leave you with 0. On the left side, 4 x − 2 x = 2 x {\\displaystyle 4x-2x=2x} , so 2x remains on the left-hand side of the equal sign. 2 x + 12 = 2 {\\displaystyle 2x+12=2} Then, combine 12 and 2 by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation so that 2x is left by itself. Subtract 12 from 12 on the left to get 0, and subtract 12 from 2 on the right side to get -10 (since 2 − 12 = − 10 {\\displaystyle 2-12=-10} ). You're left with 2 x = − 10 {\\displaystyle 2x=-10} ."

Go back and check your work by plugging in -5 for x in the original equation to make sure that both sides of the equation are equal. This would look like: [7] X Research source ( − 5 + 3 ) / 2 = ( − 5 + 1 ) / 4 {\\displaystyle (-5+3)/2=(-5+1)/4} , which simplifies to − 1 = − 1 {\\displaystyle -1=-1} .

If that fraction’s product is larger than the other when you compare them with cross multiplication, then we can say the value of that fraction is more than the other fraction. [10] X Research source For example, if we were comparing the fractions 3 / 6 {\\displaystyle 3/6} and 6 / 10 {\\displaystyle 6/10} , then we’d cross multiply like this: 3 ∗ 10 = 30 {\\displaystyle 3*10=30} and 6 ∗ 6 = 36 {\\displaystyle 6*6=36} . In this case, since 36 is larger than 30, and since the 36 product belongs to the fraction with 6 in the numerator, we can say that 6 / 10 {\\displaystyle 6/10} is greater than 3 / 6 {\\displaystyle 3/6} ."

      "content": "Cross multiplying works because it’s a quick way to find common denominators. When we compare two fractions with different denominators, we usually need to find a common denominator so that we’re looking at fractions that share the same number of total parts (for example, 2 / 5 {\\displaystyle 2/5} has fewer total parts than 2 / 10 {\\displaystyle 2/10} since 5 is less than 10).

      "content": "Example: Say we wanted to find a common denominator between 2 / 5 {\\displaystyle 2/5} and 2 / 10 {\\displaystyle 2/10} . First, we multiply the denominators by each other ( 5 ∗ 10 {\\displaystyle 5*10} ) to get a common denominator of 50. Then, to make sure that each fraction still has the same value, we multiply the numerator of each fraction by whatever number we multiply the denominator by. So, multiply 2 ∗ 10 {\\displaystyle 2*10} and 2 ∗ 5 {\\displaystyle 2*5} to get the fractions 20 / 50 {\\displaystyle 20/50} and 10 / 50 {\\displaystyle 10/50} , which are much easier to compare. Notice how if we were simply to cross multiply the original fractions ( 2 / 5 {\\displaystyle 2/5} and 2 / 10 {\\displaystyle 2/10} ), we’d be doing the same operation as the step above, and looking only at the final numerators, 20 and 10. That’s cross multiplication!"
