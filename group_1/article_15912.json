You can reset the BIOS to its default settings by removing the CMOS battery for about 5 minutes and then reconnecting it, or by temporarily moving the CMOS jumper slider to a different position. Removing/replacing the CMOS battery: Turn off your PC and disconnect all cables and peripherals. Open your computer and locate the CMOS battery on the motherboard. It's a round battery in a horizontal or vertical battery holder, or sometimes connected to a header with a wire. [10] X Research source If the CMOS battery is in a holder, take a photo so you can remember which direction it's inserted in, then remove it from the holder for about 5 minutes before replacing it. If it's connected with a wire, disconnect the wire for about 5 minutes, then reconnect it. Reboot and enter the BIOS. Resetting with a jumper: Turn off your PC and disconnect all cables and peripherals. Locate the 3 pins near the CMOS battery, a round disc-style battery. The jumper should have two positions—1-2, and 2-3. The default position is 1-2. Move the jumper to 2-3 and leave it in place for 5 minutes. Move the jumper back to the default position, reboot, and enter the BIOS."
