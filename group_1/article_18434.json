      "content": "Understand the difference between vegetarianism and vegan. Vegans are all vegetarians, but not all vegetarians are vegans. A vegetarian diet cuts out all meat products — beef, poultry, sometimes fish, and so on — but a vegan diet eliminates all animal and animal-based food products. This means vegans do not eat dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, butter, cheese) and eggs. Vegans therefore base their diets around nutrient-rich plants. [1] X Research source The diet of a vegan is more restrictive, and therefore more of a challenge to get complete nutrition (although of course, it is possible), and for underweight individuals, may make it a bit more difficult to gain weight."

[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When trying to lose weight, you want a calorie deficit, meaning you burn more calories through activity than you take in through food. To gain weight, you do the opposite: eat more calories than you burn in the course of a day. [3] X Research source A vegetarian diet offers many calorie-rich options that will help you increase caloric intake without having to cut down on the exercise or activity that keeps you healthy.

But this is typically not what a person who is underweight actually needs. While there is plenty of fat and calories, these foods are lacking in nutrients such as protein, calcium, fiber, and other important needs for a healthy body.

Drink your calories! Instead of drinking only water, drink juices, protein drinks, and smoothies that will bring in calories without filling you up. Add easy calories through garnishes. For example, add olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fruits, to salads."

      "content": "Eat protein-rich food to build muscle mass. A lack of protein is typically the main issue seen with vegan and vegetarian diets. Those following these diets should consistently watch for complete protein. Complete proteins are necessary due to their complete panel of amino acids. However, vegans and vegetarians can consume various protein options that complement one another (called complementary proteins) to form a complete protein that has all 9 essential amino acids. They can also simply consume complete proteins such as garbanzo beans, spirulina, and flax seeds. An example of combined protein would be brown rice and beans.

Some people object to tofu's smooth texture, so you might add TVP (textured vegetable protein) to dishes that need protein that feels like ground meat — tacos, pasta sauces, etc. Add calories to meals through soy garnishes, as well. You can find soy cheese, soy milk, or soy sour cream at your grocery store. Use these products to add calories to salads, baked potatoes, tacos, or granola without filling yourself up."
