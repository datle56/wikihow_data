      "content": "Think about your patterns in love—and avoid repeating mistakes. People naturally put up walls to avoid getting hurt, and that makes total sense. If you know you reject crushes, avoid intimacy, or let insecurity run your romances, then know that acknowledging the issue is a big first step. Now, you’re empowered to change. Look for new approaches in love, for example: [1] X Research source If you distance yourself to avoid getting hurt, communicate that to your crush: “I tend to pull away when I catch feelings, but I don’t want to do that with you.” If you reject people that you have feelings for, try to take things slow: “I like you, and I’m nervous about that. Can we take things slow at the beginning?” If you tend to feel desperate and insecure in love, recenter yourself: “ I know that this isn’t about them, it’s about me. Today, I'm going to focus on things I can control. ”"

      "content": "Accept yourself for who you are, because you’re amazing. No one is perfect, so why are you holding yourself to such a high standard? The truth is, when we actively love and celebrate ourselves, we make it easier for others to as well. Focus on healing old wounds and becoming the best you you can be; then, do your best to come to terms with your insecurities (after all, we all have them!). [2] X Research source Try therapy and journaling to heal. If you’ve been cheated on, for instance, processing with a pro can help you keep that from affecting new romances. Things like exercise, creative expression, or even socializing make us feel more like ourselves. Wish you were someone who read more? Go be that person! Negative self talk feeds insecurity. So instead, challenge them : “No, brain, I’m not the dumbest person in my class. I’m still learning, and that’s great!”"

      "content": "Keep critical thoughts about your own love life in check. When faced with disappointments, sometimes people convince themselves of things that are untrue. This can create hopeless and defeated feelings, and it might even keep you from taking big opportunities in love. Stay positive and correct bad thoughts—positivity takes more effort than negativity, but in the end, you’ll be closer to finding love if you’re willing to do the work. [3] X Research source You’ll never find love: Actually people find love all of the time, and if I put myself out there, there’s no reason that I won’t too. You’re unlovable: This isn’t true. Everyone deserves love, and my future partner will be so glad that I’m such an affectionate, loyal person. I’m too broken for love: I’m working to heal myself every day, and that’s huge. Plus, people don’t need to be totally healed in order to be ready for love."

It might make you feel a little more vulnerable than playing coy, but in the end, it’s more likely to help you find what you’re looking for. You don’t have to share every detail on date #1, but do try to be authentic. [4] X Research source For instance, if you went on a date with someone and had a good time, don't make them chase. Instead, tell them you'd like to hang again : “I had a great time...” Opening up is an important part of building a relationship. You don’t have to confess your deepest feelings right away, but honesty, not mind games, is the key to love."

Try out these tips for overcoming rejection: [5] X Research source Hang out with people you love. You know that friend who always makes you smile? Call them up for a quick coffee to get your mind off of things. Enjoy something you’re passionate about. No matter your relationship status, your love of reading, painting, or running doesn’t change. Go enjoy it! Take a self-care day. A little relaxation and pampering can go a long way, leaving you rejuvenated. Buy a treat, get a facial, or take a long nap."
