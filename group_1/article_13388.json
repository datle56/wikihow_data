      "title": "Rock a ponytail.",
      "content": "Rock a ponytail . Though it’s a classic style, there are plenty of ways to freshen up a ponytail and make it look older for middle school. Wear a high ponytail. This looks especially great if you have medium-length hair. After you put your ponytail in place and secure it with elastic, pull on the top and bottom of the ponytail right beside the band. This will add volume to your hair. This look is also great for athletes and cheerleaders because it looks cute but keeps your hair out of your way. Wear a low side ponytail. If you want to add an extra touch to your side pony, form a part in your hair just above the hairband that’s holding your ponytail. Take the end of your ponytail, and thread it through the hole you made. This will create a kind of twist above your hairband. For a fancier ponytail, wrap a strand of your hair around your hairband to cover it. Tuck it back into the hairband, or secure it with a bobby pin, if you need to. Let your hair draw attention to your face. If you have bangs or layers, let some of your hair hang loose around your face to soften your look. If you don’t have bangs, try wearing a cute headband or headscarf with your ponytail."

Starting with the base of your ponytail, begin to bobby pin your hair rope as you twist is around your hairband. Make sure to bobby pin the end of your ponytail, as well. When you are done, spray your bun with hairspray. [1] X Research source If you want, you can add a scrunchy around your bun to make it more fun.

      "content": "Curl your hair. If you have naturally straight hair, this can be a great way to achieve a soft, romantic wavy look. While your curling iron heats up, use a large clip to secure the top layer of your hair on top of your head. Starting at the back of your head, gather a small amount of hair and wrap it around the curling iron. Make sure that the wand is pointed down toward the floor. Hold each piece of hair around the curling iron, and then release. After you finish the bottom layer of your hair, simply take out your clip and start curling pieces from the top section of your hair. When you curl the pieces of hair near your face, curl them in the opposite direction of your face so that they won’t fall into your eyes. [4] X Research source After you’ve finished curling, gently run your fingers through your hair to make it look more natural. Spritz with hairspray to keep it in place. This is a great style for hanging out with you friends on the weekends, and you’re sure to get plenty of compliments. If you don’t own a curling wand or are usually rushed before school in the morning but still want wavy hair, use the braid method. When your hair is still damp at night, braid it into as many simple braids as you like. The more you braid, the tighter your waves will be. Sleep on these braids. Take them out in the morning, and run your fingers through your newly wavy hair."

      "content": "Define your natural curls. If you have naturally curly hair, you might simply want to define your curls so that they are sleek and distinct. This is a good every day routine for school. When your hair is still damp, comb through it and apply a gel or a mousse. If you have thinner hair opt for a mousse, as it is lighter, but if you have thicker hair, you might want to go for a gel because it offers more hold. [5] X Research source Use your fingers to help shape unruly ringlets. Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer. If you use a diffuser, turn your head over, and push the diffuser up against your hair. The diffuser will help define your curls without making them frizzy. Consider finishing with a styling spray meant to add shine and tame frizz, or just use a regular lightweight hairspray for a little bit of hold."

If you have naturally curly hair, this is good way to go for a completely different look, but if you have almost straight hair, it can make you look a little more put together. Before you start to use your flat iron, prep your hair. While it’s still damp, apply a heat protectant mousse or spray, and then blow dry your hair.

Start about half an inch from your roots, and pull the iron down your hair at an even, slow pace. This is more effective than multiple quick strokes. Leaving a bit of hair unstraightened at your roots will help it to keep some of its volume.

      "content": "Switch up your part. If you want a quick and simple way to change your look, you can simply change the way you part your hair. If you normally part your hair to the side, change the side that you part it on, or try a middle part. If you have a middle part, try moving it over to one side of your head. To change your part, dampen your hair. Use a fine-tooth comb to find your new part, and then comb your hair over to create the part you want. If you have a really prominent natural part or a stubborn cow lick, this might not work for you."
