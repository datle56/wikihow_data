      "content": "Wipe away bird poop with a specialized product. Yes, they exist, and yes, they work. There’s not much to it: simply take a car wipe and attack those bird droppings with a good but gentle amount of pressure. The chemicals in the wipe are specifically formulated to loosen and break up bird poop without damaging the paint on your car. [1] X Research source Afterward, wipe down the area with some water or car shampoo and rinse it with warm water to wash away any residue. Goldberg stands by this poop-cleaning method 100%, stating that it’s one of the “safest methods for sure.”"

      "content": "Scrub the spot with a rag soaked in detailer spray for a speedy shine. Detailer spray is what they use at car dealerships to give the floor models a quick shine. It’s also handy for small trouble spots like bird poop. Give a microfiber towel a few spritzes of spray, then gently wipe the rag back and forth across the bird poop until it comes away. [2] X Research source While this is Goldberg’s preferred method of cleaning bird poop off a car, he still advises against rubbing too hard, as the spray can streak across the paint job. Smooth, light, but firm strokes are key here. While you’re at it, consider washing the rest of your car with some car shampoo for an all-over shine."

      "content": "Soak the stain in warm water for 10-15 minutes to let it break down. Typically, you don’t need to look any further than some warm water to lift bird poo. Use a spray bottle to soak the poop, or simply dump a cup of water onto it until it's completely saturated. Wait 10-15 minutes, then wipe it away with a rag or a microfiber cloth. Put some elbow grease into it, but not too much. Go gentle on the paint job. Keep soaking and wiping as needed. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak the poop in club soda for 10-15 minutes before wiping it away. Pour a small amount of unflavored seltzer water or club soda on the spot, until it’s saturated. Then dampen an old rag with the club soda, and place or hold it over the stain for 10-15 minutes to let it work its way into the mess. Then, gently but firmly wipe the poop away with the rag, and rinse the spot clean with a splash of water. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix baking soda and water to make a poo-fighting spray.",
      "content": "Mix baking soda and water to make a poo-fighting spray. Bird droppings are acidic, so baking soda, which is alkaline, makes the perfect, specialized cleaner. Fill a 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) spray bottle with warm water, then mix in about 4 tbsp (14 g) of baking soda. Saturate the poo with the baking soda spray, let it break down the poo for about 15 minutes, then wipe it away with a microfiber towel. [5] X Research source Be warned: Baking soda is mildly abrasive and could damage your car’s paint. [6] X Research source Use this method with caution."

      "title": "Hit the stain with some WD-40 and wait 15-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Hit the stain with some WD-40 and wait 15-30 minutes. WD-40 is some sort of miracle substance, given just how many uses it has. Ridding your ride of bird poop is among them. Saturate the poop with WD-40, then give it 15-30 minutes to soak and start to break down. Then come back with a rag or microfiber towel and wipe those droppings away. [7] X Research source Repeat this process 2-3 times, as needed. While this is a common method to clean bird poop on a car, Goldberg advises against it because it can be abrasive and damage the car’s paint. So, use this method as a last resort for stubborn stains."

      "title": "Spray glass cleaner directly onto any poop on your windows.",
      "content": "Spray glass cleaner directly onto any poop on your windows. While glass cleaner is a bit too harsh for painted areas, it’s a no-brainer for your windshield or other windows. Give the bird poop 3-4 sprays, then firmly wipe it away with a microfiber towel until that glass is spick and span. The vinegar in the spray will break down and lift the droppings with ease. [8] X Research source If the poop is stubborn, saturate it with more cleaner and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Then come back and give it another go when the poop is a bit more broken up. Don’t use glass cleaner on any painted areas, since the chemicals in the cleaner may damage the paint."

      "content": "Let the bird poop dry before scrubbing it with a dab of detergent. Look, we won’t ask how you got bird guano inside your car, but we don’t envy you. To clean your car seats , wait for the poop to dry, then scrape the dried poop off the upholstery with a paper towel or a blunt knife. Then, dampen a rag with warm water and a dab of detergent, and scrub away the residue. [9] X Research source Use a hand vacuum to suction up any poo dust after you scrape the bulk away."

Then, take a stiff-bristled brush to the mats to brush away the bird poop. Finally, rinse the mat down with a hose and let it dry for an hour or 2 before placing it back in your car. [10] X Research source Place a dime-sized drop of dish soap on any trouble spots to lift tougher stains as you scrub. You can also use the brush to clean your tires with tire cleaner ."
