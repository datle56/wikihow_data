      "content": "Start with hair that has not been washed for 2 days. Freshly washed hair may seem ideal for dyeing someone’s hair, but this actually increases the chances that their scalp will be irritated by the color. Waiting 2 days after the last time they shampooed their hair will help to ensure that they have a layer of natural protective oils on their scalp. [1] X Research source As an added bonus, it will be easier to section the person's hair if you wait for 2 days after their last shampoo."

      "content": "Drape a towel or hairdresser’s cape around the person’s neck. This will protect the skin around their shoulders and their clothing from the hair dye. You may also want to encourage the person to wear an old t-shirt or something else they don’t care about just in case some of the dye gets on their clothes. You can purchase a hairdresser’s cape in a beauty supply store or online."

      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly or lip balm along the person’s hairline to prevent staining. This will protect the skin around the hairline from being stained by the dye. Use your fingers to smooth a layer of petroleum jelly or lip balm over the 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of skin around the person’s hairline, and over the skin on their ears. [4] X Research source Go all the way around the hairline with the petroleum jelly or lip balm including the forehead, temples, and neck to protect the person’s skin from the dye."

      "content": "Do a strand test before you apply the dye all over. Once you have finished mixing the dye, apply it to an inconspicuous strand of the person’s hair, such as on the underside of their hair in the back of their head. Set a timer and check the strand after about 5 to 10 minutes to see if it has developed to the desired shade, or if it needs more time. Then, rinse out the color and let the strand dry to check it. Note the final time when you achieve the desired shade. [7] X Research source Make sure to show the person the strand after you rinse out the color. This will be what all of their hair will look like, so it’s important to make sure this is the color they want.

Then, unclip the section next to it after you finish applying the dye on that section and continue to work towards the back of the head. [9] X Research source The sections of hair clipped up on top of the person’s head will be the most visible after you finish applying the dye, so it needs a longer processing time."

Repeat this until all of the hair in that section is completely saturated with dye. Sweep the dye down towards the ends of the person’s hair. [10] X Research source Use an applicator brush to saturate the hair with the dye. You can also use a toothbrush or mascara wand to create highlights on select strands."

      "content": "Set a timer when you finish applying the dye to your hair. Use the timer on your phone or an egg timer. This will help to ensure that you do not leave the dye on for too long and risk overdeveloping it. [12] X Research source Use the amount of time recommended by the box or the amount of time it took to achieve the desired color on your strand test. [13] X Research source For example, if the box recommends letting the dye develop for 15 minutes, use this as your guideline. Or, if you let the dye develop for 10 minutes on the strand test and the person liked the results, then use this as your guideline."

You can use the faucet or shower head to rinse the person’s hair. Continue to rinse their hair until the water runs clear. [14] X Research source If possible have them lean back over a sink, such as in an office chair that reclines slightly. This will make it easier to rinse the color out without water going into their eyes."

[15] X Research source Many box hair dye kits come with a small container or packet of conditioner to apply after you rinse out the hair dye. If your kit came with conditioner, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for how to apply it. If not, you can use any conditioner that you have on hand."
