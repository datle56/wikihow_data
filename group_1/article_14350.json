      "title": "Draw the outline sketches.",
      "content": "Draw the outline sketches. Sketch two ovals slightly intersecting each other. These are the outline sketches for the foreheads. If you're drawing traditionally, do this in pencil, pressing lightly. If you don't have a lot of drawing experience, try copying or tracing a similar drawing or painting by an artist that you really like. This can help you learn how they make marks and approach their artwork."

      "content": "Continue with the jawline of the second character. Make sure it's more on the side of the oval rather than the bottom, unlike the first character's jawline. It should form somewhat of a heart shape."

      "title": "Draw the skeleton outline for the first character.",
      "content": "Draw the skeleton outline for the first character. The purpose of the skeleton outlines is to guide you in drawing the body pose and composition. You don't have to be an anatomy expert to do this, either. Use a line for the spine, which should be slightly curved. Add two lines for the arms. For the shoulders, elbows, and hands use simple circles. Try to anticipate how you want their bodies to look together."

      "title": "Add the skeleton outline for the second character.",
      "content": "Add the skeleton outline for the second character. Using the same techniques, add the skeleton outlines for the second character. Make sure the characters aren't just standing there kissing. Put one character's arms on the other's lower back, under their jaw, or on the back of their head. You could also have them holding hands."

    {
      "title": "Draw the facial feature outlines.",
      "content": "Draw the facial feature outlines. Draw a vertical line slightly curved into the direction the face is going, then add a horizontal line across the middle of the head facing the same direction. The horizontal line will be where the eyes are, and where the two lines meet will be roughly where the nose bridge starts. Use a mirror every so often to examine your drawing. This technique can help you see your drawing in a new way while also pointing out any obvious mistakes."

If you're drawing digitally, lower the opacity of the sketch layer and create a new layer for the outlines. If the drawing program you're using doesn't have layers, you can use the paint bucket tool to make the sketch lines grey, then bucket fill them white when the outline is finished."

Add small folds where the fabric would be stretched against something (most likely the joints) or where a lot of fabric bunches up. Generally, the more folds, the tighter the clothing."
