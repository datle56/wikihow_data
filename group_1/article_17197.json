To solve this problem, we'll be looking at three different 2x2 matrices. Let's call them A 21 , A 22 , and A 23 . The determinant of the 3x3 matrix is a 21 |A 21 | - a 22 |A 22 | + a 23 |A 23 |. If terms a 22 and a 23 are both 0, our formula becomes a 21 |A 21 | - 0*|A 22 | + 0*|A 23 | = a 21 |A 21 | - 0 + 0 = a 21 |A 21 |. Now we only have to calculate the cofactor of a single element."

The same is true of columns. You can do this repeatedly — or multiply the values by a constant before adding — to get as many zeroes in the matrix as possible. This can save you a lot of time. For example, say you have a 3 x 3 matrix: ( 9 − 1 2 3 1 0 7 5 − 2 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}9&-1&2\\\\3&1&0\\\\7&5&-2\\end{pmatrix}}} In order to cancel out the 9 in position a 11 , we can multiply the second row by -3 and add the result to the first. The new first row is [9 -1 2] + [-9 -3 0] = [0 -4 2]. The new matrix is ( 0 − 4 2 3 1 0 7 5 − 2 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}0&-4&2\\\\3&1&0\\\\7&5&-2\\end{pmatrix}}} Try to use the same trick with columns to turn a 12 into a 0 as well."

In these special cases, the determinant is simply the product of the elements along the main diagonal, from a 11 in the top left to a 33 in the lower right. We're still talking about 3x3 matrices, but \"triangular\" ones have special patterns of nonzero values: [7] X Research source Upper triangular matrix: All the non-zero elements are on or above the main diagonal. Everything below is a zero. Lower triangular matrix: All the non-zero elements are on or below the main diagonal. Diagonal matrix: All the non-zero elements are on the main diagonal. (A subset of the above.) You can use the method of minors or the elementary row operations to find the inverse of a 3 x 3 matrix. [8] X Research source If you use the latter method to find the inverse of a matrix A, begin by setting up the formula [A | I]. Where I is the 3 x 3 identity matrix. [9] X Research source Then, use elementary row operations to reduce the left-hand side of the formula to I. The resulting formula will be [I | A-1], where A-1 is the inverse of A.
