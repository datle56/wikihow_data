[1] X Research source Pork chops are notorious for drying out when cooked, but there are a few ways to prevent this. Searing the meat is one of the simplest ways. Searing the surface of the meat creates a barrier along the surface, thereby locking more of the moisture inside."

Turn the bag or flip the chops every few hours to ensure that all sides get equal exposure to the marinade. As a general rule, a longer marinating time will create juicier, more tender pork chops. If you marinate the meat for too long, though, it can actually become tough. Try to avoid letting the pork chops sit in the marinade for much longer than 8 hours to half a day."

You will need to stir the garlic constantly as it cooks. Garlic burns pretty quickly, and if you take your eyes off of it for more than a few seconds, it could easily blacken. If this happens, remove the pan from the heat, wait for it to cool, then wipe out the oil and the burnt garlic before trying again with fresh oil and fresh garlic."
