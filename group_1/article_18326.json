      "title": "A black or dark-colored suit",
      "content": "A black or dark-colored suit It’s hard to go wrong with a muted, somber suit at a funeral, and it’s generally expected of you if you’re an immediate family member, close friend, or colleague of the deceased. A black suit is traditional, but other dark shades like dark gray, charcoal, dark brown, or navy are also appropriate (the key is to keep it dark and conservative). [1] X Research source Both single-breasted and double-breasted jackets are appropriate, with single-breasted jackets being more popular among younger men. If possible, choose a jacket that fits well (not too tight or creased around the abdomen and not too baggy or loose in the shoulders) to look put together and avoid drawing attention from mourners. Press your pants to get rid of wrinkles and make sure they’re properly fitted (i.e., not skin-tight or so baggy that you need a tight belt to hold them up). Go for a traditional suit over a tuxedo. Tuxes are considered celebratory and could send the wrong message at a somber event like a funeral. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "A white dress shirt",
      "content": "A white dress shirt Choose a crisp, clean, white dress shirt to go with your suit (this is the most formal and traditional shirt color for funerals). Other light colors, like blue or gray, may also be appropriate. Try to avoid loud, patterned shirts if you can (however, a subtle and muted design like stripes may be appropriate, too). [3] X Research source A single cuff shirt is more appropriate than a double cuff, which looks extra fancy or celebratory. Make sure to press your shirt ahead of time so it’s not wrinkled and distracting."

    {
      "title": "A solid black or dark-colored tie",
      "content": "A solid black or dark-colored tie Choose a subdued, dark tie that complements your suit —a black tie pairs well with a black suit, while dark gray or blue can go with other colored suits. Avoid bright colors or eye-catching designs since they may seem offensive to some funeral goers. If you do want a pattern, something traditional like stripes or small dots is appropriate.

      "title": "Black or brown dress shoes",
      "content": "Black or brown dress shoes No matter the season or suit, dress shoes are the most appropriate footwear for men at a funeral. Wear black shoes with black suits, or your choice of black or brown shoes with other colors (whichever looks best for your suit). [5] X Research source Great options include Oxfords, loafers, or even dress boots if they’re sleek and have thin laces. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Simple accessories",
      "content": "Simple accessories Generally, you want to keep your accessories minimal and conservative for a funeral. Go for a black or dark belt that matches your suit. [7] X Research source For accessories like watches, cufflinks, and other jewelry, choose something simple, clean, and not distracting (remember that funerals aren’t really the place to show off your personal style; when in doubt, go simple or opt to go without if you’re unsure whether a piece is too much)."

    {
      "title": "A well-groomed appearance",
      "content": "A well-groomed appearance Besides your clothes and accessories, it’s important to look clean and polished in order to convey your respects to the deceased and their family. Shower beforehand and trim your facial hair (or go clean shaven), comb your hair, and put on a spritz of cologne (just make sure not to overdo it—an overpowering scent can be distracting). Again, the idea is to look conservative, simple, and subdued. You might decide to get a haircut beforehand if your hair is getting wild, but don’t plan on debuting a bold new mustache or drastically different hair color at a funeral, for example."

      "title": "Opt for well-fitted dress pants or slacks and a dress shirt with a tie.",
      "content": "Opt for well-fitted dress pants or slacks and a dress shirt with a tie. If you don’t own a suit and you’re not an immediate family member or pallbearer, it’s OK to dress slightly more casually. Go for dark-colored slacks (black, navy, dark gray, etc.) with a button-down dress shirt in a soft color like white, blue, or even a pastel shade. A dark, solid tie is preferred if you have one since an open collar might look too casual (but again, if you’re not immediate family or a very close friend, you’ll be alright if you skip it). [8] X Research source If you have a sport coat or blazer that goes with your pants and shirt, feel free to wear it as well. You can also match suit separates in colors that go well together, like black pants and a dark gray jacket."

      "content": "Consider renting or buying a suit if you have the time and budget. Of course, if you want to look your best and most respectful, a suit is still the way to go. Look for an inexpensive, off-the-rack suit that fits well or consider renting one from a formalwear shop if you don’t need or want to add a suit to your wardrobe. Consider checking thrift shops or second hand stores, too. You’re not guaranteed to find your size or a color and style that you like, but there’s a chance you can find a cheap suit that looks appropriate."

      "title": "Choose a lightweight, linen suit or go without a suit jacket for summer.",
      "content": "Choose a lightweight, linen suit or go without a suit jacket for summer. A suit is still expected in hot weather, but for your comfort, go for a light material like linen or cotton that’s breathable. It’s also acceptable to remove your suit jacket for hot outdoor ceremonies—just make sure your pants and dress shirt fit well and aren’t wrinkled, your belt matches your pants, and that your shirt is tucked in neatly. [9] X Research source Sunglasses are OK if you’re outdoors in summer, but normally they’re considered too casual for funerals. Bring your suit jacket with you, even if you plan to remove it for the heat. Unless the ceremony is outdoors, you likely won’t be outside that much (and the church or funeral home may be cold inside)."

      "title": "Layer up with dark wool sweaters or overcoats for winter funerals.",
      "content": "Layer up with dark wool sweaters or overcoats for winter funerals. If it’s cold or the ceremony is outside in winter, wear a fine knit black or dark gray sweater over your dress shirt and tie. Avoid chunky cable knits, bright colors and patterns, or sweaters that are extra loose or baggy. Crewnecks half-zips, V-necks, and turtlenecks are all appropriate options. [10] X Research source Or, opt for a dark overcoat to wear over your suit jacket if you’ll be outside or just need another layer. You can leave it unbuttoned if it’s not too cold, or button it up if it’s frigid. Scarves, gloves, and other warm accessories are also appropriate if you’re outdoors. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Wishes of the deceased or the family",
      "content": "Wishes of the deceased or the family A somber suit is the funeral go-to, but it’s also important to respect the wishes of the deceased or their family members—the point of the funeral is to pay respects to them, after all. Double check the funeral information to see if there’s a requested dress code and plan your outfit accordingly. For example, some families may prefer to host a “celebration of life” and ask attendees to wear bright colors or the favorite color of the deceased. Follow their wishes but try to keep it a bit toned down unless they really ask you to go overboard and wear something like a Hawaiian shirt, for example. [12] X Research source Some invitations may only specify “no black.” In that case, stick to another dark or subdued color like navy or gray. Keep the look formal (a suit is still your go-to)."

      "content": "Cultural or religious requirements While a black suit and tie is standard in Western, Christian cultures, other faiths and cultures may have additional or different requests for attire. For example, men are typically expected to wear a yarmulke while attending Jewish funerals , while mourners at many Hindu funerals wear white instead of black. [13] X Research source If you’re attending a religious funeral, do your best to follow traditional customs. If you’re unsure what to wear, reach out to the funeral director for more information.
