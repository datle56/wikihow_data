      "content": "Catch a Nincada. Shedinja appears in your party when a Nincada evolves into Ninjask, as long as you meet the right conditions. You can find Nincada in the following locations, depending on which game you are playing. [1] X Research source Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald - Find Nincada in the grass on Route 116. FireRed and LeafGreen - You have to trade for Nincada. Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - Find Nincada in the Eterna Forest, but you need to use the Poké Radar. HeartGold and SoulSilver - Get a Nincada in the Bug Catching Contest at the National Park on Thursday and Saturday. Black and White; B2 and W2 - You have to trade for Nincada. X and Y - Find Nincada in the grass on Route 6. You can also find it in a Ground-type Friend Safari. Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire - Find Nincada in the grass on Route 116. Sun and Moon; Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon - You have to trade for Nincada. Sword and Shield - Find Nincada on Route 5, in South Lake Miloch, and West Lake Axewell. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl - Find Nincada in the Eterna Forest using the Poké Radar or in the Grand Underground (Grassland, Riverbank, Still-Water, and Sunlit Caverns). Scarlet and Violet - Nincada (and Shedinja) is not in Scarlet and Violet and can’t be transferred into the game. Note : In Sword and Shield, you can catch a Shedinja in random Max Raid Battles in Bridge Field, Rolling Fields, and South Lake Miloch. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep an open space in your party. In order to receive a Shedinja when Nincada evolves, you need an open spot in your party. This means you can only have five or fewer Pokémon with you, including Nincada. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Have a spare Poké Ball (some versions only).",
      "content": "Have a spare Poké Ball (some versions only). Most versions of the game require you to have at least one spare Poké Ball in your inventory. It must be a standard Poké Ball, not a special one like an Ultra Ball. [4] X Research source Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald do not require an extra Poké Ball. All other versions do. Note that since Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald do not have a Poké Ball requirement, Shedinja will copy the Poké Ball that was used to catch Nincada. This is the only way to get a Shedinja in a non-standard Poké Ball."

      "title": "Raise Nincada to at least Level 20.",
      "content": "Raise Nincada to at least Level 20. This is the first level that Nincada will attempt to evolve into Ninjask. Make sure that you meet both the space and Poké Ball requirements before allowing Nincada to evolve, or you won't get Shedinja. You can raise Nincada's level by battling or by using Rare Candies. [5] X Research source You don’t have to evolve Nincada at level 20. You can prevent your Nincada from evolving by holding “B” during the evolution. This allows you to continue to train it up so your Shedinja inherits everything from the Nincada when it evolves. For example, preventing your Nincada from evolving until it hits Level 50 will create a Level 50 Shedinja as well, with all the moves the Nincada has learned up to then. You might want to wait to evolve Nincada once it learns Metal Claw or Dig, since Shedinja can’t learn these moves."

      "title": "Allow Nincada to evolve to receive Shedinja.",
      "content": "Allow Nincada to evolve to receive Shedinja. As long as you meet the requirements (open space in your party, at least 1 Poké Ball), Shedinja will appear in your party. You won't receive a notification that you've received it—simply check your Pokémon party to see if it’s there. [6] X Research source Since Shedinja comes from Nincada, if your Nincada is Shiny, your Shedinja will be as well. Shedinja also inherits all of Nincada's EVs and IVs. Shedinja has 1 HP, but is not vulnerable to much. Shedinja's Wonder Guard ability only lets \"Super Effective\" moves, weather effects (like Hail), and status conditions (like Poison) cause damage. “Super Effective” moves include Fire, Flying, Ghost, Rock, and Dark types. [7] X Research source Shedinja can pack quite a punch. If you teach Shedinja Quick Claw, you can strike first and take your foes out before they use a super-effective move."

      "title": "You can only get Shedinja through special events or trade.",
      "content": "You can only get Shedinja through special events or trade. Unlike the main Pokémon games, you can’t get a Shedinja by evolving Nincada—this will only get you a Ninjask. However, Pokémon GO has provided chances in the past to encounter a Shedinja, like when you complete all the Research Tasks in the Bug Out special event. [8] X Research source Keep a lookout for future Pokémon GO events that involve encountering Shedinja. You can check out upcoming events on Serebii.net’s website . If you know someone who has a Shedinja, you can always ask them to trade it to you."
