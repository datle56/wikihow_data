If you're driving backward to back out of a driveway or a parking spot, put your car in Reverse (R). If reversing, check your rearview mirror and then place your hand on the passenger seat as you turn your head to the right to look behind you. If your car has a driver-assist camera, use it to get a clear view behind you. However, it’s still a good idea to turn around and check each side."

Gradually press harder on the gas to accelerate your car. If you’re moving forward, continue to press on the gas until you reach the speed limit in your neighborhood. Don’t worry about shifting gears as you move forward. The car uses sensors to shift automatically at the appropriate time. [3] X Research source When you're on the highway, be aware of the speed limit, but go with the flow of traffic. If all the cars around you are going much slower than the speed limit due to traffic, drive accordingly to avoid crashing into them. If all of the cars around you are driving much faster than the speed limit, you don't have to match their speed and break the law. Move your car into the right-hand lane to drive with slower traffic. Remember that driving too slow can be just as dangerous as driving too fast. Accelerate your car smoothly. Don't push your foot too hard on the gas, or you may go much faster than you intended. Know that each car has its own acceleration rate."

Other positions, including 10 and 2 o’clock were previously recommended, but due to airbag technology, they’re no longer safe in some cars. [4] X Research source Good steering placement makes your driving experience smoother and helps you avoid collisions. It also helps you turn and position your car in the most convenient way. Here are some tips for good steering: When turning, pull down on the side of the wheel you wish to turn towards and push up with the opposite hand. This is called “pull-push” steering. To make sharper turns at lower speeds, use hand-over-hand turning. To do this, perform a push-pull turn, but bring your pull hand over your push hand in order to continue moving the wheel in the desired direction. [5] X Research source"

When traveling at a faster speed, it often takes more than one car length to come safely to a stop. Take weather and road conditions into account when gauging how long it takes your car to stop. Try not to stop suddenly unless it’s an emergency. Sudden stops may cause vehicles behind you to plow into your rear."

When learning to drive a manual car, get familiar with how the clutch and shifter work before you start driving. [14] X Research source The clutch : The clutch controls the connection between the engine and transmission. Pushing on the clutch pedal disengages the clutch and disconnects the engine from the transmission. Releasing will engage the clutch and connect them. When disengaging the clutch, you effectively place the car in neutral regardless of whether it is in gear or not. Engaging the clutch will place the car into whichever gear is currently selected. [15] X Research source The shifter : Shifting gears is done by moving a stick called either the gear stick, shift stick, gearshift, gear lever, gear selector, or shifter. Gear numbers and shift patterns will vary by model, but the “default” position is (N) Neutral, followed by gears that range from 1 to 5 or 1 to 6, and then (R0 Reverse."

When you're starting out, make sure you're in an isolated location to help prevent any distractions or accidents. Get a licensed driver to take you to a safe spot to practice if necessary. Here's how to do it: [16] X Research source Begin by pressing the brake with your right foot and stepping on the clutch with your left foot. Most manual cars will not start unless the clutch is disengaged. Turn the ignition key or press the starter button. Once you have started the car, keep your foot on the brake and release the emergency brake. If moving forward, place the car into 1st gear, marked with a 1 on the shifter. If reversing, place the car into Reverse (R). Slowly and smoothly release the clutch. As you feel the car start to inch forward, slide your foot off the brake and slowly apply pressure to the gas pedal. As the engine revs up and the car edges forward, lift your foot a little more off the clutch until you feel and hear the clutch “catch.”"

Before you start switching gears, remember these points: [19] X Research source Listen to your car and switch to a higher gear when the engine revs or gets louder. Shift to a lower gear as you slow down, and the RPMs drop. Think of the clutch pedal and gas pedal as being inversely proportional to the other in pressure. They act in concert in the same way as a see-saw or scales. When one goes up, the other goes down. Gradually applying gas while engaging the clutch makes shifting gears smoother. It takes time to get the hang of it, but once you master the feeling of the clutch and gas, it becomes second nature."

Moving the car into Neutral (N) ensures that the engine is no longer moving the transmission and prevents you from stalling as you wait for a green light. [20] X Research source Don’t put your car in neutral to brake for longer periods. While it may be the easiest way to avoid stalling the engine, it limits maneuverability. This can be a safety issue because it prevents you from reacting as quickly to hazards. [21] X Research source However, you can put your car in neutral right before coming to a complete stop. You may potentially save gas and extend the life of your brakes by downshifting to decelerate. This takes practice however, so begin by just using your brakes."

Not only can you get cited for breaking this rule, but your chances of injury and fatality during a collision also increase exponentially. Check your dashboard. Make sure your car is ready to drive and that there are no alarming lights that signal your car is malfunctioning. Adjust your seat. Move your seat backward or forward to make sure your feet comfortably reach the pedals, and you can still see the road. Lock all your doors.

Here are some general guidelines: Most states allow you to practice driving with an adult age 21 or over. Only a few states allow you to legally practice with someone younger than 21. Most states also have a curfew for permit drivers. You cannot drive at night even if accompanied by a licensed driver. If you're a minor, most states require a signature from your parent or guardian before you start driving. You'll have to pass a written test about driving rules and regulations and safety on the road before you receive a learner’s permit. Some jurisdictions will require a certain number of hours of “behind-the-wheel” driver’s education in order to get your license. If you’re still in school, your high school may offer classes in driver's education to meet these requirements. Depending on the jurisdiction, your learner's permit may only be valid after you start behind-the-wheel lessons. In other jurisdictions, your learner's permit is only valid during behind-the-wheel lessons. Certain jurisdictions require the placement of an \"L\" (learner), \"Student Driver\", \"New Driver\", or the shoshinsha mark (🔰) on the back of your vehicle during driving practice and/or for the first year after you get your learner's permit or driver's license.
