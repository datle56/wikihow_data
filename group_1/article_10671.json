Different angles will have different fading sequences (some will be up and down, some side to side, and some diagonal). If you choose the radial option, you will be given options for where the point of center of your gradient will be. You can choose the circle/arc to appear in the middle, top left corner, top right corner, bottom left corner, or bottom right corner. Try different points to see how the colors blend."

To make a color translucent, first, choose the color you are using in its opaque form. Then, reopen the color menu if needed, and select the Custom option.

Adding a gradient stop will add a small colored circle near the middle of the color bar. Use your mouse to drag the circle along the color bar to move where the color is located in the gradient.

Experiment with different styles and ways to incorporate gradients into your presentation."
