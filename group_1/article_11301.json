      "content": "Choose the right kind of blade. To get a smooth cut on a sheet of plywood, you'll need to have the right blade. Look for a carbide-tipped blade with a high tooth count. [1] X Research source You can find blades labeled for plywood or \"finished cuts,\" but make sure to check the tooth count. [2] X Research source Blades come in various sizes, so be sure you get one that will fit your circular saw. [3] X Research source If you stick with the blade that came with your saw, you'll likely end up with splintered ends, also known as tear-outs. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Set the saw blade to the right depth.",
      "content": "Set the saw blade to the right depth. Before cutting your plywood, adjust your saw blade to the right depth. If your blade is set too deep, you'll be dragging a lot of excess blade through the sheet. If you have your blade set too shallow, you run the risk of not cutting all the way through the sheet. [5] X Research source You want your saw to be about .25 inches (0.6 cm) below the sheet. If you're cutting a sheet of plywood that is .75 inches (1.9 cm) thick, set your blade to 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Support the whole piece of wood. When cutting a sheet of plywood, it's important that you support the sheet on both sides of the cut. [7] X Research source A few long 2x4s laid across two sawhorses will keep the sheet steady as you cut. Keep the 2x4s handy just for this task, as you'll be cutting into the tops of them with your circular saw. [8] X Research source If you don't have access to 2x4s or sawhorses, you can use a piece of rigid foam insulation instead. Lay the foam on the ground, and lay the sheet of plywood on top. Make sure the wood doesn't slide around on top of the foam board. [9] X Research source If you use the foam board method, you can crawl across the board as you cut, and you don't have to worry about the board snapping off at the end of the cut.

      "content": "Cut with the good side down. When using a circular saw, place your plywood on the cutting surface with the good face down. The teeth of the blade enter the sheet from underneath, and exit at the top. When the teeth exit, they may cause some chipping. Placing the sheet with the good face down will ensure a smooth surface.

      "title": "Mark your cutting line.",
      "content": "Mark your cutting line. Use a straight edge to mark your line. Measure carefully and make sure you have the cutting line square with the edge of your plywood. [12] X Research source For a smoother cut, score your line. Use a utility knife to score your line before you cut. You may have to run your knife over the line a few times to get it to score completely. [13] X Research source A good rule to follow is \"measure twice, cut once.\" If you cut the wood wrong, you can't do much to fix it other than start over with a new piece of wood."

      "title": "Use a guide to cut.",
      "content": "Use a guide to cut. Find a piece of plywood that still has its factory edge and attach it to your cutting surface using clamps. [14] X Research source Take into consideration the width of the saw's base plate, or shoe. Adjust your guide so that the shoe fits firmly against the guide, and the blade is in line with your cut mark. If you are planning on cutting a lot of plywood, you might consider investing in a saw guide that attaches to your circular saw. Look online or in your local hardware store to find one that suits your needs. [15] X Research source"

Take care to make your cut as straight as possible. [16] X Research source Using a saw is dangerous. Wear safety goggles at all times, and keep your fingers clear of the blade. Watch out for the power cord as you cut. Keep your work area clean."

      "title": "Choose the right blade.",
      "content": "Choose the right blade. You can use a table saw to cut plywood. To get the smoothest cut from your table saw, invest in a blade with a high tooth count, such as an 80 TPI plywood blade. [17] X Research source Most stock blades on table saws work well for rough cuts, but will not give you a clean edge. [18] X Research source Alternatively use a zero-clearance insert under the plywood. To make one of these, carefully set a piece of wood or plywood onto the working table saw, taking care not to have the wood slip or pull from your hands. Once the blade is all the way through (the blade needs to be quite high), clamp the insert down. You will be cutting on the insert, which does not allow the bottom layer of plywood to chip downward because of the low clearance between the blade and the insert. The insert is sacrificial and it's usually only sensible to make one when cutting large amounts of plywood."

    {
      "title": "Raise the blade.",
      "content": "Raise the blade. Raising the blade changes the direction the teeth will enter the wood. When the blade is slightly raised, such that the teeth just barely cut through the surface, the teeth enter the cutting surface at an angle. If you raise the blade a little higher, you can get a perpendicular cut, which will make a smoother surface. [19] X Research source Don't raise the blade more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the cutting surface. A raised blade may offer a smoother cut, but it also makes for a more dangerous cut. Exercise extreme caution when cutting with a raised blade. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a zero-clearance insert.",
      "content": "Use a zero-clearance insert. Your table saw may have a gap between the blade and the throat plate, where the blade sits in the table saw. A zero-clearance insert closes the gap and offers support to the sheet, making a smoother cut. [21] X Research source You can purchase a zero-clearance throat plate online or at your local hardware store. [22] X Research source Alternatively make your own. First, carefully set a piece of wood or plywood onto the working table saw, taking care not to have the wood slip or pull away from your hands. Once the blade is all the way through (the blade needs to be quite high), clamp the insert down. You will be cutting on the insert, which does not allow the bottom layer of plywood to chip downward because of the low clearance between the blade and the insert. The insert is sacrificial and it's usually only sensible to make one when cutting large amounts of plywood. To make safe cuts, make sure that whatever you're cutting isn't at an angle or unsupported on the other side."

Stabilize the sheet on sawhorses, or ask a friend to help you hold it steady. [23] X Research source Having the entire sheet supported allows you to keep a steady feed rate, that is, the speed you run the wood through the saw. [24] X Research source You can also use a circular saw to break down large sheets to more manageable sizes. [25] X Research source"

A saw with fewer teeth will cut faster, but you'll be left with a rough edge. A saw with a higher TPI will leave you with a smoother edge, but it will take some time to saw. [40] X Research source Make sure the handle is comfortable when you grip it, and look down the back of the saw blade to make sure it is straight. The tip of the saw should be flexible.
