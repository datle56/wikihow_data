      "content": "Search official government websites . If you have access to the Internet, then you can quickly find out whether or not there is a local warrant out for your arrest. Go to the city, county, state or federal website where you think you might have a warrant for arrest. Government websites are kept up-to-date, which makes them a reliable way to get information. [1] X Research source All federal government websites end in .gov, while those for states can end in either .gov or .us. Look for the \"Legal\" or \"Health and Safety\" sections to see if they offer a warrant search. Alternatively, try entering a phrase such as \"arrest warrant\" in the search bar on the website's home page. Some counties do not offer online warrant searches. In that case, look at the local sheriff or police department site for contact information."

      "content": "Call the court clerk. If you would like to speak to someone, you can call the court directly. You can call any court in the state that you believe the warrant may be in, because states maintain a warrant database that can be accessed from any state court. Do not identify yourself; instead, simply ask if there is an outstanding warrant for \"Person X\" (using your name here) in a criminal or civil case. Have the following information ready: the case number (if you know it), name, birth date, and Social Security number. [2] X Research source The court clerk of one circuit may not be able to give you information if you have an arrest warrant from a different circuit court. Keep in mind that for some cases such as family and juvenile delinquency cases, and domestic violence cases involving protective, peace, or restraining orders, you may not be able to find information through the court clerk. However, the clerk should still be able to tell you about an arrest warrant, even if he or she cannot give your specific information on the case itself. Criminal cases are mostly public record, so you should not have an issue getting information on these. However, some types of civil cases are not public record, such as family and juvenile delinquency cases, and domestic violence cases involving protective, peace, or restraining orders. For these types of cases, consider consulting a bail bondsman or attorney. You can also call the county, state, or federal clerk's office. Note that if you call from your own phone, the police may be able to locate and arrest you. They can trace the phone number to an address, or to any billing information associated with that phone number. If you are nervous about calling yourself, ask a close friend or family member to call for you. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the public records at a county courthouse. You can use the computers at your county court to search warrants. If you feel uncomfortable doing this yourself, ask someone to do it for you (a friend, family member, attorney, or bail bondsman). Most minor offenses will not lead to an immediate arrest. You may be able to pay a fine and settle the matter quickly. [4] X Research source Be warned, however, that if there is warrant issued for you, you risk being taken into custody."

      "content": "Use an online third-party service. There are a number of websites that can perform a warrant search for you. Some are free, and others charge a fee. [5] X Research source These services are quick and easy, but may not give you all of the information you're looking for. For example, they may provide vital statistics and property ownership, but not information about arrest warrants. For this reason, these services should be a last resort. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Find out when the warrant was issued.",
      "content": "Find out when the warrant was issued. Sometimes people can be completely unaware that they have a warrant out for their arrest. Knowing when the warrant was issued could shed light on some important details. There may be fines associated with your charge that have been accumulating since the warrant was issued. These will be listed among the warrant information. If the warrant was issued a long time ago, you’ll want to get the matter settled quickly before incurring any further penalties. Additionally, in some case, if the warrant was issued long ago, a person cannot be prosecuted for the crime. It is not that the warrant has expired, but some crimes have a limited statute of limitations (period in which the suspect can be prosecuted). Therefore, if you believe that you may have a warrant out for your arrest for an underlying incident that occurred over 2 years ago, look up the charge that would appear on the warrant (or something similar) to see if there is a limit on the time that the warrant would be valid.

      "content": "Inquire about the charges. If you know what you’re being charged with, you can more adequately prepare your response. Vital information includes the date of offense, the details of the charges, and the case type (e.g., felony , misdemeanor, traffic ticket , etc.). [8] X Research source You may be able to avoid being arrested by paying a fine. The severity of your charge may influence your choice of legal representation. Also note any date of conviction, sentencing, disposition, and probation, if they apply to your case."

      "title": "Contact an attorney.",
      "content": "Contact an attorney. In the event that a warrant has been issued for a major offense, you will most likely want to contact a criminal defense lawyer . An attorney can help you understand your warrant and will make suggestions as to possible next steps. In addition, an attorney can accompany you to the local court to inquire about your warrant. Bring the warrant number and all relevant information you have so far. [9] X Research source Find an attorney that specializes in your type of case (you should know the case type from the warrant information – see Part 2, Step 2). Avoid picking the first name you see in the phonebook or any other advertisement. Instead, get a referral from someone who's been in a similar situation, or someone knows a good attorney. You can also find attorneys by looking at your state bar association website. (A directory of state bar associations can be found at https://www.americanbar.org/products/ .) Meet with the attorney first to make sure that they're someone you're comfortable with and can trust. If you're unable to pay for a lawyer, contact the public defender's office of the county where your warrant was issued. Ask to speak with the duty attorney and explain you'd like to clear your warrant."

      "title": "Turn yourself in.",
      "content": "Turn yourself in. Turning yourself in can help make the process smoother, reducing the risk of more severe punishment and fines, and, in some cases, the creation of a criminal record. Start by turning yourself in to the courthouse clerk. Ask for information about what steps to take next, but make sure you have the right clerk. For county and state warrants, talk to the county clerk; for federal warrants, talk to the clerk of the U.S. District Court. Bring an attorney or legal representative with you for advice. Some misdemeanor and minor charges may be taken care of without a hearing. If you turn yourself in to a police station, you may end up being put directly in jail until your appointed time in court. A court-appointed attorney will be provided for you for free if you turn yourself in. Fortunately, the constitution requires all jurisdictions to provide you representation in case any charge involves possible time imprisonment."
