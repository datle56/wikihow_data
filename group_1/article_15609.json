      "content": "Wash your body. If you find that you are a bit smelly, hop in the shower if you have the time. Body odor is created by bacteria that cause you to smell, so rinsing your body (and the part that smells worst in particular) can help to get rid of the smell quickly. However, it's important to use soap or an antibacterial detergent when you wash yourself, rather than just rinsing with water. When you shower, be sure to use cleansing soap to lather up your underarms, groin area, and feet, along with any other problem areas you may have."

      "title": "Apply an over-the-counter antiperspirant.",
      "content": "Apply an over-the-counter antiperspirant. Antiperspirants form a block using certain chemicals (like aluminum) against sweating and perspiration, which helps to eliminate body odor. Many of these antiperspirants last all day, but you may need to reapply, especially if you've been doing something like exercising. Unlike a deodorant, antiperspirants actually eliminate the perspiration, while deodorant simply masks the smell. There has been a lot of talk about whether antiperspirants that contain aluminum cause breast cancer, or Alzheimer's, but medical research has never adequately proven a link between the two (or between breast cancer and parabens), so it should be safe to use."

Sweating serves the very utilitarian purpose of cooling your body down, but you can manage your sweating so that it doesn't happen at inappropriate times. Deodorant covers up the smell, or eliminates it entirely, while not getting rid of the moisture itself.

If you are looking for a quick fix to your body odor problems, apply any deodorant that you can find. If you are looking to stay smelling fresh for longer periods of time, consider investing in a quality deodorant."

If you find that this is the case, wash the lemon juice off and wait a couple of hours before applying a smaller amount of lemon juice to the area. You can also try diluting the lemon juice with water."

[6] X Research source There are lots of different types of detoxes, so plan to talk to your doctor before you attempt one, especially one of the more rigorous cleanses. This is particularly important to do if you have a medical condition. Some claim that you may be able to get even more from your detox if you incorporate steam or infrared sauna, although this also has yet to be scientifically verified. Try using the sauna 2-3 times a week to help detox and reduce body odor. [7] X Research source"

You might be diagnosed with Bromhidrosis, a condition that causes people to have excessive body odor</ref> Doctors can prescribe prescription-level antiperspirants. These can cause skin irritation, so make sure you're only using this if you have an actual medical issue (like Bromhidrosis or Hyperhidrosis). Botox can also block sweat glands and eliminate your sweating. Again, you don't want to do this unless you have an actual medical problem, because it is both expensive and painful. The effects may only last for a few months and aren't always a long-term solution."
