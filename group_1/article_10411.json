      "content": "Wait until any swelling goes down before using concealer. If your black eye is swollen, wait for 3-4 days until the swelling has gone. Make sure that you can open your eye fully before applying any makeup. This is because applying concealer while your black eye is still swollen can interfere with the healing process. When you first get a black eye, you will need to spend a lot of time with a cold compress on it initially. This means that wearing any makeup during this time will be pointless anyway, as it will keep rubbing off with the cold compress."

      "content": "Use your fingers or a concealer brush to apply a green concealer over your black eye. Draw a triangle with the concealer under your eye, with the point towards your cheek. Blend the concealer in carefully within the triangle. [1] X Research source Green concealer helps to reduce the red and purple tones of a black eye. If the bruising extends to your eyelid and underneath your eyebrow, use the green concealer in these places too. Use your finger or a concealer brush to dab the green concealer over these areas, before using a blending sponge to gently blend the concealer in. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a concealer that matches your skin tone over the first coat. Use the same method of creating an upside down triangle under your eye, and blending it into your skin. Make sure that you cover all of the areas where the green concealer is, so that your skin doesn't have a green tinge. [3] X Research source Apply the concealer that matches your skin tone wherever there is bruising around your eye and where you used the green concealer. Repeat the same process of using your fingers or a concealer brush to dab the concealer over these areas, and then a blending sponge to blend it in. [4] X Research source The concealer that matches your skin tone will hide the green shade of the first coat of concealer. Your black eye will be well covered. If you don’t already own a concealer, many pharmacies and drug stores sell eye makeup in a wide range of tones. Ask the sales assistant, or bring a friend to help you pick the right shade for your skin if you’re having trouble. You can also choose from a few different types of concealer, including liquid, stick, and cream products. Reader Poll: We asked 160 wikiHow readers about their preferred type of concealer and 54% of them agreed that liquid concealer works best for them. [Take Poll] So, you may want to try a liquid concealer first!"

      "content": "Repeat the same makeup over your uninjured eye. When you are happy with the tone you have created, use exactly the same 2 concealers around your other eye. This makes your face look even and symmetrical, and it will be less obvious that you are trying to cover a black eye. Use the same color foundation on the rest of your face too, as this will help your eye makeup to blend in."

      "content": "Set the makeup with a setting powder. Use a setting powder brush to lightly pat setting powder over your makeup. Pay particular attention to your eye makeup, as this will require slightly more setting powder than the rest of your face. [5] X Research source A setting powder will help to prevent your makeup from wrinkling or creasing. Don't use a swiping motion when applying the setting powder as this will brush your makeup off."

      "content": "Apply a cold compress for 15-20 minutes immediately after the injury. Wrap a bag of frozen peas in a small cloth, and hold it against your black eye. Alternatively, stick a metal spoon in the refrigerator until it’s cold, and then press it lightly against your black eye. [7] X Research source Frozen peas are a better cold compress than ice cubes because they easily mould around your face. A cold compress will help to limit the amount of swelling by constricting the blood vessels. Reapply the cold compress approximately every 4 hours over the next 24 hours."

Visit your local pharmacy, and pick an analgesic that will help you to cope with the pain over the next few days. Avoid taking aspirin, as this is a blood thinner and can make your black eye look worse. [8] X Research source Ask the pharmacist for advice about the best painkiller to take."

While a black eye is not normally serious and will often resolve itself within a few weeks, contact your doctor if you have any concerns. These symptoms can suggest a broken bone, increased orbital pressure, or damage to your eyeball. [9] X Research source Also see your doctor if your black eye hasn’t healed completely within 3 weeks."
