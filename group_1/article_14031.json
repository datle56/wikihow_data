Open-ended questions are great, as they switch up the dynamic within a conversation. Now, your audience can take the floor within the presentation, meeting, lesson, or conversation."

In this type of setting, you could actually get away with asking questions like Does this make sense? , as long as you’re following it up with a statement like, “Okay, let’s take a look.” [4] X Research source Let’s say you were explaining a new grammar concept to students in an English class, like prepositional phrases. You could start the dialogue with your students by asking, “Does that make sense?” If they say yes, give them the opportunity to prove their knowledge with a little extra practice and review."

For instance, you might ask your students to hold up a certain number of fingers to rate their understanding of a concept. You could also use systems like: Entrance/exit tickets: Students have to fill out a “ticket” at the end of the school day discussing what they learned. When they come to class the next day, they have to write down any follow-up questions that they have. Fill-in-the-blank sentences: Create fill-in-the-blank prompts that students have to fill in to test their understanding. Examples: Ask your students to create an example using the content they just learned (like a new vocabulary word or a new math concept)."
