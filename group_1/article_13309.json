A positive number divided by a negative number will always be negative, regardless of whether the number is a whole number or a fraction. The same is true when dividing a negative number by a positive number. Remember that dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

Assuming it can sustain this rate indefinitely, how long would it take a peregrine to reach a height of -240 km? Remember that a negative number (-240km) divided by a negative number (-320km/hr) will equal a positive number (number of hours).
