      "content": "Boil the eggs. Put the eggs in a pan of water. Turn the heat to medium. Allow the eggs to boil for about fifteen minutes. Then, remove the eggs and allow them to cool. [1] X Research source While the eggs are boiling, use that time to cover the area where you will be dyeing the eggs with newspaper or paper towels."

      "title": "Fill a container.",
      "content": "Fill a container. If you’re only dyeing one egg, you can use a cup (236.6 ml). For several eggs, you should use a larger, plastic container. Fill the container with a ½ cup of water, one teaspoon of white vinegar, and about twenty drops of any food color. You will know that you’ve used liquid if the egg completely submerges in the water. [2] X Research source Fill several containers if you will be using different colors. Each color should have its own container."

      "title": "Soak the egg for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the egg for 5 minutes. Place the egg on a spoon and dunk the egg into the liquid. Turn the egg around so that both sides get color. Allow the egg to soak for five minutes. Leave the egg longer if you’d like a darker color. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dye the egg in multiple colors.",
      "content": "Dye the egg in multiple colors. You can dye the egg at least two colors by dipping only one section of the egg in at a time. This works best if you start with a fresh, boiled egg that has not been dyed yet. Hold one-half of the egg so that only half of it is submerged in the dye. After about five minutes, submerge the other half of the egg in another color. You will probably have to hold the egg as it soaks to submerge only half of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the egg.",
      "content": "Remove the egg. You can use tongs to gently remove the egg. Put the egg(s) in an egg carton to dry. The egg is now ready to be used for decoration. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a plastic egg.",
      "content": "Use a plastic egg. Real eggs are difficult to use with this method because they break easily. A plastic or paper mache egg is best to use. You can use any color egg you’d like. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Paint the egg.",
      "content": "Paint the egg. You don’t have to paint the egg if it’s already the same color as the glitter you will be using. If it isn’t, choose a color of acrylic paint that is the same color as your glitter. Use a paint or sponge brush to coat the egg with two or three layers of paint. Wait until the egg completely dries to move on. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply Mod Podge.",
      "content": "Apply Mod Podge. Use a separate sponge brush to apply a thick coat of mod podge to the egg. Make sure all of the egg gets covered with the Mod Podge. This part will be messy, and your fingers will likely get covered with glue. [7] X Research source You can use baby wipes to get the glue off of your fingers."

      "content": "Pour glitter over the egg. Put the egg into a plastic cup. The narrowest part of the egg should be facing upward. Pour glitter over the egg. Gently shake the cup so that the glitter covers the egg. You can add more glitter if necessary."

      "title": "Allow time to dry.",
      "content": "Allow time to dry. Once the egg is coated in glitter, give it thirty to sixty minutes to dry. You can leave the egg in the cup as it dries, or place it in an egg carton. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use acrylic paint. Acrylic paint is ideal for eggs because it covers them well and adheres nicely. You can use any brand and color of acrylic paint that you’d like. Use a paintbrush to create fun designs. Since eggs are pretty small, get some fine-pointed paint brushes for more intricate designs. [10] X Research source You may want to cover the area where you will be painting with newspaper."

      "content": "Paint one half of the egg at a time. You can paint any design you want. You can leave it one color, paint geometrical patterns and shapes, or turn the egg into a cute animal—like a bird. Let it dry before painting the other half to avoid smearing the paint. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Create a sponged effect.",
      "content": "Create a sponged effect. You can use this technique if the egg has been painted one, solid color. Wait until the first layer of paint dried. Then, use a dry sponge to apply white paint on the eggs after the other paint dries. Don’t use a lot of paint. Use a thin layer of white paint and dab the sponge all over the eggs."

      "content": "Find a silk tie. Use a tie that you won’t be wearing anymore. The tie should be 100% silk. A tie made of any other material won’t work. Choose a tie that has an interesting pattern. Dark purple, blue, and red ties work the best. [13] X Research source It doesn't necessarily have to be a beautiful tie. “Uglier” ties sometimes make the most beautiful eggs. If you don't have any ties laying around, silk ties can be found cheap at most thrift shops."

      "content": "Cut up the seam. This should double the size of your tie, which will give you a piece large enough to work with. Cut out a section that can easily wrap around your egg. You'll need a section of the material that wraps around the egg and can be held together. Leave about five centimeters of excess fabric. [14] X Research source"

Secure on the long side of the egg if you want the opposite end of the egg to show the pattern the best. Tie the egg horizontally if you want the wide side of the egg to show the design.
