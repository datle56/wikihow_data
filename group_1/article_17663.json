      "title": "Apply a 2-part epoxy putty for the most durable temporary fix.",
      "content": "Apply a 2-part epoxy putty for the most durable temporary fix. A 2-part epoxy putty is made up of a base and a hardener that solidify around your pipe when they’re mixed together. Just knead both putties in your hand until they’re thoroughly combined. Then, press the putty onto the section of pipe that’s leaking so it’s about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Leave the putty to cure for the amount of time listed on the packaging before running water through your drain again. [1] X Research source You can buy 2-part epoxy putty from your local hardware store. You can use it on any type of pipe. Even if the putty stops your leak, look for a more permanent solution to the leak as soon as you can."

      "title": "Wrap self-securing silicone tape around the pipe if there’s only a minor leak.",
      "content": "Wrap self-securing silicone tape around the pipe if there’s only a minor leak. Silicone tape works best around the joints in your drain pipe since it’s meant for low-flow leaks. Pull the tape tight and wrap it around the pipe, overlapping half of the piece underneath it with each rotation. Keep wrapping your tape past the edges of the leak so it forms a tight seal. [2] X Research source Silicone tape won’t stick directly to your pipe, but it will stick to itself, so it’s easy to remove later on. It also works on any type of pipe so it’s pretty versatile."

      "title": "Secure a pipe clamp over a leak if it’s in the middle of a pipe.",
      "content": "Secure a pipe clamp over a leak if it’s in the middle of a pipe. Clamps have a flat rubber piece called a gasket and a metal fastener that attaches around the pipe. Just be sure to get a clamp that fits the size of your pipe so it has a tight seal. Press the gasket tightly against the section of pipe that’s leaking. Set the clamp on top of the gasket and secure it around the pipe. Then, use a wrench to tighten the clamp completely so water can’t escape. [3] X Research source Clamps work for any type of pipe you’re repairing. You cannot use clamps on joints or corners since they won’t sit properly around your pipe."

      "title": "Tighten the slip nuts between pipes if they’re leaking at the joint.",
      "content": "Tighten the slip nuts between pipes if they’re leaking at the joint. A lot of times, you may just have a loose slip nut, which is a round fastener where one pipe meets another. Go underneath your sink and find the first slip nut where the vertical pipe connects to the drain. Turn the slipnut counter-clockwise until it’s hand-tight. Work your way down the rest of the pipe tightening all of the other nuts.

[5] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. Run some water down your drain and check if there are still leaks. If there are, then try tightening the slip nuts by a quarter-turn with a pair of pliers."

      "title": "Replace rubber gaskets at pipe connections if they’re old and cracked.",
      "content": "Replace rubber gaskets at pipe connections if they’re old and cracked. The gaskets are the small rubber pieces that fit between metal or PVC pipes and form a water-tight seal. Unscrew the slip nuts along the drain pipe and pull out the rubber gaskets to see if they have cracks or damage. If you notice any damage, replace the gaskets with ones that are the same size. Most gaskets will have a wider end and a narrower end. Push the narrow end of the gasket inside the pipe. [6] X Research source If you’re replacing the rubber gaskets on a slip nut, you’ll slide the gasket directly onto the pipe instead. Make sure the narrower end of the gasket points toward the end of the pipe where you’re making the connection. You can buy replacement gaskets in the plumbing section of your local hardware store."

      "title": "Wrap plumber’s tape around threadings on metal pipes.",
      "content": "Wrap plumber’s tape around threadings on metal pipes. Plumber’s tape, or Teflon tape, creates a water-tight seal where the pipes screw together. If you have metal drain pipes, unscrew the slip nuts holding them together. Wrap the plumber’s tape clockwise around the threading, overlapping each rotation by half of the tape’s width. Work up to the ends of the threading before cutting the tape and screwing your drain back together. [7] X Research source Avoid putting the tape on counter-clockwise since it could bunch up or unravel when you screw the pipe back onto your drain. Do not use plumber’s tape on PVC or plastic pipes since it could cause you to overtighten or damage the pipes."

      "content": "Put a bucket or pan underneath the pipes. Even though there’s no running water in your drain pipe, residual water may get caught in the P-trap, which is the J-shaped piece of pipe underneath your sink. Clear out the space underneath your drain pipes and set a tray or bucket directly under your pipes. [8] X Research source Some P-traps have a screw-off valve on the bottom you can use to drain it. Just turn the valve on the P-trap counter-clockwise until water spills out."

Start with the slip nut where your sink drain connects to the long vertical pipe underneath your sink. Turn the nut clockwise to loosen it completely. Follow the pipe and unscrew any remaining slipnuts until you reach the horizontal pipe coming out from your wall. Each section of pipe should easily detach as soon as you unscrew the slipnuts attached to it. [9] X Research source If only the J-shaped section of the P-trap is damaged, then you only need to remove the slipnuts connecting to that portion of pipe. You can leave the other pipes connected to your drain and wall. [10] X Research source Make sure no one uses your sink after you detach any drain pipes, or else water will spill onto the floor. If you want to, you can turn off the water supply directly at your sink to make sure no one uses it. Find the supply valve connected to the wall and turn it clockwise to shut it off.
