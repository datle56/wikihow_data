      "content": "Check the meat for signs of spoilage. If your meat has been in the freezer longer than you can remember, you'll probably want to toss it, just to be on the safe side. If not, there are some telltale signs your food has gone bad. [1] X Research source The meat looks discolored. There’s a nasty smell coming from the packaging. The package shows signs of freezer burn (ice on the inside)."

      "title": "Find a microwave-safe container.",
      "content": "Find a microwave-safe container. Though it is possible to defrost meat without a container, you'll save yourself a lot of clean up time by using one. Typically, glass bowls are the best, safest containers to use in a microwave. [2] X Research source If you’re planning to use a plastic container, check out the original packaging to make sure it's safe for microwave use. Some other items considered unsafe for the microwave include brown paper bags, aluminum foil, and single-use plastic containers (ex: the kind that take-out food comes in). Basically, if you're not sure, don't use it."

      "title": "Weigh the meat.",
      "content": "Weigh the meat. If the meat is still in its original packaging, it probably has a label that tells you exactly how much it weighs. If it doesn't, you’ll need to weigh it yourself. The best tool for weighing meat is a kitchen scale, which gives more specific weights (down to fractions of a lb/kg) than bigger scales."

      "content": "Remove the meat from its wrapper. Many materials used to package frozen meats should definitely not be microwaved, so be sure to toss everything but the meat itself before you begin cooking. [3] X Research source"

Then, set the microwave's power to 20%, and heat 1 minute for every 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) of chicken. About once a minute, flip breasts, while continually removing pieces that are no longer frozen (set those aside for cooking). [4] X Research source Thawed pieces will feel soft when you poke them with a fork."

Reduce power to 30%, and heat 1 minute for every 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) of chicken. Remove chicken pieces as they thaw — check about every 60 seconds. [5] X Research source"

When it comes to thawing meat in the microwave, it’s super important that you don’t just “set it and forget it.” Meat that hasn't completely defrosted may not cook properly.

Heating the meat up to a safe temperature stops that from happening, but only if you cook it right away. Use a food thermometer to make sure the meat is fully cooked to a safe temperature."
