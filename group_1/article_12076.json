      "content": "Resist the urge to avoid them. While it may seem easiest just to avoid your neighbor — say by peeking out your window to make sure they aren't around when you leave the house or by pretending you're not home when they knock — this is simply prolonging the issue and may, in fact, cause their behavior to escalate. Instead of avoiding your neighbor, you can set boundaries in a very non-confrontational way."

      "title": "Look outside before exiting.",
      "content": "Look outside before exiting. The easiest way to avoid your overly friendly neighbor is to look outside before walking out the door. Peer through your peephole or window and, if you see them, wait a few minutes before opening the door. If you exit your apartment and hear them around the corner, avoid an awkward encounter by waiting for them to leave the building or enter their apartment."

      "title": "Tell them you’re in a rush and can’t chat.",
      "content": "Tell them you’re in a rush and can’t chat. You might not have time in your schedule to wait for them to leave the scene, or they might see you head out and bombard you. Stop a long-winded conversation before it starts. Smile, wave or say hello, and keep walking. Say something like, “Hi there! I’m in a rush and can’t chat. Catch up with you later!” With any luck, they’ll take the hint after you do this a couple of times."

Have a good one!” Other excuses could be a lunch or dinner date, work, or meeting your workout partner. If you’re entering your home, you could say, “I have to start dinner,” or “I have piles of laundry (or another chore) to do.” You could always just leave it vague and say, “I just noticed the time - I have to run!”"

      "title": "Reschedule chats to a more convenient time.",
      "content": "Reschedule chats to a more convenient time. If your neighbor is at your door, you are not required to answer, especially if you don't feel safe doing so. If, however, you feel comfortable answering the door, you can quickly set a boundary by saying, \"Now is really not a great time for me to talk.\" If you wish to have a relationship with your neighbor, suggest an alternate time that you can talk. Say, \"Are you free tomorrow afternoon, around four? I'll be free then and would love to take a walk and catch up.\" If you don't like them dropping by unannounced, you can also tell them politely, “It’s really best to call or set something up instead of popping in.”"

      "content": "Consider how long you’ll be neighbors. If you’re a renter or selling your home, and you know you’ll be leaving the neighborhood soon, you might just want to set boundaries (for instance by telling your neighbor \"Sorry, I don't have time to chat!\") and not actually get into a discussion about their behavior. Matters are a bit more complicated if you and your neighbor are both homeowners or long-term renters. You should confront them about your discomfort instead of trying to spare their feelings or let tensions mount. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Confront them sooner rather than later. If you’ve politely given hints or tried to avoid them with no luck, you might have to have a face-to-face conversation with them. You should make your feelings clear as soon as you notice an issue developing. Delaying a calm, firm conversation will only encourage their intrusive behavior. [4] X Research source You might feel the urge to just be nice and spare their feelings, but letting tensions mount could result in a bigger issue in the future. Further, if you lead them to believe their behavior is fine, you’ll end up hurting their feelings more when you finally make your feelings known."

      "content": "Be firm and honest about how they make you feel. You should be clear and honest with your neighbors about any issues. Be respectful and polite, but try not to sugarcoat your point too much. Try saying, “You are a warm, nice person. I know you’re being friendly, and I hope you don’t find me rude, but I’m just not very social.” If you’d like, you could add something like, “My schedule is just so tight right now, and I have so many responsibilities to juggle. I find our chats pleasant, but they always seem to make me run late!”"

      "content": "Act as a united front if you’re married or have a roommate. If you live with a spouse or roommate, talk to them about how to handle your overly friendly neighbor. Come up with a strategy and make sure you both follow through with it. In any case, make sure you and your spouse or roommate are a united front. Sending mixed signals will only aggravate the situation. For example, if your neighbor follows you to your door and tries to come in, you could say, “My roommate and I have a 'call ahead' policy — we really don't like people dropping by.”"

Tell them that you’d like to have an amicable relationship and look out for each other’s property, but aren’t comfortable with anything more. [5] X Research source Try saying, “I’ve become close with neighbors in the past, but ended up having a terrible disagreement that’s made me wary of getting too close to my neighbors. I hope you aren’t insulted, and I mean no offense, but I think it’s best to keep some boundaries.”"

However, keep your conversations brief, and stick to inoffensive topics. You should ask them not to talk badly about your other neighbors if they start to make things too personal. [6] X Research source If they start putting someone down, try changing the subject or find an excuse to leave. If they ask you about your business or for your opinion on someone else, just let them know you’re not friendly enough with them to share your or anyone else’s secrets. Calmly say, “I really don’t like talking badly about other people, especially neighbors.”"

      "content": "Stop your neighbor from bringing over food. It’s nice when a neighbor bakes you a pie every now and then, but an overly friendly neighbor might try to make it a daily or weekly ritual. They might also try to make you feel obligated to return the favor. If it becomes a problem, express your gratitude, but make it clear you want them to stop. [7] X Research source Suppose your neighbor starts bringing over food every few days, and you’re tired of it. Tell them, “You know, I really have to start making my own food! I just can’t accept any more of yours.” You could try to be polite and say, “I don’t want to put you out or burden you.” If they persist, respond by saying, “I really hate to say it, but it’ll probably just go to waste. I really appreciate it, but we don’t eat many sweets (or whichever items they prepare).” You could also try suggesting a local charity, like a religious organization or soup kitchen, that would welcome their baking or cooking skills."

      "content": "Deal with a neighbor who doesn’t respect your space. In more extreme cases, an overly friendly neighbor might insist on touching you or otherwise intruding your personal space. Even if they believe touching your shoulder when they greet you is harmless, you should tell them to stop if it makes you uncomfortable. [8] X Research source Look them in the eye, stand up straight, and do your best to project confidence. Calmly and assertively say, “I don’t feel comfortable with being touched like that.” There’s no need to make excuses for them or apologize, but you can gauge your response based on your level of discomfort. If your neighbor touches your shoulder, and it’s annoying but you don’t find it threatening, politely tell them to stop. If they touch you in way you feel is inappropriate, tell them their action is harassment, and don’t hesitate to notify authorities if they persist."

If you live in an apartment complex or building, relocating to another floor or section of the complex might be an option worth exploring. That way, you'll avoid daily interactions with your intrusive neighbor without having to go through the burden of moving to another complex. [10] X Research source Describe your situation to your property manager. Ask them, \"Are there any available apartments on another floor or in a building on the other side of the complex?\" Be sure to ask them to waive security deposits and other fees, since you're an existing resident relocating due to an issue that's out of your control."
