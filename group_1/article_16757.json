If you want to use an email app (like the iPhone Mail app, Thunderbird, Apple Mail, or Postbox) to check a web-based email service (like Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo), you usually don't need to enter an incoming mail server manually, as most email apps can add this info automatically once you sign in. But for other email accounts, like the one provided to you by your ISP, work, or school, you'll usually need to enter the incoming mail server, outgoing mail server, and port number(s). You can find which incoming mail server to use in your email provider's \"Help\" or \"Support\" area, or check our handy chart for common mail server addresses: Service Incoming Outgoing AOL Mail [1] X Research source imap.aol.com (IMAP) or pop.aol.com (POP3) port: 993 (IMAP) or 995 (POP3) smtp.aol.com port: 465 Bluehost [2] X Research source example.com (your domain) port: 993 (IMAP) or 995 (POP3) example.com (your domain) port: 465 Charter.net (Spectrum) [3] X Research source mobile.charter.net port: 993 mobile.charter.net port: 587 Comcast.net (Xfinity) [4] X Research source imap.comcast.net (IMAP) or pop3.comcast.net (POP3) port: 993 (IMAP) or 995 (POP3) smtp.comcast.net port: 587 Gmail [5] X Research source imap.gmail.com (IMAP) or pop.gmail.com (POP3) port: 993 (IMAP) or 995 (POP3) smtp.gmail.com port: 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS) GoDaddy [6] X Research source imap.secureserver.net port: 993 smtpout.secureserver.net port: 465 iCloud [7] X Research source imap.mail.me.com port: 993 smtp.mail.me.com port: 587 Outlook.com and Hotmail.com [8] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft.
