Make note of where it stops. Sometimes, the dial will stick right on the numbers, but sometimes the sticking point will be between the numbers. If so, record the number to the half (example: 22.5). While continuing to apply tension to the shackle, turn the dial as far left (counter-clockwise) as you can. Make note of the first counter-clockwise (CCW) stopping point. The CCW stopping point and CW stopping point from your sticking \"range,\" for example, 22.5 to 10. Some 800XXX and 908XXX locks have a 2-number sticking range (for example, 28 to 30 and 10 to 12). Determine the first sticking point by finding the number that's in the midpoint of the sticking range. A range of 4 and 5 would have a first sticking point of 4.5. A range of 22.5 and 23.5 would have a first sticking point of 23. Each set of numbers that you find will have the same range. For example, one group may be 0.25 to 0.75 and another may be 0.5 to 0.25 on either side of the sticking points."

Look at your list of sticking points and eliminate all those which are not whole numbers (that is, cross off any number that ends in 0.5). Eliminate 7 of the 12 numbers with this step. Of the remaining sticking points, choose the number with the unique digit in the \"1s\" position. Four of the remaining 5 numbers will share the same number in the \"1s\" place. For example, if the numbers left on the list are 4, 14, 24, 27, and 34, the number 27 is the only number which does not have a 4 in the \"ones\" place. This is the third number of the combination. If you only have 4 numbers remaining and they all share the same digit in the \"1s\" position, check the \"note\" above in step 3 about a 2-number range. The third number of your combination will be the number that has a 2-number range (for example, if you have 0, 30, 20, 10 left, but 20 has a range of 19 to 21, that would mean that your third combination number is 20)."

Look at the number when it sticks and add 5 to that value. Find the number you wrote down for the first digit (in step 9) that is nearest the sum. For example, if the lock sticks at 17 when rotating CCW, you would write down 17+5=22, then look in the list above and determine that 23 is likely the first number of the combination. This trick may not work for 800XXX locks, but it's still a good starting number to try."

Now that the next number we would try is 33 which is greater than our first digit we would try 27-33-27, then CW to 37 and CCW to 27. The reason this works is the disk for the second digit isn't impacted when we rotate CCW, so we are effectively just setting the 2nd number to a bigger value. When the value gets too big then we effectively passed the first number *twice* and then picked our second digit—which is why we have to reset when the 2nd number becomes bigger than the first."
