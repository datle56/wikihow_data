      "content": "Consider the time of the ball when assessing the formality of the event. Note the time of the event on the invitation, which can give you clues about the level of formality expected. A ball held during an afternoon might be slightly less formal than one held in the evening. In general, evening events are more formal than day events. [3] X Research source Lighter colors are best suited to day events while deeper colors and black are generally more appropriate for an evening ball."

      "title": "Take the season into account when selecting formal fabrics.",
      "content": "Take the season into account when selecting formal fabrics. Choose seasonally appropriate textiles to ensure you are comfortable and appropriate at the ball. For example, a chiffon dress may be slightly out of place during a winter event. Similarly, a wool waistcoat may be a better choice for a winter ball than a summer one."

    {
      "title": "Talk with other guests about what they’ll be wearing.",
      "content": "Talk with other guests about what they’ll be wearing. Ask friends or family who are attending the ball what they plan to wear. They can help you decide if you’re dressing too casually for the event or if your look is just right. They can also assist in interpreting any creative requests in the dress code."

      "title": "Assume black tie for lack of other information.",
      "content": "Assume black tie for lack of other information. Err on the side of overdressing for the ball rather than underdressing if you aren’t given direction about the dress code. [4] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. If your hosts have not been very clear about expected attire, chances are you’re not the only guest who is making an educated guess about what to wear."

    {
      "title": "Pick an A-line dress for a universally flattering look.",
      "content": "Pick an A-line dress for a universally flattering look. Choose a long, A-line gown for a silhouette that accentuates most body types. A-line dresses hug the body from the top to the natural waist and then flare out slightly. [5] X Research source Unless the invitation states otherwise, it is best to assume all dresses for a ball should be floor length. An A-line gown in maroon or emerald green would be a refined way to wear color. Experiment with classic prints, such as florals, to provide some interest to your look. A good rule of thumb is to choose prints that are smaller than the size of your fist. Very large or ornate prints may call attention to you in a negative way."

    {
      "title": "Experiment with ball gowns if you have a slender figure.",
      "content": "Experiment with ball gowns if you have a slender figure. Choose a ball gown with a fitted bodice and large, voluminous skirt for a classic “princess” look. This style enhances flatter, more athletic body types because it gives the illusion of curves. [6] X Research source Note that if you’re very petite, a ball gown may overwhelm your small frame. A column-style dress would be more flattering. Opt for ball gowns in solid colors; a printed ball gown may appear excessive given that it is a more voluminous garment."

    {
      "title": "Try a mermaid silhouette for a sexier look.",
      "content": "Try a mermaid silhouette for a sexier look. Choose a mermaid-style, which is fitted from the top to the knee if you want to show off your curves. This style looks great on hourglass figures because the shape of the dress mimics that of the body. [7] X Research source If you’ll be dancing at the ball, a mermaid-style dress is a little more constricting than a ball gown or A-line dress, which allow more movement. Avoid cut-outs or plunging necklines with this style, as the silhouette is already sexy on its own. A mermaid-style dress in a black-and white print would be a fun, classic take on a more modern silhouette."

    {
      "title": "Opt for a column dress if you’re shorter.",
      "content": "Opt for a column dress if you’re shorter. Elongate your body by selecting a column-style dress to give the illusion of height. This is a great choice if you are petite and may accentuate your height more if you are tall already. [8] X Research source Avoid a column dress if you’re heavier on the bottom than the top, as the slim silhouette can make your body look imbalanced. Due to their simple silhouettes, column dresses are a great cut to show off intricate beading or lace detailing."

    {
      "title": "Accessorize to elevate the formality of your look.",
      "content": "Accessorize to elevate the formality of your look. Use jewelry with fine gemstones and precious metals to match the elegance of the occasion. Even faux jewels in classic styles, such as a pearl necklace or diamond earrings, can help your formal wear look more polished. [9] X Research source Pair more ornate statement jewelry featuring large stones or many strands of beads with a solid-color gown. This will make your eye-catching jewelry the center of attention. Try more understated jewelry, such as gold or pearl stud earrings, with patterned or beaded gowns, so the two parts of your look don’t compete."

      "title": "Wear gloves for white tie events.",
      "content": "Wear gloves for white tie events. Choose evening gloves in white, ivory, or taupe for white tie events. White gloves are suitable for almost any dresses. In general, the shorter the sleeves of your gown, the longer your gloves should be. If desired, you can wear your jewelry, such as bracelets on top of your gloves. [10] X Research source For a sleeveless dress, opt for gloves that are longer than elbow length. \"Opera gloves\" are very long gloves that go far beyond the elbow, and are very dressy and make for a bold look. Generally one doesn’t wear evening gloves with a long-sleeved evening gown. Proper etiquette entails keeping your gloves on when dancing and greeting others but removing them to eat."

      "title": "Choose formal shoes that suit the night’s activities.",
      "content": "Choose formal shoes that suit the night’s activities. Consider if you’ll be dancing the night away or largely dining when selecting the height of your heel for the evening. Unlike a prom, removing your shoes because your feet hurt at a ball would be a serious fax pas. Opt for heels, wedges, or flats in formal materials, such as patent leather or satin, that will allow you to enjoy the night. Metallic wedges are a supportive choice for dancing and go with most dresses. Embellishments, such as rhinestones, could dress up a pair of plain ballet flats."

      "content": "Play up formality with your hair and makeup. Use your makeup to highlight either your lips or your eyes as a prominent feature. Keep hair sleek and polished to match the formality of your event—whether you blow it straight, curl it, or opt for a sophisticated updo. If you don’t like to wear a lot of makeup, go for a polished natural look in pink and neutral shades. Many salons can do your hair and makeup for a formal event, if you don’t feel comfortable doing it yourself."

      "content": "Choose a dark suit with a complementary tie. Opt for a navy, black, or dark grey suit for balls that aren’t black or white tie. Some military balls, in particular, ask that civilians dress in suits rather than tuxedos or tails. [11] X Research source Pair your dark suit with a regular necktie or a bowtie. Bowties may come off as slightly more formal. Choose a tie in formal material, such as silk or satin. Avoid novelty prints and opt for classics, such hounds tooth."

[12] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Choose a tuxedo with either a peaked lapel or shawl collar for a polished formal look. [13] X Research source Peaked lapels are considered the most formal and traditional lapel style. Tuxedos are typically worn with a black or dark-colored bowtie, a cummerbund, and pocket square. Opt for suiting accessories in dark colors or subtle prints in fine fabrics, such as silk. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a tailcoat and waistcoat for a white tie event. Consult an expert at a fine suiting boutique to make sure you’re on trend for a white tie event. Typically white tie requires a long black tailcoat as well as a white waistcoat underneath in place of a cummerbund. White tie usually calls for a white silk bowtie and suiting accessories. [15] X Research source If you’re looking for a theatrical flourish for a very formal event, consult a suiting boutique about a silk top hat or dress cane."

      "content": "Opt for jewelry in fine materials. Choose cufflinks, dress buttons, and lapel pins in precious metals or fine jewels, such as mother of pearl. This will ensure your accessories match the formality of the ball. [17] X Research source Note that watches are often seen as being in poor taste at very formal events. The implication being that you are bored and watching the clock tick down until you can leave."

[19] X Research source Avoid fake flower boutonnieres, which may come across as comical or cheap."
