Then, use a sharp knife to carefully cut 1 ⁄ 4 to 3 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 to 1.91 cm) slices lengthwise. [2] X Research source You'll now have several potato planks on your cutting board."

Then, slice the stack into 1 ⁄ 4 to 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.64 to 0.95 cm) slices. Repeat this with all of the potato stacks. Try to make the slices as even as possible so your fries cook at the same rate."

      "title": "Adjust the mandoline",
      "content": "Adjust the mandoline to the very fine julienne setting. Place the mandolin on a flat surface and follow the owner's manual to adjust the setting. You may need to insert an extra blade to julienne the potatoes or raise a knob to adjust the blade for very fine julienne. Your owner's manual may also recommend that you wet the surface of the mandoline with a few drops of water. This can help the potatoes slide across the blade easier. Always use extreme caution when working with the mandoline, since it's easy to accidentally cut yourself on its sharp blade."

Then, drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry. Fry the shoestring fries in 350 °F (177 °C) oil for 2 to 4 minutes, depending on how crispy you like them. [6] X Research source Fry about 1 cup (325 g) of shoestring fries at a time so you don't lower the temperature of the oil too quickly."

Set the potatoes on a cutting board and hold one securely with one hand. Use your other hand to carefully make 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices lengthwise.

You can make the cubes around 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) if you want them to cook quickly or make them around 1 inch (2.5 cm) for more substantial home fries.
