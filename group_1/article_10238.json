You can find the file's directory by going to the file's location in File Explorer and then clicking the URL bar near the top of the File Explorer window. Most files will be somewhere in the following directory: [drive letter]:\\Users\\[username] (for example, \"C:\\Users\\Kyle\"). This is the directory in which almost every user-created file on your computer is located. A file on your desktop for the above example would be in the \"C:\\Users\\Kyle\\Desktop\" directory, while a file in the Documents folder would be in the \"C:\\Users\\Kyle\\Documents\" directory."
