You can also use this method if you are given two points on the line, without having the line graphed in front of you. Coordinates are listed as ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,y)} , with x {\\displaystyle x} being the location along the x, or horizontal axis, and y {\\displaystyle y} being the location along the y, or vertical axis. For example, you might choose points with coordinates ( 3 , 2 ) {\\displaystyle (3,2)} and ( 7 , 8 ) {\\displaystyle (7,8)} ."

A line with a positive slope moves up left-to-right; a line with a negative slope moves down left-to-right.

If either the numerator or the denominator is negative, then the fraction (and slope) is negative."
