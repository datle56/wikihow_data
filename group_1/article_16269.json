      "title": "Section your hair into even parts.",
      "content": "Section your hair into even parts. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to divide your hair from ear to ear. Then, divide it down the center from your forehead to your nape, sectioning the sides and back into segments about 1 ⁄ 2 –1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) wide. Make the sections as even as possible and secure them in place with clips or rubber bands. [1] X Research source If you have a hard time keeping your sections flat, you can straighten them in place with a flat iron. To make realistic dreads, your hair length should be at least 1 in (2.5 cm) long. This method also works best with naturally curly or textured hair."

    {
      "title": "Shape the sections with hair gel.",
      "content": "Shape the sections with hair gel. Apply a coin-sized amount of gel to your hand and work it into one section at a time. Begin about 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the roots and rub the gel all the way to the tips. [2] X Research source Hair gel with a strong hold is ideal for shaping secure dreads. Keeping the hair gel out of the roots prevents product buildup on your scalp."

    {
      "title": "Roll each dread with your hand.",
      "content": "Roll each dread with your hand. After applying the hair gel, grab a section of your hair and roll it back and forth between your palms. Roll the section until the hair sticks together and forms a a thin, oval shape resembling dreadlocks. Repeat on each section. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tease each section",
      "content": "Tease each section with a comb, then roll each dread again. With a fine-toothed comb, brush your hair up from the tips to the root in several short strokes. After reaching the root, roll the dread again into an oval shape to form a temporary dread. [4] X Research source Let the hair gel dry for at least 15-30 seconds before teasing your hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use hairspray to secure the dreadlocks.",
      "content": "Use hairspray to secure the dreadlocks. After making your temporary dreads, spray a thin layer of hairspray overhead, 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) away from your roots. Choose a hairspray with a gentle hold to help it maintain the dreadlock's shape without damaging your hair. When you're ready to remove the temporary dreads, wash them out in the shower with conditioner."

      "title": "Buy a bag of roving wool in your desired color.",
      "content": "Buy a bag of roving wool in your desired color. Roving wool, the same kind of wool you'd use for felting, is perfect for rolling into dreads. Depending on your hair length, you may need a 1–2 lb (0.45–0.91 kg) bag of wool. [5] X Research source You can find roving wool at most craft stores. For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of wool, you should be able to make 50-60 dreads that are 10–12 in (25–30 cm) long."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the roving wool into strips.",
      "content": "Cut the roving wool into strips. Using a pair of scissors, cut the roving wool into segments with the approximate length and width for your dreads. Keep in mind while cutting that roving wool shrinks up to 1/3 of its size during the dread making process. The length and width of the segments depends on how large you want your dreads to be. If you want dreads that are 10 inches (25 cm) long and 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, cut pieces that are 30 inches (76 cm) long and 6 inches (15 cm) wide. Use the first dread you cut as a guideline for the rest of the dreads to keep their size even."

      "content": "Mix dish soap with boiling water in a pot. Use enough dish soap to make the water color murky, but not opaque, at a ratio of approximately 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of soap for every 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. Bring the water to a boil, as the dreads will need hot water to bind together tightly. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Dunk the strips of wool in hot water.",
      "content": "Dunk the strips of wool in hot water. Grab the strips of wool with tongs one at a time and slowly immerse them into the water. After dunking them in the water, lift them out and let them cool down. [7] X Research source Wear a thick pair of rubber gloves while dunking the dreads to prevent burns."

      "content": "Roll the strips of wool into dreadlock shapes. While squeezing out the excess water, roll the dread back and forth between your palms. Continue rolling until the wool thins out and turns into a dreadlock shape. [8] X Research source Keep the gloves on while you're rolling to protect yourself from burns."

      "title": "Hang the \"dreads\" up to dry.",
      "content": "Hang the \"dreads\" up to dry. Find a spot like a clothesline or a hanger to place each dread after you roll it until they are completely dry. Leave them to dry for between several hours and a day, depending on the area's temperature and how long the dreads are. [9] X Research source Your dreads will dry faster if exposed to wind or direct sunlight. If drying your dreads in a windy outdoor location, clip them down with clothespins to prevent them from falling off."

      "title": "Braid the dreads into your hair.",
      "content": "Braid the dreads into your hair. Part your hair into small sections and, using rubber bands, insert a wool dread into each section. Box braid the dreads into your hair to secure them tightly, sectioning 2 parts of hair with each synthetic dread and pulling each section to the middle in turn until you reach the ends. [10] X Research source If you have short or no hair, make a wig using the wool dreads instead of synthetic hair as an alternative to braiding. [11] X Research source You can leave these in your hair for up to 1-2 days at a time. Remove them by taking out the rubber bands and carefully unbraiding each section."

      "title": "Measure the yarn length for your individual dreads.",
      "content": "Measure the yarn length for your individual dreads. Choose whatever color yarn you want. Multiply the desired length by 3 to ensure the yarn will be long enough once you braid it into your hair. [12] X Research source If you want your dreads to be 12 inches (30 cm), for example, cut 3 feet (0.91 m) lengths of yarn. Use the first yarn strand you cut as a guideline for additional dreads. Bulky yarn works best for knitting yarn dreads. As for the material, most yarn types (acrylic, wool, cotton, etc) work well."

      "content": "Loop the yarn around your fingers and cut the strands. Hold out 4 fingers on one hand and loop the yarn around them 5 times. Then, stretch the loops out and cut the connected ends. After cutting, you'll have 5 even lengths of yarn. [13] X Research source"

Divide your hair down the center from your forehead to the nape of your neck, sectioning the sides and back into segments depending on how many dreads you want to make.
