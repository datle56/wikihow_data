      "title": "Source a variety of fruit and vegetables to feed your snail.",
      "content": "Source a variety of fruit and vegetables to feed your snail. Raw produce is the best food option for snails, as it contains the most nutrients and is easy to digest. Apple, aubergine, cucumber, carrot, tomatoes, and lettuce are cheap and easy options; however, any fruit and vegetables are fine. [1] X Research source Give the snail a variety of fruit and vegetables to ensure that it gets a wide range of nutrients. Feed the snail organic produce, as snails are sensitive to pesticides."

      "title": "Peel the food into thin strips or cut it into 1 centimetre (0.39 in) cubes.",
      "content": "Peel the food into thin strips or cut it into 1 centimetre (0.39 in) cubes. This makes it easier for the snail to eat. Use a food peeler to shave thin strips off the fruit or vegetables. If the food can’t be peeled, use a sharp knife to cut it into thin slices or small cubes. [2] X Research source Don’t worry about removing thin skins from fruit or vegetable such as carrots. Thick-skinned produce, such as bananas and pumpkins should be peeled to make it easier for the snail to eat the flesh."

      "title": "Replenish the snail's food supply when it runs out.",
      "content": "Replenish the snail's food supply when it runs out. The snails will stop eating once it has had enough. When you notice that the snail has eaten all of its food, simply give it some more fruit and vegetables. [3] X Research source Over time, you will get used to how much the snail eats and will be able to plan accordingly."

    {
      "title": "Replace any uneaten food after 3 days to stop if from rotting.",
      "content": "Replace any uneaten food after 3 days to stop if from rotting. Most fruit and vegetables have a relatively short shelf life when they are kept out of the fridge. Replace the fresh produce regularly to stop it from going bad. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place a shallow, plastic dish of water by the snail's food.",
      "content": "Place a shallow, plastic dish of water by the snail's food. The snail will drink the water and also bathe in it to keep its shell hydrated. Place no more than 1 centimetre (0.39 in) of water in the dish help prevent the snail from drowning in the water. Do not use a dish of any material you aren't able to bend. A snail can fall on this and damage their shells. Make sure the dish is secure and will not spill."

      "title": "Leave a cuttlefish bone with the snail's food to increase its calcium intake.",
      "content": "Leave a cuttlefish bone with the snail's food to increase its calcium intake. In order to build and repair its shell, snails need calcium. The snail will absorb the calcium through its foot when it sits on top of the cuttlefish. Place the cuttlefish bone beside its food to help encourage them to sit on it. [5] X Research source Purchase a cuttlefish bone from a pet shop."

    {
      "title": "Stay away from salty foods.",
      "content": "Stay away from salty foods. Your snail only needs a very small amount of salt in its diet, which is naturally found in fruit and vegetables. Foods with a high salt content will dehydrate the snail and make it unwell. Avoid packaged food, as this tends to have a high salt content."

    {
      "title": "Avoid feeding the snail pasta, rice, and millet.",
      "content": "Avoid feeding the snail pasta, rice, and millet. Snails are unable to digest any food that has a lot of starch. These foods cause the snail to experience bloating and internal blockages. This can make the snail sick and can be fatal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit the amount of acidic food that you feed the snail.",
      "content": "Limit the amount of acidic food that you feed the snail. Provide the snail with a variety of food options. Avoid only feeding the snail acidic fruit such as tomatoes, oranges, and tangerines, as these can be harmful if they aren’t supplemented with other foods. As long as the snail has less-acidic food options, it is fine to feed it acidic foods as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid fruit and vegetables that have been sprayed with pesticides.",
      "content": "Avoid fruit and vegetables that have been sprayed with pesticides. Snails are really sensitive to the pesticides that are sprayed on fruit. Avoid any fruit and vegetables that aren’t organically grown. Look for “organic” and “spray-free” signs when you are doing your fruit and vegetable shopping."
