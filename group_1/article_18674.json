      "content": "Understand Pikachu’s happiness rating. Pikachu’s happiness is measured by an invisible scale depending on how you treat him. The number is invisible but is rated from 0 to 255. Keeping your Pikachu with you and safe will increase the number, while stowing it away and losing it in battle will lower the number. You can hit the “A” button when facing Pikachu and his response will help reveal how happy it is."

However, gym leaders are finite and it’s difficult to find enough to consistently increase happiness. [2] X Research source You can put Pikachu and the head of your party then immediately swap it out at the start of the fight and still receive the bonus happiness. The happiness increase from this method is slightly lower than using items or leveling up."
