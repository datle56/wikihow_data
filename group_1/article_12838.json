      "title": "Check your face for a butterfly rash.",
      "content": "Check your face for a butterfly rash. An average of 30 percent of lupus patients develop a characteristic rash over the face often said to look like a butterfly or wolf bite. The rash spans across the cheeks and nose, often flaring out over the entirety of the cheeks and occasionally covering a portion of skin near the eyes. Also check for discoid rashes around your face, scalp, and neck. These rashes show up as red, raised patches, and they can be so severe that they leave scars even after they’re gone. Pay special attention to rashes triggered or worsened by sunlight. Sensitivity to ultraviolet light, whether natural or artificial, can trigger sores on sun-exposed parts of the body and may worsen a butterfly rash on your face. This rash is more severe and develops faster than a usual sunburn would."

      "content": "Note any mouth or nasal sores. If you frequently get sores on the roof of your mouth, along the side of your mouth, on your gums, or inside your nose, this could be another warning sign. In particular, this is often the case if these sores are not actually \"sore.\" In most cases, mouth and nasal sores associated with lupus are pain-free. If these sores get worse in sunlight, this is an even stronger sign of lupus. This is called photosensitivity."

      "title": "Look for symptoms of inflammation.",
      "content": "Look for symptoms of inflammation. Inflammation of the joints, lungs, and the lining around the heart commonly occurs in patients who have lupus. On top of this, blood vessels are usually inflamed. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Most notably, you might see inflammation and swelling around the feet, legs, hands, and eyes. [4] X Research source If you have inflamed joints, they may feel warm and tender and look swollen and red. Inflammation of the heart and lungs can be detected at home based on chest pain. If you feel a sharp chest pain when you cough or take a deep breath, you can count this as a possible symptom. The same applies if you feel shortness of breath during these periods. Other signs that your heart or lungs could be inflamed include abnormal heart rhythms and the coughing up of blood. [5] X Research source Inflammation can also take place in the digestive tract and can be spotted through symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting."

      "title": "Pay attention to your urine.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your urine. While urine abnormalities can be hard to detect at home, there are a few symptoms you might be able to detect. If a kidney is unable to filter your urine due to lupus, your feet might swell. Worse yet, if your kidneys have begun failing, you might feel nausea or weakness."

      "title": "Note any problems with your brain and nervous system.",
      "content": "Note any problems with your brain and nervous system. Lupus can affect the nervous system. Some symptoms, like anxiety, headaches, and vision problems, are common and difficult to assign to lupus; however, seizures and changes in personality are concrete symptoms taken very seriously. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Note that while headaches are very common with lupus, they can be very difficult to attribute to the disease. Headaches are common and have many possible causes."

      "content": "Ask yourself if you are more fatigued than usual. Extreme fatigue is another common symptom of lupus. It can be caused by a number of different factors, but often these factors can be linked to lupus. When fatigue is accompanied by fever, you may be even more certain that it is lupus.

      "content": "Watch for other strange things in your body. You may notice that your fingers or toes change color (white or blue) when exposed to cold. This is called Raynaud’s phenomenon, and is common with lupus. You may also notice dry eyes and shortness of breath. If all of these symptoms occur together, you may be dealing with lupus.

      "content": "Prepare for your appointment with the doctor. You can go to any general physician for a lupus diagnosis, but that doctor may refer you to a rheumatologist who may order more confirmatory tests and help manage symptoms with specific medication for lupus. Typically, though, the start of a professional medical diagnosis will be at a standard physician's office. [9] X Research source Before your appointment, write down information about when your symptoms began and how frequent they are. Also make a note of any medications and supplements you take as possible triggers. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If a parent or sibling has ever had lupus or another autoimmune disorder, you should bring that information with you as well. Patient and family history are very important for diagnosing lupus."

      "title": "Prepare for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test.",
      "content": "Prepare for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. ANA is an antibody that attacks proteins in the body, and these ANA are present in most people with an active form of lupus. This is often used as an initial screening test; however, not everyone with a positive ANA test has lupus. Further tests are needed to confirm the presence of lupus. [11] X Research source For example, a positive ANA test can also indicate scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome, and other autoimmune diseases."

      "title": "Get a complete blood count.",
      "content": "Get a complete blood count. This blood test measures the amount of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin in your blood. Certain abnormalities can be another possible sign of lupus. For example, this test can reveal anemia, which is a common symptom of lupus. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Note that this test does not diagnose lupus by itself. Many other conditions can also cause similar abnormalities."

      "title": "Expect blood tests for inflammation.",
      "content": "Expect blood tests for inflammation. Your doctor may do several tests that confirm an inflammatory condition, though they will not definitively prove you have lupus. One such test measures your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). This test measures how fast it takes red blood cells to settle at the bottom of a test tube in one hour. A fast rate can indicate lupus. A fast rate can also be symptomatic of other inflammatory conditions, cancers, and infections, so it is not an absolute test, either. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Another test that is non-specific for lupus but can test for inflammation is a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. This liver protein can indicate the presence of inflammation, but there are many other conditions that can cause this protein to show up."

      "title": "Find out about other blood tests.",
      "content": "Find out about other blood tests. Since no blood test is exclusive to lupus, doctors usually perform a range of blood tests to narrow down the diagnosis. Symptoms usually must match at least four out of the main eleven symptoms that doctors look for. Other possible tests your doctor might use include: [14] X Research source A blood test measuring your erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This test measures how fast it takes red blood cells to settle at the bottom of a test tube in one hour. A fast rate can indicate lupus. A fast rate can also be symptomatic of other inflammatory conditions, cancers, and infections, so it is not an absolute test, either. [15] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source An antibodies to phospholipids (APL ) test. An APL test looks for antibodies that attack phospholipids, and they tend to be present in 30 percent of patients with lupus. An antibodies to Sm test. This antibody attacks the Sm protein in the cell nucleus, and it is present in about 30 to 40 percent of lupus patients. Moreover, it rarely shows up in people without lupus, so a positive result almost always guarantees a lupus diagnosis. An anti-dsDNA test. Anti-dsDNA is a protein that attacks double-stranded DNA. Roughly 50 percent of lupus patients have this protein in their blood. It is very rare in people without lupus, so a positive result almost always results in a lupus diagnosis. Anti-Ro (SS-A) and Anti-La (SS-B) tests. These antibodies attack the RNA proteins in your blood. It is more common in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, however."

      "content": "Ask about imaging tests. Your doctor might order an imaging test if they think that you have a form of lupus that affects your lungs or heart. A traditional chest x-ray might be ordered to look at your lungs. An echocardiogram will look at your heart. [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A chest x-ray can reveal shadows in your lungs, which could indicate areas of fluid or inflammation. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to measure the beating of your heart and to detect possible problems in the heart."

      "content": "Inquire about a biopsy. If your doctor suspects that lupus has damaged your kidneys, they may do a kidney biopsy. The goal of this biopsy is to obtain a sample of kidney tissue. They will assess the condition of your kidneys based on how much damage has occurred, and what kind of damage it is. Doctors can use this biopsy to determine the best treatment for lupus.

      "content": "Learn what lupus is. Lupus is an autoimmune disease, which means that it causes the immune system to attack healthy parts of your body. Again, it mostly affects the organs, such as the brain, skin, kidneys, and joints. [19] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The disease is also chronic, which means it lasts for the long-term. It causes the body to become inflamed as the immune system attacks healthy tissue.

      "content": "Understand the three primary types of lupus. When people refer to lupus, they usually refer to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This type of lupus affects your skin and your organs, especially your kidneys, lungs, and heart. There are other types of lupus, including cutaneous lupus erythematosus and drug-induced lupus. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus only affects the skin and does not threaten the other organs of your body. It rarely develops into SLE. Drug-induced lupus can affect the skin and your interior organs, but it is induced by the use of specific medications. It usually goes away once those medications are out of the patient's system. The symptoms associated with this form of lupus are typically rather mild."

      "title": "Identify the causes.",
      "content": "Identify the causes. Although it has been difficult for doctors to understand lupus, over time they have identified its characteristics. Lupus appears to be triggered by a combination of your genes and your environment. In other words, if you have a genetic predisposition for lupus, environmental factors can trigger it. [21] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Common lupus triggers include medications, infections, or contact with sunlight. Lupus might be triggered by sulfa drugs, drugs that make you more sensitive to sunlight, penicillin, or antibiotics. [22] X Research source Physical conditions that can trigger lupus include infections, the common cold, a virus, being exhausted, getting an injury, or emotional duress. It is the ultraviolet rays from sun that can trigger lupus. Ultraviolet rays from fluorescent light bulbs can do the same thing."
