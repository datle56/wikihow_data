      "title": "Set the brakes.",
      "content": "Set the brakes. Use your foot to push down on the lever near the rear wheels. While the lever is in its lowest position, it should prevent the wheels from moving."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lock the front wheels.",
      "content": "Lock the front wheels. On some stroller models, the front wheels may also have a locking mechanism to prevent them from swiveling. First, push the stroller a few paces forward to put the wheels in the forward position. Then, look for a small lever between the front wheels. If present, it may need to be pushed up or down, depending on the model, to lock the wheels in position."
    },

      "title": "Collapse the canopy.",
      "content": "Collapse the canopy. Tug gently on the canopy, if opened, to pull it back into folded position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recline the seat backward.",
      "content": "Recline the seat backward. Push the seat backward to recline it as far as it will go. On some models, you may need to undo latches on the side of the seat before this is possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a low handle.",
      "content": "Look for a low handle. Check the right and left sides of the stroller for a small handle, somewhere near the seat base or wheels. Some models simply fold when this handle is tugged in a particular direction, while others require a button in the center of the handle to be pushed and held down as you fold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the stroller together.",
      "content": "Fold the stroller together. You should now be able to fold the stroller together simply by pushing the back and seat together. Grip the lower handle if there is one. If necessary, tug the lower frame near the wheels to start the folding, then withdraw your hand from that area to avoid pinching your fingers in the folding frame. Finish pushing from the top handle and the seat base."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use this method for one-hand-fold or FastAction strollers.",
      "content": "Use this method for one-hand-fold or FastAction strollers. Graco makes many different models of strollers, but they usually advertise their most easily collapsed strollers by referring to \"one-hand-fold\" or \"FastAction\" features. If you know your stroller's model number, look it up online to see if these features are mentioned. If you do not know the model number, you should be able to see whether this method works with no more than a minute or two of effort."

      "title": "Remove the car seat for strollers without a built in seat.",
      "content": "Remove the car seat for strollers without a built in seat. Graco SnugRider stroller frames are made for use with car seats, and do not have seats of their own. Unstrap the car seat from the frame and remove it before attempting to fold the stroller frame."
    },
    {
      "title": "Collapse the canopy.",
      "content": "Collapse the canopy. The canopy over the seat, if present, should easily collapse back against the upper handles when you tug the front end backward."

    {
      "title": "Tug a strap at the hinge of the seat.",
      "content": "Tug a strap at the hinge of the seat. Graco strollers with the one-hand-fold feature fold so the seat surfaces end up on the outside of the folded stroller. These models typically have a strap beneath where a child would sit, which can be tugged to fold the stroller. Strollers that fold outward may not lock the tray into position while they do so. Remove the tray first to avoid it falling onto the ground and getting scratched or dirty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use slightly more force for old strollers.",
      "content": "Use slightly more force for old strollers. If the stroller has become rusty or dirty, it may take more force to fold. Attempt to tug it again, with slightly more force, but do not exert yourself too much or brace yourself against another surface for more force. If these methods do not work relatively easily, try the instructions for folding older models."
