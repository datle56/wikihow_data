      "title": "Choose the right dye color for your roots.",
      "content": "Choose the right dye color for your roots. Pick a dye that’s close to your current hair color. A dye 2 to 3 shades lighter or darker than your current color will look best. When choosing between 2 shades, stick with the lighter color, which can be easier to correct if needed. For example, if your hair is a dark brown, then stick with a shade that is a similar color dark brown."

      "content": "Use a permanent dye for lasting coverage. A semi-permanent or demi-permanent dye will wash out slowly over time, and these types of dyes won’t completely cover your grey hairs. Instead, semi- and demi-permanent dyes help the grey hairs to blend in. They can also leave a yellow tint on grey hair as the color fades. It’s best to use a permanent dye to cover your roots. If you do end up with a yellow tint to your grey hairs, use a purple shampoo to help remove it."

      "content": "Mix the dye with developer according to the instructions in your kit. Mix the hair dye and developer together in a small disposable bowl. An applicator brush can help you apply dye to your roots more precisely than the bottle included in your kit. Use disposable gloves when handling your dye. If you only have a few small areas with grey hairs, then you can use a clean toothbrush or mascara wand to apply the dye. If you’re applying dye near your temples or forehead, coat your hairline, ears and neck with petroleum jelly before applying the dye. It will protect your skin from dye stains."

      "content": "Follow your dye kit’s instructions for setting and rinsing your hair. Put on a plastic shower cap to prevent the dye from dripping or staining anything while you wait. You’ll need to leave the dye in your hair for about 20 to 30 minutes. After that, you’ll rinse out your hair with warm water. Dye kits usually come with conditioner that you’ll apply after rinsing. Make sure to rinse out the conditioner with cool water to seal the hair cuticle. If you have leftover dye, dispose of it according to the kit’s instructions. The chemicals break down over time and might affect your hair differently."

      "content": "Redo your highlights if you can’t touch up your roots. If it’s been too long between color appointments, your roots may have grown out too long for just a touch up. If you’ve already highlighted your hair using a dye kit at home, you can redo them yourself using a kit, or go to a salon professional to have them redone.
