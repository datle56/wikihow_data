      "title": "Get into a strong, athletic stance.",
      "content": "Get into a strong, athletic stance. Step your lead foot (the foot you are most comfortable having in front) roughly 6-8\" in front of you. Your back foot is slightly behind you, toe to your side. Slightly bend both knees, with your weight evenly distributed over your hips. Keep your shoulders loose and relaxed, roughly over your knees. Your feet are slightly greater than shoulder-width apart. [1] X Research source Rest your chin on your chest and look forward through your eyebrows. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep your spine straight up.",
      "content": "Keep your spine straight up. Your back should not be bent forward or backwards, but directly upwards. Your weight will be well distributed so that your nose never leans past your front knee. Many beginners will sink the front knee too much, causing them to bend and lean forward. Keep yourself upright."

    {
      "title": "Stay on the balls of your feet, equally distributing your weight to both.",
      "content": "Stay on the balls of your feet, equally distributing your weight to both. This is what people mean when they say \"always be on your toes.\" You can move much quicker from the balls of your feet, the small knobs right before your toes begin. Your back heel, in particular, should never touch the ground. [3] X Research source If you were to draw a line from you straight in front of you, your front foot would be at a 45-degree angle. Your back foot should be almost 90-degrees. [4] X Research source With every movement, always land and push off starting from the balls of your feet."

    {
      "title": "Step forward your lead foot and slide the back foot up to move forward.",
      "content": "Step forward your lead foot and slide the back foot up to move forward. Push off your back foot and step forward with the lead foot. As you do, slide your back foot along so that you return to your athletic stance. Neither foot should ever come very far off the ground. Keeping one foot on the mat at all times allows you to spring, counterattack, and pivot quickly in a fight. Reverse this motion to move backwards -- stepping with the back foot and sliding the lead foot backwards to follow."
    },
    {
      "title": "Step and slide when moving laterally (left or right).",
      "content": "Step and slide when moving laterally (left or right). If you're going left, step with the left foot while sliding the right to follow. You want a big, explosive push off your first step. Think of the second foot as gliding, not stepping. Just reverse it to go the opposite direction. If you're an orthodox boxer (right-handed, left-foot forward), your back foot moves first when going to the right. Focus on keeping your spine straight while moving. Don't lean wildly or take yourself off balance -- your opponent will capitalize on your loss of balance in a fight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your upper body relaxed while moving.",
      "content": "Keep your upper body relaxed while moving. Tensing up will make it harder to pivot, turn, or move smoothly. Keep your shoulders loose and your hands free by your sides. Just focus on not tensing and contracting your muscles. Instead, try to feel smooth and fluid as you move -- you'll feel the difference in your legs as well. [5] X Research source You don't have to drop your hands to relax your upper body. Let your arms sway a bit, as if you were walking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Never cross your feet.",
      "content": "Never cross your feet. There is an imaginary line between your right and left foot that should not be bent or crossed. Crossing your feet takes your off balance and makes it hard to change directions -- making you an easy target for opponents. Keep this invisible line between your feet solid to keep your footwork solid."

    {
      "title": "Practice short, explosive steps to stay just at the edge of you opponent's range.",
      "content": "Practice short, explosive steps to stay just at the edge of you opponent's range. Range is the distance where you can land a punch on the opponent. Footwork is how you position yourself to attack, prepare to dodge and evade, and dictate the speed of the fight. The best way to do this is to \"move in and out.\" Dance at the edge of your range so that you only need a small step in to attack and small step out to dodge. Short, quick steps are the hallmark of the best fighter's footwork. The movement should move you no more than 6-8 centimeters. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn to pivot efficiently.",
      "content": "Learn to pivot efficiently. A pivot changes your direction on a dime, throwing off your opponent's line of attack and opening up new ones for you. It is a small but absolutely indispensable skill to practice regularly. Work on keeping your weight over both feet and your hands up in front of you. It seems simple -- but the best boxers can pivot fluidly and almost instantly: Push off your back foot. Use the momentum to swivel your front toe 45 degrees to either side, changing your direction. Quickly slide your back foot so that it is behind your front heel. Once you get good at a basic pivot, work on taking a small step, then pivoting as the foot lands. Make sure you get back to your stance quickly."

    {
      "title": "Practice stepping diagonally, following the line of your lead foot.",
      "content": "Practice stepping diagonally, following the line of your lead foot. Moving diagonally will dramatically increase your ability in the ring. But that is only if you do it well. The basics of footwork become twice as important: keep your spine straight, your movements short, and, most importantly, don't cross your feet. For an orthodox boxer (left foot forward), moving diagonally Northwest (forward and left) or Southeast (back and right) is easy: Moving forward and to the left: Push off your back foot with a sharp, explosive step forward and sideways. Move along the angle of your feet, as if your insteps pointed the correct direction for you. Step your front foot forward 2-3\" to the front and 2-3\" to the left. Glide your back foot into place, taking care not to lean forward. Moving backwards and to the right: Push off the front foot with a sharp step. Step your back foot 2-3\" to the back and right of your body. Quickly glide your back foot forward and sideways to return to your stance. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice moving diagonally away from your front foot to get full mobility in the ring.",
      "content": "Practice moving diagonally away from your front foot to get full mobility in the ring. This is also a great technique to get an attacking lane open, as a righty can move diagonally back to expose the center of their opponent's body. However, moving off of your lead foot without crossing your feet isn't easy. Remember to keep the motions short and quick. For a right-handed boxer, whose left foot is forward: Moving forward and to the right: Push off your back foot, aiming it forward and to the left. Use your front foot like a brake, pushing off it to counteract the push from the back foot and move you diagonally. Step forward and to the right, almost like you were hopping. Glide the back foot into place. Moving backwards and to the left: Push off of your front foot as if you were trying to step directly backwards Use your back foot almost like a brake, pivoting on it to move diagonally backwards. Step backwards and to the left with the back foot, only moving a few inches. It is easiest to move back and left as opposed to perfectly diagonal. Glide your front foot back into position.

      "content": "Jump rope every day to build agility and foot speed. This classic boxing workout is a classic for a reason. Jump rope is great for explosive, quick-moving feet that can pivot on a dime and step and slide for days. Try to get 100 jumps or more in every single training session. As you get better, practice one-footed, double-time, and hopping over the rope."

      "title": "Try ladder drills to get faster feet.",
      "content": "Try ladder drills to get faster feet. A simple workout ladder is all you need. Work on moving through it quickly, touching only the balls of your feet to the ground. To get the most out of an exercise ladder, you should stick to patterns, moving your feet through with different techniques each run-through. Try: Touching both feet in every space. Touching only one foot in every space. Touching each foot twice in every space. Side-stepping through the ladder. Moving up two spaces, back one, up two, back one, etc."

      "title": "Use box jumps and plyometrics to build leg strength and power.",
      "content": "Use box jumps and plyometrics to build leg strength and power. A big, explosive step comes from big, explosive legs. Get a box that is roughly shin or knee height. Keep your shoulders over your knees and spine straight. Bend down from the knees and leap with both legs onto the box. Then jump off. Repeat 10-12 times, for three sets. As you get better, you can add variety to get even stronger: Make the box higher \"March\" up the box, stepping up and down with each foot. Work on single-leg jumps."

      "content": "Shadowbox to get used to fast footwork in the ring. Shadowboxing is when you mime a real fight, at speed, by yourself. It is an incredible workout, but only if you do it well. Focus on perfect technique, especially as your get tired. You will fight how you practice, so use this time to get perfect footwork before your opponent even steps in the ring."

      "title": "Add footwork to your speed drills and bag workouts.",
      "content": "Add footwork to your speed drills and bag workouts. There is no reason to sit flat-footed while hitting the bag or practicing punches. No matter what skill you're training, incorporate footwork into the mix. Throw three punches against the heavy bag, then move in and out before throwing three more. Pivot every 30 seconds on the speed bag and switch arms. The more you can bring footwork into your other skill training, the better boxer you'll be."

      "title": "Watch other boxer's purely for their footwork.",
      "content": "Watch other boxer's purely for their footwork. When you put on a match, ask yourself who has the better footwork? Who moves smoothly across the ring and who seems to lumber? How do great boxers move their feet to react on offense vs defense? Watching another boxer's footwork, paying attention exclusively below the knees, is a great way to see how important movement is in a fight.
