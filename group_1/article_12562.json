      "content": "Come up with a realistic timeline for achieving your goals. The timeline for your fitness training plan depends on what your specific goals are. Establishing a timeline can make it easier to schedule your workouts and stick to your plan. Make sure to set short-term and medium-term goals to help keep you motivated while you work towards your long-term goals. For example, you might set the goal of running a 1 K race or running 3 out of 7 days of the week. For example, if your goal is to lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg), your timeline could be 2 months. Since you can lose 1–2 pounds (0.45–0.91 kg) per week at a healthy pace, 2 months is a realistic timeline. If you're trying to gain muscle mass, you could set a goal of gaining 1–2 pounds (0.45–0.91 kg) of muscle mass per month, which is a realistic goal. If your fitness goals are more long-term, like improving your endurance so you can go hiking more, try to break them up into smaller increments. For example, you could say that after 3 months you want to do a 1 mile (1.6 km) hike, and after 6 months you want to do a 3 mile (4.8 km) hike."
