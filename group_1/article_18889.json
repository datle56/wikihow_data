      "content": "Double-cleanse your face with oil- and water-based cleansers. Double-cleansing is washing your face in two steps instead of one. In the first step, use an oil-based cleanser to lift makeup, sebum, dirt, and pollution from your skin. Then, wash your face with a water-based foaming cleanser to remove whatever you lifted in the first step. [1] X Research source Choose a cleansing oil, balm, or cream for your first cleanse. Micellar water is also a good choice. For the second cleanse, look for creamy, water-based cleansers with a low pH and the word “gentle” on the packaging for your second cleanse. Repeat this entire routine in the morning and at night (except for sunscreen and exfoliation). Board-certified dermatologist Paul Friedman recommends washing your face twice a day to help remove the debris and the oil that accumulates on your skin throughout the day."

      "content": "Use a gentle chemical exfoliator no more than once daily. Exfoliate your face to remove dead skin and even out your skin’s texture. It also helps the rest of your skincare products sink into your skin. A chemical exfoliator with retinoids, glycolic acid, or lactic acid is generally gentler on your skin than a physical exfoliator like a cleansing brush or sugar scrub. Depending on how sensitive your skin is, exfoliating once a day may be too irritating. If you notice redness and irritation, only exfoliate every other day. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Board-certified dermatologist and dermatopathologist Margareth Pierre-Louis mentions how she “favors the retinoids because you have a little bit more control over them, meaning that they won't cause any mechanical injury to the skin.” Friedman says one of the most common mistakes people make when exfoliating is being too aggressive and using products that are too harsh on their skin, which leads to dryness and irritation. Pierre-Louis cautions against using both a chemical and mechanical exfoliator daily because it can dry out your skin."

      "content": "Layer hydrating toner and essence to plump your skin. Soak a cotton pad with a hydrating toner and sweep it across your face to remove any leftover oil or dirt. Allow the toner to dry on your skin for a few seconds. Then, splash a few drops of essence onto your hands or a cotton pad and gently pat it onto your face. [3] X Research source Hydrating Toner: These toners typically include ingredients like aloe vera, hyaluronic acid, and glycerin to help rehydrate the skin. It also helps your skin better absorb the products you use after it. Essence: This lightweight hydrating product comes from Korean skincare routines. It typically features active ingredients that improve your skin’s overall health. However, its main job is to moisturize. [4] X Research source A traditional Korean glass skin routine requires both an essence and a toner layered over each other. However, you might find that your skin doesn’t need so much hydration and you can choose between these two products."

      "content": "Add a serum to address any skin concerns. As board-certified cosmetic dermatologist Kaveri Karhade explains, “serums contain a large variety of ingredients which are beneficial for various reasons. For example, a vitamin C serum may be beneficial as an antioxidant, and a niacinamide serum may be beneficial to hydrate acne-prone skin.” Follow the toner and essence with a hydrating serum to add even more moisture to your skin. Apply 2-3 drops of serum to your fingertips or directly to your face. Pat or gently swipe the serum onto your face until completely absorbed. Then, allow it to dry before moving on to the next step. [5] X Research source Serums are lightweight moisturizers with a consistency like a thin gel that often include a high concentration of a few active ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, or vitamin C. [6] X Research source Because it has a lighter formula, it sinks deeper into your skin. These actives target a specific skin care issue, like wrinkles, dark spots, or dullness. When layering products, avoid combining retinoids with vitamin C or AHAs and BHAs, or they may irritate your skin. [7] X Research source Avoid mixing AHAs and BHAs with niacinamide, which makes them less effective and can cause irritation."

      "content": "Seal in moisture with a face oil or moisturizer. “I would put some type of hydration on my face [every day] just to help replenish it,” says Pierre-Louis. Apply quarter-sized amount of moisturizer or a few drops of face oil to lock in the active ingredients from the previous steps. [8] X Research source Don’t forget to apply moisturizer to your hairline, neck, and chest. Choose a moisturizer based on your skin type. Generally, thicker, cream-based moisturizers are better for dry skin, lotions are great for combination skin, and gel formulas work best for oily skin."

Protect your facial skin from harmful UV rays with a nickel-sized amount of broad-spectrum sunscreen with 30 SPF or more. “Sunscreen will protect you from skin cancer. However, sunscreen also helps prevent fine lines, wrinkles, and brown spots. If you have a darker skin type, you will have a more even tone as you age if, again, you keep the tanning effects of the sun off of your skin. So wear sunscreen daily,” says Pierre-Louis. Dab the sunscreen on your skin and gently rub it in with circular motions. Make sure to apply sunscreen to all of your skin that isn’t covered by clothing, including your ears, neck, and chest. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours if you’re out in the sun. If you go swimming, sweat heavily, or towel off, apply sunscreen more frequently than 2 hours. [10] X Research source"
