      "title": "The bleeding won’t stop.",
      "content": "The bleeding won’t stop. Try to stop the bleeding as well as you can. Elevate the injured body part above the level of the heart, as this can help to diminish bleeding. Use a clean cloth or slightly damp paper towel, and apply firm pressure to the open wound for about 5 minutes. Then, remove the cloth or paper towel to check if it's still bleeding. If the bleeding is significant, do not proceed to any other steps and go to the hospital immediately. If the bleeding is uncontrollable or blood is gushing from the wound, call emergency services immediately, as this can be life threatening."

      "title": "An object is lodged in the area of the wound.",
      "content": "An object is lodged in the area of the wound. If foreign material is present in the injury, see a doctor immediately. An object in the wound could put you at risk of infection or further injury, and a medical professional is needed to assess the situation and the possibility of needing stitches. Do not try to remove the object. Sometimes, the object helps to stop the wound from bleeding excessively."

      "title": "The cut has been caused by a human or animal bite.",
      "content": "The cut has been caused by a human or animal bite. Cuts caused by an animal or human pose a higher risk of infection. You may need to be vaccinated for prevention and receive antibiotics, so regardless of whether stitches are needed, seek professional medical help."

      "title": "The injury is on the face, hands, or genitals.",
      "content": "The injury is on the face, hands, or genitals. If the cut is on the face, the hands, the mouth, or the genitals, it is important to be seen by a doctor, as you may need stitching for cosmetic reasons and proper healing."

      "title": "You’re due for a tetanus shot.",
      "content": "You’re due for a tetanus shot. If you have an open wound and it's been over 10 years since you've had a tetanus shot, go to the hospital. Tetanus shots last no longer than 10 years, and you'll have to be re-vaccinated.

      "title": "Understand why stitches are used.",
      "content": "Understand why stitches are used. Stitches have a multitude of uses. The most common reasons to get stitches are: [2] X Research source To close a wound that is too big to be closed otherwise. Using stitches to bring the edges of the wound together can help to speed up healing. To prevent infection. If you have a large, gaping wound, closing it with stitches can help minimize the risk of infection. Skin that is broken open, especially large, gaping wounds, is a prime target for infection. To prevent or reduce scarring after your wound heals. This is especially important when the cut is on areas of the body that are more cosmetically important, such as the face."

      "title": "Consider the depth of the wound.",
      "content": "Consider the depth of the wound. If the cut is greater than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) deep, the wound may be eligible for stitching. If it's deep enough that you can see yellow fatty tissue or even bone, see a doctor for treatment. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Evaluate the width of the wound.",
      "content": "Evaluate the width of the wound. Are the edges of the wound close together, or do they need to be pulled together to cover the exposed tissue? If the edges of the wound need to be pulled together to cover a gap of exposed tissue, stitches may be required. [4] X Research source By pulling the edges of the wound close enough to where they can touch, stitches can help to speed healing."

    {
      "title": "Look at the location of the wound.",
      "content": "Look at the location of the wound. If the open wound is located on a specific area of the body with a lot of movement involved, it will likely need stitching to prevent re-opening. For example, an open wound on the knee joint or fingers (especially where joints connect) would be eligible for stitches, whereas an open wound on the thigh may not need stitching.
