      "content": "Disguise your voice with background noise. Play music just loud enough so that your voice can be heard over it. You can use other recorded sounds as well, including traffic noise, white noise and static, or even the sounds of heavy machinery. Another person can help you by making humming noises or other sounds while you are speaking that have the same effect as recorded sounds. Put a handkerchief or other piece of cloth over the phoneâ€™s voice input area and move it around to create a static effect. Try using different materials for a different effect."

Instead of saying \"library\" say \"liber'ry.\" Instead of saying \"whatever\" say \"whatevrr.\" Add extra syllables where they don't belong. Instead of saying \"where\" say \"whey-uhr.\" Change up the vowels in words. Instead of saying \"there\" say \"thur.\" Speak with an accent if you know how to pull one off convincingly.

[8] X Research source While your voice may sound basically the same, if you're using words you wouldn't normally use, it can be an effective disguise as well. Try out the following tips for picking words you don't normally use: Use very smart-sounding or expensive words. Don't say something is \"good\" say that it's \"spectacular\" or \"stupendous.\" Don't say that \"Yeah\" say \"That is affirmative.\" Use old words, or words that you've only heard your grandparents use. Don't call something \"cool\" but call it \"keen\" or \"dandy\" or \"groovy.\" Use lots of shortened words or slang words or use lots of text-speak. Any new youth phrases would be great.
