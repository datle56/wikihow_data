These parts, or factors, multiply with each other to equal the original number. [1] X Research source For example, to factor the number 18, break it into 1 x 18, or into 2 x 9, or into 3 x 6."

The goal of prime factorization is to keep breaking a number down until there are only primes left. This is especially useful when handling fractions, making them easier to compare and use in equations. [2] X Research source"

You can use any two you can think of, but a prime number will make your work easier. One good strategy is to try dividing the number by 2, then 3, then 5, working your way up through the prime numbers until you find one that divides evenly. [4] X Research source Example: If you don't know any factors of 24, try dividing it by small prime numbers. Let's divide by 2 to get 24 = 2 x 12 . We're not done yet, but this is a good start. Since 2 is prime, this is an easy way to start when factoring any even number."

It should equal the original number. Example: The final line of our factor tree has nothing but 2s and 3s. These are both primes, so we're finished. We can write the prime factorization of 24 as 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 . The order of the factors does not matter. 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 is also a correct answer."

The prime factorization of 36 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3. Find a number that appears on both prime factorizations. Cross it out once on each list and write it on a new line. For example, 2 is on both lists, so we write 2 on a new line. We're left with 30 = 2 x 3 x 5 and 36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3. Repeat until there are no more factors in common. There's also a 3 on both lists, so write it on your new line to make 2 and 3 . Compare 30 = 2 x 3 x 5 and 36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3. There are no more numbers left in common. To find the GCF, multiply all the shared factors together. We just have 2 and 3 in our example, so the GCF is 2 x 3 = 6 . This is the largest number that is both a factor of 30, and a factor of 36."

For example, the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, because it has both 2 and 3 as factors. Here's an example of finding LCM from prime factorization: [10] X Research source Start with two prime factorizations. For example, the prime factorization of 126 is 2 x 3 x 3 x 7. The prime factorization of 84 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 7. For each unique factor, compare the number of times it appears in each list. Pick a list where it appears the greatest number of times, and circle each instance. For example, 2 appears once in the factors of 126, but twice in the list for 84. Circle the 2 x 2 in the second list. Repeat for each unique factor. For example, 3 appears most often in the first list, so circle the 3 x 3 there. 7 only appears once on each list, so circle a single 7 . (It doesn't matter which list you choose when there's a tie.) Multiply all of your circled numbers together to find the LCM. In our example, the least common multiple of 126 and 84 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 7 = 252 . This is the smallest number that has both 126 and 84 as factors."

Multiply each fraction so that the new denominator is the LCM. Once both fractions are in this form, you can add them together. For example, we want to solve 1 / 6 + 4 / 21 . Using the method above, we can find the LCM of 6 and 21. The answer is 42. Turn 1 / 6 into a fraction with 42 as the denominator. To do this, solve 42 รท 6 = 7. Multiply 1 / 6 x 7 / 7 = 7 / 42 . To turn 4 / 21 into a fraction with 42 as the denominator, solve 42 รท 21 = 2. Multiply 4 / 21 x 2 / 2 = 8 / 42 . Now that we have the fractions in forms with the same denominator, we can add them together easily: 7 / 42 + 8 / 42 = 15 / 42 ."
