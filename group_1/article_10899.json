    {
      "title": "Box",
      "content": "Box Check out the box of your Creed Aventus to determine the authenticity. Real Creed Aventus boxes are all black, while fakes often feature white edges or insides. Real Creed Aventus boxes don’t come with plastic wrapping or sleeves, either, so if you’re currently unwrapping the plastic on your Creed Aventus box, get ready to start the return process . [1] X Research source Signs It’s Real: It’s all black, inside and out. Signs It’s Fake: It comes in a plastic wrap or with a sleeve and isn’t all black."

    {
      "title": "Creed Cards",
      "content": "Creed Cards Check the lettering and images on the Creed Cards. On authentic Creed cards, the images are clear and defined, the lettering is easy to read, and the card is vibrant with a strong white background. On fake Creed cards, the images tend to be blurry and poorly colored, the background is dull, and the lettering isn’t as pristine. [2] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Clear images, vibrant colors, and lettering that’s easy to read. Signs It’s Fake: Blurry images, dull colors, and lettering that’s harder to read."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bottle",
      "content": "Bottle Take a look at the lettering on the bottle. Fake Creed Aventus bottles have thinner, more spaced-out lettering with a dull, blurry black color, while real ones have bold, evenly-spaced lettering with a smooth black finish. The grooves on the bottle are also another authenticity giveaway. On real bottles, the grooves are wavy and extend from the front to the back. On fake bottles, the grooves are typically straight all around. [3] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Evenly-spaced, bold, black lettering. Wavy grooves. Signs It’s Fake: Oddly-spaced, thin, blurry lettering. Straight grooves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Made in France",
      "content": "Made in France Check the bottom of your bottle for lettering that reads “Creed” “Paris” and “Made In France” in that order. If it’s there and etched into the glass, you’ve got an authentic bottle of Creed Aventus on your hands. But, if the lettering is missing, the words aren’t in the correct order, it looks printed onto the glass instead of etched in, you likely have a fake on your hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Batch Code",
      "content": "Batch Code On authentic Creed Aventus bottles, the batch code matches the one that’s listed on the box. They are located at the bottom of the bottle (and the box). While older bottles of authentic Creed Aventus have stamped batch codes, new ones have laser-engraved batch codes. When it comes to fakes, the batch codes are incorrectly formatted and tend to be located on different areas of the bottle. [4] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Batch code that starts with F or A and is placed on the bottom of the bottle and box. Signs It’s Fake: Inaccurate batch code that’s stamped anywhere but the bottom. On Creed fragrances made after 2022, the batch code starts with F. The batch code on Creed Aventus perfumes made before 2022 starts with A, which denotes the Aventus fragrance."

    {
      "title": "Bottle Cap",
      "content": "Bottle Cap With real bottles of Creed Aventus, the bottle cap snaps into place and has a smooth top, making for a secure closure. On fake bottles, the top tends to be crooked and the cap does not snap into place. Instead, it just sits and seals, making for a risky closure that isn’t as secure as the authentic model. Fake bottle caps also tend to be lighter and less solid than authentic ones. [5] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Solid, durable cap that snaps onto the bottle. Signs It’s Fake: Light cap that sits on the bottle."

    {
      "title": "Atomizer",
      "content": "Atomizer Atomizers on real Creed Aventus bottles have a white plastic outer ring underneath the cap. However, fake Creed Aventus bottles have a metal outer ring underneath the cap. So if you’ve got a white outer ring in your atomizer, you don’t have to worry. But if you pop the hood and see a metal outer ring, you may want to look into the seller’s return process . [6] X Research source Signs It’s Real: White, plastic outer ring underneath the cap. Signs It’s Fake: Metal outer ring underneath the cap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip Tube",
      "content": "Dip Tube The dip tube is the straw-like stem that’s attached to the atomizer. In authentic bottles of Creed Aventus, this tube has a steel ball located towards its top. In fake bottles, the steel ball tends to be missing, making for a clear marker of inauthenticity. Signs It’s Real: Steel ball towards the top. Signs It’s Fake: No steel ball at all."

    {
      "title": "Smell",
      "content": "Smell The smell is one of the biggest giveaways when it comes to determining whether or not a Creed Aventus perfume is real or not. Real Creed Aventus has a woody, smoky pineapple smell with hints of birch. It lasts long and is pleasant on the nose. However, fake Creed Aventus has an alcoholic smell with hints of a watered-down pineapple dry-down, making for a distinct difference for Creed Aventus connoisseurs. [7] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Smoky, woody, pineapple smell with hints of birch. Signs It’s Fake: Alcoholic smell with a weak pineapple aroma."

      "content": "Buy from a reputable seller. When you’re looking to buy Creed Aventus, make sure you’re buying from a seller who’s known for selling authentic products. It’s best to buy from the Creed Boutique, but if you’d prefer to go with another option, try somewhere that’s known for selling luxury colognes, like Nordstrom or Macy’s. That way, you don’t risk the chance of getting your hands on a fake product. [11] X Research source Be careful buying from places like Walmart, as some shoppers have reported that their Creed Aventus perfume turned out to be fake. Costco is also a good option for buying Creed Aventus. They even occasionally have sales on the fragrance!"

Look for lots of 4 and 5-star reviews that are well-written. If you spot a seller who’s got a handful of 4 and 5-star reviews and a lot of 1 or 2-star reviews, be cautious and check what people had to say, as they may be selling fake products. If they don’t have any photos of the Creed Aventus bottle or aren’t willing to send any, they may be trying to get you to buy a fake."

But this isn’t always the easiest to spot if you’re not a Creed enthusiast. So, to avoid buying a fake, compare the bottle of Creed Aventus you’re looking at to one on Creed’s website. The prices range depending on size, so take that into account, as well. The prices are as follows: [12] X Research source 50 mL: $365.00 100 mL: $495.00 240 mL: $775.00 500 mL: $1,260.00 1000 mL: $1,850.00"

The smell will weaken and it won’t last as long. The duration of Creed Aventus depends on various storage factors. To maintain longevity, keep it away from heat and UV light, as those are the most damaging elements to perfume. [13] X Research source ."

But, some sellers sell replicas and fragrances that are inspired by Creed Aventus. So, keep a watchful eye and make sure the product you’re adding to your cart is sold by Creed. If you’re unsure, click their seller profile to double-check. If you do decide that you’d like to go with a replica, check the reviews to see if it’s similar to the real thing."

Whether it’s the lettering or grooves on the bottle or the stark difference in smells, real Creed Aventus is always crafted better than the fakes. The bottle cap always snaps on, the lettering is evenly spaced, and most importantly, the smell is a woody pineapple aroma that features hints of birch. If you get your hands on a fake, look into the seller’s return process and try to get your money back. To avoid buying fakes, always do your research on the seller. If the price looks too good to be true, it likely is."
