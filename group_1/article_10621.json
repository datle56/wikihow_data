      "title": "Cut several sheets of paper down to your preferred size.",
      "content": "Cut several sheets of paper down to your preferred size. Determine how large you want your diary to be so you know where to cut your paper. For a standard-size diary, cut the paper to about 8.5 x 5.5 inches (21.6 x 14 cm), using a ruler to ensure your lines are straight. To speed up the process, cut one piece, then stack the uncut sheets beneath it so you can cut them to size all at once. [1] X Research source The amount of sheets you need depends on how thick you want your diary to be. It’s a good idea to cut at least 20, as this will create 40 pages in your diary. If that isn’t enough, simply cut some more. If you don’t want to cut your paper, skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Fold the pages in half and glue them together.",
      "content": "Fold the pages in half and glue them together. Fold each piece of paper in half so they resemble the pages of a book. Stack them on top of each other and use clips to compress and hold them in place. Apply a thick layer of white or craft glue to the side of the pages that will attach to the spine of the diary, keeping the pages compressed so they stick to each other. Set them aside to dry. [2] X Research source Don’t worry if the glue spreads beneath or between the sheets of paper. The important thing is that there is a lot of glue on the spine so the sheets don’t become loose. After the glue is dry, it may help to cut another strip of paper to glue on top of the spine. Make sure it’s the same length as the pages and wide enough to secure to the pages on either side of the spine. This will help secure the pages and won’t be visible when the diary is finished."

      "title": "Cut your diary’s cover out of cardboard.",
      "content": "Cut your diary’s cover out of cardboard. Lay your pages on top of a piece of cardboard to determine your cover’s measurements. The front and back cover should be only slightly taller and wider than the sheets of paper, usually about 3/8 of an inch (1 cm). Cut them out with an X-acto knife , then, cut a third piece that’s slightly wider than the spine of the pages to form the spine of the cover. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Glue the cardboard pieces to fabric or paper.",
      "content": "Glue the cardboard pieces to fabric or paper. Choose any type of fabric or paper that you like and lay the cardboard pieces on top of it. Leave a small gap (about 3/8 of an inch or 1 cm) between the spine and either cover so it will fold properly. Apply an even layer of glue to the back of each piece and attach it to the cover material, making sure that each piece of cardboard stays in the correct position. Cut away the excess fabric or paper until a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin remains on each side. Fold the remaining over to the inside of your cover and glue it in place to secure it. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Glue your pages to the cover.",
      "content": "Glue your pages to the cover. Once everything has dried completely, place your pages inside the cover to make sure they fit properly. Then, apply another layer of glue to the spine of the pages and secure it to the spine of the cover. Glue the first page to the inside of the front cover and the last page to the inside of the back cover. Set your diary aside to dry. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut 20-25 pieces of paper to your preferred size.",
      "content": "Cut 20-25 pieces of paper to your preferred size. In general, a good size for diary pages is about 8.5 x 5.5 inches (21.6 x 14 cm), but choose whatever size you prefer. Use a ruler to mark your straight edges and cut the first piece of paper to size. Stack the rest of your sheets beneath it and use the first piece as a guide to cut the rest. [6] X Research source If you just want to fold your paper rather than cutting it first, skip this step. 20-25 pieces of paper make 40-50 diary pages. Adjust the number of sheets to your liking."

      "title": "Fold the sheets in half and glue or staple them together.",
      "content": "Fold the sheets in half and glue or staple them together. Fold each piece of paper in half and stack them on top of each other so they resemble the pages of a book. Use clips or clothespins to hold them in place. For a quick option, staple the pages together at the top, middle, and bottom of the spine side. For a more professional look, apply a thick layer of white or craft glue along the spine, keeping the pages compressed with the clips. Let the pages dry completely before continuing. [7] X Research source If you choose to staple the pages, your journal is technically complete if you don’t want to add a more durable cover. Simply decorate the first and last page to act as your cover and start writing. If you glued your pages, continue to the next step to make sure the pages stay together and that your diary doesn’t fall apart."

      "title": "Secure the pages to a paper or cardstock cover.",
      "content": "Secure the pages to a paper or cardstock cover. While standard white paper will work, a thicker paper like cardstock will create a more durable diary. Cut your cover material so it’s about 3/8 of an inch (1 cm) larger than the size you originally cut your pages to, then slip your pages inside to make sure they fit properly. Then, either glue or staple the spine of the pages to the center of the cover. [8] X Research source For extra security, glue the first page to the inside of the front cover and the last page to the inside of the back cover. Another option is to sew the pages to the cover. Open your diary to the centermost page and use a sturdy sewing needle to poke several holes through the spine of the pages and the cover. Then, sew the pages together with a basic stitch. [9] X Research source If you don’t have sewing experience, it will be easier to glue or staple the pages."

      "title": "Draw on the cover with markers and pens.",
      "content": "Draw on the cover with markers and pens. Your diary should reflect you, your personality, and your interests, so decorate it however you like. Draw doodles like stars or hearts, add your favorite quote, or draw something more elaborate. If you’re not sure what to draw, practice on another sheet of paper first to get an idea of what your design will look like. [10] X Research source For example, write “Shoot for the stars” in the center, then draw a bunch of little stars and planets on the cover. Take inspiration from journals you’d find in a store. There are usually a ton of cute designs to choose from. If you want something simple, write “Journal” or “Diary” in the center, or if you prefer to be discreet, leave the cover blank. If you’re feeling really artistic, try painting your cover, as well."

      "content": "Add stickers and washi tape. Stickers are another cute, unique way to decorate your diary. Pick some stickers up from your local craft store or get a pack of aesthetic stickers online. Arrange them however you want across the cover and feel free to add some to the corners of your pages, as well. Washi tape is also a great way to decorate the edges of your journal. [11] X Research source For example, if your favorite color is green, add a bunch of green stickers to your diary. Choose small stickers to add a bit of flourish to your cover, or go with larger stickers as the main decoration. If your journal is secured with staples, add a piece of washi tape or decorative duct tape to the spine to cover them."

      "content": "Write about your daily life. If you’re not sure what to write in your new diary, one of the easiest ways to start is to write about your day. Write down anything exciting that happened, anything that frustrated you, or just your daily events. Ask yourself questions like what you learned that day, what you wanted to accomplish, and how you felt. [14] X Research source For example, include any interesting conversations with friends, yummy meals you ate, or wacky dreams you had. It’s your journal—include whatever you want to talk about! It’s a good idea to write in pen, as pencil fades over time."

Sometimes just talking about the things that upset or anger you can help relieve stress. Writing about things that make you happy can also help improve your mood. [16] X Research source Don’t be afraid to confess your innermost feelings or secrets. If you’re worried someone might read your diary, find a good place to hide it ."

      "content": "Dedicate the journal to a particular hobby or interest. There are tons of ways to use a diary that don’t involve writing about yourself. Consider dedicating a journal to reviewing your favorite books or movies. Make a travel journal, keep track of all the concerts you’ve been to, or dedicate the pages to your fantasy football league . Include a little bit of everything if you want to! It’s entirely up to you. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a schedule and time limit.",
      "content": "Create a schedule and time limit. Remembering to write in your new diary can be tough, especially if you’ve never journaled regularly before. To help get in the habit, decide when and how often you want to write and stick to that schedule. For example, try writing two days a week, just before bed. If you’re worried about getting carried away, set a time limit for how long you write during each session, like 30 minutes to an hour. [18] X Research source If you don’t want to create a schedule, that’s okay, too! Some people prefer using their diary only when inspiration strikes. Others enjoy the routine of writing daily, even when nothing particularly interesting happened. It’s up to you! Don’t stress if you forget to write when you said you would. Forcing yourself to use your diary will only make it feel like a chore. Remember, this is supposed to be a fun hobby!"

      "content": "Pick a writing format. While each of your entries can be in a different format, it’s often a good idea to think about how you want to write before you start your diary. For example, do you prefer writing long, detailed paragraphs or do you jot down your thoughts with bullet points? Do you want your journal to be filled solely with writing or do you want to leave room for art? Try out different formats until you find what works best for you. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Date your entries.",
      "content": "Date your entries. Writing down the date of your entries can help you look back on your life and reflect on where you were at different points. This allows you to see how you (and your journal) have progressed over time. Even if you aren’t writing about your day or your emotions, dating your entries can show you what you were interested in at the time. [20] X Research source Of course, you don’t have to date your entries if you don’t want to. It’s your diary, after all, so only include the information you want."

      "content": "Make an introductory entry. Many people enjoy introducing themselves in their first diary entry. Write about who you are, how old you are, and what your interests are. If you’re dedicating your journal to a specific hobby like reading, consider listing your favorite books or the books you hope to read soon. Doing an introductory entry can often help get your creative juices flowing for the rest of your entries. [21] X Research source"

      "title": "Make your entries different and unique.",
      "content": "Make your entries different and unique. Don’t be afraid to mix things up. If all your entries talk about the same thing or are written the exact same way, you’ll probably get bored. Try to differentiate your entries as much as you can, even if your diary is dedicated to a specific topic. Consider different ways you can write about different topics or how you can make your pages look visually interesting. Sometimes, doing something as simple as writing your entries with a different color pen can spice things up. Consider gluing or taping memorabilia into your journal when writing about certain events. For example, if you went to the zoo, paste in your ticket or a photo you took while there."

      "content": "Be honest and open in your writing. This is your personal diary meant for your eyes only. Don’t be afraid to open up. Treat your diary like your most trusted friend; know that your secrets will be safe. Don’t feel like you have to hide or skirt around your feelings. Be yourself and discuss things candidly. [22] X Research source This is why many people start their entries with “Dear diary.” It’s like you’re talking directly to someone you trust. Remember, your diary is a judgment-free zone, so don’t feel like you or your entries need to be perfect."
