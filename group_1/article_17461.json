      "content": "If you're using an iPhone charger or an accessory that isn't Apple-certified, disconnect the accessory and see if the problem continues. Some third-party charging cables, headphone jack converters, battery charging cases, and other accessories that connect to your Lightning port can cause strange screen movements while connected. If you're only experiencing ghost touch when an accessory is connected, that accessory is likely the culprit. If you determine the problem is related to a charging cable, you may also want to try plugging the charger into a different outlet or device, such as using your computer instead of a wall outlet. This can help you rule out grounding problems with problematic wall outlets, extension cords, and power strips."

      "content": "Remove dirt, dust, and debris using a soft, lint-free cloth. If your iPhone is detecting phantom touches, it might be reacting to something on your screen. A microfiber cloth will work best, such as one you'd use to clean a pair of glasses. If you don't have a microfiber cloth, you could use a soft cotton t-shirt. Gently wipe the screen with the cloth until there's nothing left on the surface. [2] X Research source Turn your iPhone off while cleaning to avoid opening apps and sending accidental messages. For sticky or grimy substances, you could lightly dampen the cloth with a small amount of distilled water before gently wiping the screen."

      "content": "Screen protectors can sometimes cause touch screen problems. This is especially true if there is dirt, hair, dust, or an air bubble between the tempered glass protector and the screen, or if the screen protector is misaligned. Cracks in the screen protector can also cause problems, replace your screen protector any time you notice a crack. You can remove the screen protector by hand, using a credit card, or by lifting it with duct tape. Applying low heat to the screen protector before you attempt to remove it will help loosen the adhesive."

      "content": "The shape or alignment of your iPhone case might affect screen sensitivity. While manufacturers do their best to create cases that properly fit all iPhone models, there may be areas of the case that are touching the screen corners or edges. If you don't have ghost touch problems without a case, it's time to invest in a new case."

      "title": "Many Accessibility settings change how your iPhone's screen responds to touch.",
      "content": "Many Accessibility settings change how your iPhone's screen responds to touch. You may have accidentally changed the touch duration, turned on AssistiveTouch, enabled Touch Accommodations, or even turned on a feature that registers taps on the back of your phone. Here's where to look: [3] X Research source Open your iPhone's Settings and tap Accessibility . Tap Touch . If \"AssistiveTouch\" is enabled, your iPhone will behave differently when you touch the screen or perform custom gestures. To turn off this feature, tap AssistiveTouch and toggle off the switch. If \"Touch Accommodations\" is enabled, your iPhone might be ignoring repeated taps or requiring you hold the screen much longer to record the tap. To turn this feature off, tap Touch Accommodations and toggle off the switch. If \"Back Tap\" is enabled, your iPhone will register double or triple taps on the back side of the phone to perform certain actions, such as opening apps, changing the volume, or activating Siri. To turn this off, tap Back Tap and select None for both Double and Triple Tap. Tap Haptic Touch to see whether the touch duration (the time you must hold your finger to the phone to register a long tap) is too fast or slow."
