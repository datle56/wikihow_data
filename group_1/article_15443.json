      "title": "Buy a live sea urchin that smells fresh.",
      "content": "Buy a live sea urchin that smells fresh. Sea urchins are sold live because they decay very quickly after they die. Like with other fish, the best indicator for freshness is smell. If the urchin smells fishy or pungent, then it isn't fresh, so don't buy it. Get one that doesn't have a strong smell, and check to see if the spines are moving slightly. This all means the urchin is alive and fresh. [1] X Research source If you're diving for sea urchins, looks for ones that are green, red, or purple. Black sea urchins aren't edible. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Put gloves on so you don’t get stung.",
      "content": "Put gloves on so you don’t get stung. Sea urchins are venomous and getting stung by a sea urchin can lead to disastrous consequences. Always put on a pair of thick gloves to protect your hands before handling the urchins. If you don’t have gloves, you can also wrap the urchin in a towel. Some people handle sea urchins without gloves because you have to press down hard to get stung. Still, this could be dangerous."

    {
      "title": "Cut around the base of the urchin with scissors.",
      "content": "Cut around the base of the urchin with scissors. First flip the urchin upside down. You’ll be able to tell because there is a small mouth on the bottom. Then take scissors and cut all around the base of the urchin. Lift this part off to expose the edible innards. [3] X Research source Some people also just cut around the urchin mouth with a knife. You could also do this, but you’ll need to dig your finger inside to get the edible parts out. [4] X Research source The spines on the urchin might fall off while you’re cutting, so do this over a sink or towel."

      "title": "Drain all of the liquid out of the urchin.",
      "content": "Drain all of the liquid out of the urchin. The urchin is full of dark liquid and seawater. Hold it over a sink or bowl and flip it upside down to drain all of this out. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrape off the orange innards inside the shell.",
      "content": "Scrape off the orange innards inside the shell. When you open up the urchin, you’ll see 5 orange, tongue-like structures. These are the gonads, or the urchin's sexual organs. They’re the edible parts of the sea urchin. Take a spoon and scrape each one out. [6] X Research source The gonads are also called roe, though this isn't technically correct because roe refers to a mass of eggs inside a fish. The gonads are the only edible parts of the urchin, so don't eat anything else inside the shell. If the gonads are brown, then the sea urchin is spoiled, so don’t eat them."

    {
      "title": "Rinse off the roe in salt water.",
      "content": "Rinse off the roe in salt water. As you scoop the roe out, transfer them into a bowl of salt water. Rinse them off in the bowl to get rid of any brown residue from inside the urchin. If there are still brown pieces left on the roe, you can wipe or pick them off with tweezers."

      "title": "Keep the urchins chilled until you’re ready to eat them.",
      "content": "Keep the urchins chilled until you’re ready to eat them. If you’re not going to eat the urchins right away, then make sure you keep them cold until you do. Put them on ice or in the refrigerator so they don’t spoil. [7] X Research source When storing the urchins on ice, make sure to use a perforated pan, strainer, or rack inside of a standard pan, bowl or another container so that the water runs off as the ice melts. You never want fresh seafood \"swimming\" in melted ice water. Urchin starts spoiling quickly, so chefs recommend eating them right away instead of leaving them out, even if they’re chilled."
