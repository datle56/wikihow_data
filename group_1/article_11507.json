      "content": "Plan to dance during a fast song if you want to keep things casual. Fast dancing usually feels more lighthearted, whereas slow dancing has the potential to be intense or awkward. If you’d like to dance with a guy you don’t know very well, or you want to keep things light, having fun during a fast dance is probably the way to go."

      "content": "Wait for a slow song if you want a more romantic moment. If you want the guy to get the idea that you like him, you might want to try to slow dance with him. Swaying back and forth to a slow song can be a more intimate experience, and can also give you the chance to talk to a guy more easily if you’d like to get to know him better. Slow dancing can be a lot simpler than fast dancing. If you don’t have very good rhythm or want to stick to very simple dance moves, a slow dance is probably your best bet."

      "content": "Show you’re interested in a dance by hanging out near the dance floor. Better yet, get out on the dance floor with a group of friends or even by yourself! A guy may be more likely to approach you if you are already out there dancing, rather than sitting at a table in the corner. If a guy approaches you, you can appear welcoming and show him you’re interested by making eye contact and smiling. [1] X Research source Don’t just stand around next to the dance floor doing nothing, as this can look a little awkward. If you don’t want to dance on your own, find something to do, such as grabbing a drink with a friend. [2] X Research source"

Try to hang out with just a couple friends at a time. Grab one or two friends and form your own dance circle, or sit by yourselves for a bit. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask a guy to dance if he doesn’t approach you. It’s completely okay to not wait for him to make the first move. If there’s someone you’re interested in, wait until he’s free and not dancing with anyone else, and make your own approach. Walk up to him and say, “Want to dance?” or “Care to join me on the dance floor?” Try asking nonverbally by approaching the guy, making eye contact, and smiling. Reach out your hand and, if he takes it, pull him closer. [4] X Research source Alternately, dance on your own near him and mimic his moves or playfully bump his shoulder with yours to get his attention. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Make it your goal to just have fun and be confident. If you seem to be relaxed and enjoying yourself, a guy will be more likely to ask for a dance! Plus, if you’re able to have fun all on your own, you won’t be as disappointed if you end up not dancing with a guy at all. Don’t worry about not being a great dancer. Most likely, a guy won’t care too much if you don’t have the perfect moves down, as long as you’re trying and enjoying the moment. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Work out who will lead and who will follow. Traditionally, a guy leads when dancing with a girl, but if you want to be unconventional or you’re dancing with a same-sex partner, ask your partner what they prefer or say something like, “do you mind if I lead?” [7] X Research source The leader generally initiates dance moves and determines where the couple moves on the dance floor. If you’re feeling less confident, you can try following, which simply means paying attention to where your partner is moving and trying to mirror that.

      "content": "Wrap one arm around your partner, and grab their hand. Traditionally, the leader’s right arm goes near their partner’s side, with their hand touching their partner’s left shoulder blade or waist. The follower rests their left arm on top of the leader’s right arm, and their hand grabs their partner’s bicep or shoulder. Both partners grab each other’s free hand, with the follower’s hand on top. When holding your partner’s hand, your grip should be firm but friendly — you shouldn’t be squeezing the guy’s hand too tight, but you should be grabbing on to it with enough pressure that they are able to lead you. [9] X Research source Alternately, a simpler way to stand is for the follower to put their arms around the leader’s neck, and the leader to put their hands on the follower’s waist."

If you do happen to step on a toe, just say “excuse me.” [10] X Research source If you’re standing very close to your partner, try putting one of your feet between theirs, and your other foot on the outside.

      "content": "Look at your partner, or over their shoulder. It’s helpful to make eye contact when you’re first getting started, so that you can both start moving in the same way. Once the dance gets going, feel free to carry on a simple conversation, look over the guy’s shoulder, or rest your head on their chest or shoulder if you are dancing close together. [12] X Research source Looking into your partner’s eyes is generally the least awkward option if it’s someone you don’t know. Just make sure to look away occasionally so you’re not staring or coming across as creepy. [13] X Research source Keep the conversation simple. You could talk about the song, or ask your partner about the event you’re attending. [14] X Research source"

[15] X Expert Source Lorena Bravo, MA Professional Dance Instructor & Competitor Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. Don’t lock your knees, and sway slightly with your hips. Keep your feet planted on the ground at first, or take small steps if you’re feeling a little more confident. [16] X Research source The leader may choose to move in a circle while slowly stepping back and forth. If you’re the follower, it’s easiest to follow their lead and try to move your body in the same way that they do. [17] X Research source Try to stay relaxed while you dance. If you’re feeling panicked, try focusing on breathing steady for a minute. [18] X Research source"

Try adding an extra step or two to the side, or to the front or back, similar to a waltz. [19] X Expert Source Lorena Bravo, MA Professional Dance Instructor & Competitor Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. For a basic two-step, the leader can use their left foot to take a step to the left, bring their right foot in to meet it, and then repeat again for two steps to the left. The leader then can take 2 steps back to the right. The follower mirrors this by stepping to the right twice, and then to the left twice."

You can also sway your hips to one side, and then the other, each time you hear a beat. It’s going to be a lot easier to dance if you’re both following the beat, but if one or both of you is having trouble keeping up, you can feel free to set your own pace. Follow along with the rhythm your partner is setting, or help him find the beat by putting your hands on his waist and gently guiding him back and forth in time with the song. [25] X Research source"

With each bounce, turn your chest and shoulders to one side, and then the other. This is the most basic dance move you can do. [26] X Research source Keep your arms relaxed. Bend your elbows so that your hands are at waist or chest level, and move your arms slightly up and down or to the side as you move the rest of your body. [27] X Research source To get familiar with how this move is supposed to look, watch a movie with a scene in a nightclub and pay attention to the basic movements that the background actors are doing.

Don’t take large steps, and keep your arms close to you and your guy. [30] X Research source Dance moves that make women look the most attractive include swaying their hips and moving their arms asymmetrically. Try raising one arm in the air, or playing with your hair with one hand. [31] X Research source"

How about you?” Let him know you’re interested by giving him a compliment. Try telling him that you really like his dance moves, or that you think he smells nice."
