      "title": "Start with having the right clothing on.",
      "content": "Start with having the right clothing on. You'll want to have your shirt or top on (such as a choli), your petticoat (sometimes called an inskirt) on and tied snug, and your shoes on before you start wrapping. The top worn with a saree is typically known as blouse (choli). While not necessarily required, safety pins make all sari wrapping much easier and better looking."

      "title": "Wrap and tuck the starting end.",
      "content": "Wrap and tuck the starting end. Hold the sari so that the shorter distance goes from your waist to the floor and the long end can be wrapped around. Then, start at one end and tuck the corner of the fabric into your petticoat at your left hip, wrap it around behind you, over your right hip, past your navel, and around again until it reaches your navel once more. Continue to tuck it into your petticoat as you go around like this. [1] X Research source Ensure sari is not too high. Ideally, your feet should not be visible from under the sari hem. You can use a safety pin to pin it into place at your waist right now, but the petticoat should be secure enough to hold it in place."

      "title": "Pleat the other end.",
      "content": "Pleat the other end. Switch to the other, more decorated end of the sari (called the pallu). You'll want to make the pleats that go over your shoulder. [2] X Research source Do this by using your fingers span to space the pleats, and fold them across the short end of the sari. You can use a flat hair clip to keep the pleats in place until you're done with your look. Just don't forget to remove it later!"

      "title": "Cover and tuck the hip.",
      "content": "Cover and tuck the hip. Pulling the fabric from the top left of the skirt until it is taut at the back, drape it diagonally so that it covers your exposed love handle (or place where a love handle would be) and then tuck the fabric into the waistband at the navel."
