      "title": "An email thread lists the original message and all subsequent replies in a single, easy-to-read format.",
      "content": "An email thread lists the original message and all subsequent replies in a single, easy-to-read format. If you're using Gmail , messages are threaded by default—this means you can click a single message in your inbox and see the original message, as well as all follow-up messages in order. In most cases, the original message will appear at the bottom of the email thread, and the latest response will appear at the top. Email threads can be convenient for keeping track of email conversations, especially when an email message is sent to multiple people. When somebody hits Reply All , their response will be added to the thread. If your email app doesn't have threading enabled, each reply to a message will appear in your inbox as an individual message. This can lead to a clogged inbox if you maintain a lot of conversations via email. For longer email threads, you might see your reply, the email before it, and a Show quoted text link that hides the rest of the conversation. Click the link to view the earlier responses. A threaded email will commonly have a number, (e.g., (5)) after the sender's name to show how many emails are in that thread. An unthreaded email, however, will not have that number marker because all the messages are listed separately."

      "title": "Pros.",
      "content": "Pros. Easily view conversations in one message. When people email back and forth about something, it's easy to lose an email or two in a cluttered inbox . You can check an email thread to view the entire conversation from start to finish in a single message. Keep your inbox tidy. An inbox with lots of messages can be overwhelming. Email threads combine replies to the same original message, making it so you'll see conversations in your inbox rather than every individual message. If three people reply to an email thread, you'll only see one conversation (with the number of replies) in your inbox instead of 3 separate email messages. Quick access to conversation details. For example, let's say you've been going back and forth over email with your child's teacher, and the teacher gave you details about the upcoming field trip in one of her replies. If you forgot the field trip details, you can easily click the email thread and find what you need. Keeps groups informed. Say you're working on a group project and communicating about the details over email. Having a group email thread ensures that everyone in the group has access to entire chronological conversation and can refer back when needed."

    {
      "title": "Cons.",
      "content": "Cons. Unrelated messages. While the original message may have focused on a single subject, email threads can veer off course—especially group email threads. Some email clients don't offer threaded conversations. The most popular clients like Apple, Gmail, and Outlook provide this feature, but others may not. If you use an email client that does not support threaded messages, you'll see every reply to that original email as a new email in your inbox. Can get too long. If you're working on a long project, you can accrue tons of emails, but not each response in the email will be pertinent to the project. Someone else tagged in the conversation who hasn't been keeping up will have to spend extra time scrolling through the threaded messages to catch up."
