      "content": "Look at plans for the building to see where there is plumbing or wiring in the wall. This will help you determine if there are any places you need to avoid cutting into. Only cut into spots where there might be plumbing and electrical wiring if it is absolutely necessary and be extra careful to cut no deeper than the depth of the drywall, which is usually 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). If you don't have architectural plans for the wall you need to cut into, you can try estimating where plumbing and wiring runs by looking at things like sinks, toilets, electrical outlets, and light fixtures."

      "content": "Mark the outline of the section you want to cut out with a pencil. Identify the spot where you want to make a hole for an inspection or to access something behind the drywall. Draw the outline for the cut freehand if you just need a rough opening or use a straight edge to create perfectly straight lines. [1] X Research source If you want to create a circular opening in drywall, you can trace around a round object to create a neat cut line."

      "content": "Plunge the tip of a jab saw into the drywall where you want to start cutting. [2] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 24 February 2021. Place the sharp tip of the jab saw against the drywall, then wiggle it back and forth while applying strong pressure to push it straight through using your dominant hand. Use your non-dominant hand to push on the back of the handle if you need more force to get it through. [3] X Research source A jab saw is also known as a drywall saw. It has a sharp tip that makes it relatively easy to punch through a sheet of drywall as well as teeth for sawing. Jab saws can be used to make both straight and circular cuts in drywall."

      "title": "Saw along your cut lines using clean, smooth strokes.",
      "content": "Saw along your cut lines using clean, smooth strokes. Apply more pressure on the forward sawing motion to create a neat cut without jagged outside edges. Pull the blade most of the way out and rotate it 90 degrees before plunging it back in whenever you reach the end of a cut line on a square or rectangular section. [4] X Research source Try your best to saw with even, controlled motions and only saw about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) deep, which is the most common depth of drywall."

      "content": "Use a shop vac to suck up dust as you go if you want to minimize the mess. Hold the nozzle of a shop vac in your non-dominant hand. Follow along behind the jab saw to suck up the dust as you cut. [5] X Research source This is completely optional. It just helps to reduce the mess you make, but you can always vacuum it up afterwards if you want to. Another trick to minimize dust is by fitting a jab saw with a finer-toothed blade meant for cutting metal rather than drywall."

      "content": "Smooth out any irregular edges of the cut with a utility knife when you finish. Carefully go back around the edges of the section you cut out using a utility knife. Cut away any rough, irregular pieces or straighten the lines. [6] X Research source This will make it easier to patch or repair the drywall."

Adjust the cutting guide to 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm), which is the depth of most drywall. [7] X Research source You can use a rotary tool of your choice, such as a Dremel tool or a RotoZip. If you don't have a drywall cutting bit, you can also use a multi-purpose cutting bit."

      "content": "Turn the rotary tool on and plunge it into the drywall. Set the rotary tool to its highest speed and turn it on. Plunge it into the beginning of a cut line wherever you want to start your cut. [8] X Research source You won't be able to plunge the bit into the wall if the rotary tool is not on."

      "content": "Move the rotary tool along your cut lines until you have cut out the section. Carefully push the rotary tool along the cut lines you drew with both hands, holding the cutting guide firmly against the wall to help you make clean cuts. Stop and pull it out once you have cut along all the lines. [9] X Research source You can now pop out the section you cut out to access something behind it or install a piece of hardware like an electrical outlet."
