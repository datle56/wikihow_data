      "content": "Remove debris from under the keys on your keyboard. Dust in your keyboard is one of the most common reasons behind a spacebar that doesn't work. To clean under the spacebar and remove dust, use a can of compressed air. Position the nozzle under and around the key and spray, using the air to dislodge dirt, crumbs, or other debris that could be under there. Don't turn the can of compressed air upside down and spray. This will cause the propellant to be sprayed out of the can, which could damage your keyboard. This propellant is also very cold, and could cause injury."

      "content": "Remove the spacebar keycap and clean underneath it with isopropyl alcohol. Another common reason spacebars stop working is sticky residue from spilling liquid on your keyboard. Whether you have a mechanical keyboard or membrane keyboard, you can clean under the spacebar keycap by removing it. Unplug, disconnect, or turn off your keyboard before continuing. Use a keycap puller, paper clip, or screwdriver to gently pry the spacebar keycap from the keyboard. Dip a cotton swab in 70% or higher isopropyl alcohol (though 99% isopropyl alcohol is recommended). The cotton swab should be saturated but not dripping wet. Clean up any residue under the spacebar with the dampened swab. Also be sure to clean the underside of the spacebar keycap and the switches (if you have a mechanical keyboard). If the switches are very dirty, take a fresh cotton swab and dip it in the isopropyl alcohol. Press the tip of the swab into the switch, pushing up and down on it, so the excess alcohol flows into the switch to loosen and dissolve any residue. Allow the keyboard to dry for a few hours to a day before reassembling it and attempting to use it again. To reattach the spacebar, simply press the keycap back into place."
