Then, take a clean white cloth or cotton swab and gently blot the stain until the polish comes off. The fresher the spill is, the easier it will be to remove it using this method! [1] X Research source Use clear, non-acetone nail polish remover only! Acetone is a strong solvent that can dissolve certain types of carpet fibers, so it's best to opt for a remover product that doesn't have it. Avoid cleaning nail polish stains on dark carpets with nail polish remover or you'll run the risk of bleaching them. For large nail polish spills, use a kitchen spoon to scoop up the wet nail polish. Tilt the spoon slightly to get up as much polish as possible, then immediately wipe the spoon clean with a paper towel and wash it before you use it for cooking. Then rub and dab the area with non-acetone nail polish remover. [2] X Research source"
