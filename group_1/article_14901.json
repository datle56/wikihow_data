      "content": "Raki is a Turkish anise-flavored alcoholic drink. This beverage has a unique flavor that plays an important part of Turkish cuisine and culture. Made by distilling grapes 2 times, raki is often called “lion’s milk” because of its cloudy appearance and association with Aslan, a legendary lion from Turkish legends. The drink is typically drunk with others and is a symbol of strength and community."

      "content": "Enjoy raki socially with other people while having a good conversation. If you’re traveling in eastern Europe, chances are you’ll come across raki at a restaurant or gathering. It’s commonly served when people gather together to have fun or celebrate something. [2] X Research source Depending on where you live, it may be hard to find raki to purchase. You can buy bottles online, or if there is a large ethnic community in your area, a specialty grocery store may carry it."

      "title": "Sip your raki and drink it straight if you like strong liquor.",
      "content": "Sip your raki and drink it straight if you like strong liquor. Raki has an alcohol-by-volume (ABV) of 45% to 50%, so it’s one of the stronger liquors, and some homemade varieties are even stronger. It’s not traditional to take raki as a shot, so be prepared to sip your drink. [3] X Research source Luckily, raki is nearly always served with snacks or a light meal or some sort, so you won’t have to drink on an empty stomach."

    {
      "title": "Dilute your raki with ice or water if you don’t want to drink it straight.",
      "content": "Dilute your raki with ice or water if you don’t want to drink it straight. If you’re at a gathering, there will probably be a bowl of ice on the table and a pitcher of cold water. You can add as much to your drink as you’d like. Adding ice or water also changes the color of the raki to a milky white, which is why coupled with its high ABV, it’s often fondly called “lion’s milk.” [4] X Research source Raki is flavored with anise, which contains a compound called anethole. Anethole can’t dissolve in water, so when you add water to your drink, it separates the anethole from the liquor and creates an opaque milky color."

      "title": "Eat a little bit of cheese and melon before sipping your raki.",
      "content": "Eat a little bit of cheese and melon before sipping your raki. At a minimum, raki is traditionally served with bowls of cut melon and dishes with cheeses, most often feta. At a more extensive gathering, you’ll probably encounter a mezze platter, which is a spread of things like hummus, baba ganoush, tzatziki, fresh cut vegetables, stuffed grape leaves, olives, tabouli, and other tasty dishes. [5] X Research source A mezze platter is very similar to tapas, or small dishes meant to be shared with others. This supports the communal aspect of drinking raki with others."

      "title": "Make a toast to your companions as you eat and drink.",
      "content": "Make a toast to your companions as you eat and drink. Before you sip your drink, you can say “serefinize,” which means, “in your honor” or “cheers!” Clink together the bottoms of your glasses when you toast others, and enjoy the friendly communal atmosphere. [6] X Research source Touching the bottoms of glasses signifies that you’re thinking of the other person."

      "content": "Order a single drink for yourself by asking for a kadeh. The “kadeh” is actually the kind of glass that raki is served in. By ordering one, you signify that you just want a single serving of the drink. Say “bir kadeh raki,” which is pronounced, BEER kah-DEH rah-KUH. [7] X Research source If your waiter adds ice or water for you rather than providing a pitcher and bowl on the table, say “taman,” when enough has been added to your drink."

      "content": "Purchase a half-bottle of raki if you’re drinking with several friends. Purchasing drinks for others is a sign of goodwill and helps set the tone for the night. You can say “bir otuzbeşlik raki” to order a half-bottle to be delivered to your table. [8] X Research source The pronunciation for the half bottle is BEER OH-tooz-BESH-leek rah-KUH."

      "content": "Get a full bottle to enjoy with friends over the course of several hours. Order a “bir şişe raki” (BEER SHEE-sheh rah-KUH), which will provide you with about 24 ounces (680 g), or about 16 drinks. If you do this, plan to stay at the same place for a long evening of drinking, eating, and talking with your companions. [9] X Research source This full bottle is also sometimes called a “yetmişlik” (yeht-MEESH-leek)."

      "content": "Try a cocktail for a new twist on this classic drink. Several high-end restaurants and bars have started creating raki cocktails to elevate their patrons’ drinking experiences. Most often, raki is mixed with some kind of citrus-flavored liqueur, lime, and pomegranate juice. [10] X Research source If you don’t see a raki cocktail advertised anywhere, chances are the location you’re at doesn’t offer them."
