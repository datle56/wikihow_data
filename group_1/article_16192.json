      "content": "Pierce the softest eye with a metal skewer. Poke at each of the coconut's 3 eyes. You should find one that's softer. When you do, push the skewer through the eye, making a hole through it. [1] X Research source The eyes are the small dark circles that are clustered together on the top of the coconut. You can also use a wooden skewer, but it could break. You could also try an ice pick or even just a sharp knife. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the coconut water into a container.",
      "content": "Pour the coconut water into a container. Turn the hole over a container and shake out the water. It may take a moment or two to get it all out; you should end up with 0.25 to 0.75 cups (59 to 177 mL) of coconut water from each coconut. If you need to, make the hole bigger. [3] X Research source Coconut water is good for drinking, and you won't really need it for the oil."

      "content": "Whack the coconut with a hammer or meat tenderizer until it breaks. Grab the coconut with a towel and turn it so the shell is exposed. Tap the coconut with the tool, turning it as you do. The shell will eventually crack. Keep tapping to expand the crack around the coconut. [4] X Research source You can also use anything else heavy you have laying around, such as a small cast iron skillet or even a pestle. If you're using a skillet, set the coconut on a cutting board or another hard surface to crack it. You can also hit it on a hard surface. [5] X Research source"

Place one half face-down on a cutting board, then whack the shell with the hammer or meat tenderizer. Just hitting it a few times should make the flesh loose enough to pull out. [6] X Research source Another option is to keep hitting it on a hard surface until the shell cracks off. Keep turning the shell to hit a new spot each time. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Some people prefer to peel off the thin, brown skin, though it's not necessary. If you'd like to, use a vegetable peeler to take it off and rinse the pieces again.

      "content": "Chop the coconut meat into smaller pieces. Your blender will do most of the work for you, but your coconut meat needs to be in small enough bits for your blender to get to it. Try 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes or smaller. [10] X Research source You can use as many or as few coconuts as you want. Keep in mind that it takes quite a few coconuts to make a small amount of oil and different methods will produce different amounts of oil. For instance, 3-4 coconuts will likely only produce 0.25 cups (59 mL) of coconut oil."

Only fill the blender about 1/3 of the way with coconut. Pour in enough hot water to completely cover the coconut with an extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of water on top. [11] X Research source Boil some water and then mix it with cool water so it's hot but not so hot that you can't touch it. Some people use cold water for extraction. However, you won't get as much oil from the coconut with cold water. [12] X Research source"

It's made of fine cloth, and you can squeeze the whole bag to release the milk.
