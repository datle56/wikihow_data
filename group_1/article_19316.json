    {
      "title": "Trim thick or long patches.",
      "content": "Trim thick or long patches. If you have thick, dense back hair growth, this can clog the razor. Trim it down first to ensure the best results with shaving. There are several ways to do this. For example, you can have your assistant cut it with a pair of scissors and a comb or use a heavy-duty set of electric clippers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Exfoliate.",
      "content": "Exfoliate. Have your assistant scrub your back with warm water and a mild abrasive. You can use a shower brush, a mild body scrub, or a pumice stone — whatever you're comfortable with. This will exfoliate your skin, getting rid of dead skin cells before you shave. The main benefit of this is that it reduces the chance of ingrown hairs. However, it's not strictly necessary, so you can skip this step if you're in a hurry."
    },
    {
      "title": "If you have an electric shaver, use this first.",
      "content": "If you have an electric shaver, use this first. Electric clippers aren't as good as razors for getting a close, smooth shave, but they are good at getting through a lot of hair fast. If you have a set, have your assistant go over your entire back once, giving it a rough shave. You don't need to shave all the way down to the skin — just cut down on most of the \"bulk.\" When you shave with a razor in a few steps, your work will go quicker and there will be less hair to clog the razor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the shaving cream or gel.",
      "content": "Apply the shaving cream or gel. Have your assistant apply your preferred shaving lubricant all over your back in a single layer. Whatever you normally use for your face should be fine. Keep in mind that this will use a lot more lubricant than your typical face-shaving session. Make sure you have plenty before you start or you may need to make a trip to the store mid-shave."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shave.",
      "content": "Shave. Tell your assistant to start shaving. You'll probably want to be near a sink for this so your assistant can rinse the razor. Have your assistant apply more gel or cream as needed until your entire back is shaved. To get a smooth shave without discomfort, shave your entire back once with the grain , then shave again against the grain . [2] X Research source Shaving against the grain first can cause minor pain and irritation."

      "title": "Optionally, shower.",
      "content": "Optionally, shower. You don't need to, but this is a great way to rinse off stray hairs that can become uncomfortable when you put on your shirt. Plus, it feels great — especially if you haven't had a smooth back in a long time."

    {
      "title": "Dry off.",
      "content": "Dry off. Pat the skin dry lightly with a clean towel. Be sure to use a patting motion, not a rubbing one. Rubbing can irritate the newly-exposed, delicate skin. To keep the skin smooth and supple, you may want to apply unscented lotion all over the back. Avoid scented lotions — the chemicals in these can irritate post-shave skin (especially if your assistant accidentally gave you tiny cuts or nicks)."

      "title": "Evenly distribute the cream over your back.",
      "content": "Evenly distribute the cream over your back. Make sure all of the hair is covered. Have an assistant help you if you're even a little worried about not being able to reach the middle of your back — you don't want to miss any spots. You don't need to vigorously rub the cream into your skin. Just apply it gently over all of your hair. Wash your hands after your have applied the cream. The cream can irritate your skin if it's allowed to dry (not to mention that it will remove any hair on the backs of your hands it is allowed to work on)."

      "content": "Let the cream sit for as long as directed. The cream's packaging will tell you how long to let it sit. Usually, this will be somewhere in the neighborhood of about three to six minutes. After waiting, use a damp cloth or towel to wipe a small area of your back. If the hair does not come off easily, wait another couple of minutes."

      "content": "Rinse off with warm water in the shower. This is a quick, convenient way to rinse all of the cream (and the dissolved hair) off. You can rinse your back with water from a towel, but it's much easier to miss spots and allow the cream to sit for too long this way."

      "content": "Wash your back with soap and water. This is usually easiest in the shower. This is an important step — the wax has a much easier time grabbing your hair if it is free of sweat and oil. After showering, be sure to dry your back thoroughly."

      "title": "Prepare the wax according to the product’s instructions.",
      "content": "Prepare the wax according to the product’s instructions. For most hot waxes, you'll need to heat the wax up (usually in the microwave). The temperature of the wax should be warm, but not painfully hot. Different products will have slightly different sets of instructions."

      "content": "Jerk the hair out quickly. Pull the strip in the against the direction of hair growth. This is the opposite of the direction you applied the wax. Use a quick, fluid motion. Don't go slowly — this will hurt. To reduce pain, do not pull straight up or up at an angle. Keep the strip close to the body as you pull in a direction parallel to the skin and pull as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Repeat the process of applying and removing the wax and strips.",
      "content": "Repeat the process of applying and removing the wax and strips. Continue until all of the hair on the back has been removed. This will take many applications. Don't be afraid to take breaks if the pain becomes too much. Future waxings tend to hurt less than the first. If the pain is ever unbearable, stop — burning or injuring yourself isn't worth worrying about uneven back hair."

Wet your back and apply shaving cream/gel if you are using a standard razor."

Since it's hard to look at your entire back at once with the two-mirror setup, take a few minutes to look at each spot individually. If you see any leftover hair, shave it as normal.

This can make it a lot easier to remove the hair, so while it's not essential, it's usually a wise idea. You don't need to wash with soap yet — this will come later. Note: As with waxing, it's best to do this method the day before you need to show off your back so any redness and irritation will have a chance to subside."

The teeth of the epilator will pull the hairs out (similar to how a waxing strip would). This is generally described as being painful, though there is some debate about whether waxing or epilating hurts more. As when waxing, don't hesitate to take breaks. If the pain is too intense, dragging the epilator across the skin more quickly can reduce the amount of time you have to endure the pain. However, you may need to go back over the same patch multiple times if you miss hairs."

The level of pain is likely to be roughly the same. Professionals may be able to work more quickly than amateur assistants and, depending the service you use, you may be in a more comfortable environment than you would be at home. Back waxing fees will vary by location. $40-$70 for just the back is typical — costs will be higher if extra areas are waxed. [9] X Research source"

Multiple treatments are usually needed over time to get permanent results. Some limited hair regrowth can occur over time, though multiple sessions make this less likely. [10] X Research source This procedure tends to cost about $400-$500 per session. One advantage of laser treatments is that they allow the option of \"thinning out\" patches of hair, rather than removing all of it. [11] X Research source"

Electrolysis is truly permanent — once each cell is treated, it is very rare that hair will regrow. However, since each hair follicle must be treated individually, it can be very time-consuming. This procedure costs about $40 per treatment, but a large area like your back may require many treatments. [12] X Research source"
