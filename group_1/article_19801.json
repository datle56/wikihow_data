      "content": "Use steam. Nasal and sinus congestion are common symptoms of the flu. If you are suffering from congestion, using steam may give you some relief. The heat of the steam loosens mucus while the moisture helps to relieve dry nasal passages. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Try a hot shower or bath to help to clear your congestion faster. Turn the water as hot as you can stand it and let the bathroom fill with steam with the door closed. If the heat leaves you feeling a little weak or dizzy, stop immediately and do not continue. When you get out of the shower, dry your hair and body thoroughly. Damp hair can cause you to lose body heat, which is not good when you are sick. You can also use steam by filling your bathroom sink with hot water and placing your face over it. Drape a towel over your head to keep the steam in. You can even add a couple of drops of a sinus-clearing essential oil, such as eucalyptus, or peppermint, to maximize the sinus-clearing benefits."

The Neti pot is an oblong ceramic or clay teapot that can be purchased online, in health food stores, and in some pharmacies; however, any kind of bottle or container with a thin spout can also be used. Buy the saline solution used in the Neti pot in health food or drug stores; however, you can make your own saline solution by mixing half a teaspoon of kosher salt into a cup of sterile water. It is essential that the water is sterile or properly distilled — ensure this by boiling the water for five minutes, then allow it to cool to room temperature. Fill the pot with the saline solution and, tilting your head to one side over a sink, insert the spout of the pot into one nostril. Slowly pour the solution in, which should flow in one nostril before coming out the other. When the water stops dripping, blow your nose gently, then repeat the process on the opposite side.

It is thought that the fever will heat up your body and blood, which makes it easier for your body to fight off the infection, or that the virus may be unable to replicate as easily when your body is at a higher temperature. However, there is no evidence to suggest that taking Tylenol to bring down a fever would prevent your immune system from working at its best. You can likely take Tylenol to relieve your symptoms with no fear of additional harm, but you can always check with your doctor if you're unsure.

Do not inhale mucus back into your nose because that can lead to sinus pressure and earaches. [7] X Research source To blow your nose, hold a tissue over your nose with both hands. The tissue should be covering your nostrils so that the tissue will catch the mucus when you blow your nose. Then apply gentle pressure on one nostril and blow out through the other one.

This also means you need to rest more, since your body is working so hard. If you try doing more than you have to, you can make your flu last longer and make your symptoms worse. At least eight hours of sleep per night is ideal, but you will probably need even more when you're sick. Sleep in and take naps throughout the day.

Dry heat can bother your nose and throat, causing them to dry out even more and making your symptoms worse. Try using a humidifier in the room where you spend most of your time.

This can worsen flu symptoms and cause more symptoms, such as headaches and a dry, irritated throat. Try to drink more fluids than average when you're sick. You can drink decaffeinated hot tea, an electrolyte solution like PediaLyte, diluted sports drinks, eat soups and water-heavy fruit and vegetables such as watermelon, tomato, cucumber, and pineapple, or drink more juice and water. Avoid sugary sodas because soda acts as a diuretic, which causes you to urinate more and lose water. Drink ginger ale if you have an upset stomach, but drink more water. To check for dehydration, examine your urine. Very pale yellow or almost clear means you’re well-hydrated. When urine is dark yellow, you may be dehydrated and you should drink more water.

Avoid taking NSAIDs if you have acid reflux or peptic ulcer disease. These medications can upset your stomach. If you are already taking an NSAID for other issues such as blood clots or arthritis, talk to your doctor before taking the medicine. Many multi-symptoms medicines contain acetaminophen. Make sure you take the appropriate amount because an overdose can lead to liver toxicity.

This includes those ages 65 or older, young children, women who are pregnant, those with depressed immune systems (such as those undergoing chemotherapy), or those with chronic health conditions like asthma or diabetes. If you are a parent or caretaker for a person with the risk factors just described, or a health care worker, it is important you get the flu shot too to protect these people. Flu season is October to May, with its peak December to February. [20] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source . Around this time, flu shots, which are vaccines, are available at most pharmacies. Most insurances cover this cost. Get the vaccine few weeks before the season starts. The vaccine takes a good two weeks to fully kick in, by helping you develop antibodies to the flu so you can fight it off; however, getting it early will help you not contract it during the two weeks you are susceptible to the flu. You can also get the flu shot if you're currently experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. Some people believe that flu symptoms are a contraindication for the flu shot, or a reason you shouldn't get it, but this is a common misconception. The vaccine is only effective for one flu season, so you must get it every year. It also only covers some strains of the flu. [21] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Also worth noting is that flu vaccine manufacturers in partnership with doctors basically have to guess which flu strains will be prominent that year and make the vaccine to include those strains.
