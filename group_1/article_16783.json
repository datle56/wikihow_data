This is an optional tool unless the mod specifically requires the Forge API. Some mods may require an older tool called Modloader. This tool is not compatible with Forge API, so you should stick to one or the other. It is recommended that Forge be installed on a clean installation of Minecraft . This will help reduce errors and incompatibilities. Run at least one game on your new Minecraft installation. Before you install anything, you should run one game on your fresh Minecraft installation. Download the latest Forge installer from the developer's website. Open the installer. Make sure that it is set to “Install client” and then click OK. Forge will be installed. You can select the Forge profile from your Minecraft launcher to load your installed Forge mods."
