      "content": "Buy halva fresh to ensure you get the best quality. Halva's increasing popularity has given rise to several pre-packaged brands, but it is still best to get it from a local deli.

      "content": "Make halva easier to eat by cutting, scraping, or spooning it. Halva can vary in texture from soft and spreadable to hard and brittle. It's easiest to eat if you can cut it into bite-sized pieces. If you have a soft or semi-soft halva, take it out of its container and slice it with a sharp knife. If you have a particularly hard halva, you may not be able to get a knife through it. In this case, shave pieces off the top with a strong metal spoon. Scraping the top of the halva with a spoon produces thin strips that resemble sawdust shavings. Soft halva can be enjoyed right out of the container with a spoon."
