      "title": "Brush your salmon with olive oil.",
      "content": "Brush your salmon with olive oil. Use a brush to spread a light amount of olive oil over your filet. This will help your salmon retain moisture while stuck in the oven. If your salmon is large, cut it into smaller filets before spreading any oil."

      "title": "Season your salmon with herbs, spices, and citrus.",
      "content": "Season your salmon with herbs, spices, and citrus. To season your salmon thoroughly, sprinkle pinches of salt, pepper, dill, garlic, parsley, and tarragon over the filet. After, squeeze half of your citrus fruit over the salmon for extra flavor and juiciness. Make sure to season both sides before baking."

      "title": "Oil your grill to prevent sticking.",
      "content": "Oil your grill to prevent sticking. While your grill is heating up, run a cloth dipped in olive oil over your grates. This will help prevent your salmon from sticking to the surface. Keep the cloth between your hand and the grates to avoid burning yourself. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread a light amount of olive oil over your filet.",
      "content": "Spread a light amount of olive oil over your filet. Use a brush to coat your fish with a thin layer of olive oil. This will pack in moisture while your salmon is grilling. If your filet is large, cut it into smaller pieces before using any olive oil."

      "title": "Sprinkle herbs, spices, and citrus over your salmon.",
      "content": "Sprinkle herbs, spices, and citrus over your salmon. To add additional flavor, sprinkle your fish with a small amount of salt, pepper, dill, garlic, parsley, and tarragon. For additional zest, squeeze half of your lemon or lime over the filet. Before grilling, make sure you cover both sides. To give your salmon more flavor, place it in a wet marinade an hour before cooking. Popular ingredients include lemon juice, sesame oil, honey, and hot sauce. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Grill your salmon until one side is golden brown.",
      "content": "Grill your salmon until one side is golden brown. Place the filet on a part of the grill where heat is evenly distributed, avoiding spots directly above large flames or burners. Depending on the size of your filet and the heat of the grill, each side could take between 4 and 8 minutes to cook. To give your salmon grill-marks, place it at a 45° angle to the grate."

      "title": "Move your salmon off the heat to finish cooking.",
      "content": "Move your salmon off the heat to finish cooking. To see if your salmon is close to done, press your spatula into the center of the fish. If it flakes and causes clear juice to run out, it is ready to be moved. Fish can dry out quickly, so taking your salmon off the grill will ensure that residual heat does not overcook or burn it."

      "title": "Fill a pot with cold water, lemon, onion, celery, salt, and herbs.",
      "content": "Fill a pot with cold water, lemon, onion, celery, salt, and herbs. Fill a pot with 1 US-quart (950 ml) (1 L) of cold water. Either squeeze your lemon into the water or cut it into thin slices to insert. Place your onions, celery, and bay leaf into the pot. Sprinkle thyme, dill, and salt on top to taste. For more flavor, try adding peppercorns, other vegetables like carrots, or cooking liquids like chicken stock and white wine. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Add your salmon filet and heat to a medium temperature. To avoid overcooking your fish, keep your pot well below boiling, aiming for a temperature around 170° F (76° C). If your water does not fully cover the salmon, add just enough to do so. Do not preheat your pot. Starting cold will help your salmon retain moisture and avoid overheating. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook your salmon until it is opaque and flakes easily. Let your salmon simmer until it can be easily pulled apart by a fork and is no longer transparent on the inside. Depending on the exact heat, this could take between 20 and 30 minutes. Poached salmon will not change colors as drastically as grilled or baked salmon, so pay extra attention to the opacity and toughness."
