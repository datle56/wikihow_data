When flying the US flag above or alongside other national flags, make sure the US flag is the same size or larger than the others.

If you're mounting the US flag with a state flag in a crossed arrangement on a wall, keep the US flag to the right side and the state flag to the left, from the perspective of the flags themselves. When crossing the staffs, keep the staff of the US flag in front of the staff of the other flag. The US flag's staff should be furthest from the wall. [7] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Veterans Affairs U.S. government agency providing healthcare and resources to veterans Go to source Make sure that, to a viewer facing the display, the US flag appears to their own left. In this arrangement, both flags should cascade away from the central crossing point; they shouldn't overlap in the middle."

Instead, secure the flagstaff to the right side of the vehicle in an upright position. If you prefer a draped effect, use flag-inspired bunting. Arrange the bunting with the blue portion at the top and the red portion at the bottom. While being displayed, the US flag should never touch the ground or another object."
