      "content": "Remove glue residue with an oil. Coconut oil, olive oil, or cooking oil are all good options to choose from. Once you've removed the residue, you can wash the glass with dish soap, or use alcohol to clean off the leftover oil."

      "content": "Rub the glue using a towel moistened with a household alcohol. Rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover is, most often, the best choice for removing sticky substances from glass. [2] X Research source Pour a small amount of the liquid onto a paper or cloth towel. In a circular motion, rub the dried glue with the paper towel to soften the substance. Once softened, use the same towel to wipe the glue and any extra residue away."

      "title": "Coat the residue with a strong cleaner to break down tougher glues.",
      "content": "Coat the residue with a strong cleaner to break down tougher glues. If the glue on the glass is a stronger type, you may have to use a cleaner specifically made to break down sticky or oily substances. The cleaning section at a nearby market or automotive shop should have these items in stock. [3] X Research source These could be window or glass cleaners like Windex, or automotive cleaners like Goo-Gone or Goo Off. Wet a towel with the solvent, place it on the glue, and leave the towel there for a few moments to let the cleaner begin to break down the adhesive. Take the towel off and wipe away any remaining glue with a clean towel. Commercial-strength cleaners contain chemicals in order to break down residues. In order to use them safely, make sure to use the products in a well-ventilated area with the proper protective gear to cover skin and eyes."

      "title": "Soften the glue using heat or other agents.",
      "content": "Soften the glue using heat or other agents. If previous methods do not work at first, try further softening the glue with other means before trying to wipe it away again. This can be done most effectively by heating the glue up by pouring hot water onto it or blowing it with a hair dryer, or by soaking the glue with other chemical softeners like vinegar, cooking oil, or lighter fluid. If this works to soften the residue, then wipe it away using a clean towel."

      "title": "Scrape the glue away with a scraper after softening with a solvent.",
      "content": "Scrape the glue away with a scraper after softening with a solvent. Chip away at the glue using a sturdy, sharp metal scraper. Make sure to scrape away from your face and body so that if the scraper slips, you do not cut yourself. Do not use a very thin or fragile blade. Scraping with a blade like this requires you to apply much more force than you would use with a thicker, sturdier blade, and this could cause you to scratch or break the glass."
