      "content": "Popular truffles are found in West Europe and the Pacific Northwest. Truffles are found underground in moist, warm forests. While you may be lucky to find black, burgundy, or white truffles in other areas, you’re more likely to find them in Italy, France, Oregon, and Washington. [1] X Research source However, countries like Chile, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand have cultivated truffles on farms or orchards. [2] X Research source There are also truffle orchards in states like Missouri. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Thousands of truffle species can be found throughout the world. Although no truffles are toxic, only a few are coveted for their strong flavor and aroma. [4] X Research source The French black (Tuber melanosporum) and Italian white (Tuber magnatum) truffles are the most famous and expensive truffles. [5] X Research source There are also native truffles that grow all over the world and are desired for their culinary qualities, like pecan truffles in North America. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Search after heavy rainfall in forests where the soil is moist. Truffles thrive in moist soil, so hunt where the ground is often damp, just after there’s been a lot of rainy weather. For best results, search 10 to 14 days after a heavy rainfall has taken place. [7] X Research source In the American midwest, truffles ripen from August to November.

      "content": "Search under beech, fir, and oak trees. Trees that form ectomycorrhizal (symbiotic) relationships with fungi, such as beech, fir, and oak trees, must be present in order for truffles to grow because truffles attach to tree roots. [9] X Research source Pine, hazelnut, hickory, birch, and eucalyptus trees might also have truffles near them. [10] X Research source Truffles share resources with these kinds of trees—truffles absorb water and nutrients that trees need, and trees have photosynthesizing leaves that make the food that truffles need. [11] X Research source The kind of tree species truffles grow on depends on your area. In Oregon, they’re almost always found under Douglas fir trees. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for darkened exposed dirt around the base of trees. As you hunt, look carefully at the ground to see if there are any trees without vegetation growing underneath them. [13] X Research source If truffles are present, a “brûlée” effect may make the ground look burnt, rough, and darker than surrounding areas because their existence prevents vegetation from growing. [14] X Research source When you find these “brûlée” areas, start carefully digging in the dirt with a trowel or hand rake to find truffles. Because tree roots can grow throughout a forest, truffles can be anywhere. While you hunt, look near rotting logs, abandoned roads, and in loose or compacted soil. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Check for small holes in or around the dirt. Look very carefully at the “brûlée” areas for small holes. This is a sign that rodents and other small mammals have been looking for the truffles. [16] X Research source Seeing a lot of these may mean that rodents smelled the truffles’ strong aroma and began digging to find and eat them."

You’ll know you’ve found a truffle when you find a lump underneath the ground that looks like a potato or chocolate truffle. [17] X Research source Try to avoid eating a wild truffle or mushroom unless you or someone else has completely identified it. If you’re not sure what it is, wait to eat it until you do.

      "content": "Dig truffles up with a rake. When you’ve found an area that you think may contain truffles, use a rake with 3 to 5 tines to gently peel back the layers of soil. Most truffles will be 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) deep. After raking, cover the soil back up to protect the roots of the tree and ensure there will be truffles there next season. [19] X Research source Raking is the best way to hunt for truffles without a truffle dog or pig to help sniff them out. However, this method can pull up unripe or rotten truffles along with mature ones. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Train a truffle dog to help you hunt. Dogs can be a major asset because they only seek out ripe truffles and won’t dig up rotten or inedible truffles. To train your own truffle dog, pair the scent of truffles with a treat. Once they associate truffles with a reward, hide ripe truffles in containers and bury them under trees for your dog to find.

[31] X Research source Most truffles will keep in the fridge for 10 days. White truffles last for around 5 days, while black truffles can stay ripe for about a week. [32] X Research source Make sure the container has more air than truffles inside, and that no truffles touch each other. Replace the paper towels every 2 days. Try to avoid storing truffles in plastic bags. This can cause them to rot, get slimy, or mold.
