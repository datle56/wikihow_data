      "content": "Don’t let your enemy see you upset. The main thing a bully wants is to get a reaction from their target. Don’t give them the satisfaction. Next time your enemy starts trying to push your buttons, take a few deep breaths, count to 10 backwards, or do whatever it takes to help you find your peaceful place. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Cameron Gibson, R.C.C. Registered Clinical Counsellor & Men's Mental Health Expert Expert Interview. 10 February 2021. It’s totally natural to get angry or upset when someone is mistreating you. The trick is not to show it. If you feel like you’re about to lose your cool, calmly excuse yourself or just walk away, then let your feelings out when they’re not around to see it. If you’re dealing with a rival in a work or business setting, keep your cool and stay professional. Ultimately, you’ll come out looking (and feeling) a lot better than they will. Staying calm and cool lets the bully know that they have no power over you. [3] X Expert Source Cameron Gibson, R.C.C.

      "content": "But do it in a civil, unemotional way. You probably grew up hearing that you should ignore bullies. But looking the other way when someone is mistreating you seldom works—instead, it just gives them the idea that it’s okay to keep acting that way. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Instead, confront them about their behavior and calmly tell them that you won’t stand for it. [5] X Research source In his famous treatise The Art of War , the ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu said, “When I wish to avoid battle, I may defend myself simply by drawing a line on the ground.” [6] X Research source Keep it simple and let your enemy know where your boundaries are. Say something like, “That’s not acceptable,” or “Don’t talk to me that way.” Avoid using emotional language or saying anything that makes them feel like they’ve gotten the reaction they’re looking for. For instance, don’t say something like, “You’re ruining my life,” or “You make me so angry!” If they’re lying about you to someone else, calmly correct them and back it up with evidence. For instance, if a coworker tries to pin the blame on you for a project falling apart, say something like, “Actually, that’s not true. I filed my forms on time. Here’s my email with the timestamps on it.”"

      "content": "This sneaky psychological tactic can be very disarming. Next time your enemy tries to push you around, do your best to make and hold eye contact. It makes you look more confident, which might be enough to throw them off their stride. Plus, they’ll be forced to really see you—and maybe think twice about being so unkind. [7] X Research source Looking them in the eyes and laughing or smiling can be especially effective. If they’re trying to get you upset, that’s not the reaction they’ll be expecting!"

Go to source Talk to some other people you trust about what’s going on, whether they’re family members, friends, or people in your professional support network. If your enemy sees that you have a bunch of other people in your corner, they’re more likely to back down and leave you alone.

You could confront them as a group or go together to report their behavior to someone in charge. [10] X Expert Source Cameron Gibson, R.C.C. Registered Clinical Counsellor & Men's Mental Health Expert Expert Interview. 10 February 2021. If your enemy is a bully, they’ll want you to feel powerless and isolated.

      "content": "Don’t let them get away with abusive behavior. If you can prove that your rival has been harassing, bullying, or lying about you, use that against them. Next time they try to pull something, write it down. If they harass you over text or email, keep a copy or snag a screenshot. If there are witnesses, even better! Ask them to back you up. If possible, report their behavior to somebody who can do something about it—and show them the evidence. [12] X Research source [13] X Expert Source Cameron Gibson, R.C.C. Registered Clinical Counsellor & Men's Mental Health Expert Expert Interview. 10 February 2021. For example, if you’re dealing with a workplace bully, document their behavior and report it to your boss or HR. At school, you can go to your teacher or the principal. If you think your enemy is doing something illegal or unethical, report them to the appropriate authorities, whether that’s the police, their supervisor, or a professional organization they belong to. But don’t do this lightly! Be ready to show evidence to back up your accusations."

      "content": "Sometimes, all you have to do is sit back and wait. Is your enemy posting nasty things about you online? Are they being unprofessional, picking fights, or constantly breaking the rules? If so, let their actions speak for themselves instead of trying to directly respond or engage. There’s a good chance that they’ll eventually face the natural consequences of their actions. [14] X Research source For example, if an angry ex is saying nasty things about you on Facebook, don’t respond directly to their posts. Just quietly block them (and unfriend them, if you haven’t already). If you have to, you can always address anything false that they said about you in your own post. Stepping away from the situation can also give you a chance to calm down and think of the best approach to take. If you try to react to their behavior while you’re still upset, it could just end up making things worse. Of course, if they’re doing something overtly harmful, such as threatening or hurting you or someone else, it’s a good idea to report their behavior. But try not to engage with them directly."

On the other hand, a true enemy will hate to see you happy and successful, which means that living your best life is the best way to defeat them! [15] X Research source A few ways you can do this include: Focusing on self-care. Do things that you find enjoyable, relaxing, and fulfilling. Spending more time with friends and other people who lift you up instead of bringing you down. Making a list of your strengths and positive qualities. Repeating an empowering mantra to yourself (e.g., “I am fierce. I am powerful. I am unstoppable.”)."

Go to source Maybe they’re always trying to undermine your confidence by telling you that you can’t succeed at something. Turn that around on them by working even harder to achieve your goal. Your victory will be extra sweet! You can also look at their behavior as a learning opportunity. For instance, if they’re always picking on other people, use that as a guide for now not to behave."

If you’re not sure, avoid making guesses or trying to get inside their head. It’s possible that they don’t even realize what kind of effect their behavior is having on you. Ask yourself things like: [17] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If they criticize me, is the criticism constructive or destructive ? Do they apologize or try to change their behavior when I tell them I don’t like what they’re doing, or do they minimize my feelings and continue doing it? Are they actively doing anything to try to harm me, or do they just seem to dislike me? Remember, someone who’s not your friend or who doesn’t agree with you isn’t necessarily an enemy! It’s okay for people to disagree or dislike each other—it only becomes a problem if they’re actually trying to hurt you in some way."
