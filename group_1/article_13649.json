      "title": "No, you don’t have to check out of a hotel.",
      "content": "No, you don’t have to check out of a hotel. As hotels become increasingly digital (with some letting you unlock your room door with your phone), stopping by the front desk to drop off an actual room key isn’t as common anymore. Since the hotel should already have your name and payment information, you can still be charged accordingly even if you don’t officially “check out.” Even though you don’t have to formally check out, most hotels have a specific check-out deadline, so be sure to keep that in mind. Ultimately, check-in and check-out policies vary by hotel. It’s always good to check your hotel’s official policy before you leave. For instance, if your hotel still hands out old-fashioned room keys, you’ll likely need to return them before you head out. Make sure to leave your key card in the hotel room before you leave. Many hotels let you ask for a late check-out time, but this might cost extra."

      "content": "You can make sure your final bill is accurate. During a hotel stay, it’s easier than you’d think to get extra charges added to your final bill. By checking out manually, you can look at your final cost with a hotel employee and iron out any discrepancies before you leave (e.g., if you have the right credit/debit card on file). Checking out is also handy if you participate in the hotel’s loyalty/rewards program. At check-out, you can ensure that you’re getting credited for your stay."

      "content": "It gives hotel staff the go-ahead to clean your old room. While hotel staff will eventually clean your room regardless, clearly checking out with the hotel lets staff members know for sure that your room is vacant and ready to be cleaned. From there, staff can tidy up your room and get it ready for a new guest more efficiently."

      "title": "Stop by the front desk as you’re leaving.",
      "content": "Stop by the front desk as you’re leaving. Return your hotel key (if necessary), and go over your final bill before you leave. If you have any questions or concerns about extra charges, mention them to the desk clerk to iron them out. For instance, you might see a charge for Wi-Fi, even though you never connected your devices. By checking out on-site, you can get that charge cleared up without having to call the hotel back later. If you stay at a certain hotel chain frequently using their loyalty program, you can eventually qualify for “elite” status. [1] X Research source This may let you use a different check-out counter as you leave, which can save you some time."

      "title": "Check out using your hotel’s app if they have that feature.",
      "content": "Check out using your hotel’s app if they have that feature. Plenty of hotels have apps designed to optimize your stay. Some chains and resorts even have the check-out process built into the app, so you don’t have to stop by the check-out desk when you leave."

    {
      "title": "Give the front desk a call.",
      "content": "Give the front desk a call. Double-check your hotel’s check-out policy, as some places may let you call the front desk and check out from your room. This can be handy if you’d like to multi-task while packing up your things—if you call as you pack up your room, you can leave and head to your car without making any extra stops at the front desk."

    {
      "title": "Use your hotel room TV to check out if that option is available.",
      "content": "Use your hotel room TV to check out if that option is available. In some hotels (e.g., some Las Vegas resorts), the TV is programmed with a function that lets you check out from your room. If your hotel offers this feature, feel free to use it instead of stopping by the front desk."

      "title": "Leave without consulting the front desk.",
      "content": "Leave without consulting the front desk. When all is said and done, you don’t have to stop by the front desk if you don’t want to, especially if you’re confident that your stay will be charged to the correct card and not have any extra fees. Simply head out to your car without making any stops in the lobby. Be sure to leave your key in the room before you leave for the last time."

      "title": "Typically by late morning, but it depends on the hotel.",
      "content": "Typically by late morning, but it depends on the hotel. Each hotel has its own policy regarding check-out times (including late check-outs), so it’s always best to consult your individual hotel’s website when planning your upcoming stay. As a general rule of thumb, anticipate that your hotel’s check-out time will be around 11 AM or 12 PM, but don’t be surprised if it’s slightly different than this. [2] X Research source Some hotels may let you request a late check-out, but this may cost extra. If your hotel doesn’t offer late check-outs and you have a late flight, see if you can stash your luggage at the hotel, at a nearby luggage locker, or in the trunk of your rental car. You can always hang out in the hotel lobby or at a nearby coffee shop in the meantime, or head to the airport a few hours ahead of time."
