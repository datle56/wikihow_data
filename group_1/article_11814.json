      "content": "Decide if it's verbal abuse or normal behavior. Conflict is a normal part of any relationship, but verbal abuse is not. If an argument always feels one-sided, if there are threats involved, and if your parents humiliate or demean you, a fight qualifies as verbal abuse. Some examples of verbally abusive statements are: “Hey, fatso, come over here!” This counts as humiliation. “If you didn't make me mad, I wouldn't have to treat you like this.” “Don't you dare do that or I'll punch you!” Threats are always abuse."

      "content": "Remove yourself from the situation. Shouting makes people angry, so revisiting the problem in 20 minutes or even the next morning is sometimes the only way to calm down. [4] X Research source If your parents think you are just avoiding them, tell them you need a break. Say, “Can we please talk about this in a half an hour?” Ask politely, “Please, can I sit in the other room for a few minutes?” Tell them, “I really want to talk about this tomorrow.”"

      "content": "Practice deep breathing. Regain control of yourself by breathing deeply. The best way to do this is to go in a different room away from your parents.

Be sincere and honest about what you did wrong and how you will improve in the future. Don't make excuses for something you did. Taking responsibility for your actions is a very adult thing to do.

      "content": "Change your behavior. Once you figure out why your parents are shouting at you, before shouting is necessary, change your behavior so your parents approve of it. This is the safest tactic and the most beneficial in the long run. Most parents will appreciate you trying to act differently. For example, if your parents shout when you don't do your homework, do your homework every day. Clean your room if they are shouting about you being messy. If your parents say you have an attitude, try to be more respectful."

They might shout about the way you dress, the color you want to paint your bedroom, or even the food you eat. [6] X Research source Compromising a little bit can go a long way. Tell your parents something is important to you: “I really want to paint my walls red because I think the color is beautiful.” Offer a compromise: “Ok, what if I eat healthy for two meals a day instead of only one?” Ask them to meet you in the middle: “I really don't want to wear baggy jeans. Can't I wear tight jeans some of the time?”"
