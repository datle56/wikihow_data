[1] X Research source Take out the Wooden Planks. Wood can be found by destroying trees. You can destroy trees with an axe but it is also possible to punch them to obtain wood, although this takes significantly longer."

This has the added bonus of creating a new spawn point, after which you will always spawn next to your bed after death. Keep in mind that the wool has to be the same color since colored beds are now added. After the village and pillage update of Minecraft, villagers began breeding based on the number of beds in the village. [4] X Research source In the new version, villagers breed as long as there is an open bed within the village. [5] X Research source Besides this, villagers also breed based on willingness, which the player can manipulate by giving the villagers specific food amounts. [6] X Research source"
