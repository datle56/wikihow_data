      "content": "Exercise. Doing something that is good for your health can keep your mind off of cutting. It also allows you to have control of your body in a positive way. Exercising can also help to release stress, anxiety, anger, and other emotions you usually use cutting to help with. If you got into an argument with your friend, physical activity can be a positive replacement to cutting. Walk, run, bike, lift weights, take a yoga class, or participate in any physical activity to distract yourself. [1] X Research source This will be more effective if you get involved in a structured exercise routine, such as working out with a trainer or training for a 5K. Don't work out only when you feel like cutting because this will not help to prevent anxiety the way that a regular exercise routine will."

Engaging in this type of activity will not only stop you from hurting yourself, but you may come out with a treasured work of art or delicious meal. Reader Poll: We asked 2539 wikiHow readers what their go-to self-care activity is, and only 4% of them said Baking and cooking. [Take Poll] Baking or cooking isn't the first type of self-care that comes to mind for most people, possibly because cooking takes organization and work. But studies show that cooking for yourself stimulates positive brain chemicals!"
