      "content": "Tell your mother that the Pokémon on the TV was \"Blue\". This will enable Latios to be found in Hoenn.

      "title": "Make preparations before starting the hunt.",
      "content": "Make preparations before starting the hunt. Latios can be an incredibly difficult Pokémon to catch, as it tries to escape on every turn, forcing you to hunt it down again. Make sure you're prepared before starting your hunt, and it'll make catching Latios much easier."

    {
      "title": "Save your Master Ball.",
      "content": "Save your Master Ball. If you haven't used your Master Ball, this is one of the best uses for it in the game. The Master Ball will instantly catch Latios when you use it, making it the most efficient way to catch it. If you have a Master Ball, you don't really need to worry about any other preparations, and can skip down to the next section. If you don't have your Master Ball anymore, read on."

    {
      "title": "Train a Gengar or Crobat (Option 1).",
      "content": "Train a Gengar or Crobat (Option 1). Latios is an incredibly fast Pokémon, and if you want to have a chance to capture it without a Master Ball, you'll need a Pokémon with a high enough speed that it can act first. Not only that, you'll need a Pokémon that can learn the skill \"Mean Look\". Gengar and Crobat are two of the best candidates that meet both requirements. Train your Gengar or Crobat up to at least Level 50. This will ensure that they have enough speed to beat Latios. When leveling up your Gengar or Crobat, make sure that you don't forget the Mean Look skill. Gengar learns it at Level 13, while Crobat learns it at Level 42. If you want to use the Super Repel trick to make finding Latios easier (see below), use Gengar and keep it at Level 39."

      "content": "Find a Wobbuffet (Option 2). Another strategy for catching Latios is to use Wobbuffet, who has the Shadow Tag ability. This prevents the enemy Pokémon from escaping. Train Wobbuffet to Level 39 to use the Super Repel trick (see below). Make sure that Wobbuffet is the first Pokémon in your party so that it can trap Latios."

The best way to do this without risking knocking out Latios is by using a Pokémon with the False Swipe ability. This will lower the enemy Pokémon's health but will never take it below 1 HP. This will ensure that you don't knock Latios out. It will also help to have a Pokémon with the Paralyze ability to help keep Latios trapped."

Have a friend trade you their Latios, and then trade it back right away. You simply need to receive it in a trade in order for it to appear in your Pokédex."

Make sure to use your trap ability (Shadow Tag, Mean Look) as soon as the battle begins. If you have Wobbuffet, Mirror Coat is very useful as Latios uses a lot of Special Attacks. Use Paralyze to help keep Latios from fleeing. Use False Swipe to get Latios down to 1 HP. Start throwing Ultra Bars as soon as Latios's health is low."

The Eon Ticket was a special event item that was distributed to players, which allowed players to access a special island where they can catch Latios or Latias, depending on which one they released. Since the ticket is no longer available, you'll need to use cheat codes to get it. To use Gameshark codes, you'll need to be using an emulator like Visual Boy Advance . While there are codes to get Latios directly, it's recommended that you use the ticket instead. When you add Pokémon using codes, they can be fairly buggy, so use the ticket instead and catch the Latios as the game expects you to.
