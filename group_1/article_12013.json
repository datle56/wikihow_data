[1] X Research source While the person may gain better coping skills with age, it's likely that they will be sensitive for all their lives. In some cases, the person might wish they were less sensitive, or that they could turn it on and off at will. However, there's no way to do this."

      "content": "Recognize that life can be tough for sensitive people. Highly sensitive people may have to cope with a world that can feel jarring, overwhelming, and uncaring. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source They may struggle to cope with strong emotions. Sounds, lights, smells, and tastes may feel more intense, which can be overwhelming.

      "title": "Accept that they're going to be sensitive no matter what.",
      "content": "Accept that they're going to be sensitive no matter what. People can change to some extent, but core traits of their physiology and personality are here to stay. [6] X Research source If you're trying to help the person (like if they're your child), then focus on helping them gain coping mechanisms and skills, instead of trying to make them less sensitive. You can't \"fix\" the sensitivity, but you can help them learn to cope with it better."

      "title": "Try asking them about their sensitivity.",
      "content": "Try asking them about their sensitivity. Understanding what they're sensitive to can help you better understand how to avoid problems and help them be comfortable. Try asking politely about their sensitivities, and practical ways to adjust. Here are some examples: \"You mentioned that loud noises bother you. Would you prefer to eat outside, instead of in the crowded cafeteria?\" \"I noticed that you covered your eyes when I opened the blinds. Do bright lights often bother you?\" \"I saw that you got pale when Richard started talking about details of his surgery. Are medical things an upsetting topic to you?\""

      "content": "Keep a gentle and patient attitude. Sensitive people best respond to a calm, gentle, non-threatening tone of voice. A warm and encouraging attitude can help them get along well with you. [7] X Research source If you want to persuade them, go for an encouraging and supportive tone. This is better than being pushy, which can make them shut down. Sensitive people may be easily rattled by an impatient or aggressive attitude. If you're losing your cool, try taking a break, and apologizing if you upset them."

      "content": "Set them up for success. Don't push the sensitive person to do things that are likely to make them overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Instead, try to help them feel comfortable and make things easy. If a tough environment can't be helped, then see if things like headphones or longer breaks would make it easier. For example, instead of hanging out in a crowded mall, they might prefer getting takeout to eat at the park."

Keep in mind that sensitivity is not a choice, and the person is probably doing the best they can to cope with the situation they're in. Avoid rude comments like: \"Why are you so sensitive?\" \"You're too sensitive!\" \"You're just doing this for attention.\" \"Get over yourself.\" \"Stop being so dramatic.\" \"You need therapy to fix this problem.\""

I don't mind.\" \"Take as long as you need to calm down. There's no rush.\" \"Of course you're hurt.

Or you may feel upset because you care about them and it's hard to watch them struggle. You're allowed to feel this way. Take some quiet time to sort through your emotions, or talk to a trusted mentor about what's going on. Never take out your feelings on the sensitive person. They're doing the best they can (just like you are), and it's important to stay kind. If you do mess up and treat them unkindly, don't beat yourself up.

It's hard for me to figure out a time to do laundry that works for both of us. Could we talk about a good laundry schedule?\" \"It hurts my feelings when people tease me about my bald spot. I know we do friendly teasing sometimes, and I'm okay with that. Let's just keep that part off-limits, okay?\" \"I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings when I made that comment about your picture. It was thoughtless of me. I'll try to be more considerate of your feelings in the future.\""
