      "content": "Remove the used pad from your underwear and roll it up. When you’re ready to change your pad , carefully remove it from your underwear. Roll the pad up tightly and neatly, starting from one end and working your way to the other. Roll it up so that the soiled part is on the inside, and the adhesive part is on the outside. Rolling up your pad will make it easier to wrap and minimize the space it takes up in the garbage."

      "content": "Wrap the pad in a piece of paper. Wrapping your pad will make it more sanitary and help keep odors contained. Use a piece of newspaper, toilet paper, or waste paper to carefully wrap your rolled-up pad. [1] X Research source You can also use the wrapper from a fresh pad to wrap up your used pad. If the wrapper has an adhesive tab on it, use that to help keep the wrapped pad secure."

      "content": "Put the wrapped pad in the garbage can. Once the pad is wrapped, toss it in the bathroom garbage. If possible, use a garbage can or bin with a lid. This will help keep any odors from the pad contained. [2] X Research source Never flush your pad, wrapper, or paper liner down the toilet. Doing so will clog the plumbing. Preferably, you should put the pad in a garbage can with a bag or liner. This will make it easier to dispose of the pads and other garbage when it’s time to take out the trash. Some public bathrooms have small trash cans or metal disposal bins in each stall where you can dispose of pads or tampons."

This will help prevent the spread of germs and rinse away any menstrual blood that may have gotten on your hands.

      "content": "Take out the garbage bag with the used pad in it as soon as possible. If you allow used pads to sit in the garbage too long, they may start to smell bad or even attract bugs. If you’ve disposed of one or more pads in your own garbage can, take out the garbage as soon as you can and dispose of the bag in an outdoor trash can or dumpster. [5] X Research source Tie up the garbage bag to keep the smell in and prevent the used pads from attracting bugs or other animals."

      "content": "Purchase a disposal bag designed for period products. Check online or in your drug store for disposal bags designed for this purpose. You may be able to find them in the menstrual (or \"feminine\") hygiene section, along with pads and tampons. Popular brands include Scensibles and Fab Little Bag. You can also use diaper disposal bags. Many of these products are biodegradable, making them more environmentally friendly than regular plastic bags. Some public bathrooms have dispensers that provide disposal bags."

You will need to roll or fold the pad up enough so that it can easily fit inside your disposal bag.
