      "content": "Take the soup out of the freezer and put it into a microwave-safe bowl. Turn the bowl upside down and look for a label that should say “Microwave-safe” or “Heatproof”. If the soup is already in a microwave-safe bowl, then remove the lid and cover the container with a plastic wrap that is also microwave safe. [1] X Research source Glass and ceramic bowls are usually microwave-safe. Never put metal or aluminum bowls or dishes in the microwave. You can use wax or parchment paper instead of plastic wrap."

      "title": "Place the container in the microwave and heat on a medium-low setting.",
      "content": "Place the container in the microwave and heat on a medium-low setting. Microwave the soup on 30% power for about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the container, stir the soup and continue microwaving until the ice is melted and the soup is hot. To adjust the power level, enter the cook time first and then press the “Power” button. The reduced power will allow your soup to defrost evenly. If you are heating with glass or ceramic, the container may be hot. Use an oven mitt or heat-resistant glove to remove from the microwave."

      "title": "Use a food thermometer to test the temperature of the soup.",
      "content": "Use a food thermometer to test the temperature of the soup. Remove the container from the microwave. Place a food thermometer into the soup and check that the temperature is 165 °F (74 °C) to make sure that it is safe to eat. Don't make contact with the bottom or sides of the bowl, this will give an incorrect temperature reading. If you don't have a thermometer on hand, you can use a knife. Insert the knife into the center of the bowl. The soup is warm enough to eat when the knife is hot when removed."

      "title": "Place the container in a kitchen sink and fill the sink with warm water.",
      "content": "Place the container in a kitchen sink and fill the sink with warm water. Put the container into the sink and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes or until the ice starts to melt. The soup is warm when it starts to separate from the sides of the container. [2] X Research source Soup stored in a glass may need extra time to defrost to make it easier to remove. If stored in a bag, let the soup sit in the sink until you can squeeze the bag and the soup breaks into pieces."

    {
      "title": "Remove the container from the sink and pour the soup into a pot.",
      "content": "Remove the container from the sink and pour the soup into a pot. Find a pot that is big enough to hold the soup and 1 cup of extra water. Place the pot on the stove and add ¼ cup of warm water. Stir the water into the soup. It’s best to add water to the pot because soup absorbs water when it’s frozen. This is also a great time to add additional seasonings to give the soup a fresh flavor. Try adding a little lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and fresh herbs. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Heat the soup on the stove and stir often.",
      "content": "Heat the soup on the stove and stir often. Cover the pot with a heat-resistant lid and warm the soup on medium-low heat. Stir every 30 seconds to keep the soup from burning. A thick-bottomed pot works best for heating soup because it evenly distributes heat. If you happen to burn the soup, do not scrape the bottom. Instead, pour the soup into a different pot and reheat."
