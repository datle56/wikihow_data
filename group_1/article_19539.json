      "content": "Look at the color and location of the blister to determine if it's a cold sore. Cold sores, also called fever blisters, are caused by the herpes virus and are very contagious. They develop most often on the lips, starting as a red patch and becoming a fluid-filled blister that may be light-colored at the center. They often feel painful, though your pain will fade over the 4-5 days after the onset of the cold sore.

[2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Cold sores can have 1 or several fluid-filled bumps that are red around the base and ooze pus when they break. As the blisters burst and dry, they'll likely look crusty. Along with a cold sore, you may experience a fever, body aches, fatigue, and enlarged lymph nodes.
