      "content": "Understand golf carts. Golf carts are classified under Neighborhood Electric Vehicles. Despite the vehicle's name, golf carts are used off golf courses for a variety of reasons. Golf carts fall between 15-35 mph top speed by regulation standards. You must be 14 years of age or older to drive a golf cart. You don’t need a license to drive a golf cart. Depending on what state or county you live in, you may need a permit to operate a golf cart. [1] X Research source Most state's allow an unlicensed driver to drive on private roads, but not on main roads for long distances. It's okay to cross an intersection of a main road. You'll need a license to drive on public roads. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the key.",
      "content": "Use the key. Like the golf cart’s older cousin, the automobile, you will need a key to start it. Insert the key in the key slot and turn it to the right. You probably won’t hear a loud startup like you would for a car. Most golf carts run on electricity and the key merely turns the battery on. You may also see a reverse setting, but set the key to forward motion. Some golf carts run on gasoline and electricity. These carts will start up with a familiar engine sound."

      "title": "Put your seat belt on.",
      "content": "Put your seat belt on. Although the golf carts do not run too fast, it’s still a good idea to buckle up. Some carts won’t exceed 14 mph and therefore don’t have seat belts. Be sure that any young children riding with you know to remain seated. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Accelerate.",
      "content": "Accelerate. Once everyone is seated, you’re ready to accelerate in the golf cart. [4] X Research source Use your foot to press down on the thin, right pedal. [5] X Research source The pedal is sensitive to the amount of pressure you use. Start with mild pressure using your foot to get a feeling for the handle of the golf cart. Once you understand how the cart operates, add more pressure to the pedal. Do not floor the acceleration pedal upon startup. Increase the pressure and speed with your foot on the pedal gradually."

    {
      "title": "Use the brake.",
      "content": "Use the brake. Take your foot off the acceleration pedal and press it on the wider pedal. [6] X Research source This is the same setup for automobiles with the left pedal, usually the widest pedal, activates the vehicle's brakes. Don’t slam on the brake unless you absolutely have to. For normal use, ease onto the break much like you use the acceleration pedal."

    {
      "title": "Drive backwards.",
      "content": "Drive backwards. To go backwards, pull or turn the switch on your cart and use the acceleration pedal. Most golf carts will not go as fast using the backwards setting. Turn your body by putting your right arm around the back of the passenger seat. This position will allow you to see everything behind you."

    {
      "title": "Drive at night.",
      "content": "Drive at night. It is important to take extra precautions when driving at night. Before driving at night, make sure your golf cart is equipped with headlights, brake lights, turn signals and reflective devices. If you don’t have these safety measures on your vehicle, reconsider driving at night or consider investing into your cart."

    {
      "title": "Understand the rules of the road.",
      "content": "Understand the rules of the road. Golf carts are not allowed on any road with a posted speed that exceeds 35 mph. This is for the safety of the golf cart and the other cars on the road. Aside from safety measures, golf carts can cause unexpected traffic which could lead to aggravated drivers. Over half the states don't allow golf carts on public roads. For safety measures, golf carts cannot be on roads above 35 mph. Your golf cart needs to be able to go 25 mph to access public roads. These are the current list of states that allow golf carts on public roads: CA, NV, AZ, NM, CO, WY, IL, MN, IA, FL, GA and TX. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the horn.",
      "content": "Use the horn. The horn is another practical safety measure. It is especially efficient used at intersections. While the horn isn’t encouraged on the golf course, it is great for off the course. This can help pedestrians and other golfers to watch out for your cart. Try not to use the horn with malice towards another player."

    {
      "title": "Slow down when turning.",
      "content": "Slow down when turning. Just like with automobiles, you need to slow down when turning your cart. Even turning at a speed of 11 mph can project a passenger from the golf cart. Golf carts don’t have doors and some don’t even have seatbelts. Keep your passengers and yourself safe by slowing down significantly before turning. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider insurance.",
      "content": "Consider insurance. There is never a guarantee you won’t injure someone if you own a golf cart. Many insurance agencies will offer a wide insurance plan that covers vehicles like segways, golf carts and snowmobiles. Insurance will help you pay for medical bills and damage to your vehicle."
