If another date doesn't come about, you may feel rejected, but this proves that you were just not meant to be. Being honest and being true to yourself can help you avoid wasting time while dating. Furthermore, acting the way you think your suitor wants you to act rather than being yourself can foster feelings of resentment, stress, and discomfort.

Keep adding to the list because everyday you could learn something positive or negative about your suitor. After a fight take a look at the list. It may help you appreciate what you have, or realize what you're lacking. This is a great exercise to put your relationship into a logical perspective. It may come in handy in times of stress. You might realize it's not your partner making you miserable, it's actually, for example, your job or your diet. This can also be helpful when you're looking for someone to date—make a list of the qualities you want, as well as your deal-breakers. However, it's important to remember that no single person is going to be 100% of what you're looking for. However, if you're open and willing to compromise, you should be able to find someone who meets most of what you're looking for.
