      "title": "Use the #1 dating app for users 13-19 years old.",
      "content": "Use the #1 dating app for users 13-19 years old. MyLOL markets itself as the #1 teen dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. It is the only app that is exclusive to teenagers, as you must be 13 years old to create an account and cannot be over 19. The app is available for both iOS and Android. As with any other app, be careful interacting with strangers. Even with the 19-year-old limit, there may be older users posing as a teenager."

      "title": "Find people near you with Skout.",
      "content": "Find people near you with Skout. Skout began by allowing users 13-17 years old to create an account. Now, the app separates those teenage users from its 18+ community, creating a safer environment. Users must verify their age by connecting through Facebook, limiting (but not quite eliminating) the number of impostors. [1] X Research source Teens also are unable to take advantage of Skout's search feature. The app remains GPS-based, but will not reveal to teens the exact location of others."

      "title": "Livestream and video chat others on Yubo.",
      "content": "Livestream and video chat others on Yubo. Yubo is a social networking app designed to facilitate face-to-face interaction. The company partners with Snapchat to incorporate the Snap Inc. camera kit into the app. Livestreaming with up to 10 other users is the main functionality, but you can also video chat and swipe right on profiles. Like Skout, Yubo separates its 13-17 community from its 18+ community."

      "title": "Older teens may consider using one of the most popular online dating apps.",
      "content": "Older teens may consider using one of the most popular online dating apps. Bumble is among the most popular dating apps out there, but it does not offer a specific teenage community. You must be 17+ to join. Of course, many younger teenagers do still join the app by lying about their age. We do not recommend doing so, but 17-year-olds may still decide to join if they are safe and responsible in their online interactions. It may be tempting to join a dating app by lying about your age, but there are several ways in which it might hinder your experience: Other users may realize you are younger and quickly unmatch. Other users may report you, which could lead to your expulsion from the app altogether. When you do finally reach an appropriate age, you will not be able to edit the age on your account, so you will always be 2-3 years off from your actual age."

      "title": "Join the MeetMe community to find users near you.",
      "content": "Join the MeetMe community to find users near you. MeetMe offers a map functionality that allows its users to find people nearby. It is reserved for users 18+, but it does have a sizable teenage community anyway. We recommend teens to wait until they are 18 to create an account. Teenagers should consider hiding their location while using the app, only seeking out others that they trust."

      "title": "Turn chance encounters into romance with Happn.",
      "content": "Turn chance encounters into romance with Happn. The Happn app uses uniquely specific GPS information to notify you when you have crossed paths with another Happn user. You can then decide whether or not you want to send that user a like. Happn has a burgeoning teenage community, but it does include more sexual and graphic content than similar dating apps, so parents may decide to monitor their child's Happn use more closely."

      "title": "Find the perfect partner with Coffee Meets Bagel.",
      "content": "Find the perfect partner with Coffee Meets Bagel. Coffee Meets Bagel is unique from other dating apps in that it only offers a select few users for you to \"like\" each day. These are your \"bagels\" and they are uniquely tailored to your profile and preferences. While the app is limited to users 17+, it offers one of the more robust reporting systems, granting teenagers and their parents peace of mind in case of contact with an undesirable user."
