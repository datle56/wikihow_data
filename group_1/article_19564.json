      "content": "Freshen up your living space with a homemade deodorizer. Dump 1 cup (272 g) of baking soda into a clean mason jar, as well as 15 drops of your desired essential oil . To really boost the fresh scent, mix in 1 tsp (2 g) of dried herbs (like rosemary or basil ), too. Replace the lid and shake everything together to incorporate it all together; then, pour the mixture into a bowl and set it out in the fume-filled room until the bad smell goes away. [5] X Research source Make multiple bowls of this deodorizing mixture to achieve max benefits. Don’t have any herbs or essential oils lying around? Set out a few dishes of plain baking soda instead."

      "content": "The onion slices help eliminate the paint stench from your space. Peel away the outer layer of a medium- or large-sized white or yellow onion. Slice each onion in half, placing each chunk cut-side-up in a bowl.

      "title": "Diatomaceous earth is a popular household deodorizer.",
      "content": "Diatomaceous earth is a popular household deodorizer. Pour food-grade diatomaceous earth into containers and set them around the room. Any leftover or unused containers you have lying around your home work well for this. Set the containers out in the smelly room, leaving them out until the stench clears away. Diatomaceous earth is most commonly used for small-scale deodorizing projects, like airing out a pair of shoes or refrigerator, but there’s no harm in using it for larger-scale projects, like a living space. [8] X Research source The FDA considers diatomaceous earth as a “generally safe” product, but still opt for the food-grade variety whenever you can, as it’s gone through a purification process."
