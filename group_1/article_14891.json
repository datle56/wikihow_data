For thin matcha (\"Usucha\" in Japanese), use 1 tsp. (5 g) of matcha and 2 oz. (60 ml) of boiling water. For thick matcha (\"Koicha\" in Japanese), use 2 tsp. (10 g) of matcha and 1.4 oz.

Move in a quick, back-and-forth motion as if you were drawing the letter W or M. Use your wrist instead of your arm. Whisk the surface of the tea when it has small bubbles until a thick froth appears. For Koicha, move in a slow kneading motion from left to right as well as up and down. Since you're not aiming for froth, gently rotate the whisk in a 360 motion to achieve a thick, smooth, and even consistency."
