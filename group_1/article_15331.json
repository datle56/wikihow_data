      "content": "Eat broccoli raw to get the most nutrients out of it. Broccoli contains a compound called sulforaphane, which has been shown to help prevent cancer and promotes detoxification in the body. Your body absorbs more sulforaphane from raw broccoli than from cooked broccoli because cooking it locks some of the compound in. [1] X Research source Broccoli is also high in fiber, potassium, iron, vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin B-6, and vitamin A. It contains more protein than other vegetables as well."
