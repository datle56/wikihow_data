This works because according to number theory, every integer (except -1, 0, and 1) has a number of prime numbers that, when multiplied together, will equal the number. Remember that 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. 72 should be factorized into 2 and 36, 2, 6, and 6, and finally, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, which equals 2 3 *3 2 ."
