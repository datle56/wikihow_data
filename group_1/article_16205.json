      "content": "Eyebrow blindness refers to being unaware that your brow style doesn’t quite flatter your face. The term became popular on TikTok in June 2024, when users began sharing photos of brow looks they regret wearing. [1] X Research source Users often ask in their videos, “Why didn’t anyone say anything?” or, “Why did my friends let me walk around like that?” Another version of the TikTok trend sees users diagnosing themselves with eyebrow blindness. They use a filter that shows them the ideal brows for their face shape [2] X Research source —the more differences between the filter brows and their current brows, the blinder they are."

      "content": "Eyebrow blindness is a symptom of blindly following trends. Your face shape and features may be suited to a current trend—but they might not be. It’s impossible for different brow styles like extreme plucking, lamination, and dramatic arches to suit everyone. Plus, beauty standards change over time, meaning what’s considered attractive today might be ridiculed tomorrow. This so-called blindness isn’t unique to eyebrow styling trends. Similar terms have gone viral on TikTok to describe other beauty regrets, including blush blindness [3] X Research source , highlighter blindness, money piece blindness, and lip filler blindness. This is also a consequence of your facial structure changing as you age. A brow style that looked good on your face at one point may not look good on your face as you get older."

      "content": "Over-plucked or bleached brows. The razor-thin brow look dominated the ‘90s and early ‘00s, inspired by icons like Drew Barrymore and Paris Hilton. The bleached brow is a more recent trend rocked by the likes of Mia Goth and Kendall Jenner. Those with more angular face shapes or larger features may claim eyebrow blindness when looking back on their time with skinny brows. These subtle brow styles are most flattering on individuals with round or oval face shapes and small, delicate facial features. [4] X Research source Of course, everyone’s face is different. Don’t feel discouraged from trying a trend because of your face shape or features—you never know what will work on you until you try."

      "content": "Over-arched block brows. The beauty gurus and influencers of the 2010s inspired many Millennials and Gen Zers to liberally apply tinted brow pomade. Now, TikTokers are claiming they had eyebrow blindness. The bold look doesn’t flatter everyone, but thankfully isn’t as permanent as over-plucking. Although natural, soft brows are the current trend, arched and thick brows could be ideal for your features. Block brows are especially suited to those with angular faces—such as a heart or triangle face shape. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fluffy soap brows. Many Gen Zers adopted the soap brow trend when it went viral in 2016. [6] X Research source The look involves using bar soap and a spoolie brush to press your brow hairs up for a lifted, feathery effect. You might feel you had eyebrow blindness if you over-separated your brows, regardless of how flattering the look was on you. While not suitable for every face shape, the fluffy look helps lengthen round and heart-shaped faces. [7] X Research source Its appeal also comes down to personal preferences for a soft versus a defined brow."

      "content": "Use a TikTok filter to test for eyebrow blindness. TikTok has an “eyebrow blindness filter” you can use to map out your ideal brow shape. Other filters on TikTok and Instagram allow you to try on different brow shapes and decide for yourself what looks best. You can also manually map your brows . This technique involves using a brow pencil or string to create an aesthetically pleasing brow shape customized to your features. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Reflect on why you chose your current brow style. Are you following eyebrow styling trends because they’re popular, instead of because you think they’ll suit you? Eyebrow blindness stems from trying to fit in without considering your own unique beauty and preferences. There’s nothing wrong with experimenting with trends—just prepare for some missteps as you figure out what works."

      "content": "Reflect on why you want to try a brow trend. The easiest way to prevent eyebrow blindness is to ask yourself what’s motivating you to make a change to your brows. You could get eyebrow blindness if you’re jumping on the bandwagon without taking your facial features and preferences into account. Some trends like over-plucking lead to drastic, irreversible changes in your brows’ appearance—be sure you understand the long-term effects of any brow styling trend before you commit to it."

      "content": "Accept that trends will change. People from Gen X to Gen Z have experienced eyebrow blindness. What they regret doing to their brows depends on which trends were popular when they were figuring out their personal style. Beauty trends change quickly—accept that, and you won’t feel too blinded when what once was cool is now considered cringe."
