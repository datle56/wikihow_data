For instance, take “10” from the tens category if the values in the ones category cannot be subtracted as they are. Example: Start with the ones category, followed by the tens, followed by the hundreds. 4 – 1 = 3 10 – 70; since “70” is larger than “10,” you'll need to take “100” from the “800” and add it to the “10,” making this equation: 110 – 70 = 40 700 – 500 = 200; the “800” became “700” when you took the “100” for the tens category"
