      "content": "Make plans that don’t depend on them. If you are throwing a birthday party, don’t have them bring the cake. If you will need a ride somewhere, ask another person who is more punctual."

    {
      "title": "Tell them an earlier time.",
      "content": "Tell them an earlier time. If you need them to arrive somewhere at 6PM, and they are typically more than two hours late, tell them to be there by 4PM. Be aware that should they actually arrive at 4PM, they will be upset with you for misleading them. [1] X Research source If they are upset, explain your reasoning in telling them the earlier time. Tell them that this event was time sensitive and you were afraid they would be late."

    {
      "title": "Help them if they are in need.",
      "content": "Help them if they are in need. If this person is late because they have a disability, are elderly, or have small children, don’t punish them. Instead, go over to assist them so they can be on time. Offer to pick them up if you are able."

    {
      "title": "Go with the flow when you can.",
      "content": "Go with the flow when you can. Sometimes, being on time is not always important. Who cares if you show up 30 minutes late to the party? And so what if you’re a bit later than expected for a beach outing. Pick your battles when the schedule is flexible. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use waiting time productively.",
      "content": "Use waiting time productively. The person who is late might be someone who you cannot avoid waiting on, like your boss. Find something to do to occupy your time so that you won’t be fretting over their lateness. Send emails, read a book, or catch up on any other work. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use extra time to relax.",
      "content": "Use extra time to relax. If you are always waiting for your spouse to get ready, but are in no particular rush, use this time to do something for yourself. Watch a show you’re behind on, read a magazine, or call and catch up with a friend."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk in private.",
      "content": "Talk in private. If this person is rarely late, consider letting it slide, but if it is more regular, a conversation is necessary. Once you notice a pattern of lateness, pull your employee or friend to the side to chat. The next time they are late, sit them down away from others to chat. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Voice your concerns.",
      "content": "Voice your concerns. Let them know how their lateness makes you feel. Tell them that your time is valuable, but you often find yourself waiting around on them. Ask them if they can be on time in the future or let you know well in advance if they’ll be late. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Say “When you’re late for these events, it’s really frustrating for me. When we go to the movies or to a show, we never get to see the whole thing and that’s unfair. Can you work on being on time in the future?”"

    {
      "title": "Listen and make exceptions when necessary.",
      "content": "Listen and make exceptions when necessary. Stay completely focused during this conversation. Stay off your phone and computer. Your employee or friend may be dealing with something difficult at home that is affecting their sleep and making them late to work or events. Work out a temporary schedule when necessary to accommodate this person if they are your employee. [6] X Research source For instance, you might allow them to come in late and stay later, as well. Give them a two week limit on this type of schedule so that other employees do not get jealous."

      "content": "Set a limit on how long you’ll wait. You may have waited an hour or longer for this person to meet you somewhere in the past. Let them know that from now on you will wait no longer than thirty minutes for them. Stick to your rule and go home or invite someone else if you have tickets to something. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Model punctuality.",
      "content": "Model punctuality. If you are working to encourage your employees or friends to be punctual, be sure always arrive on time each. When possible, arrive ten to fifteen minutes early. If you are regularly late, it will be harder for others to show up on time."

    {
      "title": "Set consequences.",
      "content": "Set consequences. If this person is late for no clear reason or if they continue to show up late after giving them chances, begin enforcing consequences. With your employees, you might write them up the next time they are late and make them aware that more than three write-ups could result in termination. [8] X Research source With friends, you might refuse to go with them to time sensitive events like concerts or movies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a less direct approach.",
      "content": "Try a less direct approach. Talking with someone who is chronically late and setting boundaries with consequences doesn’t work with everyone. Other approaches you could take include: Give your friend an earlier start time than everyone else. For example, if you are having a party, then you could give your friend a special invitation that specifies a start time 15 to 30 minutes earlier than everyone else’s invitation. Avoid inviting your friend to time sensitive events. Stick to activities where time is not an issue. Don’t do anything. Another option is to simply let your friend be late and allow them to deal with the consequences of that. For example, if you have a dinner party and your friend arrives late, then the might be naturally embarrassed if everyone is already there and halfway through the meal."

      "content": "Distance yourself if they are being a bad friend. If this person is missing major milestones in your life, then are they really a friend? If they are late for your wedding, graduation, or events for your children, then this person might not be a good friend to you. You don’t necessarily need to cut off the friendship, but spend less time together and share less details about your life. [10] X Research source If they are your employee, then it might be time to fire them."
