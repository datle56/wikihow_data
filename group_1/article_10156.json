Jot down any probable cause, from scents from outdoors to household products. Take your journal with you to work or social events. Such places can sometimes be ripe with unwanted scents that may trigger a reaction. Keeping your journal in a \"notes\" section on your smartphone can make it easy to access it."

      "content": "Seek a doctor's input. If you suffer from scent sensitivity, it's a good idea to talk to a doctor. Scent sensitivity is not just an inconvenience. It's a legitimate medical condition. It's well-documented that many people react with allergic reactions such as rashes in response to certain fragrance. While most people must have direct physical contact with a fragrance containing substance, some people's scent sensitivity is so severe they may break out into rashes just from inhaling a smell. Part of your medical evaluation may include blood work, urinalysis, pulmonary function testing, and evaluation for mood disorders (such as depression and/or anxiety). A simple patch test can be used to diagnose an allergy to a specific scent. Patches containing a potential irritant will be placed on your skin. After 48 hours, your doctor will remove such patches and examine your skin for a reaction. If you do have an allergy, your doctor can help you come up with an action plan for treatment. They may recommend medications or lifestyle changes that help you cope with scent sensitivity."

I don't want you to feel bad, and I'm sorry if it's an inconvenience, but I just want to be able to work effectively.\" If unwanted scents are a major issue at work, talk to your boss.
