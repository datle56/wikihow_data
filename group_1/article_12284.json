The flavor and quality will definitely deteriorate. [1] X Research source However, for the best quality, try to eat your cake within 6 months or so if it's not a wedding cake."

      "title": "Set the covered cake in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.",
      "content": "Set the covered cake in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. Start the thawing process in the refrigerator. Keep the cake in its wrappings, as you may damage it if you try to take it out at this point. [2] X Research source You can leave it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before eating. It may start to go stale after that."

    {
      "title": "Place the whole cake on the counter.",
      "content": "Place the whole cake on the counter. After it has thawed in the refrigerator, take it out about an hour before you want to eat it. That will help it come up to a good temperature for eating. [3] X Research source Keep it in the wrapping while it thaws on the counter, too."

      "title": "Remove the wrappings to eat the cake.",
      "content": "Remove the wrappings to eat the cake. If you prepped your cake well, it should have several layers of wrappings. Carefully peel off any plastic wrap or aluminum foil you used, as it may have stuck to the cake in places. [4] X Research source If the outside of the cake is unfrosted, you can frost it now as it thaws."

      "title": "Add decorations to the cake.",
      "content": "Add decorations to the cake. If you are using the cake for a party or centerpiece, smooth out the frosting with a knife. Add any decorations to the cake, as there shouldn't have been any on the cake when you froze it. If you froze the cake with decorations on it, they're likely smushed. You may need to do some damage control, such as scraping off iced decorations. Smooth out the icing, and top it with sprinkles or another decoration to hide the damage. Other decorations might bleed, like sprinkles. In that case, you might be able to swirl the colors into the cake frosting for a fun effect."

    {
      "title": "Use the cake within 2 months.",
      "content": "Use the cake within 2 months. While you can freeze cake layers for much longer, the quality will start to degrade after a few months. It will still be safe to eat for up to a year, though."

      "title": "Place the covered layers in the refrigerator overnight.",
      "content": "Place the covered layers in the refrigerator overnight. Like whole cakes, layers thaw best in the refrigerator. However, individual layers may defrost a bit faster than whole cakes, so you may get away with only 12-16 hours in the fridge instead of 24 hours. [5] X Research source Use the layers within 2 days, as they'll likely get stale after that."

    {
      "title": "Frost your cake straight from the fridge.",
      "content": "Frost your cake straight from the fridge. You don't need to let it warm up on the counter before you frost it. It will warm up while you're working with it. In fact, it's easier to frost a previously frozen cake layer because it doesn't create as many crumbs. After frosting, add any decorations you'd like, such as piping, sprinkles, or chocolate shavings. [6] X Research source It can still be lightly frozen in the center if you're frosting it on the counter. You may even be able to get away without doing a crumb layer of frosting."
