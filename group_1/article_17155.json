      "content": "If you feel less emotionally connected than before, it could be a red flag. Maybe you used to stay up late chatting in bed with your boyfriend. You talked about your day, you shared your feelings... and now that connection seems to have suddenly vanished. If he's suddenly emotionally withdrawing or seems distracted all the time, it's a possible sign he's investing his attention elsewhere, or that he's too ashamed to be emotionally intimate with you. [1] X Research source Not only will he withdraw from you, but he'll likely resist efforts on your end to get closer again. If you try to initiate pillow talk before sleep, he might insist he's too tired and roll over."

      "content": "If he’s cheating, he might show it by being extra defensive or extra happy. If he used to be pretty even-keeled and now gets randomly happy or unexpectedly upset, these mighty be indications something is going on. He could be excited about his lover, resentful of you for “standing in the way” of his new romance, or angry at himself for cheating. Pay attention to his mood to see if something is up. [2] X Research source When his mood shifts, ask him why. If he says, “No reason” or “Nothing,” he might be hiding something from you. Someone who's cheating may \"blame\" you for their infidelity or even accuse you of cheating. If it suddenly seems as if nothing you do is right, he might be projecting guilt onto you. [3] X Research source Of course, there are plenty of reasons a person could experience mood swings, and the reason may not be about you at all. He could be stressed about work or going through a period of depression—but he still needs to communicate with you about it."

      "content": "If he suddenly cares about his physique, it could be for his side piece. When you start to see someone new, it's common to want to look your best to impress them. If your man suddenly seems to care a lot more about his body than he did before, it's possible he's not doing it just for you. Unless he's suddenly determined to run a marathon (which he would probably tell you about), he could be trying to improve his body for another lady. [4] X Expert Source Michelle Jacoby Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. There are a number of totally legitimate reasons why your boyfriend might just start working out more out of the blue. After all, exercise is good for us! If it appears in conjunction with other signs on this list, though, suddenly working out is a potential red flag. Remember that going to the gym could also just be another excuse for seeing the other person. If he's dramatically changed his diet to be healthier, he could be doing this to impress someone else."

      "content": "He may be trying to look good for his side piece. Your man's appearance can say a lot about whether he's cheating. If he didn't care much about his appearance before, but now spends more time grooming than you do, then something may be up. He may be improving or changing his looks to please the person he's cheating with. [5] X Expert Source Michelle Jacoby Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Has he stepped up his fashion game? If his clothes have improved significantly, he could be trying to impress someone. If he suddenly always looks nice, even when he's supposed to be studying or working overtime, it could mean he’s seeing someone at work or school. A guy who’s involved with someone else might also smell different! He may be wearing new cologne to smell good for his side piece, but his body chemistry may also have changed slightly from being with another woman. He may also pick up smells and stray hairs from his affair partner: he might smell like perfume or cologne, if he’s seeing someone who wears a fragrance, and they may leave stray hairs on his body and clothes."

      "content": "A guy who’s no longer into you will become more physically avoidant. Read his body language to tell if he’s not as invested in your relationship as he used to be. If he’s not into you anymore, he might avoid holding your hand, kissing you, even making eye contact with you. [6] X Research source Some guys are uncomfortable with PDA, but if your guy used to hold your hand in public and has stopped, or has begun standing far away from you in public places, he may be worried that his other partner will spot you two together. Keep in mind that while a decrease in physical attention often indicates a lessening of romantic interest, it doesn’t necessarily mean he’s unfaithful. (Still, it’s not great news.)"

      "content": "A side piece may make him less horny…or more horny. If you and your boyfriend are sexually active, he may stop spending as much time in the bedroom with you if he's cheating—but cheating could also make him want to have more sex! His side piece may get him aroused and in the mood to have more sex with you than before. [7] X Research source If he’s suddenly trying a ton of new moves in bed, he could have picked these up from another sexual partner. An increase in sex may also be because he's afraid not having sex will make you suspicious. Aside from how often you're doing the deed, pay attention to your emotional connection while you're having sex: if he's cheating on you, the sex could still be great, but he'll likely have a harder time getting emotionally close to you while you're having sex."

      "content": "A cheating boyfriend may be more attentive due to some serious guilt. And with good reason: if he’s fooling around behind your back, he should feel guilty! If you find that he's suddenly helping out around the house a lot more or doing a ton of favors for you, he may be doing it to compensate. [8] X Research source If he cleans your apartment, fixes your car, or buys your groceries and has never done those things before, there may be a reason for it. If he's suddenly Mr. Romance and brings you candy and flowers, he may be trying to make himself feel better about cheating."

If your boyfriend never cared about the state of his car or apartment but is now taking the time to clean it or if he's suddenly showering at odd times, he may be trying to hide evidence of his infidelity. If his apartment is much cleaner than it used to be, or he's suddenly begun showering before or after sex with you, he may be cleaning it to get rid of evidence of his other partner—or of you. [9] X Research source He could also be cleaning up to make his car, house, or person look nicer for his side piece. If you really want to find out if he's cheating on you, come over when he says he is \"cleaning his apartment\" and see what he's really up to."

[10] X Research source Is he spending more time texting and talking on the phone than he used to? He could be talking to his other partner. If he shuts his phone off around you or keeps his phone face-down, he could be afraid of getting a text or call from his side piece in front of you. [11] X Expert Source Michelle Jacoby Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Is he suddenly spending a lot of time online? This could be a sign that he's chatting it up with another person. If he slams his computer shut when you walk into a room, that’s a red flag. If you're feeling gutsy, try to check his phone or Internet activity when he's not around. If you find mysterious texts, emails, or social media activity, he might be cheating. Of course, if you're at the point of spying, maybe it's time to end the relationship.

      "content": "Many people who cheat have attachment disorders. An emotionally avoidant person might cheat because they feel \"smothered\" in their relationship and need a distraction, while an emotionally anxious person might cheat because they feel (unreasonably, perhaps) that their partner \"wouldn't even care\" if they did. If your boyfriend has intimacy issues, the more serious your relationship gets, the harder it may be for him to get close to you in a healthy way. He may respond to his own inability to emotionally connect by cheating on you. [12] X Research source For emotionally avoidant or anxious people, cheating may be a form of self-sabotage. He may cheat out of fear of getting too close to you, but that's never an excuse."

But if he’s given you multiple excuses for why he can’t spend time with you, it might be because he's busy hanging out with someone else. [14] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source It’s important that you both get time apart to be alone or bond with friends. But if he's suddenly always neglecting you to hang out with “the guys,” he might be lying about his whereabouts. This isn't a definite sign he's cheating. He may avoid you because he's considering ending the relationship (which is only slightly better news, we'll admit), or maybe he's withdrawing because he's struggling with something he doesn't know how to talk about."

On the other hand, if he always used to compliment you but has suddenly stopped, it could mean he’s saving his flattery for someone else. [15] X Research source It might not even be a matter of his being nicer or less complimentary: he might just sound… different . If he's saying things he's never said before, using words he's never used before, or even laughing in a new way, then maybe he picked up these words from his side piece. This sign applies to texting too: if you were having a long texting exchange and he's suddenly MIA, it may mean that his new partner just showed up."

[16] X Research source If he used to be open about his spending or have his Venmo set to “public,” but has become more secretive and set his accounts to “private,” he might be hiding something.

[17] X Research source His friends might go out of their way to avoid interacting with you, or they may overcompensate by being extra nice to you. If you're feeling bold, ask one of his friends. If his friend knows about his shady behavior, they may not feel good about it and confess.

Of course, if you’re at the point where you’re spying on your boyfriend because you’re too scared to share your concerns with him directly, it’s probably time to just end the relationship. If he says he's hanging out with the boys and you want to see if he's lying, follow him in a friend's car so he doesn't notice it's you. \"Pop in\" on him when he's not expecting it.

Once the signs have added up and you feel like you've already found out that he's cheating , have a conversation about it. Then you can avoid snooping through his stuff, getting hurt when you see something you don't like, and spare yourself the extra pain and humiliation. Catch him off guard so he'll be less likely to come up with a lie. Tell him you'd prefer honesty over more lies. Make it sound like he's doing you a favor by confessing—which he really is doing. If he’s cheating, he might confess when you ask—or he might deny it. A guy who’s faithful will be eager to show you whatever proof you need that’s not cheating, while a cheater might tell you you’re crazy or act offended that you would even bring it up. Even if he's not cheating, if you're suspicious that he is, that means something has broken in the relationship and needs repairing. Whether he's cheating or not, talking can help clear the air and maybe even make you closer than you were before. [18] X Research source"
