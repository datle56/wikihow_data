      "content": "Go up to somebody and say, “Would you like to dance with me?” You can ask your crush, or just a friend. If you’re at a school dance with a date, ask your date. If not, ask anybody! It’s normal to be nervous, but think about it: you’ll never dance with them if you don’t ask! If they say no, respect it. Try to cheer yourself up by dancing with your friends or asking another person to dance. Remember, a rejection doesn’t say anything bad about you. It just means the other person wasn’t feeling in the mood."

[1] X Expert Source William Orrock Professional Dancer & Instructor Expert Interview. 5 July 2022. Traditionally, a guy will stand with his hands gently on the girl’s waist. A girl will put her hands on the guy’s shoulders. But, you don’t have to follow that tradition! A girl can dance with a girl, or a guy can dance with a guy. [2] X Research source If you're much shorter than your partner, and can't reach his shoulders, just put your arms on their upper arms. Or, stand on your tiptoes."

You can lean your head against their shoulder, if they’re taller than you. If you don’t know your dance partner, it’s respectful to keep a bit more distance between you two."

If you were going to snap along to the song, each snap would be a beat. [5] X Research source Don’t worry if you’re not swaying perfectly to the rhythm, though. Your partner may be able to adjust your swaying, and anyway, the point is to enjoy each other’s company."

You can compliment your partner’s outfit, or ask what they think of the song that’s playing. But there’s no pressure to talk if you can’t think of anything to say. Just sway and smile. It’s probably too intense to stare into your dance partner’s eyes for the whole song. Feel free to look over their shoulder and around the room for a while, so long as you come back to looking at them pretty often."
