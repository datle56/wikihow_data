      "content": "Pay attention to what other people are wearing. You don’t want to exactly copy anyone else’s style, but you should pay attention to what other people are wearing. What styles are you most drawn to? Once you start paying attention to what you like, you’ll know whether you are more into a crisp preppy look or if you favor a more laid-back street-style vibe. Identifying your style can help you be more fashionable. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what looks good on your body type. If you’re slender, you might want to wear horizontal stripes and dress in lighter colors to make you look more muscular. If you’re broad across the middle, dark colors can make you appear slimmer, and a belt will make your waist appear smaller. If you have an athletic body type, wear slim-fitting shirts and straight-leg jeans to show off your muscular figure. If you have an \"average\" build, you can wear almost anything — just avoid loose or saggy clothing. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Find inspiration in magazines and online. Check out fashion magazines, style blogs, Pinterest boards, and pictures of celebrities to get ideas of the kind of style you’re into. Remember that you’ll be wearing these looks to class, so look for styles that are appropriate for school. George Clooney might look great in a tuxedo, but it might not be the right outfit for history class. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Be willing to experiment. Sometimes the only way to know if something looks good on you is just to wear it. You might be all about the skater vibe, only to discover that you don’t like the way it looks on you. On the other hand, that shirt that your aunt got you might not seem like your style at first, but it could grow to become your favorite after you pair it with the perfect jeans. Middle school is all about finding yourself, so don’t be afraid to experiment with your look. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t fall victim to trends. You should know the difference between what you really like and what’s a trend right now. Think about looks from previous decades that look really dated. You probably wouldn’t wear wide-legged skater jeans from the 90s, or cut your hair in a mullet in the 80s today. Classic pieces like well-fitting jeans and button-down shirts or t-shirts are always in style. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy jeans that fit you well. You probably already have a couple of pairs of jeans, but you might not like how they look. Focus on finding at least 2 pairs of jeans that fit you comfortably in the waist and which are just long enough to brush the tops of your shoes. If you have a pair that you like but which are a little too long, ask a family member who knows how to sew to hem the pants or take your pants to a tailor. [6] X Research source If you wish to look mature and impressionable, do not wear sweatpants or anything with an elastic waistband to school except during gym class."

      "content": "Get at least 2 button-down shirts. You don’t have to wear a button-down shirt to class every day, but rocking one every once in awhile shows that you care about your looks. Have at least 2 button-down shirts so you don’t show up to school in the same one every time you have to give a presentation. Your button-down shirts should drape comfortably around your torso, but they shouldn’t be too big or you’ll look sloppy. [8] X Research source"

Get a thick, comfortable hoodie or a zip-up jacket for a casual look that will still seem put together. If you’re going for a dressier look, opt for a peacoat or bomber jacket. [9] X Research source A denim jacket or another statement jacket is best to wear with a plain t-shirt that has no pattern."

For instance, you might add buttons to your jean jacket to add a 90s rocker vibe to your streetwear look, or you might add a bold, funky watch in a bright color to an otherwise buttoned-down preppy look.

For instance, many schools allow their students to wear athletic shoes with their uniforms, so you could wear your favorite sneakers. If your school requires you to wear dress shoes, find a dressy pair of lace-up shoes that still shows style, like a pair of low-cut oxfords. Replace your shoes when they start to fray or get holes.

A chunky plastic watch in a bright color might be perfect if you are into street style, while an inconspicuous leather watch with a gold face might be best if preppy is your thing."
