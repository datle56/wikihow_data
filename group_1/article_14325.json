      "content": "Trace your hand. If you intend to create a henna design for your hand, you can begin by tracing your hand on a sheet of paper. This gives you a sense of scale and shape for your unique henna design. [2] X Research source If you are creating a design for another location, it is still a great idea to begin with an outline that depicts the ultimate size and shape of your henna tattoo. Be sure to use regular white copy paper if you are going to use this design to create a tattoo stencil."

      "title": "Design the “palm.”",
      "content": "Design the “palm.” Henna designs often feature a central “mandala,” or circular symbol, with tendrils and other details radiating outward. This central mandala comprises the “palm” of your design, while the other details make up the “fingers.” You can start by pinpointing the center of your palm and creating a spiral, flower, or star that emanates from this center. Add paisley shapes, crisscrosses, spirals and other shapes to add detail to your design. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Design the “fingers.”",
      "content": "Design the “fingers.” The “finger” portion of a henna tattoo often uses long repeating patterns. These might be “natural” representations (like leaves, drops of water, or flowers), or more abstract designs (like swirls, shapes, or braided lines). Using your pencil, design the fingers of your henna tattoo. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Gather supplies. In order to create a henna paste and apply a henna tattoo, you will need a few basic supplies. You are going to need two black tea bags, water and a kettle (to make tea), one plastic baggie, and a small plastic bottle with a pointed lid. You will also want to keep some paper towels handy, because henna can be a bit messy. [6] X Research source You can find a small plastic bottle with a pointed lid at either a craft store (they are typically used for paint) or a beauty supplies store (they are typically used for hair dye)."

Move the baggie around in your hands to ensure that it is evenly blended and all lumps have been worked out. Let this mixture sit for two hours.

      "content": "Transfer the paste to a small bottle with a pointed lid. Using a pair of scissors, cut one corner off your plastic baggie containing the paste. They squeeze the henna paste through this opening and into the small plastic bottle. You will use this bottle to apply the henna paste to your skin. Depending on the size of your design, you may want to begin by transferring just a little of your paste. Any remaining unused paste can be kept in a sealed container in your refrigerator for up to two weeks. Using a small bottle is preferable to applying the paste with a paintbrush. You can also use the plastic baggie to apply your henna. [8] X Expert Source Moushami Iyer Henna Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2021."
