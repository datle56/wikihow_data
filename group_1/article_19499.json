Find their contact information, call them up, and demand to be removed from their mailing lists. You’ll probably have to be persistent here.

In the US, the Postal Service allows you to refuse mail and return it to the sender. Simply write “REFUSED” across the front of the envelope and drop it in the mailbox. [3] X Research source Since companies might have to pay a return fee, they’ll probably take you off their lists if you do this often enough. The USPS won’t return mail that’s been opened, so refuse the mail without opening it."

Most email servers have a “Mark Spam” button, or something similar. Select the junk mail and hit the spam button. This way, similar emails will automatically go into your spam folder instead of your inbox. [6] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source The exact button to hit depends on your email server. In Gmail, for example, the button is a stop sign that says “Report Spam.” Outlook says “Report as Junk.” Other servers might just say “Junk” or “Flag.” Check the correct button for your email server. You should still check your spam folder every so often. Sometimes important messages end up in there by accident. You can select these messages and click “Not Spam” or a similar button so these emails go to your inbox in the future."

Click “Unsubscribe” to get off the mailing list and prevent future emails. [7] X Research source In most cases, the button will take you to another site where you have to select unsubscribe again. This is all meant to keep you on the mailing list without unsubscribing.

[10] X Research source Blocking a sender isn't permanent, and you can decide to unblock them later on if you want to. Your server should have a blocked list that you can view and update. Keep in mind that spammers often use multiple email addresses that are only slightly different, so blocking addresses might not stop all your spam from getting through."
