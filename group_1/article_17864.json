      "content": "Make eye contact. [1] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 September 2019. Don't just stare into her eyes and scare her. Look at her eyes. When you stare at the wall or something, she will think that you are not interested, and will just end the conversation then. But if you look at her, nod your head and listen, she'll like you because you pay attention."

      "content": "Smile . Girls love it when you smile while talking to them or when you look at them because they know that you're happy to talk to them, and they know that they are not boring you. Even just giving her a quick glance with a smile will show her that you think she is cute. Just don't over-do it. Smiling too much can sometimes be creepy and cause her to think you're unusual."

      "title": "Compliment her",
      "content": "Compliment her . [2] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 September 2019. Always compliment from the neck up. Ex: Your eyes are beautiful, your hair is pretty, your smile is cute. Unless you are talking about clothes. Ex: I like your shirt, I like your shoes. But never compliment her pant's back pocket. Girls just take that as \"you just like my pants because they are tight enough to see my butt\" and that will send the wrong message to her. Girls are very sensitive about their body, and if you say something that involves their private areas, they will definitely get the wrong message."

    {
      "title": "Be kind.",
      "content": "Be kind. Girls love guys who are sensitive and understand them. When they start getting upset and maybe even cry about something, don't just run off and use the stupid \"sorry, I can't help you, I'm not a girl\" excuse. If you actually listen to what she is saying, she will like you even more. Most guys think that girls like \"bad boys\" who spray paint buildings and get in trouble at school, but actually, it's the total opposite. Girls hate guys to try to be bad because they think it's cool, but really, it's not. So don't try to be all \"gangster\" or anything because girls hate that."
