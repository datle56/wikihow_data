      "content": "Avoid “stuffing” each page with as many keywords as possible. At the end of the day, readability is more important than page visits—people won’t stay on your site if they don’t think the content is valuable. Insert your strongest and most relevant keywords a couple of times near the start of the page; use them sparingly anywhere else on the page that seems relevant. Keep in mind that keywords are most effective when you put them in titles, headers, the first paragraph of the article, and URLs.
