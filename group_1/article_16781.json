      "content": "Restart the game if you've already battled the trainer and the Youngster. This glitch requires you to find a trainer hidden in the grass near the Nugget Bridge in Cerulean City. You'll also need to battle Youngster, who's located in the bushes north of the Nugget Bridge."

      "content": "Visit the Training Center in Cerulean City. This is an important step for a Teleport move you'll perform later in this glitch. The Teleport move transports you to the last training center you set foot in. In this case, the one located in Cerulean City is the most convenient one to return to for you to complete the glitch and find Mew. [1] X Research source Remember to save your progress after completing each step!"

      "content": "Catch an Abra if you don't have one to access its Teleport move. You can find it in the grass to the left of the Nugget Bridge after you cross it from Cerulean City. You can catch it by lobbing Poké Balls at it, but the easiest way to defeat it is by putting it to sleep. [2] X Research source To put the Abra to sleep, catch a Caterpie and evolve it into a Metapod and then a Butterfree. Once it becomes a Butterfree, teach it the Sleep Powder move. Then, when you next encounter an Abra, choose the Butterfree and engage Sleep Powder to put the Abra in a slumber. This will make it much easier for you to catch it."

      "content": "Cross the Nugget Bridge (Route 24) north of Cerulean City and go left. You'll come across a body of water and then a hedge wall extending vertically across the screen. Between the hedges and the water is a field of tall grass. Stand in the short grass above where it borders the tall grass. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Walk down toward the tall grass and press Start simultaneously.",
      "content": "Walk down toward the tall grass and press Start simultaneously. You'll see the head of a trainer pop up out of the tall grass and turn toward you. By pressing Start quickly, you'll avoid engaging him, since that's not the goal for this glitch. [4] X Research source"

From there, you can return to the Nugget Bridge for your first real battle with a trainer for this glitch. [5] X Research source Finding the trainer in the tall grass and Teleporting before he can engage you activates the glitch that will ultimately help you catch a random Pokémon."

      "content": "Find the Youngster north of the Nugget Bridge. Make your way from the Cerulean City Training Center to the Nugget Bridge and cross it. When you reach the other side, turn right onto Route 25 until you see large bushes blocking any further eastward progress. Go up among the bushes and then turn right to cross the field until you come across a trainer standing above two bushes growing next to each other. This is the Youngster with the Slowpoke you need to battle. [6] X Research source The Youngster's Slowpoke has the same Special stat as Mew (21). Defeating the Slowpoke will complete the glitch you began by Teleporting instead of battling the first trainer and cause Mew to spawn in a specific location."

As soon as the battle screen returns to the regular map, press the Start button and use your Abra's Teleport power to return to the Pokémon Center in Cerulean City. [7] X Research source To engage the Youngster in a fight, leave at least one square of space between you so he'll walk up to you. If you stand directly in front of or adjacent to him, the game will freeze! After you return to Cerulean City, don't enter any other buildings or engage with other trainers until you find and catch Mew."

Exit it and you should find yourself in a battle with Mew! Fight him and catch him in a Poké Ball to add him to your roster.

To use the Ditto glitch, Fly away from the Gambler on Route 8 (like you did in the Gambler and Youngster glitch ) to Fuchsia City. Once you arrive, battle any random trainer you want. Then travel east of Fuchsia city and battle a wild Ditto in the grassy area near Route 15. [16] X Research source During the battle with the Ditto, choose a Pokémon whose Special stat matches that of a different Pokémon you want to catch for your roster. The Ditto will copy your Pokémon's appearance and abilities while you're beating it. This is essential to complete the glitch successfully, so don't skip this part! [17] X Research source Finally, fly back to Route 8 and walk to the left, after which the Pokémon you're trying to catch will spawn. Toss Poké Balls at it during your battle to catch it. [18] X Research source Repeat this glitch to catch any Pokémon that you haven't yet come across in the course of the game to collect all 151 creatures in Pokémon Red/Blue . For example, if you engage the Ditto and fight it with a Slowpoke, the Ditto will copy all the Slowpoke's abilities and stats. Then, when you return to Route 8 and walk left, you'll stumble across a Mew, which has the exact same Special stat as the Slowpoke (21)."
