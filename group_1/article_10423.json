      "title": "Hang a picture",
      "content": "Hang a picture or poster as a hole-hiding option. Position the picture or poster so that it covers the hole, then secure it in place with tape, thumbtacks, or nails. The hole’s still there, but a guest would have to be very nosy to find it. If you don’t want to add more holes to the wall, there are plenty of ways to hang pictures without using nails . You may want to frame your poster so someone doesn’t accidentally poke through it and into the hole behind! For a cluster of holes, or a really big one, hang a tapestry or decorative rug or quilt instead."

      "content": "Rearrange furniture to hide a hole as another alternative. Move a tall bookcase over to hide an eye-level hole from view, or slide a loveseat against the wall to cover a lower hole. Placing a floor mirror against the wall can also obscure a smaller wall hole. Ask a friend to help you move furniture if you’re going to move anything heavy or unwieldy."

      "content": "Place an indoor plant in front of the hole as a temporary screen. This is a good way to conceal a hole temporarily—for instance, if you’re having a party and your kids just knocked a hole in the wall playing indoor hockey! However, unless the hole happens to be in a good growing spot for your plant, you’ll want to move it back to its original location. The fuller the plant, the better concealment it will provide."

      "title": "Hang longer or wider curtains",
      "content": "Hang longer or wider curtains to conceal a hole near a window. If you have a hole in the wall right above, below, or beside a window, try replacing your current window treatment with a larger one that covers the hole. Just make sure you don’t create new holes while trying to hang the curtains. Elongated curtains can help to make a room with a low ceiling appear “taller,” and longer and wider curtains can make a window that’s too small for the room appear larger."

      "title": "Fill nail holes",
      "content": "Fill nail holes with spackle for a permanent repair. Add a small amount of spackle to a putty knife , then press and smooth it into and over the hole. Use the blade of the putty knife to scrape away any excess, then wipe over the area with a damp cloth. Wait 24 hours for the spackle to dry, then gently sand it with fine-grit sandpaper. [1] X Research source Spackle is often referred to as mud or joint compound. These are all the same thing."

      "title": "Plug the hole with white glue or caulk for a longer-term fix.",
      "content": "Plug the hole with white glue or caulk for a longer-term fix. Squeeze the white glue or caulk into the hole until it’s overfilled. Then, use a flat edge (like a putty knife or old credit card) to scrape away the excess. Follow up with a damp rag to clean up any excess material on the wall. [2] X Research source If you prefer applying a paste, you can mix white glue and baking soda, then apply it with your finger."

      "content": "Press white toothpaste into the hole for a quick repair. Squeeze a small dab of white toothpaste onto your fingertip and press it into the nail hole. Smooth over the toothpaste glob with your finger, then use a damp rag to wipe away any excess on the wall. [3] X Research source The toothpaste will start to dry out and shrink within 24 hours, and may simply fall out of the hole after that time. Most temporary tricks work best on white or off-white walls. For painted walls, there’s no substitute for patching and painting."

      "content": "Rub white bar soap over the hole as another short-term fix. A soft, white bar soap (Ivory is the most well-known brand of this type) will work best here. Just keep rubbing the bar over the hole until enough soap rubs off to fill it in. Then, wipe away any excess with a clean, damp rag. [4] X Research source Don’t expect this trick to work for more than 24 hours or so—the soap will dry and shrink fairly quickly."

      "content": "Make a temporary filling paste with baking soda and water. Put a large spoonful of baking soda into a bowl and stir in just enough water to make a thick (toothpaste-like) paste. Use your finger to press it into the hole, then wipe away the extra paste with a damp rag. [5] X Research source The baking soda paste will dry out—and probably fall out of the hole—within a few days at most."

      "content": "Try children’s play-dough to match a colored wall. Search your kids’ play area or the store shelves for a color of play-dough that roughly matches your wall. Then, press a small amount of it into the nail hole with your finger and wipe away any excess with a clean rag. The play-dough will dry, crack, and probably fall out of the hole within a few days. Try making your own play-dough if you like!"

      "title": "Cover golf ball-sized or smaller holes with repair tape and joint compound.",
      "content": "Cover golf ball-sized or smaller holes with repair tape and joint compound . Stick a piece of fiberglass wall repair tape over the hole. After that, scoop up some joint compound on a putty knife and smooth it over the tape. Add the joint compound in thin layers, letting it dry for 2-4 hours between coats. Once the tape is covered, use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out the patch. [6] X Research source Make the layers of joint compound as thin as possible around the edges of the repair job. This is called “feathering,” and makes it easier to blend the patch seamlessly into the surrounding wall."

      "title": "Cut around and patch a large hole in a sheetrock (drywall) wall.",
      "content": "Cut around and patch a large hole in a sheetrock (drywall) wall. Use a drywall saw or utility knife to cut out a square that extends from wall stud to wall stud on either side of the hole. Cut a matching square from a new piece of sheetrock and secure it onto the wall by screwing it into the studs. Apply joint tape around the seams, and smooth on layers of joint compound until the seams are invisible. [7] X Research source It will take about 3 coats of joint compound to cover over the tape and seams. Apply thin layers and let them dry between coats. Use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots."

      "title": "Use patching plaster for large holes in lath-and-plaster walls.",
      "content": "Use patching plaster for large holes in lath-and-plaster walls. Carefully scrape out any loose plaster around the hole, trying not to enlarge it much more. Trowel on a thick first coat of patching plaster over the exposed horizontal wooden slats (“lath”) that support the plaster wall. When this layer is firm but not fully dry, add a thinner second layer and smooth it over to blend into the surrounding wall. [8] X Research source Unsure if you have drywall or plaster? Try pushing a thumbtack through the wall. If the thumbtack enters freely with little resistance, it’s drywall. Plaster is much harder to puncture. Once the top layer of patching plaster dries, go over it with fine-grit sandpaper to smooth it and blend it into the surrounding wall. Before adding the patching plaster, secure any loose pieces of lath by screwing them into the closest wall studs, and replace any broken lath pieces."

      "title": "Prime and paint",
      "content": "Prime and paint a wall repair job of any size. Whether your patch is the size of a marble or a volleyball, prime and paint over the repair material. Add 1-2 coats of interior latex primer over the dried patch with a brush, and let each coat dry completely. Go over the primer with fine-grit sandpaper , wipe away any dust, and apply 1-2 coats of interior latex paint . Paint stores can match existing paint colors, especially if you bring them in a sample (e.g., a piece from the hole you patched). However, even if you have some of the original wall paint, it will never match the surrounding area perfectly. So, especially for larger patches, painting the entire wall may be your best option."
