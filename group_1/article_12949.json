      "content": "Electronic signatures (e-signatures) are more common than digital signatures. If you need to sign your name or initial a PDF document, you'll use an e-signature.

      "content": "A digital signature requires keys to assure authenticity. This is so the signature is provided by the person who claims to sign it and cannot be forged or added by someone else.
