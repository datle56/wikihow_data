Leave about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) of the tape hanging over the edge of the case. You can fix these ends up later. If you are feeling creative, try creating a zig-zag pattern."

      "content": "Paint small dots of polish on the outside of the case in a pattern. Nail polish brushes are quite hard to manoeuvre so dots are a nice and easy option. Paint the dots into a grid formation to make a geometric look. If you want a less symmetrical look, cluster the dots in 1 or 2 corners of the case as a feature. If you are feeling artistic, you could try use the dots to create a picture, such as a sun or a cat face. [11] X Research source Use your different colours to create a pattern. For example, paint one line of grey circles and then paint a line of pale pink circles. Paint the circles close together to create a confetti look. Paint large shapes like squares and triangles to create a geometric theme. Write your name using small dots to personalise your case."
