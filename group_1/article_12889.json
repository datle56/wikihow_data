If the nail experiences trauma, the claw may grow in deformed. To spot trauma to the nail, look for missing or broken nails, blood, or pus. You may also check around the nail bed to see if there is any swelling or redness. Your cat may also limp or feel pain if that paw is touched. This happens most often to the dew claw."

They may ask you for a medical history of your cat and if they are experiencing any other odd symptoms. [4] X Research source Don’t hesitate to have your pet’s nails checked out. Anything that looks odd, different, or abnormal could indicate a bigger problem. If you wait too long, the infection may get worse or the cat may lose their nail."

      "title": "Undergo tests.",
      "content": "Undergo tests. Depending on what the vet thinks the underlying problem is for the deformed nail, they will probably do tests. For example, if the vet believes the deformity is due to an infection, they will take a bacterial and fungal culture. [5] X Research source Your vet may draw a blood sample to test for parasites or infection. If the vet suspects ringworm, they will perform a test where they examine the cat with a special lamp that will indicate ringworm. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a biopsy.",
      "content": "Get a biopsy. For some causes of deformed nails, like autoimmune skin diseases, a biopsy may be needed. The vet will do a skin scrape and analyze it to determine what condition is causing the deformed nails. [7] X Research source"

Even just cutting the nail can be very painful for your cat. The vet may have to put them under anesthesia so they do not experience too much pain. [8] X Research source If there are other problems with the nail, the vet may cut away part of the nail before treating it in another way. In some cases, your cat may need to be sedated before they can have the nail removed."

If the infection is due to a fungus, antifungals will be prescribed. They may be in the form of an oral tablet, a soak, or a topical ointment. This treatment may last up to three months after a healthy nail has replaced the deformed one."
