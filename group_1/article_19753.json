      "title": "Use a cold compress.",
      "content": "Use a cold compress. Applying an ice pack or a cool cloth is an easy way to help to soothe a rash. [1] X Research source Try wrapping an ice pack in a paper towel and holding it on the rash for up to 20 minutes. Then, give your skin a break for about an hour or so before applying another ice pack. You can also hold a clean washcloth under cold running water for a few minutes and wring out the excess water. Then apply the cool cloth to your rash. Use a new paper towel or cloth every time to avoid spreading the rash."

      "title": "Rinse the rash with water and let it air dry.",
      "content": "Rinse the rash with water and let it air dry. If you think the rash is the result of contact with poison ivy or poison oak, you should rinse the area right away with warm, soapy water and let it air dry so you do not irritate it by scrubbing it with a towel or cloth. This will prevent the spread of the rash, as once the urushiol is washed off your skin, you cannot give anyone else the poison ivy or the poison oak. If the rash develops due to an allergic reaction, you can take a bath or shower in cold water with non-drying soap and let your skin air dry. This can help to soothe any redness or discomfort. Change into some loose clothing when you are dry. Tight clothing may irritate a rash further, so it is important to switch to loose-fitting clothing if you are dealing with a rash. Opt for lightweight, natural fiber materials, such as a 100% cotton t-shirt or a pair of loose-fitting linen pants."
