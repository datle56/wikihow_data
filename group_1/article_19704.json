      "content": "Take a pain reliever. If the pain or discomfort is hard to bear, take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is generally considered to be the best option. Ibuprofen (Advil) works too, depending upon which you have available. Both are available for purchase over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.

[3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Follow the instructions on the label when taking the medication. For acetaminophen, don't take more than 4 g in 24 hours. For ibuprofen, the max dose is 2 g in 24 hours. If you have kidney or liver problems, talk with a doctor before taking pain medications like these."

      "content": "Do not force your eye open. Oftentimes, a black eye can be accompanied by significant swelling around the eye. If this is the case for you, and if it is challenging to open your eye, there is no need to force it open unnecessarily. As long as you have ruled out that it is nothing more serious than a black eye (that there are no other medical concerns), there is no problem with keeping your injured eye shut if it is painful to open."

As your black eye heals (which normally takes one to two weeks in total), you will want to ensure that you wear glasses or other protective gear if you find yourself in any situation that could potentially cause further damage to your eye. Or, if you injured your eye during sports, refrain from participating in this sport until your eye has fully healed.

If accompanied by other eye injuries, however, you will need to seek professional medical care as soon as possible. You may have suffered severe damage to your eyes or a severe head injury.

If you see any blood in these spots, you could have injured your eye in a critical way. Schedule an urgent appointment with an ophthalmologist. If you have vision problems like blurring, double vision, or an increased sensitivity to light, you should also contact an eye specialist. Other signs of potentially critical damage include severe pain when moving the eye, severe headache, numbness of the face, swelling or depression of the eye or eye socket, nosebleeds, and/or dizziness."

      "content": "Switch to moist heat after 24 to 48 hours. After a day or two of using an ice pack to soothe the swelling, you should switch tactics and begin applying moist heat to the injured area. [7] X Research source Hold a warm, moistened washcloth or compress against the affected area. Do not use a heating pad, since this provides dry heat and can actually be too hot, thereby causing more damage to the sensitive skin of your face. Apply the warm compress in 10-minute intervals, each of which should be separated by a period of rest lasting no less than 10 minutes each. Do not apply the warm compress directly to the eye. Only apply it to the skin around the eye. Warm compresses promote an increased amount of circulation to the damaged blood vessels. This allows pooled blood trapped below the surface of your skin to be re-absorbed, which can speed up the healing process."

Wait until you have entered the warm compress stage of treatment before applying any makeup to the injured area, and apply makeup as little as possible. If you feel you need to cover your eye when you need to leave the house or if you are having people over, that's okay, but when you're just at home on your own, you should avoid applying makeup."

[10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For best results, use a liquid corrective concealer in a yellow or green shade. Liquid corrective concealers are easier to apply and blend than most creams and require the use of less pressure on the skin. You must use a corrective concealer first before using a standard concealer if you wish to disguise the black eye. Standard concealers match the tone of your skin and can only blend uneven tones together. Corrective concealers rely on the principle of complementary colors to correct discolored portions of skin. A yellow concealer generally works best for a black eye in its early stages, when it appears to have deep purple undertones. As the black eye lightens and takes on more red tones or yellow-brown tones, you may need to switch to a green corrective concealer. Apply the corrective concealer with your fingers. Use your fingers to dab specks of corrective concealer all around the blackened area of your skin. Use light pressure to gently and carefully blend the concealer into your skin, covering the entire damaged area."
