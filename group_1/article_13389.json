      "title": "Request a short fade style.",
      "content": "Request a short fade style. Request a \"short fade\" hair style at your barber's. This style will allow you to style your hair like Daniel Craig at home. The short fade style means your hair will start off longer near the top of your head and gradually get shorter as your barber works their way down the sides. [1] X Research source Daniel Craig's hair frames his face by making a round curve near the top of his head that fades out slightly towards his temples. This frames his face and softens his features.

      "title": "Request specific measurements.",
      "content": "Request specific measurements. Request your barber cut your hair between one and one point five centimeters (about .4 and .6 of an inch) on the sides. On the top of your head, request the length be around 2 centimeters (about .8 of an inch). [3] X Research source It can also help to let your barber know you're going for a rounded effect. You want a look that will frame your face, so your hair's length should be reduced gradually as your barber moves from the top of your head to the sides. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask for a textured cut near the top.",
      "content": "Ask for a textured cut near the top. Texturizing a cut means hairs are cut with minor variations in length. While most of the hair near the top of your head will still be the appropriate two centimeters (.8 of an inch), your barber will cut some hairs shorter or longer here and there. These subtle variations in length create a sense of depth, making thinner, shorter hair look and feel fuller. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Towel dry your hair after showering.",
      "content": "Towel dry your hair after showering. [6] X Research source A microfiber towel is your best option for towel drying. Once you get out of the shower, very gently run a towel through your hair. Go slowly and be gentle to keep your hair looking smooth. If you want, you can apply a leave-in conditioner just prior to towel drying for added smoothness. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Let your hair dry.",
      "content": "Let your hair dry. It's always best to style your hair when it's completely dry. Towel drying does not usually completely dry your hair. You can use a blow dryer if you're in a hurry to dry your hair further. [8] X Research source Air drying is also an option if you're not in a rush. If you do go the blow drying route, blow dry your hair to one direction and slightly back. Use a small, round brush to direct your hair as you blow dry. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub matt clay into your hair. [10] X Research source You can purchase matt clay at most hair salons or online. Start by applying the clay to the top of your head. Work the matt clay into your hair by moving from your roots to your tips. Push the clay outward from the top of your head as you go, dispersing the clay throughout your hair. [11] X Research source Refer to your package's instructions for the precise amount to use. The amount of matt clay you need depends on your clay's specific formula."

      "title": "Give your hair a messy part.",
      "content": "Give your hair a messy part. Near one side of your head, give yourself a somewhat messy part. Craig's hair is not known for being perfectly neat, so have some hairs criss-crossing to create a rough, uneven line separating your hair. [12] X Research source A comb may create a very neat part, so it's easier to use your fingers to emulate the messy look of Craig's hair."

    {
      "title": "Add some texture with your fingers.",
      "content": "Add some texture with your fingers. Craig's hair creates a rounded shape that frames his face, so your hair should move in opposing directions on either side of the part. However, your hair should not lie completely flat. Use your fingers over a brush to style your hair. As you push your hair to frame your face, tousle your hair slightly using your fingertips. This will cause some hairs to stand up slightly, preventing a flat look. You want a slight spiked effect to give off the Daniel Craig vibe. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Plan extra time to style your hair in the mornings. The Daniel Craig look takes a bit of time and effort achieve, especially considering your hair should be completely dry before you style it. Make sure to give yourself an extra few minutes in the morning if you want to wear the Daniel Craig style to work or school. [14] X Research source While blow drying your hair can speed up the drying process, it still takes a little extra time. Give yourself extra time even when blow drying."
