      "content": "Wear an ice skating dress with a skirt all the way around the waist. Some coaches will allow their female skaters to wear leotards or leggings to practice. [1] X Research source However, most prefer their skaters to wear a skating dress since it allows the coach to critique their skaters’ forms, so be sure you ask first! Your skirt can have slits, but it must wrap all the way around your waist. [2] X Research source For practice, choose a practical skating dress in a stretchy material like cotton or spandex. For competition, feel free to get creative! Popular embellishments on costumes include sheer mesh panels, rhinestones, sequins, and brightly colored fabrics. [3] X Research source Remember that you will get a deduction if any part of your costume falls onto the ice, so make sure embellishments are attached securely."
