      "title": "Start your turn when you see the black T on the pool floor.",
      "content": "Start your turn when you see the black T on the pool floor. There is a black line at the bottom of your pool lane. The perpendicular line lets you know that the wall is two feet away. You can use the black T to let yourself know it's time to start executing your turn. [1] X Research source This can be hard to judge because it all depends on the length of your legs. Depending on how long your legs are, you would normally do two strokes after the T, then do your turn. If you're very tall or on the short side, adjust accordingly."

      "title": "Follow the last stroke of your arm under the water.",
      "content": "Follow the last stroke of your arm under the water. As your arm enters the water, tuck your chin and keep kicking your legs to propel you over. Bring in both arms and position your hands at your sides. [2] X Research source Do not start rotating your body during this step. As you start to somersault, breath out hard through your nose to prevent any water getting up it."

    {
      "title": "Tuck your knees and feet as you angle forward to somersault.",
      "content": "Tuck your knees and feet as you angle forward to somersault. Keep your elbows close to your body. Make sure your knees are close to your chest. If you don't tuck your knees close enough, your feet will take too long to get to the wall. [3] X Research source The tighter you tuck your body, the faster your somersault will be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfold your upper body.",
      "content": "Unfold your upper body. After completing the somersault, release your elbows and extend your arms in the direction you just came from. Put your hands together. Your body should form a straight line from your torso to the tips of your fingers. [4] X Research source At this point, your legs are still tucked. Make sure you are not rotating in the water back onto your belly. You should be on your back at this point."
    },
    {
      "title": "Untuck your legs and press your feet flat on the wall.",
      "content": "Untuck your legs and press your feet flat on the wall. Your toes should be pointing upwards, towards the top of the water. Your knees should be at 90 degree angles. Your hips need to be at about 110 degrees."

    {
      "title": "Straighten your legs as you push yourself off the wall.",
      "content": "Straighten your legs as you push yourself off the wall. When your feet are flat against the wall, use them to push off. Your body should shoot off the wall like a torpedo. The harder you push off, the faster you will spring off the wall. Think of the flip as a jump. The more power you put into that push, the farther you're you'll go without having to put in work and start swimming."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rotate onto your stomach.",
      "content": "Rotate onto your stomach. As you are pushing off the wall, start rotating so that your back is facing the ceiling. Your belly will be facing down at the pool floor. Twist your hands and look towards the direction you want to twist. Don't move your head. [5] X Research source After kicking off and during rotation, you can perform a few strong dolphin kicks. This is optional, and may be something you want to do after you get better."

      "title": "Resurface and begin swimming normally.",
      "content": "Resurface and begin swimming normally. Swim around 10 to 15 feet ( approximately 5 meters) underwater using the butterfly kick in streamline position. Start the pull with the arm that was closest to the bottom as you rotated. Your hand should exit the water as you finish the pull. Now resume your freestyle stroke."

      "content": "Learn how to somersault in water. Knowing how to somersault in water is essential for learning the flip turn. If you have never tried one, you should practice basic somersault technique. You want to be able to approach the wall, tuck your chin and fold into a ball, and start to flip over with your bottom popping out of the water as your flip over onto your back. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Practice each step of the technique separately.",
      "content": "Practice each step of the technique separately. This technique requires a lot of practice. You need to practice approaching the wall and getting used to knowing when to breathe, where the correct length is for your height, and how to kick off and rotate in the water. Practice over and over, moving at a slow pace. As you get used to it, you can do it faster. It is important that you don't speed up as you approach the wall until you master this flip. Otherwise, you could hit the wall and hurt yourself."

      "content": "Practice several times per week. The exact frequency is up to you, but perfecting this move will take some time. Practice as often as you can. Don't forget to take days off occasionally to rest up, though!"
