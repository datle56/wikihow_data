      "content": "Choose several key wardrobe pieces, like a striped shirt and a cotton skirt. Start with basic pieces that you can then pair with other bottoms or tops.

Don’t be afraid to go bold with your stripes. Make a statement with large or thick stripes on a shirt or a skirt. Go for lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton, jersey, and denim. You can wear nautical year round, though it may be more suited to warmer seasons like spring and summer."

You can also add different textures to your outfit, like a white cashmere sweater instead of a blazer, or a ribbed sweater on top of a white collared shirt."
