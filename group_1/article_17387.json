However, the devices can drastically underestimate calories burned while taking steps around the house, up to 74%. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For other activities: Calories burned during weight training can be overestimated by 12-48% Calories burned while walking can be overestimated by 26-61% Calories burned while cycling can be underestimated by 37-59% Calories burned while jogging can be overestimated by 25-39%"

      "content": "Some Fitbit models are more accurate than others. Depending on your Fitbit model, your tracker may be overestimating or underestimating your calories burned: The Fitbit Versa 2, 3, and 4 models are mostly reliable in tracking your calories burned. The Versa 2 and later have enough technology and features built-in to allow it to accurately track your calories burned. Versa models are more likely to overestimate calories burned rather than underestimate. In comparison, models like Inspire 2 and 3 are less accurate and tend to overestimate calories burned. Of course, these are cheaper models that lack built-in GPS, so they're not designed for ultimate accuracy. Still, fitness enthusiasts looking for a cheap fitness band shouldn't shy away from Inspire 2."

      "content": "While imperfect, your Fitbit can still be useful for your fitness journey. While the accuracy isn't perfect, it is most essential that the numbers remain consistent, allowing you to develop healthy habits and routines. You may want to avoid building your diet around the numbers presented, but your exercise routine could be developed alongside your calories burned."

      "content": "Understand how your Fitbit calculates data. While Fitbit does use your personal data (height, weight, gender, age, etc.) in calculating your calories burned, the number also comes from more general calculations that rely on assumptions about how humans burn calories while resting . [3] X Research source Fitbit combines your calories burned while resting with another number that begins to accumulate whenever your heart rate increases. Fitbit assumes an increased heart rate can account for an additional amount of calories burned."

You can try wearing another Fitbit, or you can test out a different line of products altogether. If there is a large discrepancy between the numbers, you may consider a few measures to improve your Fitbit's accuracy."

Wearing your Fitbit too high up on your wrist or too loosely can lead to improper tracking of your heart rate and other key data that contributes to your calories burned. You may also want to wear your Fitbit on your non-dominant hand, so activities like writing do not inflate your statistics.

It may sound obvious, but the more activity you perform while wearing your Fitbit, the more the device will come to understand your activity level and measure your calories burned accordingly. However, extreme activity can lead to an overestimation of calories burned. If accuracy is your primary concern, you may consider moderate rather than frequent physical activity.
