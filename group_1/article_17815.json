      "content": "Start with clean, damp hair. You will be blow drying your hair straight but curling it inward/outward. This will create that \"flipped\" look. Consider spraying your hair with a heat protecting spray. This will help keep your hair from getting damaged while you blow dry it."

      "content": "Take a small section of hair and place it between a round brush and the nozzle of the hair dryer. If you want to flip your hair inward, place the brush under your hair, and the hair dryer over it. If you want to flip your hair outward, place the brush over your hair, and the hair dryer under it. Your hair should always be sandwiched between the hair dryer and the brush. Use a round, tube-shaped brush, not a paddle brush."

      "title": "Bring the brush and hair dryer down towards the center of the hair shaft.",
      "content": "Bring the brush and hair dryer down towards the center of the hair shaft. Turn the hair dryer on and start sliding both it and the hairbrush down towards the middle of your hair. Make sure that you slide both the brush and hair dryer down at the same time. Stop when you are half-way down the hair shaft."

      "title": "Twist the round brush when you are half-way down the hair shaft.",
      "content": "Twist the round brush when you are half-way down the hair shaft. Twist the brush towards you if you want your hair to flip inward. If you want your hair to flip outward, switch the positions of the brush and the hair dryer: place the nozzle of the hair dryer under your hair, and the hairbrush over your hair. Twist the brush up and away from you as you slowly bring both down."

      "title": "Touch up with a flat iron if you have thick or curly hair.",
      "content": "Touch up with a flat iron if you have thick or curly hair. Take a small section of hair and position the flat iron about half-way down. Start straightening your hair. Instead of bringing the iron straight down, however, rotate it inwards/outwards as you reach the ends of your hair. Remember to use a heat protecting spray before using the flat iron. Flat irons get much hotter than a hair dryer and can cause more damage."

      "content": "Start with tangle-free hair. This style works with all hair types: curly, wavy, and straight. It is best for shoulder length and longer hair. If your hair is not long enough, your ponytail won't flip properly."

      "content": "Stick your finger up through your hair, just above the hair tie. There should be equal amounts of hair to either side of your finger. Also, make sure that your finger is sticking up, from under your hair. Some people find it easier to use a special loop made for flipping ponytails. You can also bend a pipe cleaner in half and use that instead."

Tug it down as far as you can, but not so much that the hair tie goes through the hole too. If that happens, you have pulled too much. If you are having troubles getting the ponytail through the hole, try widening the hole a little bit by inserting your first two fingers and spreading them. You can also try pushing the ponytail through the hole."

      "content": "Use your hand to flip your hair back over your shoulder. Start with a part of your hair draped over your shoulder. Place the back of your hand against your hair, and quickly flick your hand back at the wrist. This will cause your hair to flip over your shoulder. This works best with hair that falls somewhere between your shoulders and your elbows. If your hair is too long or too short, it may not be as effective. Use a small, less dramatic motion. This will help make it look more natural. If you try to make a huge show of your hair flip, and make a large gesture, you will look overly dramatic and unnatural."

      "content": "Flip your ponytail. This was work with just about any length of ponytail, but it will be most effective with tails that reach your shoulder. Simply turn your head towards one shoulder, and very quickly sweep your head towards the other shoulder. To make your flick even more effective, try to dip your head down slightly as you reach the middle of your \"turn.\" This creates a dip or curve that causes your ponytail to flip even more. Depending on the length of your hair, you might end up catching someone in the face."
