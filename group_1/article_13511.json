      "content": "“Do not pass go” means to do something immediately. The phrase references the rules and gameplay of the board game “Monopoly.” People use it to order a person to do something right away without any detours or delays. There’s also the implication that the person is being punished. They got caught, and there’s no way to wiggle out of their punishment. Example: “That’s it. Go to your room. Do not pass go. You’re big in trouble.” Example: “If the teacher finds out you copied that paper, you’re going to get detention. Do not pass go.”"

      "content": "The phrase can also mean someone is failing or unlucky. Some people use “do not pass go” to humorously call out a failure so bad there’s no way to appeal or bluff your way out of the consequences. Not only did you lose, but you lost so badly that it’s embarrassing. It refers to Monopoly gameplay in that going to jail immediately ends your turn without any benefit. Example: “Jacob tried to bake a cake that was so bad even the dog wouldn’t eat it. Now, he’s not allowed in the kitchen. Do not pass go, man.” Example: “Did you hear Quinn got kicked out of the library for talking too loudly? The librarian didn’t even give her a warning. Just kicked her out. Do not pass go.”"

      "content": "People use two longer versions to add intensity to the phrase. The original quote from the “Go to Jail” Community Chest card in Monopoly is “Go to jail. Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.” The “Go to Jail” Chance card is the same, except it starts with “Go directly to jail.” [1] X Research source People often shorten the phrase to “Do not pass “Go,” do not collect $200.” Sometimes, people substitute other things for “jail” or “$200” to connect the phrase to a specific situation, so it's funnier. Example: “Dude, you’re so busted. Go to jail. Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.” Example: “Go to bed. Go directly to bed. Do not check your phone. Do not get a snack.” Example: “Go to jail. Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not eat any freshly baked cookies.”"

      "content": "“Do not pass go” originally appeared on 2 cards in the game Monopoly . The phrase appeared on one Community Chest card and one Chance card. [2] X Research source Both cards mean the player who drew it must put their game piece on the “Jail” space without passing “Go.” The Community Chest card features an image of a policeman brandishing a billy club and holding Mr. Monopoly (or Rich Uncle Pennybags), the game’s mascot, by the collar. The Chance card features a policeman carrying a billy club and dragging Mr. Monopoly away by his feet."

      "content": "Being sent to jail in Monopoly ends your turn without any benefits. When you go to the “Jail” space, you’re not allowed to draw the $200 salary you would typically receive every time you make a complete trip around the board and pass the “Go” space. Once you get to the “Jail” space, your turn is over. You’re not permitted to make any plays, including using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card. [3] X Research source You also can’t collect the $200 even if you passed “Go” before drawing the “Go to Jail” card."
