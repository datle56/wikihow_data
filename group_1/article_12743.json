      "title": "Get a film development kit for black and white photography.",
      "content": "Get a film development kit for black and white photography. A film development kit will come with all the chemicals you need to develop your photos. The kit also comes with a development tank with a spiral loaded inside so you can easily load and unload your film strips. Make sure the kit you buy is meant for black and white photography. Development kits can be purchased at photography supply stores and online. Development kits for color film will not work for black and white film since they use different chemicals."

      "title": "Work in a room without visible light so your film doesn’t get exposed.",
      "content": "Work in a room without visible light so your film doesn’t get exposed. If your undeveloped film comes into contact with light, then it could cloud your negatives. [1] X Research source Pick a laundry room or bathroom that doesn’t have any windows. Cover the cracks between the door and its frame with weather stripping, masking tape, or towels. [2] X Research source Wait a few minutes before working in your darkroom so your eyes can adjust. If you don’t have a room that’s lightproof, you can also purchase a film changing bag that you can put your supplies in without exposing them to light. Do not use a red light in your darkroom. Even though it’s seen in movies, it could affect how your film develops."

      "title": "Open the film with a bottle opener in the darkroom.",
      "content": "Open the film with a bottle opener in the darkroom. Make sure all of the lights are out before you start working on your film. Hold the film canister upside down so the flat edge faces up. Hold the edge of the bottle opener to the end of the film canister and pry the cap off. Dump the roll of film into your hand. [3] X Research source You can also use a film canister opener to access your film. Buy them online or at specialty photography stores."

      "title": "Cut the end of the film with a pair of scissors.",
      "content": "Cut the end of the film with a pair of scissors. The leading end of the film is slightly narrower than the rest of it. Pull out 2–3 cm (0.79–1.18 in) from the leading end and use a pair of scissors to cut a straight line across the film. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Feed the film into the slot on the film spiral.",
      "content": "Feed the film into the slot on the film spiral. The spiral looks like a large spool that sits inside of the development tank. Feel for the protrusions along the edge of the spiral’s interior to locate where the film channel starts. Pinch the end of your film strip and pull 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) of it into the channel directly underneath the protrusions. Rotate the sides of the spiral to feed the rest of the film onto it. When you reach the end of the film, cut the end with a pair of scissors. [5] X Research source Many film spools can be pushed or pulled apart to adjust for different film sizes."

    {
      "title": "Seal the film spiral in the development tank.",
      "content": "Seal the film spiral in the development tank. The development tank is a lightproof container where you’ll mix the developing chemicals. Set the spiral on the bottom of the tank so the film is on the side. Place the lid on top of the tank and screw it on to secure it in place. [6] X Research source Once the film is secure in the development tank, then you can turn the lights on again."

      "title": "Wear safety glasses and latex gloves.",
      "content": "Wear safety glasses and latex gloves. Since you’ll be working with chemical developers, make sure to protect yourself. Put on safety glasses so the solutions don’t splash into your eyes. Then, protect your hands with latex or nitrile gloves so your skin doesn’t get irritated if you accidentally spill. [7] X Research source If you’re worried about the chemicals spilling on your clothes, you can also wear a protective apron."

      "content": "Combine the developer solution and water. Measure 60 ml (2.0 fl oz) of the developer into a measuring cylinder. After you add the developer, pour in 240 ml (8.1 fl oz) of room temperature water. Mix the solution thoroughly with a stirring spoon. [8] X Research source The developer makes the image appear on the film."

      "content": "Dilute the stop bath solution with water. Pour 15 ml (1.0 US tbsp) of the stop bath into a second measuring cylinder. Then, add 285 ml (9.6 fl oz) of room temperature water to dilute the stop bath. Stir the solution with a spoon until it’s combined. [9] X Research source The stop bath prevents the pictures on your film from getting overdeveloped. Never mix the stop bath and developer together before you develop your film or else it will not work."

      "title": "Pour the developer into the tank and agitate it for 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Pour the developer into the tank and agitate it for 10 seconds. Remove the top part of the tank’s lid so your tank looks like a funnel. Slowly pour all of the developer into the tank and press the lid back into place. Once it’s sealed, agitate the tank by flipping it upside down and right-side up again repeatedly for 10 seconds. [11] X Research source The tank is still lightproof when you take off the lid. Just be sure not to unscrew it entirely while you’re developing your film."

      "title": "Agitate the solution once each minute until the film is developed.",
      "content": "Agitate the solution once each minute until the film is developed. Pick up the tank and turn it upside down to mix the developer through the chamber. Agitate the tank every minute throughout the process so the film develops evenly. When there are 15 seconds left of your developing time, pour the developer out. [12] X Research source The amount of time it takes for your film to develop depends on the type of film and the developer you’re using. Usually, it takes around 5-7 minutes for a standard 35mm film roll. You can find out how long your film takes to develop here: https://www.digitaltruth.com/chart/print.php ."

Flip the tank upside down repeatedly for about 30 seconds so the stop bath coats all of the film evenly. When you’re finished, pour the stop bath out from the tank. [13] X Research source"

Fill the tank again with more water and invert it 10 times. Empty the tank when you’re finished and your film is ready to dry. [15] X Research source"

Secure a wooden or plastic clip to the end and use it to gently tug the film. Your film should easily unravel from the spiral. [16] X Research source There will not be any photographs on the end of the strip so your clip won’t damage any negatives. The film is safe to handle in the light after it’s been developed."

Make sure the film doesn’t touch anything while it hangs or else you could get dust on your negatives. [17] X Research source Make sure the room you’re using is clean and dust-free since it could damage your negatives. Cut the negatives into smaller strips if you do not have the space to hang the full strip."

      "content": "Let the film fry for 4 hours. Avoid touching or handling your film during this time so it can dry completely. Leave the film alone for the next 4 hours until it’s dry to the touch.
