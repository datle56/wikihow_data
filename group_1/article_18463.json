      "title": "Wacky Duck is a goofy game where players use fake voices to win.",
      "content": "Wacky Duck is a goofy game where players use fake voices to win. Sit in a circle, choose one person to be “it,” and sit them in the center of the circle, blindfolded. “It” must then feel around for people with a newspaper rolled up, and whoever they stop in front of must quack like a duck. If “it” can guess who quacked, they win. If they can't, they have to keep looking (and guessing) until they get one right! Try to play this game with at least 8 players to ensure it’s a challenge for the guesser to pinpoint who is quacking. After blindfolding the “it” person, you could also spin them in a few circles and rearrange the seating to ensure they don’t know who is sitting where."

      "content": "Wink Assassin is a stealth game where players must catch a killer. Prepare a chit (a small slip of paper) for every player participating, labeling one as the “killer,” and have players pick chits to determine who the murderer is. Then, everyone must stand in a circle and look at one another. The murderer must try to secretly “kill” players by winking at them, and everyone else has to determine the killer’s identity. [1] X Research source When the killer winks at someone, they have to count to five, then scream and pretend to die. To guess who the murderer is, a player has to say “I accuse.” Then, other players will have until the count of 3 to back up the accuser. As soon as two accusers point to the same suspect, and that suspect is indeed the murderer, the game ends."

      "content": "Would You Rather is a lighthearted game of choices and decision-making. Have all players arrange themselves in a circle and then choose someone to begin the game. That person must say a “Would you rather…?” prompt , asking a question with two options or scenarios. The person they ask has to pick one of the two choices. From there, you can continue playing until you have exhausted your questions. [2] X Research source “Would you rather be an only child or have 12 siblings?” “Would you rather never play a video game again, or never use your favorite app again?” “Would you rather wear winter clothes or summer clothes all year long?” “Would you rather meet Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift?”"

      "content": "Balloon Blow challenges players to make balloons fly by blowing them. Start by dividing all the players into pairs and giving each pair a balloon. From there, the goal of the game is simple: keep the balloon in the air as long as possible by blowing on it. The pair whose balloon stays up in the air longest wins the game! This game is best played with at least 6 players (or 3 pairs). Remember to only blow on the balloon—no head butts, wrist bumps, or anything else—as you play."

      "content": "Reveal your craziest stories while playing a game of Never Have I Ever . This is best played by teens that know each other and are comfortable sharing a few secrets! First, give everyone a few pieces of candy and pick a player to go first. That player must say a phrase beginning with “Never have I ever…” and ending with something they’ve never done. If another player has done it, they must eat a piece of candy. [4] X Research source “Never have I ever been out of the country.” “Never have I ever seen an R-rated movie.” “Never have I ever done something super embarrassing in the middle of class.” If you want to play for winners and losers, you could say the first person to eat their candy loses (or, conversely, the first person to eat their candy wins)."

      "content": "Singing Bingo lets you listen to your favorite songs as you play. Start by creating a Bingo card (much like the classic game), where every space has a word that is commonly used in songs. All players must then listen to music on the radio; if they hear a song that uses a word on their Bingo card, they can mark off that space. The first person to declare “Bingo!” wins. [6] X Research source Commonly overused words in songs include terms like “Oh,” “Babe,” or “Love.” Alternatively, make a set of flashcards with overused words to match your Bingo cards. Have players take turns picking cards and singing a lyric that incorporates whatever word is on the card!"

Then, assign each person a number. The person in the center must call out a number at random, throw a water balloon, and the person whose number was called must try to catch it. Anyone who drops the balloon is out. [8] X Research source For example, if your assigned number was 8 and the person in the middle of the group yelled, “Baby in the air, I call number 8,” you’d have to run forward to try and catch the water balloon. At least 8 (or more) players are ideal when playing Baby in the Air. Play this game outdoors if you can; popped water balloons can get messy."

Scout out the area for the scavenger hunt ahead of time to make your list and ensure everything your players will need is there. Then, hand out the lists and let the hunt begin! The first person (or team) to find and take pictures of everything wins the game. [9] X Research source Items on a scavenger hunt list tend to vary by the location the hunt is held in. For example, if you have a scavenger hunt in a mall, you might ask players to find things like “the most expensive shoes in Macy’s” or “meat lovers’ pizza at the food court.” You could also create an Instagram hashtag (like #ValleyMallScavengerHunt or #AlexBDayHunt) for all the participants to use as they post their scavenger hunt photos."

Each balloon symbolizes a “life,” and the last person standing with a balloon wins the game. Balloon War is a game of strategy! You can’t hide any of your balloons (they have to be on your person no matter what), but you can hide with them."

Split into teams; when it’s your turn to “draw,” think of a book, movie, or TV show and try to spell it out with a string of emojis while your team guesses what it is. If they guess correctly, you get a point—and the team with the most points wins. If you have a Pictionary board game on hand, you can also use that for emoji prompts. Avoid prompts that can be depicted with 1 emoji, as those are too obvious; for example, a secret word like “banana” would be easy to guess."

The Caller can call players to hint at their location but must keep moving around to evade them simultaneously. [10] X Research source Once somebody finally finds The Caller, the game ends! This is a great party game to play inside or outside, so long as you play it at night for that exciting, mysterious, and slightly creepy vibe."

[11] X Research source If you want to change the game, teams could win based on creativity rather than timing. For example, if one team made a decorative toilet paper bow or colored the paper with a marker, they could win points for originality."
