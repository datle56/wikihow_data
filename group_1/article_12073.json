      "content": "Identify the signs. Pericoronitis (the infection around the wisdom tooth) occurs when the tissue surrounding a wisdom tooth becomes inflamed and infected. It can be caused when only part of the tooth has “erupted” into the mouth, or if crowding near the wisdom teeth has made flossing and proper cleaning difficult. [2] X Research source To figure out whether your wisdom tooth is infected, it is important to be able to identify the tell-tale signs and symptoms. Look for the following: Bright red gums or red with white spots on your gums. The gums will be inflamed around the particular tooth. Moderate to severe pain in your jaw and difficulty chewing. You may notice swelling that looks like a small lump in your cheek. The swollen area may also feel hot to the touch. An unpleasant, metallic taste in your mouth. This is caused by the blood and pus at the site of the infection. You may also experience bad breath as a result. Difficulty opening your mouth or swallowing. This may mean that the infection has spread from the gums to the surrounding muscles. Fever. A temperature above 100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C) indicates that you have a fever, which means that your body is fighting off an infection. In severe cases, the infection may be accompanied by muscle weakness. If this is the case, you should contact a dentist or doctor immediately. In some cases, the root may also be infected. If this is the case, your dentist will likely extract the tooth."

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually available over the counter at pharmacies and drug stores. [7] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin are the most common NSAIDs. Do not give aspirin to children under age 18, as it has been linked to the development of Reye’s Syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is not an NSAID and does not reduce inflammation, but it can help relieve pain. Follow the dosing instructions on the packaging, or as instructed by your doctor, and do not exceed the maximum dosage. Keep in mind that each drug has its own list of side effects, so read the product advice information on the packaging before taking any medication. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if needed."

If there is an abscess on the gums, sometimes a small incision will be made to drain the pus. After the cleaning, your dentist will recommend home care for you to follow over the next few days.

      "content": "Prepare yourself for minor surgery. One of the main causes of wisdom tooth infection is when a section of gum covering the wisdom tooth — known as the gum flap —becomes infected due to bacteria, plaque and food debris becoming trapped underneath it. If the tooth is still buried within the gums (but is positioned to emerge from the gums correctly) it is often easier to remove the infected gum flap than the tooth itself. [13] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Your dentist might schedule a minor surgical procedure called an ‘operculectomy’, in which the soft gum tissue covering the wisdom tooth is removed. Once removed, the area will be a lot easier to keep clean and free of plaque and bacteria, which greatly reduces the chances of the wisdom tooth becoming reinfected. Before the procedure, your dentist will numb the area with a local anesthetic. S/he will then remove the infected tissue flap using surgical scalpel blades, lasers or electrocautery methods."

It is essential that you follow your dentist's advice regarding good oral hygiene practices.

In order to avoid future infections, it is essential to maintain good oral hygiene. The first step to good oral hygiene is to brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled toothbrush. Hard-bristled toothbrushes are too harsh and can wear away delicate tooth enamel. [17] X Research source Hold your toothbrush at 45-degree angle to your gumline. Brush your teeth using small circular motions, rather than brushing back and forth (as this can damage tooth enamel). You should brush your teeth twice a day, for at least two minutes at a time. Make sure to brush down to the gum line and don't forget the teeth at the back."

Hold the floss firmly between both hands and work it gently down between the teeth using a gentle back and forth movement. Try not to \"ping\" it down onto the gums, as this is irritating to the gums and can cause bleeding. Curve the floss into a “C” shape against one tooth. Slide the floss gently between your tooth and your gum. Holding the floss tightly, rub the tooth with gentle back and forth motions. Make sure to floss between every tooth and at the backs of your rear molar. You should always rinse your mouth after flossing to remove the dislodged plaque and bacteria."
