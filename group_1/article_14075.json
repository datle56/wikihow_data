Only write the number in the “ones” place position as part of your answer. [2] X Research source Example: In this problem, 14 is greater than 10, so the you must carry the 1 over to the next place setting. The 4 will be the right-most digit in your answer."

Since you carried over 1 from the previous place setting, you must also add it to the doubled value of this place setting. 5 + 5 + 1 = 11"

Example: Since 11 is greater than 10, you will need to carry the extra 1 over to the next place setting. The right-hand 1 will be the middle digit in your answer. There is only one place setting left to deal with in this answer. You will need to add the values of this place setting together along with the 1 you carried over: 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 This 7 will be the left-most digit in your answer."

Doubling any digit between 5 and 9 will result in a two digit number, which makes this step necessary. Doubling and digit between 0 and 4 will result in a single digit number.

The double of 7 is 14 . Ignore the tens place ( 1 ) and only save the value of the ones place ( 4 ) for your final answer. This 4 will appear in the middle of your final answer."
