      "content": "Make a vinegar trap. Pour about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of apple cider vinegar into a clean plastic cup. Stir in 2 drops of dish soap so that the 2 ingredients are well combined, and place transparent tape over the top of the cup so it’s entirely covered. Poke a small hole in the tape with a thick needle or similar tool so the gnats can fly into the cup and get stuck in the tape. [1] X Research source The gnats will be attracted to the smell of the mixture and get stuck in the cup. They’ll die after a few hours or so. If you have a lot of fungus gnats in your soil, plan to dump out and replace this trap every day or so. Want more ideas for getting rid of fungus gnats?

      "content": "Lure larvae out with potato chunks. Cut a raw potato into chunks, then place the chunks on top of the soil near your plant’s roots. Larvae love to feast on starchy foods, so they’ll be lured out of the soil and onto the potato. After a couple of days, check the chunks for larvae and eggs. If you see any fungus gnats, throw the potato chunks into the trash, then add more potatoes. [2] X Research source Keep using your potato chunks until there are no more larvae or eggs on the potatoes."

      "content": "Put a fabric softener sheet on top of the soil to repel the gnats. Fabric softener sheets are great for getting rid of gnats because many of them contain linalool, which is a naturally-occurring alcohol found in many flowers and spice plants. Insects are repelled by the smell, which is why they tend to stay away from linalool. Grab a fabric softener sheet and place it on the soil of your houseplant around the roots. The sheet will prevent the gnats from laying their eggs in the soil and the scent will keep them away from your plant. [3] X Research source Researchers have found that Bounce original fabric softener sheets work best for repelling fungus gnats. However, any fabric softener with linalool will do the trick."

Buy a bottle of neem oil and dilute it with water according to the instructions on the bottle. Then, spray the soil and the leaves of your plant once a day to naturally repel fungus gnats. [5] X Research source Neem oil is not toxic, so it’s safe to use around children and pets."

Follow the instructions that come with the diatomaceous earth and mix it into your houseplant's soil, or just spread it on the top layer of soil so it's about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. [6] X Research source Wear a mask when you're mixing the diatomaceous earth in with your soil, if possible, so you're not breathing it in. Diatomaceous earth is a natural type of ground-up rock that is great for pest control."

      "content": "Purchase bugs that prey on gnats to get rid of them for a natural option. Biological controls include things like nematodes , mites, or rove beetles which will prey on the gnats. Look for these at a bug or organic pest control store and release them into the soil to let them do their job.

      "title": "Let the plant’s soil dry out between waterings.",
      "content": "Let the plant’s soil dry out between waterings. If your houseplant’s soil is always wet or damp, this will attract gnats. Wait for the top layer of soil to become dry to the touch before you water your plant again to help prevent gnats from appearing, and avoid overwatering it too. [9] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. To quickly dry out your soil, point a fan at your plants. Try watering your plants from the bottom up. Fill up a bowl or a sink with water, then dip the bottom of your plant into it. After a few minutes, take your plant out of the water and let it drain."

      "title": "Use pots that have good drainage.",
      "content": "Use pots that have good drainage. It’s important for your plant’s pot to have holes in the bottom so the extra water can drain out. Pick out a pot that has at least one drainage hole in the bottom. If you're using a pot that doesn't have any drainage holes, it’s best to transfer the plant to a new pot that does so it will stay healthy. [10] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. Pots with drainage holes also help prevent root rot, which can kill plants over time."

      "content": "Pour out the excess water that gathers in saucers. If your houseplant is sitting in a saucer that catches the extra water after you water the plant, empty these once all of the water has drained through the soil. If you leave the water sitting in the saucer, it can attract more gnats. [11] X Research source Wait a few minutes after you water the plant before emptying the saucer so the soil has time to drain."

If leaves or flower petals from your plants fall off, pick them up out of the soil as soon as you see them and discard them. Once parts of your plant fall off and start to decay in the soil, it’ll attract the gnats. [12] X Research source Check your houseplants each day to pick up any dead plant material. Consider composting the dead plant material or throwing it in the trash if composting isn't possible."

      "content": "Sprinkle a layer of sand over the soil to keep gnats from laying eggs. Gnats don’t like laying their eggs in sand because it dries out quickly and has a rough texture. Add a layer of sand that’s about 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) thick, covering the soil thoroughly so the gnats can't reach it.
