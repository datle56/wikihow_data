      "content": "Ask your friends and family to spend time with you. They can offer you advice or simply be a distraction in your time of need. You don’t have to do anything big—simply going over to someone’s house for dinner or watching a movie together can help you keep your mind off things. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If you feel comfortable, you could try talking about your feelings with your friends or family members. If you don’t, that’s okay too. Being alone suddenly after you’ve been in a long term relationship can be hard. Try not to isolate yourself, and aim to spend time with positive, upbeat people who will improve your mood. If you’re feeling particularly lonely, try reconnecting with old friends or making new ones by joining a club or hobby group. If you find spending time with friends and family isn’t enough, consider reaching out to a therapist for professional help. Reader Poll: We asked 566 wikiHow readers who've been through a breakup, and only 7% of them agreed that the best way to cope is by seeking professional help. [Take Poll] You should always seek professional help if you think you need it, but sometimes spending time with loved ones is enough to heal on your own."
