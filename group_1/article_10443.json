      "content": "There are a few reasons you'll get a CPU fan error: The fan is installed incorrectly The fan revolves too slowly Your system is overheating You have a liquid cooling system . Most CPU fan errors pop up whenever you boot your computer. If your computer randomly turns off while you're using it and you see a CPU fan error, your computer is probably overheating and shutting down to prevent damage."

      "content": "Ignore the CPU fan speed in the BIOS/UEFI. If you have a liquid cooling system, it can't be detected by the BIOS, resulting in a CPU fan error popping up every time you turn on your computer. To fix this, enter the BIOS/UEFI , go to Monitor > CPU Fan Speed , and select Ignore . [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Open your PC and check the fan.",
      "content": "Open your PC and check the fan. Use your manual or look online to see where you're supposed to install the fan according to your motherboard. Make sure you have the correct cables, 3-vs-4 pins. On some computers, there's a CHA connecter that you want to avoid attaching the fan to. If the fan has been working fine for a while and you suddenly get this error, make sure it is still secured in place. Any jostle or shake could have dislodged the fan from its proper place and triggered the error message. Ensure the computer is off and unplugged before you check the fan to avoid further damage."

      "title": "Try a different CPU fan slot.",
      "content": "Try a different CPU fan slot. If one slot is giving the CPU fan error, it might be damaged. Many motherboards come with multiple fan slots, so try another one to see if it gets rid of the error message."

    {
      "title": "Change the fan speed in BIOS.",
      "content": "Change the fan speed in BIOS. If your fan revolves slowly, the CPU might not register it, giving you the CPU error message. Fix this by entering the BIOS and selecting a slower fan speed. For example, \"CPU Fan Speed Low Limit\" is what you want to select if you're using an Asus computer. [2] X Research source If you don't see the \"Low Limit\" option, make sure the Q-Fan Control is set to \"DC Mode,\" \"PWM Mode,\" or \"Auto.\" If you have an older version of the Asus motherboard, you'll see \"Enabled,\" \"Advance Mode,\" and \"Auto\" instead."

      "content": "Don't overclock too much. Although overclocking may make your computer run faster and give you better graphics, it's also liable to overheat. Overheating too frequently can damage circuits and cause interior damage."

      "title": "Clean your fans.",
      "content": "Clean your fans. Ensure your computer is off and unplugged before you clean it to avoid any static shock or damage. If you can reach the fans, use a tool like compressed air at a safe distance (in very short bursts) to blow away any dust or debris . Note that opening a laptop or enclosed case to access internal fans might void the warranty or cause more damage. Be careful not to hold the compressed air too close, as you can damage the fan blades. If you're unsure, check your computer's manual or contact customer service for more help."
