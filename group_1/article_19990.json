As well as your videos not appearing on the For You page or hashtag search results, you'll also notice that your videos are getting very small number comments, likes, or views relative to your popularity, and that you're not getting new followers. You can figure out if you're shadowbanned by having a friend (someone with a different TikTok account) search for your videos via TikTok's search feature . If your videos and account is not listed at the top of search results, it is possible you have been shadowbanned."
