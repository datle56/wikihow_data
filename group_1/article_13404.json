      "content": "Backcomb or tease your hair to create volume. Scrunch some volumizing powder or mousse into your roots, then grab a teasing brush or boar bristle flat brush. Starting at your hairline, take a section of hair about the size of your brush and hold the ends up in the air. Lightly brush the hair back towards the root for 2-3 strokes. Work towards the back of your hair, repeating the process until all of your hair is teased. This teasing method is great for any updo, such as the Gibson Girl. If you’re starting with wet hair, blow-dry it upside down before adding volumizing mousse or powder. Teasing or backcombing may not be necessary if you naturally have very thick hair, but you’ll definitely want to add some volume if you have thin or normal hair."
