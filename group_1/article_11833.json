Unknown cats may not have vaccines, so you may need to have preventative treatment for bacterial infections, tetanus, or rabies.

Any cat scratch can be painful, but the depth of the scratch will determine the severity of the wound. A shallow wound that involves the uppermost layer of skin but involves minimal bleeding can be considered superficial. A deeper scratch injury that pierces several layers of skin and bleeds moderately should be considered serious.

      "content": "Watch out for cat scratch disease. Cat scratch disease, the commonest disease spread by cats, is caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. Cats act as a reservoir for the disease, and it's especially prevalent among young cats and cats with fleas. About 40% of cats carry the bacteria at some point in their lives, but will show no sign of carrying the disease. Some cats who have cat scratch disease can develop heart disease, ulceration in their mouths, or eye infections. The first sign of cat scratch disease in humans is usually a small swelling at the region of the cat scratch or bite, followed by enlarged lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck. Next is a fever, fatigue, red eye, joint pain, and sore throat. Untreated cat scratch disease in humans can cause severe eye, brain, liver, or spleen damage. Immuno-compromised people are at higher risk of experiencing complications or even death from cat scratch fever. The diagnosis of cat scratch disease is usually by B henselae serology but can be diagnosed by culture, histopathology, or polymerase chain reaction. It is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, rifampin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin or bactrim."

Severe cases can cause damage to the brain, eyes, or lungs, and an infection can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women. Therefore, pregnant women should avoid tending to the litter box or cat feces during pregnancy. Treatment for toxoplasmosis involves taking an antiparasitic drug such as pyrimethamine.
