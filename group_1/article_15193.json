      "title": "Wash your hair 24 to 48 hours before dyeing.",
      "content": "Wash your hair 24 to 48 hours before dyeing. Doing this allows the natural oils in your hair to develop which in turn allows the dye to bind to your hair more easily. The dye will blend more naturally with your hair, and that tends to make it last longer . If possible, avoid conditioner when you wash your hair the day before dyeing it. Conditioner eliminates your natural oils, which you need for the dye to set in more easily. If your hair is extremely dry, condition it every night for at least five minutes in a hot shower for a week before you plan to dye your hair. Then, do not condition your hair the night before dyeing. This will keep your hair from drying out after you dye it."

      "content": "Pick a color that you really like. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the hundreds of shades you can choose from. If this is your first time dyeing your hair, it's best to stick to a hair dye that is no more than two shades darker or lighter than your own natural hair color. If you are new to dyeing, you can also try dyeing your hair with a temporary or semi-permanent dye first. Using one of these types of dyes ensure that if you mess up, you won’t have live with your mistake for long. Keep in mind that you have to apply semi-permanent dye to damp hair. Temporary dyes, such as chalk and mousse, usually wash out after 1 to 2 shampoos. Semi-permanent dyes will rinse out after 20 to 26 shampoos. Permanent dyes are permanent. The color may fade after 6-8 weeks, but will need to grow out. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Protect your home and yourself from dye stains. While you want to stain your hair, you do not want weird blotches of cherry red all over your carpet and favorite shirt. Cover any surface around you that might get dye on it and put newspapers on the floor. Have paper towels nearby to deal with spills. Wear a ratty old shirt you do not like, preferably one you are ready to throw away. It is very easy to get dye on whatever shirt you are wearing."

      "content": "Put a towel or color cape around your shoulders. The towel or cape will catch any dye that may drip off of your hair during the dyeing process. You can purchase a color cape at a beauty supply store. Secure the towel in the front of your neck with a safety pin or clip. If you decide to use a towel, use one that is a dark color to avoid visibly staining the towel."

      "content": "Put on your gloves. Gloves generally come with a dye kit, but if they don’t, you can simply use normal rubber, vinyl, or latex gloves. Remember that it is imperative to wear gloves when dyeing your hair. If you do not, you will end up dyeing your hands as well. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the supplied bottle or a bowl to mix the dye. Follow the directions provided on the box. Most box kits include bottles that you use for mixing the dye. Follow the instructions to combine the dye ingredients into the bottle provided. Then, shake the solution until the ingredients are well combined. If your dye does not include these items, then you will need to purchase a bowl to mix the dye in. If your hair dye does not come with a paint brush, you can buy one at your local beauty supply store or just use your gloved fingers to apply the dye. Be careful picking colors based on what they look like on the box, as that may not be what you actually get. For instance, if you have black hair, you're too far on the color spectrum from blonde to easily achieve that color."

      "content": "Mix your dye with a developer. This only applies to some dyes - the box your dye came in will have instructions regarding developer. The developer is generally included in the kit. If it is not, you can purchase it at your local drugstore. If you need to purchase your own developer, choose a 20% developer. Each increment of 10 represents one level change of color. For instance, a 30% developer will move your hair up three levels. If you're a sandy blonde, then you can get to a bright, sunny golden blonde with 30%, because that's a level 7 to a level 10 change."

      "content": "Apply the dye to your hair in sections. Break each section of hair up into smaller 1/4\"-1/2” subsections as you work (this will just make your dye job more even.) Use the applicator bottle or brush to dispense the dye onto your hair. Use your gloved fingers to work the dye into your hair. [4] X Research source Whether to begin applying the dye will depend on whether or not you have ever dyed your hair before. For virgin (first time dyeing) hair, start applying dye about 1 inch (3 cm) from your roots. For touch-ups, start applying dye about ½ inch from your roots. Work the dye into your hair well so that you do more than simply color the top layer of your hair. The thicker your hair is, the smaller you should make your sections so that the dye can saturate the hair fully."

Do not rinse the dye out before the minimum time or leave the dye in past the maximum time. Make sure to follow the directions exactly. If you have a lot of grey hair, it’s best to leave the dye in for the maximum amount of time. It may help to sit under a heated dryer, as well. [5] X Research source Never leave hair dye in overnight. Leaving it in overnight will dry out your hair and it may cause severe skin irritation as well."

If you want, you can put a shower cap on your hair to keep the dye from going everywhere. Once you have put a shower cap on, you can wrap your head in a towel so that the cap retains the heat of your head. This will speed up the dyeing process."

Use warm water to rinse the dye out of your hair. Rinse your hair until the water runs clear. [6] X Research source Don't panic if you see the color run in the shower - this is totally natural and does not mean you’ve messed up the dyeing process. Keep in mind that if the dye is temporary, the dye will continue to run each time you wash it until it is completely gone."
