      "title": "Color it dark green with watercolor or colored pencils.",
      "content": "Color it dark green with watercolor or colored pencils. You will need a really dark green that could almost look black. This gives it a more avocado-ish look to it. If you want to, you can add a stem, but it isn’t mandatory as it may let the avocado look like a pear if not done correctly."
