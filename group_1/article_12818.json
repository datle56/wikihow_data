      "content": "Get an over-the-counter kitten dewormer. If you want to deworm your kitten at home before taking them to the vet, you can buy a commercial dewormer. Look for products containing pyrantel pamoate, which will kill round and hookworms. [3] X Research source Only use over-the-counter dewormers that are labelled as safe for cats. You must look at the age restrictions on the dewormer to make sure the kitten is old enough. Some dewormers are for cats six weeks and up, while others may be nine weeks and up. Over-the-counter worm preventatives and treatments may come in liquid, tablets, or topical solution. A liquid solution is given orally, as are the tablets. Topical solutions are liquid solutions that are placed directly on the skin. No dewormer will get rid of all types of worms. While a commercial dewormer will get rid of most common types of worms, your kitten may still have worms that aren’t treated by the medicine. Take your cat to the vet as soon as you can to get a fecal exam, so they can be treated for the specific worms they carry."
