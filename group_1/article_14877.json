      "content": "Sip gin neat or straight to experience its natural flavors. One of the best ways to enjoy the flavor of gin is to sip it neat—which means you drink it without any additional preparation—no chilling, no ice, and no mixing. To enjoy gin this way, pour 1½ oz (44 ml) into a glass. Sip the gin slowly to experience all the subtle citrus or herbal notes that you might not pick up when its mixed with other drinks. All gins are infused with juniper berries along with other botanicals like citrus, coriander, or cardamom. As you sip your gin, try to pick out the different florals, citrus, and herbal notes. [1] X Research source London Dry gin is the most popular type and has a crisp juniper and citrus flavor. Old Tom gin has the same aroma, but with added sugars or barrel-aging that adds a softer mouth feel. [2] X Research source Plymouth gin as a softer, more earthy citrus flavor. New Western or Contemporary gin describes any gin with a flavor that doesn’t fit into the other categories. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Test how temperature changes the flavor of your gin. When sampling gin for the first time, sip it at room temperature to get a feel for its natural flavors and aromas. [4] X Research source Then, try it on the rocks (with ice) or have it up (chilled) to see how the notes change. You can also put it in the freezer to see how the extreme cold changes the texture and taste of the gin. To drink it on the rocks, place 2 or 3 ice cubes in a glass and pour a shot of gin over the top. Before taking a sip, swirl the gin around in the glass a few times to help chill it. To have your gin “up,” pour a shot of gin into a martini shaker filled with ice. Put on the lid and shake it thoroughly. Remove the lid, leaving the strainer on, and pour the gin into a glass. You can also use chilled whiskey stones instead of ice cubes. These are special rocks that you freeze, and that cool your drink without watering it down. While the alcohol won’t freeze, it will make the gin a little thicker. As the gin warms, it will become less viscous and the flavors will become more apparent. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a delicious gin cocktail. Pair your gin with other mixers, like tonic water or lemonade, to create a yummy cocktail. Mix 1 part gin with 2 parts mixer and pour it into a glass with ice cubes. If your gin has a citrus aroma, compliment it with a lemon rind, lemon bitters, or a squeeze of citrus juice. If your alcohol tastes like herbs, serve with a sprig of mint or thyme. Contrast gins with citrus aromas or floral hints (like Bloom, Hendrick’s, or Bombay Sapphire) with herbs to get a more complex flavor. You can also contrast herbaceous gins, like Portobello Road and Broker’s London Dry Gin, with a citrus mixer or floral garnish to mix up the flavor pattern. You can also garnish herbaceous gins with rosemary, basil, or sage, or add an herb-flavored mixer."

Pour a whole bottle of a London Dry gin into an airtight mason jar or other sterile sealable container. Add 1 to 2 cups (about 200 to 400 g) of your ingredients, close the container, and leave it to infuse. [6] X Research source Fruits: Strawberries, blueberries, black currants, lemons, cucumbers, or blackberries. Let the mixture infuse for 3 to 4 weeks, then strain and enjoy. Herbs and plants: Rosemary, thyme, lavender, mint, elderflower, or rose. Infuse for 5 to 7 days before you strain and drink it. Teas: Ear Grey, green tea, or chamomile. Steep for at least 2 hours, then serve immediately."

If you’re really into the collector’s side of spirits, try to find popular gins from years gone by or unexpected ones, like AMASS Dry Gin, which is made with 29 different botanicals, including lion’s mane and Reishi mushrooms. [7] X Research source Unlike whiskey, gin doesn’t always get better with age—so try not to drink the ones older than 10 years. [8] X Research source When tasting a vintage or new gin, take a sip and roll the liquid around in your mouth to coat it before swallowing.
