      "content": "Find out where the state in which you were married keeps vital records. Different states have different ways of keeping vital records, including marriage records. In Pennsylvania, you’ll find marriage records at the Marriage License Clerks division of the county courthouse in the county where you were married. In Florida, you can find marriage records through the Department of Health’s Bureau of Vital Statistics. You can search online for the state’s name and “marriage records” or “vital records.” The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has information on how to find vital records in each state. This part of their website can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm . Always be sure to look on official websites that contain “.gov” in the web address for the correct information. There are other sites that claim to find marriage records for free or for a fee; these may not be reliable sources."

In order to look at more recent census and other vital records from the past 72 years, you may need to fill out a legal form, BC-600, that verifies you are either the person getting the record or his descendant. This formality is to protect the privacy of the public and only allows actual descendants or spouses to see address information on people who are either still living or are recently deceased. If you fill out form BC-600, you’ll need to mail it in to U.S. Census Bureau, P.O. Box 1545, Jeffersonville, IN 47131, along with a money order or check for $65.00 payable to \"Commerce–Census.\" [3] X Trustworthy Source United States Census Bureau The United State's leading and trusted source of quality data about its people and economy.
