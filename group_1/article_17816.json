      "title": "Hold the knife from the safe side.",
      "content": "Hold the knife from the safe side. Make sure you start with a closed knife. If the knife is already open you should find someone who understand a Butterfly Knife to close it for you. The knife has a dull side and a sharp side and you always want to keep your fingers away from the sharp side. Look at the anatomy of the knife and determine which direction the sharp side would close into. The knife slips into a groove inside the handles on both sides. [1] X Research source You want to hold the handle that would house the dull side of the knife. Even if you are not using a sharp knife, this is the proper technique."

      "title": "Flick your wrist back.",
      "content": "Flick your wrist back. Hold the knife directly out in front of you pointing forward. Now flick your wrist back. The flick of your wrist should be similar to the reverse motion of casting a fishing line. When you flip your wrist back the knife will open and the handle of dangerous side will hit you between your thumb and your forefinger. [2] X Research source Keep your hand where it is.

    {
      "title": "Flip the knife back forward.",
      "content": "Flip the knife back forward. This time flick your wrist downward so that the knife closes again. The knife should be a similar position to when you started now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open your thumb and flip the knife up again.",
      "content": "Open your thumb and flip the knife up again. The last time you flipped the knife up the handle hit you on the thumb and forefinger. Flip the knife up in the exact same way but open your thumb and move it to the side this time. This will allow the handle of the dangerous side to smack into the handle that you are holding, engaging the knife. [4] X Research source Once you have flipped the knife up into place close your thumb over both handles."

    {
      "title": "Use your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Use your dominant hand. Start with a closed knife to avoid cutting yourself and to complete the trick. You'll be flipping the knife open so you need it closed to start with. Hold out the hand that you use when someone hands you something or when you throw a ball. When holding the knife, stick out that hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curl your thumb under the catch.",
      "content": "Curl your thumb under the catch. Place the knife, lengthwise, along the second joint of your fingers. Now curl your hand in, placing your thumb just under the catch. Flick upward with your thumb against the catch to open it. Make sure to maintain not a necessarily strong grip, but a firm one as it is easy for the knife to fly out of your hand when flipping it quickly if you have no practice. Do not crush the knife in your grip, but do not hold it loosely either."

      "title": "Flip the catch to your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Flip the catch to your dominant hand. [5] X Research source Flip the catch to your right if you are right-handed or to your left if you are left-handed."

      "title": "Flick the first blade up, letting the safe side hit your fingers.",
      "content": "Flick the first blade up, letting the safe side hit your fingers. [6] X Research source You only need to make a slight jerking motion Pinch the back half of the knife against your thumb and fingers, letting the front half and the blade drop down. Now give a flicking motion and let the front half fly up and hit the back of your fingers. Knives that are heavier may require more than just a slight jerking motion and you will have to rotate your hand as you flick it to bring the piece up quickly and fluidly."

      "title": "Flick the second blade up.",
      "content": "Flick the second blade up. Remove all but your forefinger from the knife as it moves up by holding them straight out. [7] X Research source The front piece will fly up and hit the back of your forefinger. It is now the back piece. If you do it wrong, when you flip it closed, the blade half will hit the back of your forefinger. It is recommended practicing with a dull one. Once you get good at it, sharpen the knife.
