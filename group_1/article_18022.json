      "title": "Warm your tortilla and fill the center with your ingredients.",
      "content": "Warm your tortilla and fill the center with your ingredients. Spoon the filling just below the center of the tortilla. Arrange your ingredients in a straight line evenly across, not in a single pile in the center. For small tortillas, leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) on both ends free of toppings. For larger tortillas, you may need to leave 2 inches (5 cm) on each end. Warming tortillas in an oven: Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Wrap a stack of eight tortillas in aluminum foil and heat them in your preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Warming tortillas on the stove: Turn one burner on medium heat. Grab one tortilla with a pair of tongs and hold it over the burner for a few seconds, occasionally swapping sides. Remove once it softens and starts to turn brown. Warm tortillas in the microwave: Wrap a stack of eight in a clean, semi-damp paper towel or dish towel. Microwave the stack on full power for 30 to 45 seconds."

Gently fold it up so it covers the fillings entirely or by at least 1 in (2.5 cm). [1] X Research source If your wrap has a lot of filling inside, push the filling back inside the folded edge of the tortilla with your fingers as you roll it over. [2] X Research source For a more secure fold, hold the other edge of the tortilla up so that the filling slides down into the folded edge."

Holding the tortilla pocket holding the fillings firmly with both hands, roll the tortilla until the open edge is pressed against the side of the wrap.

      "title": "Spread the filling across the tortilla, slightly below the center.",
      "content": "Spread the filling across the tortilla, slightly below the center. Warm the tortilla on the stove, in the oven, or in the microwave to make it pliable. The key to rolling a burrito so it doesn’t leak is to make sure not to overfill it. Spread a small amount of the filling horizontally across the tortilla so it sits slightly off-center. Warming tortillas in an oven: Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Wrap a stack of tortillas in aluminum foil and heat them for 10 to 15 minutes. Warming tortillas on the stove: Turn a burner on medium heat. Grab one tortilla with a pair of tongs and hold it over the burner for a few seconds, occasionally swapping sides. Remove once it softens and starts to turn brown. Warm tortillas in the microwave: Wrap a stack of eight in a clean, semi-damp paper towel or dish towel. Microwave the stack on full power for 30 to 45 seconds. Make sure that there is enough room at each end of the tortilla to prevent the filling from falling out. If you have a smaller tortilla, 1 inch (2.5 cm) might be enough. For larger tortillas, you may need up to 2 inches (5 cm) on each end."

      "title": "Fold the sides of the tortilla in toward the center.",
      "content": "Fold the sides of the tortilla in toward the center. With both hands, bring both sides in toward the center. This creates a pocket, or envelope shape, for the fillings to sit inside of. If the fillings start to spill out of the top of the tortilla, take a little bit out. [7] X Research source As you fold, some of the fillings might slide down to the bottom of the tortilla or over the center mark. This is fine as long as none of the filling slides off the lower edge."

      "title": "Bring the bottom of the tortilla up, pushing the filling inside the pocket.",
      "content": "Bring the bottom of the tortilla up, pushing the filling inside the pocket. Use your thumbs to bring up the bottom of the tortilla, wrapping it up and over the fillings as well as the lower portion of your folded sides. Continue rolling until the fillings are tucked inside the tortilla. [8] X Research source Tuck the edges of the tortilla in towards your fillings as you roll to ensure that nothing falls out of either end when you eat it later. Make sure that each fold you make as you roll the tortilla up is as tight as possible. Squeeze the roll back toward you a little each time to ensure a tight roll."

From here, you can cut the burrito in half or eat it uncut. [9] X Research source Add any toppings you’d like on top of your folded burrito, like shredded cheese, lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, or chile sauce. Optionally, heat the seam of the burrito on a hot pan for a few seconds to seal it. [10] X Research source You can also place a few toothpicks in the seam to keep it secure."

If you’re making a quesadilla, sprinkle enough cheese on the top and bottom of your ingredients—the cheese will act as a glue, sealing both sides of the tortilla around your filling. [11] X Research source Warming tortillas in an oven: Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Wrap tortillas in aluminum foil and heat them in your preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Warming tortillas on the stove: Turn one burner on medium heat. Hold one tortilla with tongs over the burner for a couple of seconds, occasionally flipping it. Remove it once it softens and starts to turn brown. Warm tortillas in the microwave: Wrap a stack of tortillas in a semi-damp paper towel or dish towel. Microwave on full power for 30 to 45 seconds. If you have a square tortilla shell, divide the shell in half diagonally rather than lengthwise."

Bring the untouched half of the tortilla shell up and over so that it completely covers the filling, with both edges overlapping evenly. If you’re making a taco, serve it immediately. If your goal is a quesadilla, place it in the oven at 350 to 400 °F (177 to 204 °C) for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. [12] X Research source You can also toast both sides of your quesadilla in a pan on the stove with a little bit of oil, or brush both sides with oil and close it in a waffle iron or panini press for 5 minutes. Press the edges together firmly to pinch them in place."

For quesadillas and other similar dishes, use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the tortilla into 3 to 5 wedges and serve it hot. If your soft taco is stuffed to the brim, stick a toothpick in the top of the two sides to keep it together as you eat."

Spoon 2 tbsp (30 ml) or so of any fillings or sauces you want into the center of the tortilla and spread it evenly over the surface. [13] X Research source This folding technique tends to work best with sliced deli meats, flat greens, soft cheeses, chutneys, or thick spreads, not crumbly fillings like ground beef or shredded cheese.

This will create a spiral shape, with the tortilla and the fillings as two different layers inside the roll. [14] X Research source Wrap tightly so there’s minimal air in the center of the wrap. [15] X Research source This process is very similar to how you would wrap a jelly roll."

If you’re using cream cheese in your recipe, refrigerate your roll-ups for at least an hour before cutting into them. [17] X Research source"

Microwave the stack on full power for 30 to 45 seconds. For a square tortilla, draw a line of filling from one corner of the shell to its diagonal opposite. This fold is not as secure as the ones above, so it’s best to use it for larger fillings like sliced deli meats and sauteed vegetables that are less likely to spill out."

This will create one side of your tortilla wrap. [19] X Research source Make sure that the filling is completely covered by this side of the wrap. Alternatively, fold the end of the tortilla perpendicular to the filling, then fold the other two edges over that. This creates a nice pocket to hold your toppings while you eat."

Imagine a diagonal line connecting the rounded corners. Fold one corner into the tortilla, gradually rolling it toward that other corner along the imaginary diagonal line. Alternatively, fold one of these rounded corners over so that it meets the other rounded corner. Press the edges together to seal them."
