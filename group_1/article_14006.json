Your data remains stored by OpenAI as long as you keep your ChatGPT account open. You can view your saved conversations with ChatGPT in the left panel of the ChatGPT homepage. You can delete saved conversations easily—just select the prompt you want to delete, then click the trash icon. While deleting conversations removes them from your view, your chats can still be used by OpenAI. The only way to permanently delete your saved ChatGPT data (aside from the data that's already been used to train ChatGPT) is to delete your OpenAI account . [1] X Research source"
