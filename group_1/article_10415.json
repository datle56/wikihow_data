      "content": "Cut 2 rectangular pieces of fabric that are slightly larger than the bottom of the box. Lay the fabric on a table with the back side up. Place the box on top of it and trace around the bottom. Use a ruler to add an extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) on each side of the fabric. Cut the rectangle out of the fabric. [1] X Research source Cut another piece the same way."

      "title": "Measure the sides of the box.",
      "content": "Measure the sides of the box. Use a ruler to find the height of the box. Multiply the number times 2 and add 1 inch (2.5 cm). Measure the length of both the long side and the short side of the box. Multiply each number by 2 and add them together, plus 2 inches (5.1 cm). [2] X Research source For instance, if the height of the box is 5 inches (13 cm), multiply it by 2 to get 10 inches (25 cm) plus 1 inch (2.5 cm), equal to 11 inches (28 cm), and cut the fabric to that height. If the sides measure 8 inches (20 cm) and 4 inches (10 cm) in length, multiply each by 2 to get 16 inches (41 cm) and 8 inches (20 cm). Add them together plus 2 inches (5.1 cm) to get 26 inches (66 cm), and cut the fabric to that length."

      "content": "Mark and cut a long piece of fabric based on your measurements. Use the 2 totals from your measurements for the height and length of the fabric. Measure it out and cut it with fabric scissors. Along the long edge of the fabric, measure up to the height of the box and mark it along the length of the fabric with a ruler. [3] X Research source Make sure to mark it on the wrong side of the fabric with a pen or pencil."

[4] X Research source Once it's just tacky, not sticky, lay the fabric inside the box, centering it as well as you can. It will come slightly up the sides of the box. As it does, fold the extra fabric at the corners over and glue them into place, too. [5] X Research source You can also use plain school glue, or if that doesn't work well, watered down school glue (equal parts glue and water). Mod Podge is also a good option. [6] X Research source"

Once it's just tacky, center the rectangle on the bottom of the box and smooth it out with your fingers. Add glue to the sides of the box at the bottom and fold the fabric over it; the fabric should hang over 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so on all sides.

Line up a short edge so that 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the fabric goes over one side to the next. Also, the fabric should overhang the bottom about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Line up the mark you made on the fabric with the top of the box. [8] X Research source You'll fold the fabric over into the box in a minute; you want it to just reach the bottom with no overhang."

Continue all the way around, just working on the outer sides first. Paint or spray glue on each side 1 at a time and smooth down the fabric over it before moving on to the next side. [9] X Research source If you want, you can lay the fabric flat on the table and move the box instead. Make sure you're pulling the fabric taut around the corners. When you reach the first edge that you glued down hanging over one side, fold the piece you have leftover to make a smooth line. Fold it just enough that it reaches the corner of the box, then glue it into place."

Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the top all the way around to fold over the edges. Use fabric scissors to trim off the extra fabric. [12] X Research source If you prefer, you can measure the box with a measuring tape. Measure down one side, across the back, and up the other side to get the length. Do the same the other way to get the width. Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) to each measurement and then cut a rectangle of that size out of the fabric.

Fold the triangles flat behind the main piece of fabric, lining up the edges as you do. You may need to work a little to get this perfect.
