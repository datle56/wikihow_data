      "content": "Know what to include. Resume templates can be very useful if you are uncertain about how to format your resume, or you are not confident using the formatting tools on Word on another word processing programme. If you prefer create your own format and not to use a template, start by planning out which sections you will be including and how they will be organised. A resume should generally include the following sections: Education and qualifications. Work and volunteer experience. Skills and qualities. It should also include your full contact details and state that references are available upon request."

There are a number of different types of resume, including the chronological resume, the functional resume, the combination resume, and the curriculum vitae (CV). The chronological resume lists your work experience from your most recent position to your earliest position, with your responsibilities for each position listed under the position title and dates you held it. This type of resume helps you to show how you have progressed over time. [3] X Research source Most chronological resumes only cover the last 5 to 10 years of your employment history. You may wish to include positions earlier than this if they are appropriate to the job you're seeking. This is the format most American employers prefer to see resumes in."

This format enables you to highlight your skills most prominently, but also to tie them to your practical work experience. This can be helpful if your skills are more relevant than your work experience for the position you are applying for, but this format is unfamiliar to some employers and it is generally preferable to opt for a chronological resume. A combination resume might list your key skills at the top before providing a short account of your experiences. This type of resume can be helpful for those entering the job market with little work experience, or for those trying to change careers. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider a CV. A curriculum vitae serves the same basic purpose of a resume, but there are different conventions that govern how it is written. The curriculum vitae is a comprehensive list of your job experience from your current or most recent position to your earliest. Unlike the chronological or functional resume, which typically run 1 to 2 pages, the CV is as long as it needs to be to encompass your experience. The CV is commonly used when applying for positions in Europe, and also when applying for positions at colleges and universities worldwide. CVs can be thought of as living documents that records all your work and achievements, which will generally grow and develop over time more than a resume.

Employers have mixed opinions on the inclusion of an objective statement, so consider carefully whether or not it adds anything to your resume. If you do decide to include one, make it short and closely focussed to the position you are applying for. For example, you might write that your objective is “To contribute to the design of new word processing software.” Alternatively it may state the position you hope to attain, such as “A position as in healthcare policy and research.” Objectives have become less common, and you may prefer to provide this information in your covering letter .

You will probably find that most of your skills have been covered in your education and experience sections, but it can be a good idea to have a separate skills section. This is an opportunity to highlight any skills and knowledge you have that is relevant to the position, but does not fit in anywhere else in the resume. You can title this section as “Other Relevant Skills”, or just “Skills.” This could include proficiency in foreign languages, knowledge of particular computer software and programmes, and any other specific skills not previously mentioned.

Choose a single, easy-to-read font, either a serif font (Times New Roman, Book Antiqua) or sans serif font (Arial, Calibri, Century Gothic). All text should be 10 to 12 point, except for your name in the first-page header, which can be 14 to 18 point. Bold your name, your section headings, and your job titles. Allow reasonable margins around the edges of the page. Word's default settings are usually sufficient for this. Left-align your section headings. You can use single-spacing after a heading and before the section content, and double-spacing before a heading. Get your resume down to one page if at all possible. You can try adjusting your line spacing in the Paragraph dialog box, but don’t lose your neat formatting trying to get it down to one page. Rethink your words and try to express yourself more concisely."
