      "content": "Tinder’s official policy is that bans are final, but it’s possible. Unfortunately, Tinder tends to be pretty strict when it comes to bans. Their official ruling on bans is that they’re not reversable, but there’s a slight chance they’ll remove the ban if you appeal. [1] X Research source You’ll know you’re banned if you log in to the app or website and you get a message you’ve violated their terms of use. [2] X Research source If you have Tinder Gold or Tinder Plus and you subscribed using your Apple ID or Google Play Store account, go here to cancel your subscription to avoid being charged. If you signed up for Tinder Gold or Tinder Plus using the direct credit card option or on Tinder’s website, your subscription will be cancelled automatically."

      "content": "Yes, and this is the only official way to get unbanned. While Tinder claims that there’s no appeals process for bans, there’s actually a request page for this here . Select “Trouble with account login” and then “Can’t login, my account was banned.” Enter your information and fill out a description of why you think the ban was a mistake. They may unban your account. [3] X Research source If there was a misunderstanding with another user, try explaining it. You could say something like, “I know one of my matches got upset, but they misinterpreted what I wrote. Can you take a look and please unban me?” If you have no idea why you were banned, ask them to review your account. You might say, “I don’t think I’ve violated any rules? Was this a mistake? Can you review my activity to see what the problem is?” Finish your description with a kind and simple promise to never mess up again. If you get a friendly reviewer to check it out, they may unban you."

      "content": "Uninstall the app and disconnect any paired social media accounts. Tinder tracks your IP address, phone number, Wi-Fi, and SIM card. If you’re banned and you reuse any of these on your new account, they may re-ban you. Start by uninstalling the app on your phone. If your Facebook or Insta account are linked to Tinder, remove their permissions in the relevant social media sites by logging on and going into the security settings. [4] X Research source For best results, use a new phone and SIM card before downloading the app, if possible. This appears to dramatically improve the odds that you don’t get flagged as a banned member. Factory resetting your phone may help if you can’t use a new device. If you’re using a computer, use incognito mode or use a VPN to hide your IP address."

However, you can use a friend or family member’s phone number if you prefer. If you have more than one cell phone, you could use your second phone number. Sign up for a new Tinder account using a different email address. [5] X Research source"

Do not reuse anything from your old Tinder profile, since it appears that Tinder uses reverse image searches and scans for ban evasion regularly. Fill out your new profile using fresh photos and a new bio. [6] X Research source Then, you can start swiping. Do not sign up for Tinder Gold or Tinder Plus using a credit or debit card that you previously used on your banned account. You may want to change your age by 1 year (i.e. if you’re 22, make it 23), and change/add one letter in your name (i.e. if your name is Eric or Sarah, make it Erik or Sara) to increase the odds you aren’t detected."

So long as you avoid breaking the rules, you shouldn’t run into this problem again. [7] X Research source You are not allowed to: Share nude photos or share sexually explicit content. Harass, bully, insult, or intimidate anyone. Engage in hate speech (this includes anything racist, transphobic, bigoted, ablest, etc.). Promote a service or spam links to external websites. Share trademarked content, or content that you did not create. Use a third-party app, like an auto-swiper."

For the rest of your account’s lifespan, do not use any old photos, recycle material, connect to your home’s Wi-Fi without a VPN or incognito mode, or log in from your old device. So long as Tinder doesn’t identify that your new account has anything to do with your old account, you should be good. Just know, most users who have been banned end up eventually getting flagged again. Tinder seems very adept at spotting banned users, so you may need to repeat this process again at some point."

If you’re trying to meet new people, try one of these alternative options. They’re all free, but they offer premium services as well if you want something comparable to Tinder Plus or Tinder Gold. [8] X Research source Bumble is a dating app where women are always required to message first when there’s a match. Hinge is another dating app that’s comparable to Tinder, but geared more towards serious relationships. Grindr is a dating app designed for people who identify as LGBTQ+. Additonal options include Coffee Meets Bagel , HER, Plenty of Fish , eHarmony , and OkCupid ."
