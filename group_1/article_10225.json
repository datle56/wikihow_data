Even so, autistic people vary widely. Each person is impacted, gifted, or impaired by being autistic in a unique way. If you've met one person on the autism spectrum, you've met just one person on the autism spectrum. There are a lot of very negative stereotypes about autism, which can be scary, especially to people who don't understand autism well. Remember that lots of the things you have heard are worst-case scenarios, things that can be helped and improved over time, or blatant lies. Stay away from Autism Speaks and other groups that use scare tactics as a fundraising technique. They tend to exaggerate the negatives and often don't have your best interests at heart."
