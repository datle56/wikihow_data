      "title": "Get three eggs.",
      "content": "Get three eggs. You may not need to use every bit of egg. However, since you will only be using the whites, you need more eggs. You might want to chill the eggs to make them easier to separate, but that isn’t necessary."

    {
      "title": "Use nothing more than the eggshell.",
      "content": "Use nothing more than the eggshell. Once you get the hang of it, the easiest and cleanest way to separate an egg is with the cracked pieces of shell. Crack the egg along the equator and open it as cleanly as possible. Taking care not to puncture the yolk, transfer the innards back and forth, letting the egg white drip into a bowl below. After a few transfers, you should have little more than the yolk in one half the egg and the white in a bowl. You can throw away the eggshell and yolk. You won't need it. Repeat this process with the remaining 2 eggs. Collect the egg white in the same bowl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your hands.",
      "content": "Use your hands. Another easy way to separate the egg white from the yolk is letting it drip through your fingers. Some may not prefer this method because the texture of egg white is unpleasant. However, it is the most simple. To do this, crack an egg and hold one hand over a bowl. Pour the insides of the egg over your hand. The white will slide through your fingers, but the yolk shouldn’t. Discard the yolk and shell, and repeat with the other 2 eggs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a water bottle.",
      "content": "Use a water bottle. An increasingly popular method is using the suction of a plastic water bottle to suck the yolk out of the egg white. Crack the egg directly into the bowl this time. Make sure the mouth of the water bottle is a little wet to make it easier for the yolk to slide through. Squeeze it slightly. When you place it over the yolk and release your squeeze, suction should pull the yolk into the bottle. Discard the yolk, rinse the bottle, and repeat with the next 2 eggs. For more details about these methods and more, see Separate an Egg . Since separating eggs has been essential to cooking and baking for a long time, there are countless methods. If you aren’t comfortable with the more common methods for doing this, look around to find one that meets your needs."

    {
      "title": "Beat the egg whites (optional).",
      "content": "Beat the egg whites (optional). It is not necessary to do this, as the texture of the egg is less important than the nutrients themselves. However, it may be easier to apply an even coat to your skin this way. In a bowl, use a whisk or fork and beat the egg until it is light and frothy."

      "title": "Add lemon juice (optional).",
      "content": "Add lemon juice (optional). Adding lemon juice may help to loosen the blackheads, though it is not entirely necessary. Juicing a real lemon is the most natural way, but store-bought lemon juice would do fine. Add 1 tablespoon to your egg white and mix it up. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Add honey (optional). This natural substance helps your skin heal as well as providing a barrier against infection. Mix a little honey into the egg white with a fork or whisk.

      "content": "Add baking soda (optional). This can be easily paired with any other 'optional' substance. Baking soda is good for your skin in several ways. First, it helps create a paste that cleans and exfoliates your skin. Second, it helps neutralize Ph imbalances that cause acne. Finally, baking soda helps dry out your skin, killing acne and other bacteria. Try adding one tablespoon, and increase gradually if this makes the treatment more effective without harming your skin. To see similar treatments, see this guide about using baking soda to treat acne."

      "content": "Let it dry. Before applying any more layers, you need the first to dry. The idea here is to get multiple layers to create a thick mask of egg white on your skin. If you don’t let each layer dry, subsequent layers will simply combine with the others, and may not dry quickly or evenly. By applying a thin layer at a time, you are creating the mask bit by bit.

      "content": "Consider using a piece of tissue between layers. A way to ensure you have separate but conjoined layers is by putting a clean piece of tissue or toilet tissue between them. After painting on the first layer, immediately press on the tissue. Allow this to dry before applying more layers. You will apply tissue on top of each layer before it dries."

Try to peel off the mask, especially if you used tissue. Rinse your face with water and use a gentle cleanser to clean all the egg white off your skin. Pat your skin dry to avoid irritating it."
