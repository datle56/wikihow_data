      "content": "File and buff your nails to prepare them for gel polish. Use a nail file to create your desired nail shape, then use a cuticle stick to gently push your cuticles back from the nail beds. Next, use a buffer block in a back-and-forth motion to buff and create a slight texture on the surface of your nails. Sweep away the nail dust with a soft fluffy brush. Buffing your nails is an essential first step because gel nail polish will not stick to a smooth, shiny nail surface."

After applying a no-wipe gel top coat, place your nails under a UV lamp until the top coat is completely dry, and your gel manicure is ready for chrome powder! [3] X Research source No-wipe top coats are specially formulated to not be sticky after curing. They also give your nails a salon-quality clear finish. Be careful not to touch the top coat after curing it. Your skin contains natural oils that could transfer to your nails and prevent the chrome powder from going on smoothly. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source Since chrome powder is expensive, start with a very small amount. You can always add more if needed. Chrome powder is made of glass, metal, and pigment. It doesn’t actually contain any chrome because chrome is a heavy metal that cannot be used safely in cosmetics. [6] X Research source"
