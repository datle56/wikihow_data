      "title": "Get a proper diagnosis.",
      "content": "Get a proper diagnosis. The first step you should take towards fighting your PTSD is to verify that you actually have this mental illness. PTSD is an anxiety disorder and the symptoms can often overlap with other similar conditions. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source See a mental health provider for a thorough differential diagnosis so that you can get the adequate treatment for what's bothering you. In order to receive a diagnosis of PTSD, you must have a history of exposure to a traumatic event that meets specific stipulations. For example, you must exhibit symptoms from each of four symptom clusters for a specific period of time: 1) intrusion- nightmares, flashbacks, and recurrent memories; 2) avoidance- avoiding thoughts, people, places, and things that remind you of what happened; 3) negative alterations in cognitions and mood- feeling alienated from others, persistent negative beliefs about the world, inability to recall aspects of the event, etc.; and 4) alterations in arousal and reactivity- irritability, hyperarousal, sleep disturbances, etc. Anyone who has experienced a traumatic event can end up with PTSD. Children who suffer from abuse, people who have been sexually assaulted, combat veterans, and car accident or natural disaster survivors are all at risk of developing this disorder. Acute Stress Disorder is a related anxiety disorder that can often become PTSD. ASD occurs within one month after the traumatic event. It can last between 3 days and 4 weeks. Acute stress symptoms that last longer than one month are a sign that the disorder has progressed to PTSD. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk to a therapist who has experience working with trauma victims. Sure, talking to your parents or close friends can help you process your feelings after a traumatic event, but a therapist is specially trained at helping individuals like you. Tell your therapist everything! Even avoiding details that seem small can make the problem harder to resolve. If you have to cry, then cry. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Therapists may use cognitive-based treatments that focus on helping you to identify and change your thoughts and beliefs about the horrible event. Survivors often blame themselves for what happened. Talking through the event with a professional can help you to come to terms with how little control you had over what happened. Some treatment approaches involve gradual or all-at-once exposure to places or situations that relate to the trauma. One of the diagnostic criteria--avoidance--causes people to refrain from talking about or thinking about the event. However, processing what happened and talking about it with your therapist can help you to heal from the event. Your therapist should be open to shifting your treatment plan to the best option for you. Different people heal in different ways, and it's important to choose the treatment option(s) that best fits your situation."

      "content": "See a psychiatrist for medication management. If certain symptoms of your PTSD significantly affect your ability to function, such as not being able to sleep or having so much anxiety that you fear going to work or school, your therapist might refer you to a psychiatrist for pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed medication for PTSD, but other antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and other medications may be helpful. Note that each medication carries its own group of side effects, which you should discuss with your physician. [4] X Research source Sertraline (Zoloft) helps with amygdala seratonin deficiency by boosting your brain's serotonin production. Paroxetine (Paxil) increases the amount of serotonin available to the brain. Sertraline and paroxetine are the only medications currently approved by the FDA for treating PTSD. Other medications may be used, but they have not been approved by the FDA for treating PTSD. Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Venlafaxine (Effexor) are sometimes used to treat PTSD. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, but venlafaxine is an SNRI (selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), meaning it increases both serotonin and norepinephrine. Mirtazapine, which affects both seratonin and norepinephrine, may be helpful for treating PTSD. Prazosin, which helps decrease nightmares in PTSD, is sometimes used as an \"adjunctive\" treatment, meaning it is prescribed in addition to other treatments such as an SSRI and therapy. Suicidal thoughts may be a side effect of SSRI and SNRI use. Consult with your doctor to understand these risks and how to handle them."

      "content": "Participate in support groups. If you are having difficulty struggling with the fear and anxiety that accompanies PTSD, it may be helpful to join a support group. While these groups are not directly aimed at treating the disorder, they do help those dealing with symptoms feel less alone and provide them with encouragement from others who are going through the same ordeal [5] X Trustworthy Source National Alliance on Mental Illness Grassroots mental health-focused organization providing resources, support, and education for those affected by mental illness Go to source . Receiving a new diagnosis such as PTSD may be difficult to come to terms with. Taking part in a group helps you to see that there are millions of people out there managing this disorder. Joining a group may help you to reconnect socially. If your spouse or loved ones are having trouble coming to terms with your diagnosis, they may be able to gain useful tips and support by participating in a recovery group for partners or family members of those with PTSD.

      "content": "Take care of your body and mind. Many people have found that getting adequate exercise, eating a diet of healthy foods, and enough rest can make a significant impact on PTSD. Plus, all of these strategies have been proven effective against battling both stress and anxiety which are naturally high in PTSD-sufferers. [6] X Research source Changing certain elements in your lifestyle may help reduce symptoms or help you to be able to manage your PTSD symptoms better. When you are getting regular physical activity and eating a diet of whole foods, you may feel better equipped to attack negative thought patterns or come down more quickly from an anxiety attack. Avoid alcohol and drugs. Find healthier ways of coping with stress and undesirable feelings like going for a walk outdoors, reading an interesting novel or phoning a friend to talk things over. Recognize that having PTSD does not make you weak. Understand that PTSD can affect anyone. In fact, strong people may be the ones who wind up in situations that cause it, either because they stood up for what they believed in, tried to help others, or have survived personal obstacles. If you developed PTSD after military service, you were brave to join and you're still brave now. Facing PTSD and seeking treatment is courage in itself."

      "content": "Recognize the signs of an impending panic attack. Persistent fear is an underlying aspect of having PTSD. Excessive stress or fear can cause panic attacks, and panic attacks often co-occur with PTSD. These may last anywhere from five minutes to an hour or more. Sometimes, you may begin to feel extremely panicky without any obvious signs. Each time you respond in positive ways to your anxiety or panic, you will be working toward making it happen less often. Practice will make it easier to cope. Common signs of a panic attack include: [10] X Research source Pain in your chest Difficulty breathing or feeling short of breath Sweating Choking sensations Trembling or shaking Nausea Dizziness, light-headedness or faintness Chills or feeling hot Numbness or tingling Derealization (feelings like you're not real) or depersonalization (feeling like you're outside yourself) Fear of losing control or \"going nuts\" Fear of dying A general sense of doom"

This method can ease stress and help with conditions beyond anxiety like insomnia and chronic pain. Progressive muscle relaxation also makes use of deep breathing for even greater impact. Start at the tips of your feet and slowly move up through the body. While inhaling for 5 to 10 counts, contract the muscles of the feet, and hold. As you exhale, suddenly release the tension of those muscles, taking notice of how they feel after the tension has been let go."

      "content": "Try to minimize worrying. Constant worrying about when a panic attack will happen may actually cause it to happen. Keep yourself busy and distracted so that you do not accidentally start up excess anxiety due to nonstop worrying. Develop a few positive self-talk strategies for when you find yourself worrying over and over again. These can be telling yourself \"I will be ok.\" or \"This, too, shall pass.\" Reminding yourself that you have been here before and survived can make anxiety attacks less frightening and possibly even prevent them. When you find yourself worrying about the future, try to focus your attention back on the present. Write down some things you are grateful for or some positive attributes about yourself such as \"I am strong.\" This can assist you in getting a grasp on anxiety and remind you that your life isn't all bad which can feed panic."
