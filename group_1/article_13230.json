      "title": "Call emergency services",
      "content": "Call emergency services immediately after using an EpiPen. A severe allergic reaction is considered a medical emergency. If you are close to a hospital and have someone with you who can drive, head to the emergency room as soon as possible. Otherwise, call 911 or your local emergency number to get an ambulance to take you there. [2] X Research source Even if the EpiPen seems to be working and you feel okay, you still need to seek immediate medical attention. You may have another reaction or need additional medication or treatment. If you call the emergency number, tell the operator exactly what you were exposed to and how long after exposure you used your EpiPen. If there is a risk of additional exposure, let them know about that as well. It will help emergency responders know what to do when they get to you."

      "title": "Place the used EpiPen back in its container and label it clearly.",
      "content": "Place the used EpiPen back in its container and label it clearly. EpiPens have built-in needle covers that will shield the needle after it is used. However, you still need to be careful with it. Return it to the box, if you still have that. On the outside of the box, write the date and time that you administered the EpiPen. [3] X Research source If you don't have the original packaging for your EpiPen, write the time down on the outside of the tube with a permanent marker. Do not dispose of your used EpiPen until you've received medical attention. Keep it with you so you can give it to the medical professionals who treat you."

      "title": "Give the used auto-injector to emergency responders.",
      "content": "Give the used auto-injector to emergency responders. Emergency responders or emergency room personnel need to know when you used the auto-injector and exactly how much medicine was delivered. This information can help them determine whether you might need another dose. [4] X Research source Medical personnel know how to dispose of EpiPens properly. Typically, after the amount of medication and time are noted, they will dispose of it with the rest of the medical waste."

      "title": "Look at the EpiPen device to find the expiration date.",
      "content": "Look at the EpiPen device to find the expiration date. The expiration date on the original box may be different than the expiration date on the device itself. If the two dates are different, the one on the device will generally be more accurate than the one on the box. [5] X Research source If you can't find the expiration date on the device, use the date on the box as a reference. However, it's a good idea to take the EpiPen to a pharmacist and ask them if they can figure out the expiration date."

    {
      "title": "Replace your EpiPen before its expiration date.",
      "content": "Replace your EpiPen before its expiration date. If you live in a country that requires a prescription for an EpiPen, get your prescription refilled at least 30 days before your EpiPen expires. That way you'll know for sure that you always have a good EpiPen available. [6] X Research source You may want to call ahead to your usual pharmacy and make sure they have EpiPens available. If they are out and it's close to the expiration date for your old EpiPen, you may need to check at a different pharmacy. Ask the pharmacist to give you an EpiPen with the latest possible expiration date, so it will last longer."

      "content": "Save your expired EpiPen as a backup only if absolutely necessary. An expired EpiPen may still contain enough active medication to save a life up to 2 years after the expiration date on the device. While you shouldn't rely on an expired EpiPen exclusively, you may want to keep it as a backup for a few months after the expiration date. [7] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Do not attempt to use an EpiPen if the liquid inside is discolored or if there are solid particles in the liquid. This is a sign that the medication has destabilized and injection could be dangerous. You can view the liquid through the window on the side of your EpiPen. It is surrounded by a yellow box with the words \"Replace if solution is discolored.\" An expired EpiPen may not have enough medication to stop a severe allergic reaction. If all you have is an expired EpiPen, call the emergency number and state specifically that you used an expired EpiPen. Do not attempt to inject yourself again, even if you find an EpiPen that is still good. You don't want to risk an overdose. Set a reminder on your computer, phone, or other electronic device so you'll know when your EpiPen will soon expire and can replace it. Do not rely exclusively on an expired EpiPen."

      "content": "Take your expired EpiPen to your doctor or pharmacist. Even though they're covered with safety caps, you still shouldn't simply toss an expired EpiPen in with your regular household garbage. If you're going to get a new EpiPen, take your old one with you and give it to the pharmacist. They'll know how to dispose of it. [8] X Research source You can also give your expired EpiPen to your healthcare provider when they renew your prescription if you're not planning on keeping it to use as a backup."

      "content": "Keep your EpiPen in a dry, dark place. To keep the medication safe and stable, your EpiPen should not be exposed to sunlight or extreme moisture. If you feel more comfortable carrying your EpiPen with you, return it to a dry, dark place as soon as you get home. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Because of the humidity, don't keep your EpiPen in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. If you take your EpiPen to work, invest in a storage case or locker specifically designed to maintain the proper environment. You can find these at major online retailers. Your doctor may also have a recommendation. If your child has an EpiPen for school, give it to the school nurse rather than letting your child keep it with them. School nurses have special lockers where EpiPens can be kept at the proper humidity levels."

      "title": "Avoid exposing your EpiPen to extremely hot or cold temperatures.",
      "content": "Avoid exposing your EpiPen to extremely hot or cold temperatures. An EpiPen in its original carrier tube should be kept at room temperature, preferably between 68 and 77 째F (20 and 25 째C). While they can tolerate temperatures from 59 to 86 째F (15 to 30 째C), exposure at the extreme ends of that range should be brief. [10] X Research source If you're outdoors for an extended period of time, you might consider using a commercial carrier to keep your EpiPen in. These carriers are designed to keep your EpiPen cool and can be purchased online. Ask your healthcare provider for recommendations. While it may seem convenient to keep your EpiPen in a car glovebox, this is not recommended because of the extreme temperature changes. Only do this if you live in a relatively mild climate where temperatures do not fluctuate and humidity isn't extreme."

If you're traveling by air and need to take your EpiPen with you, tell flight and security personnel that you have it in your carry-on luggage. Never pack your EpiPen in a checked bag. The baggage compartment is not pressurized and your EpiPen could burst. [11] X Research source If you are traveling to a country where EpiPens are only available with a prescription, you may need a letter from your doctor explaining that the EpiPen is a medical necessity. Contact your country's passport agency in advance of your trip to find out what is required."

If you remove the cap, your EpiPen could accidentally release. The cap also ensures that the needle is sterile. [12] X Research source If the safety release cap comes off but the EpiPen has not been used, you can replace the cap. Return the unit to its carrier tube with the safety release end facing towards the opening. Gently press the cap back onto the end, being careful to keep your fingers clear of either end.
