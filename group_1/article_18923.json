      "content": "Understand how to get gunpowder from creepers. Each creeper drops 0, 1, or 2 units of gunpowder, but only if you kill it before it explodes. [1] X Research source Now that you know the basics read on for a few ways to kill it without damaging its precious goods. The steps below are organized by the tools they require. Methods lower down are faster and easier but require more advanced items."

      "title": "Place cactus in the creeper's path.",
      "content": "Place cactus in the creeper's path. One way to kill a creeper without fancy tools is to place cactus blocks behind you as it chases you. The cactus will damage them when they brush past it. [2] X Research source This is much faster if you just let the cacti injure it enough to finish it with a single sword blow. Thirteen cacti hits and one iron sword blow will kill a creeper. Twelve cacti hits and one diamond sword blow will kill a creeper. One cactus will sometimes hit the Creeper more than once. The creeper makes a noise each time it gets hurt, so you can count these to keep track of cactus hits."

      "content": "Fight creepers underwater. Explosions cannot hurt you underwater. [3] X Research source Lure the creeper to water deep enough to submerge yourself completely. Staying underwater, kill it with a sword . Remember, you need to kill the Creeper before it explodes to get gunpowder. The water is a safety feature if something goes wrong."

      "title": "Kill creepers in hand to hand combat.",
      "content": "Kill creepers in hand to hand combat. You can kill creepers without any fancy tactics. Needless to say, this is dangerous. Stash all your valuable items in a chest, and pick up an iron or diamond sword. Here's how to make a successful attack: [4] X Research source Lure the creeper to open ground. Double-tap the forward key to start sprinting. (On Pocket Edition, this requires version 0.12.1+.) Strike the creeper with your sword while sprinting to knock it backwards. This should cancel its explosion countdown. Immediately retreat to get some distance between you. Repeat. The creeper will die after three hits with a regular iron or diamond sword."

      "title": "Lure creepers into burning terrain.",
      "content": "Lure creepers into burning terrain. Equip flint and steel . Get the creeper to chase you over grass, planks, or other flammable ground. Run backwards and light the ground in front of you on fire. The creeper will catch on fire, then slowly burn to death. This will not cause an explosion, so you can still pick up any gunpowder that drops."

      "title": "Shoot creepers with a bow and arrow.",
      "content": "Shoot creepers with a bow and arrow. This is one of the easiest ways to kill creepers, especially if you start on the higher ground. Here's how to get this weapon: Each skeleton killed has a small chance to drop a bow and/or 0 to 2 arrows. [5] X Research source To make a bow instead, combine three sticks and three strings. You can get string by killing spiders or breaking cobwebs with a sword. To make your own arrows, combine one flint, one stick, and one feather. Flint is an uncommon drop from gravel. Feathers come from chickens."

      "content": "Tame ocelot bodyguards. Ocelots are cat-like animals that spawn in jungles, available in all versions of Minecraft. (You may need to update Pocket Edition to 0.12.1.) Creepers will not come near ocelots, so hunting for gunpowder is much easier with these cats around. Here's how to tame them: [6] X Research source Gather as much fish as you can, usually by fishing. Approach the ocelot, preferably in an open area. Sneaking is recommended. Hold the fish. Stay still and wait for the ocelot to look at you and approach. Feed the fish to the ocelot. Use the left trigger or L2 button on a console. Hold down the right mouse button on PC. Keep feeding fish until the Ocelot turns into a cat. It will now follow you."

      "content": "Know the odds. Each witch killed only gives about a 16% chance of dropping gunpowder, compared to a 66% chance when killing creepers. However, the witch can drop up to six items and may drop other items like spider eyes or glowstone. This makes them more profitable if you're interested in these extra items."

Make sure you have line of sight to fire bows from this high ground into the pit. Include a barrier to hide behind as well, since witches throw damaging potions. Warning: the hut may contain a witch. Be prepared for a fair fight before you set up your trap."

Ambush it from behind a tree or barrier to prevent this. The witch will poison you. Poison cannot kill you, but it can bring you to one health. Have a healing item ready to recover after the combat. Each subsequent potion will deal six damage. You should survive if you have decent armor and can kill the witch quickly."
