      "title": "Declutter and vacuum your car.",
      "content": "Declutter and vacuum your car. Wear a mask, gloves, and goggles to protect yourself against bacteria. Thoroughly deep clean your car by taking out all trash, food, open water sources, blankets, pillows, and other objects. Shake out the floor mats and use a vacuum with a thin hose attachment to clean any dirt or crumbs between creases, under seats, inside the trunk, and under the hood of the car. Cockroaches often burrow underneath car seats, so consider removing your car seats to clean more thoroughly underneath them. By taking out any objects that roaches can hide and breed in and removing any trash or crumbs, you make your car less attractive for roaches to live in, which may make the infestation leave on its own."

      "content": "Scatter diatomaceous earth powder where you’ve seen roaches. If you’ve already deep cleaned your car and your roach problem hasn't disappeared, try applying natural-grade diatomaceous earth (DE) powder to your car’s carpeting and crevices. After 24 to 48 hours, vacuum up the excess DE and any carcasses that may have been left behind. DE is a non-toxic powder that’s safe for use around pets and humans. However, prolonged exposure may irritate the lungs of people and pets. [1] X Research source Made from pulverized and fossilized one-celled organisms, DE powder can act as a natural pesticide that dries out insects that have an exoskeleton. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Put a mixture of baking soda and sugar or onions in the car. Cover a small number of onions in baking soda or mix 3 parts baking soda with 1 part sugar and spread the mixture in the affected areas. Place a small bowl of water beside the sprinkled mixture. When the roaches eat this mixture alongside the water, it can create gasses inside their stomachs and cause them to explode. [3] X Research source This remedy is a bit extreme and may be difficult to clean up, so use it with caution. However, baking soda is safe around pets and humans and can be effective."

      "title": "Combine boric acid with sugar and spread in the infected areas.",
      "content": "Combine boric acid with sugar and spread in the infected areas. Creating a mixture with sugar attracts the cockroaches to eat the Borax. Combine 3 parts Borax or boric acid with 1 part sugar and carefully spread the mixture around the surrounding areas. The roaches can take the mixture back to their nest, killing the whole colony. [4] X Research source After a day or two, vacuum up the excess mixture and any carcasses left behind. Getting rid of roaches with Borax can be safer than traditional pesticides, however, use it with caution around pets and children—it can be harmful if ingested. [5] X Research source Insecticide versions of boric acid are usually sold in cans or plastic squeeze bottles, and should be lightly dusted over carpets—cockroaches tend to avoid large hills of powder.

Glue traps are less effective than other remedies, but they may help you find out if your other efforts are working. [7] X Research source Place them in tight cracks or near corners of the car where roaches might run through. After a few days, remove and discard the traps in a sealed plastic bag along with the roaches it collects. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Put down poisonous bait traps to kill the roaches. If any of the above methods don’t work, consider placing bait stations or gels near the edges of the car or where you have seen roaches. After several days, throw away the bait along with any roaches you might find. These baits usually have a scent that mimics roaches’ favorite foods, and when the roach eats it, it ingests the poison inside and dies. Bait traps are filled with poison that can harm humans and animals—consider not using poisonous bait around children or pets and try a different method instead. Bug bombs were once a popular roach killer, but recent research has found that they can be incredibly harmful to your upholstery, your electronics, and your health. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Although it’s possible to use a bug bomb inside a car, the results aren’t worth the risk—try another method instead."

[10] X Research source Spray an IGR solution in areas where you’ve seen roaches. After several days, clean up any roach carcasses you see. Consider steam cleaning your car to get rid of any odors and leftover IGR. IGRs tend to have a very low toxicity to humans and animals when applied according to the manufacturer instructions.

[17] X Research source Get a bag or a box and gather everything you’ve been meaning to put inside with you to reduce any places that cockroaches can hide.

Clean your garage regularly and try to keep trash and stacks of firewood outside.

      "content": "Roaches like the heat, fermented food, and water that can be found in cars. If you have an infestation, your car might be providing roaches warmth, food, or access to water. Roaches are omnivores that eat rotten meats, fresh fruit, sugar filled foods, or anything with a strong odor, but even just a bottle of open water can invite them to move into your car. For example, crumbs stuck between the seats, spilled soft drinks, exposed adhesives, cardboard, newspapers, cosmetics, wrappers, or old lunchboxes can attract roaches. This is the reason why it’s so important to deep clean your car first and remove any items that might be attracting them to your car."
