To feel more youthful, even just temporarily, don’t worry about appearing stupid, silly, or crazy. [1] X Research source For example, don't worry about how loud you are laughing.

Many of the activities you can do to feel more like a child will require you to let go of your inhibitions and worry less about what other people may think. This may be hard to do, but you can start out small. Watch comedy movies and television shows and laugh as much as you want."

This might feel forced at first, but it will help retrain your brain to stop being judgmental and start being positive. Psychologists suggest that one of the best ways to reduce your judgmental attitude about other people is to start being nice to yourself since judgement comes from a place of insecurity. Make a list of your best personality and character traits. Read this out loud every morning, and you'll notice that you have a better perspective on the world and the people around you."
