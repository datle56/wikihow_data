      "content": "Whale eyes are when a dog shows the whites of their eyes. Certified dog trainer Russell Hartstein says whale eyes are when your dog looks at something from the side, causing the whites of their eyes (called the sclera) to show. Their eyes are usually focused on a thing or person while their head is pointed away.

Go to source Whale eyes are sometimes called half-moon eyes because the whites of your dog’s eyes have a half-moon shape. Dog whale eyes look similar to someone giving you the side-eye: your dog is giving something a sidelong glance while facing away from it."

      "content": "Whale eyes usually mean that your dog is feeling stressed or anxious. When your dog looks to the side and exposes the whites of their eyes, they’re most likely telling you that something is bothering them and making them uncomfortable. This could be for a variety of reasons, like a dog or cat is getting in their space, they don’t like how they’re being pet, or someone stole their favorite toy.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Whale eyes are considered an appeasement gesture in dogs, which are behaviors that dogs display when they’re stressed to signal that they’re not a threat. These gestures are thought to help prevent conflict. [3] X Research source Certified dog trainer Rendy Schuchat says that dogs reveal their emotions and mood through their body language. She advises that you read their body language to understand what they’re trying to say. Does whale eye mean my dog will get aggressive? Stressed, anxious dogs can sometimes react aggressively to defend themselves from a perceived threat, says Schuchat. We’ll explain what to do when your dog gets whale eyes to help them calm down in the sections below. Whale eyes can be caused by a medical condition, though this is less common. For instance, pain and diseases like glaucoma can lead to whale eyes."

      "content": "Stressed dogs often flatten their ears, go stiff, and get low to the ground. Your dog’s eyes are just one way that they communicate their emotions. To fully understand what they’re saying, Hartstein says you have to look at the rest of their body language, as well as the situation and environment you’re in. Stress signals that often appear with whale eyes : Pushing back and flattening the ears. Licking the lips. Yawning. Freezing up and going stiff. Lowering the head and crouching down. Tucking the tail. Hair rising up on the back. Barking, whining, and panting."

      "content": "Remove the stressor or your dog from the situation. Professional dog trainer Elisabeth Weiss advises figuring out how great the stressor is. She says if your dog is “able to focus back on you or they are able to take a treat…that means that the stress is manageable” so it’s probably okay to just remove the stressor or stop any behavior they don’t like. But, if your dog is “refusing any food and any attention, then it's time to remove them from that area and the situation.” For instance, if you’re at home, take your dog into a calm, quiet room. If you’re at the dog park, calmly and quickly lead your dog back to your car. If it’s not possible to remove the stressor, like if a repairman is working at your house, then the best course of action is to remove your dog from the situation. While whale eyes don’t mean your dog will get aggressive, it can be a possibility if your dog remains stressed out. Stop anything that might be triggering your dog and calmly and quickly remove them from the situation . If any children or other pets are present, remove them from the situation, too. Stressed dogs can react unpredictably and potentially aggressively. If your dog is stressed by routine care practices, like trimming their nails or getting bathed , praise them frequently and take as many breaks as needed until they’re comfortable again."

If your dog is experiencing chronic stress, like separation anxiety, help them feel more calm and comfortable by feeding, walking, and playing with them on the same schedule each day. Keep stimulating toys around the house and make sure they have a comfortable dog bed to lie on so they can calm themselves down, too.

Go to source Professional dog trainer Ovidiu Stoica agrees and recommends that you walk your dog and play with them regularly to help lower and prevent stress. Train your dog to calm down by telling them to sit or lie down as soon as they start to experience stress or anxiety. This teaches them to control their reaction and calm themselves down. According to Stoica, “When a dog’s needs for exercise, activity, and mental stimulation are met, they will be relaxed and comfortable in the home.” If your dog is still very stressed or anxious, talk to your vet. They may recommend professional training or medication to help keep your dog calm.

This can make your dog feel worse, which might escalate the situation, and actually reinforce their behavior. Instead, speak to them calmly in a low voice, keep your body language relaxed, and give them their space.

If your dog continues to act stressed or aggressive towards certain triggers, seek help from a professional dog behaviorist or trainer to modify their behavior. If your dog’s stressed or aggressive behavior is new, visit your vet. Dogs can grow stressed or aggressive when they’re in pain, so a medical condition may be the cause of their behavior.

      "content": "No, whale eyes can mean your dog is excited or just looking around. Whale eyes don’t always indicate negative behavior in your dog. Lots of dogs give the side eye when they want to play—you’ll likely notice them grabbing a toy and dipping into a bow (pressing their chest to the ground and raising their bottom in the air). It’s also possible that they’re just checking out what’s going on around them.

Go to source As always, check out your dog’s other body language to see how they’re feeling. Certified dog behavior consultant Dee Hoult says happy, playful dogs usually have a loose body, relaxed eyes, and a lower tail that is wagging in broad strokes. Some dog breeds simply have features that cause them to show more of their eye whites, regardless of how they’re feeling. For instance, brachycephalic dogs, or dogs with short snouts, may get whale eyes more often (like pugs, bulldogs, and boxers)."
