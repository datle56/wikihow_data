      "content": "Gel straight from the plant is best but store-bought gel works, too. If you have access to an aloe vera plant, carefully cut open a leaf, scoop out the gel with a clean spoon or finger, and apply the gel directly to the affected area. The gel is moisturizing so your skin will soak it right up. Do this twice a day—once in the morning, once in the evening. Studies show that aloe vera gel works best for mild acne. It’s less effective for severe and cystic acne. This technique is even more powerful if you use it alongside prescription acne medication like Retin-A. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Aloe vera is effective because it contains antioxidants, enzymes, and vitamins, along with anti-inflammatory properties."
