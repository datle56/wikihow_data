      "title": "Remember users you enjoy playing with.",
      "content": "Remember users you enjoy playing with. Remember or write down the username of a gamer you enjoyed playing with. This way, if you see them again, you’ll be able to recall aspects of their playing that you like, or, if they mentioned something specific while playing, you’ll be able to talk about it with them. Compliments are a great way to reach out for the first time. If you liked a strategy that someone used, or noticed a great move they made, let them know. Saying something like \"great shot!\" may not seem like much, but it lets them know that you've noticed them."

      "title": "Reach out when you see them online.",
      "content": "Reach out when you see them online. Message a user you've enjoyed playing with and ask them if they'd like to play again. Consider logging in around the time of day when you last played with them, in order to increase your chances of seeing them online. Many games offer the ability to “friend” another player, which will notify you when they’ve logged into the game. This way you can see when your new friend is playing and invite them to play with you at any time. Say something like, \"Great game yesterday! Wanna play another one?\""

      "title": "Make plans to play with each other later.",
      "content": "Make plans to play with each other later. If you want to be formal, you can ask someone if they’d like to play again soon, nailing down a date and time for another game. This can be a good way to strengthen beginning friendships. Try phrases like: “I enjoyed playing with you! Want to play again sometime soon?” “You’re good at this. Want to play another one?”"

      "title": "Remember to keep it casual.",
      "content": "Remember to keep it casual. While you might be looking for lifelong friendships, they might just barely be interested enough to play another round with you. Don’t ask for personal information straightaway, and never give up personal information unless you feel safe doing so. If you ever feel unsafe while talking to another user (if they're asking for personal information, such as your full name, telephone number, mailing address or other sensitive information), block them or stop talking to them. Only offer personal information if you think it will help your friendship grow, and won't be used in a devious way by another person. For example, if your friend gives you their first name and asks yours, it's probably not too much to give them your name. You could even give a pseudonym. However, if the same person asks which street you live on, where you go to school, or where you work, it's not a good idea to give up that information. If your friend ever wants to meet in person , be sure to have a phone or video chat with them beforehand, so you can verify who they are. Avoid alcohol while meeting up, as this can cloud your judgment and lead to an unsafe situation."

      "content": "Find groups on Facebook. Search for the game you want to play in Facebook’s search bar, then press the \"Group\" button to filter by group only. Oftentimes, multiple groups are available for each game. Just click the “Join Group” button, and you’ll be added by a moderator. From there, you can start posting in the timeline to see who wants to play. Avoid suggesting that you’re looking for “friends,” as this can make people think you’re looking for a big commitment. Instead, simply say that you’re looking for someone to play today or tomorrow. Keep it relaxed and informal. Try something like, \"Hi everyone, looking for someone to play Far Cry 5 with, 5pm CST tomorrow! Does anyone want to play?\""
