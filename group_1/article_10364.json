      "title": "Use a measuring tape to measure the width of the bottom of the arch.",
      "content": "Use a measuring tape to measure the width of the bottom of the arch. Measure only the window opening, and measure from left to right of the very bottom of the arch to find the width. Measure to the nearest 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm), do not round up or down as this will result in an ill-fitting shade or shutter. [1] X Research source If you are measuring for multiple windows, be sure that you measure each one as their measurements may vary. Be sure to measure the width where you plan to mount the covering, even if it is below the arch itself. For quarter arches, measure the bottom of the arch for the width."

      "content": "Divide your width in half and measure the height at that location. To get an accurate height, measure from the center of the width to the highest point of the arch. Record your measurement to the nearest 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm). Accurate measurements will ensure a great fit. For quarter arches, measure the tallest portion of the window."

      "content": "Choose cellular or honeycomb shades to be able to let in light. Cellular and honeycomb shades are often used for rectangular windows, but they can also be shaped for arched windows or just the arch itself. The benefit of these shades is that they are moveable, so you can let in light as you please. [2] X Research source Choose between fan-shaped shades and sunset shades for just the arch. These are often custom made, so be sure to measure your arched windows exactly before ordering!"

      "title": "Use fixed shades if you do not need to open up the arch of the window.",
      "content": "Use fixed shades if you do not need to open up the arch of the window. This type of shade can be used to match shades for the rest of the window if you choose to keep the arch closed but would like to open shades for the rest of the window. A palladian shelf can be used across the window to hold the rectangular shades. Fixed shades still need to perfectly fit the arched windows, so be sure to measure the size accurately. Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) to your length and width measurements if you plant to mount your shades on the outside of your arch."

      "content": "Install a palladian shelf to mount blinds and shades beneath the arch. A palladian shelf can be mounted on the inside of the window frame and is a sturdy structure to mount shades or blinds to extend below your arch. Measure the width of the bottom of your arch to get the right size and screw or nail in end brackets to install."

      "content": "Customize shutters to fit your arched window and match your decor. Use the measurements of your arch to choose from shutters that swing open, shutters with adjustable louvers to let in light, or shutters that stay closed if you don't need to open your arched window. Plantation shutters are a longer-term option for arched windows and can be customized to match elements of the room. You could also install an awning if you just want to shade the window. These can be stationary, or you can opt for one that will roll out when you need it. [3] X Expert Source Michael Fox Window Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 December 2020."

Use a drill or screwdriver to install a curtain rod above the arch and hang curtains or drapes that will cover the entire window.

      "content": "Mount a flexible curtain rod on the inside of the window frame. A flexible curtain rod is adjustable and allows your curtains or drapes to fit inside the arch of your window. This is an easy solution that also does not involve any screws or nails in your walls. [5] X Research source You may need curtain rings that lock into place to prevent your curtains from sliding to the sides. Use tiebacks to keep curtains open when you want to let in light."

      "content": "Apply a window tint to decrease light without losing visibility. A window tint allows you to see out of the window, but limits the amount of light coming in. Be sure you accurately measure your arch and choose a tint that is trimmed to the type of arch that you have. Clean your windows thoroughly, remove the adhesive backing, and attach the film to the window by starting at the top of the window and working your way down. [6] X Research source Be sure to smooth out any bubbles that form beneath the film. A tinted window can also make the room cooler because there is less sunlight entering through the window."
