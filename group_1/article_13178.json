Always put on work gloves or very thick rubber gloves and thick-soled shoes while handling broken glass to protect yourself from getting cut. [1] X Research source You should also keep kids and pets away from the area until you’ve finished the cleaning process. Even if you think the broken glass is only in one small area, it’s safest to keep children and pets out of the room completely, explains Olin. “You would be surprised how far glass can travel,” Olin says. “Once that breaks, you may discover a shard halfway across the room from the glass that you dropped.”"

      "content": "Place the large pieces of glass in a cardboard box or several trash bags. “You can generally safely use a broom and dustpan to sweep up the big chunks. Put them in a cardboard box if you have one because [the shards] are likely to cut through trash bags,” says Olin. If you don’t have a cardboard box, Olin recommends putting the pieces of glass into four layers of thick garbage bags to prevent any punctures or tears. Alternatively, you can also wrap the pieces of glass up in several layers of newspaper and secure it all with tape, but this works best for a small amount of broken glass. [2] X Research source Disposing of broken glass in this way is important because it protects sanitation workers from getting injured. If you put the broken glass directly in a garbage bin without any protective coverings, the sharp shards may cause cuts when sanitation workers come to collect your trash."

      "content": "Label the broken glass before disposing of it. Whether you used a cardboard box, placed the glass in several layers of trash bags, or wrapped it up in newspaper, make sure to clearly label it with the words “broken glass.” You can write the words directly on the cardboard box, or write them on a piece of paper then securely tape the paper to your trash bag or newspaper parcel. Now that your glass is properly contained and labeled, simply put it in your regular garbage bin or place it in your community’s dumpster. [3] X Research source"

Once you’ve collected the larger pieces to the degree that you can, go over the area with the hose attachment on your vacuum. [4] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Make sure to cover the entire area up to approximately fifteen feet away, since broken glass can fly quite far. Make sure you use the hose attachment! A conventional rolling vacuum will only crush the glass into even tinier shards, and it lacks the suction power of the hose."

      "title": "After vacuuming, use a damp paper towel to pick up any leftover pieces.",
      "content": "After vacuuming, use a damp paper towel to pick up any leftover pieces. Even a vacuum can miss some of the tiny pieces of broken glass. To get these super small shards, Olin recommends using damp paper towels. “The key to picking up smaller pieces is going to be wet paper towels that you can just throw away. So ideally, you'd want to use several paper towel rolls that are damp to pick up the glass that's left on the floor,” he explains. “You're also going to want to wear gloves and long pants that cover your knees while you're doing this because you're going to want to crawl around and closely inspect all areas of the floor before you finish. It can be very easy for some small pieces to escape you,” Olin says. When you're completely done, remember to wipe down the soles of your shoes to get any glass dust you may have picked up during the rest of the cleaning process. And that’s it! You’ve now safely and successfully disposed of your broken glass."

      "content": "First, see if you can give the unbroken flat glass away or recycle it. Flat glass includes things like mirrors, window glass, and tabletops, as well as dinnerware, drinkware, and ceramics. In the case of mirrors or glass table tops especially, you may be able to give the object to a friend or donate it to a charitable organization. [5] X Research source If you can’t give it away, check with your municipality to see if they accept flat glass for recycling. Whether or not you’ll be able to recycle your specific piece of glass depends on the area where you live. Mirrors, window glass, and other large pieces of flat glass have a different chemical composition than standard bottle glass, so many recycling plants don’t accept them. [6] X Research source If your municipality does accept window glass, etc., then they'll likely have a specific process for it. Contact them and follow any specific instructions. This process will most likely involve taking the glass down to a recycling center, since the trucks that run recycling routes aren't typically equipped for nonstandard items. [7] X Research source"

If it looks like sending your glass to the dump is the only option, then you’ll want to start by contacting your area’s waste management service to see if they will pick it up. [8] X Research source Different companies will handle waste of different sizes. For truly large pieces of glass, your waste management company may not dispose of it in a single piece. You'll likely find information with weight and dimension restrictions on the company's website or by calling."

      "content": "Cover the surface with tape. If the waste management company says your piece of glass is small enough to dispose of whole, you’ll need to take some steps to prepare it. Since multiple waste management personnel will have to handle the glass, you want to help ensure that it doesn't break and become a hazard in the process. Start by covering the surface of the glass with duct tape. [9] X Research source Tape across the glass will help keep the pieces in place and limit splintering in the event that is does break. Tape both the front and back surfaces of the glass. The more of the surface you cover the better, but if you don't want to waste a large amount of tape, then you can simply place a large X across the front and back surfaces. [10] X Research source"

If your piece of glass exceeds the waste management company’s size limits, they may instruct you to break it up first. Place the glass down flat on the ground, and cover the entire pane with an old blanket or several old towels to keep the shards in place. Next, use a hammer or shovel to break the pane into smaller pieces. Finally, follow the steps listed in the previous section to dispose of the broken pieces. When breaking glass, always be sure to wear gloves and goggles or other eye protection."

      "content": "Some types of glass can be recycled, but others cannot. As a general rule of thumb, glass bottles and jars are safe to be recycled. On the other hand, items like window glass, mirror glass, auto glass, standard light bulbs, crystal, pyrex, stemmed drinkware, and ceramics will usually need to be thrown away, instead. [14] X Research source These types of glass are usually treated with chemicals that ultimately make them unrecyclable. If you’re not sure whether the glass waste you have is recyclable, check with your city’s sanitation or waste management department. To recycle glass bottles and jars: Make sure they are completely empty, rinse them out thoroughly, and remove lids. Place the clean jars and bottles in your recycling bin. [15] X Research source"
