      "content": "Choose a sharp, serrated knife with a 12 in (30 cm) blade. While you can use any sharp knife, a serrated slicing knife with points along the edge will work best. The small points help you slice through the brisket. [2] X Research source Aim for a knife that has a 12 inches (30 cm) blade length on average, which allows you to slice more of the brisket at once. [3] X Research source For the short strokes needed to cut your brisket against the grain, you can see-saw a serrated knife across the brisket, working your way from the top to the bottom.

      "content": "Identify the direction of the grain on the brisket. Place the brisket on a cutting board to examine the direction of the grain. The grain is defined by how the strands of muscle run through the meat. It's like a long series of rubber bands, which will appear as lines in the meat. [5] X Research source"

Then, separate the 2 pieces from each other by lifting and slicing between them. [6] X Research source Some people separate the point and the flat as soon as they're done cooking to deal with this problem. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice the flat into thin slices, cutting against the grain.",
      "content": "Slice the flat into thin slices, cutting against the grain. Turn the meat so your knife is perpendicular to the grain. Cutting against the grain helps produce tender bites of meat. Therefore, once you find the grain, set your knife up so that you're slicing against the grain. [8] X Research source Aim for slices that are about a pencil width thick. You can go thinner if the brisket seems tough, but this measurement is a good standard to work with. If it's falling apart, try a slightly thicker cut. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Slice the point straight down the middle. Rotate the point 90 degrees and slice directly down the middle. Follow up by continuing to slice against the grain of the point. You can also reserve this fattier piece of meat to chop or use for burnt ends. [10] X Research source"

Season the burnt ends with any additional flavoring you like and toss them thoroughly. Place the pan in the smoker and cook for 1 hour or until the liquid has completely reduced. Let your burnt ends cool, and then dig in! [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify the different parts of a brisket. A brisket contains two muscles, the point and the flat, which are both separated by a thick, white seam of fat. The fat cap is the large layer of fat primarily located on the point side of the meat. [12] X Research source The point is also called the deckle. This part of the brisket has the most fat on it. It has a marbled look, meaning more fat lines run through it. The flat cut is the part of the brisket that has less fat. As you may have guessed, it is also generally flatter than the point.

Also, check for a vibrant red color. [14] X Research source Look for the point cut when you need a fattier, more flavorful brisket made for shredding. Look for the flat cut for leaner meat that's better for slicing. A whole brisket includes both cuts. [15] X Research source"

Trimming allows more seasoning to get to your meat, but the fat can provide additional flavor. Work in sections across the meat to trim the fat cap off completely. Slip your knife under the fat and slide it back and forth until the section comes off. [16] X Research source To trim off part of the fat, just cut the top part of the fat off from the thicker sections. You may want to leave some fat on if planning to smoke your brisket."

While you don't need to separate them completely, you do want to trim off some of this fat. Start on the outer edge of the fat vein and shave off the fat in small chunks. Take off most of the fat down to where you can see the meat below. You should then be able to lift a chunk of the meat to put seasoning in the middle."

Although you can slice your brisket with other tools, these ones will give you the most efficient process and the best cut brisket: [17] X Research source Sturdy Cutting Board : A large, strong wood cutting board will provide you with enough space to slice the brisket with control and care. Large Serrated Knife : A Long serrated knife is your best choice for slicing the cooked brisket, but you may wish to use a sharp chef’s knife or boning knife, especially when separating the point from the flat or trimming the raw brisket. Work Gloves : Heat-resistant gloves are a safe way to handle a brisket that’s right out of the smoker or oven. [18] X Research source"

Once you’re finished slicing the brisket, simply use a meat cleaver or dough blade to roughly chop a small group of brisket slices into square-shaped chunks. [19] X Research source If you want larger chunks, chop one small section of the meat instead of pre-sliced pieces. Adjust the size accordingly, but the chopped pieces should still be bite-sized. Consider chopping the flavorful point section of the brisket while reserving the flat section for slicing. Chop against the grain for the best pieces of brisket that work great for sauces and sandwiches. [20] X Research source"

When you slice with the grain, you end up with long, stringy pieces that are very difficult to chew. When you slice against the grain with short strokes, you’ll end up with a soft, buttery brisket that melts in the mouth. [21] X Research source"

Smoke the meat for 3 hours, but wrap the meat for the first 2 hours and unwrap the meat for the last hour. Cooking brisket with the 3-2-1 method is an easy way to ensure this dense cut of meat renders down until it’s both tender and juicy. [22] X Research source"

It consists of the pectoral muscle of a cow, so it has a lot of connective tissue. The two parts of the brisket are called the flat and the point. The flat is usually sliced, while the point is fattier, so works best for chopped brisket or burnt ends. Other than this distinction, brisket is brisket. [23] X Research source"
