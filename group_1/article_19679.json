      "title": "Apply a salicylic acid pad or gel.",
      "content": "Apply a salicylic acid pad or gel. Salicylic acid is a nonprescription wart removal option you can find at your local drugstore or pharmacy. It helps to dissolve the protein of the wart and the dead skin around it. Look for wart removal pads, plasters, gels or drops that contain 17 percent salicylic acid solution or patches that contain 15 percent salicylic acid. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You will need to apply these products once a day for several weeks. For optimal results, soak your finger or fingers with the warts in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes. This will soften the skin of the wart. Then, file away at any dead skin on or around the wart with an emery board or a pumice stone. Once you have filed away the dead skin, apply the salicylic acid pad, gel, plaster or patch to the wart. You can then file away at the dead skin that appears on and around the wart between treatments with an emery board or a pumice stone. Do not share the board or pumice stone with anyone else and throw it away once the wart is removed. You may need to apply the salicylic acid for 12 weeks or more until the wart flattens and fades away. If the wart becomes irritated, sore, or red, you should stop using the salicylic acid product and talk to your doctor."

      "title": "Use over-the-counter freezing products.",
      "content": "Use over-the-counter freezing products. You can also use freezing products on the warts to try to remove them. Aerosol wart treatments can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy. These sprays will freeze the warts at a temperature of minus 90°F (minus 57°C). [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind over-the-counter freezing products will not work as well as liquid nitrogen agents applied by your doctor to the warts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises caution when using wart removers, as they are flammable and should not be used around fire or any heat sources."

      "title": "Get a prescription for chemical treatment from your doctor.",
      "content": "Get a prescription for chemical treatment from your doctor. Your doctor can suggest the use of prescription chemical treatments to try to kill off the skin cells of the warts. These treatments usually contain chemicals such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and silver nitrate. The side effects of these chemical treatments include the skin around the wart being stained brown, and burns to the skin surrounding the wart. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Your doctor may also suggest prescription-strength wart medication that contains salicylic acid. This medication will remove layers of the wart over time and is often more effective when used in combination with freezing or cryotherapy."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about cryotherapy.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about cryotherapy. Cryotherapy is a procedure where your doctor applies liquid nitrogen to your wart, which causes a blister to form under and around your wart. The dead tissue can then be removed seven to ten days after the freezing. However, this method can trigger your immune system to fight viral warts and you may need repeat treatments done to remove the wart completely. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Cryotherapy sessions usually take five to 15 minutes and can be painful. If the warts on your hands are large, they may need to be frozen several times before they are fully removed. There are several side effects of cryotherapy, including pain, blistering, and discolored skin around the wart."

      "title": "Consider laser removal of the warts.",
      "content": "Consider laser removal of the warts. Your doctor may suggest that you try pulse-dye laser treatment to burn off tiny blood vessels in the wart. The infected tissue will then die and the wart will fall off. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind the effectiveness of this method is limited. It can also cause pain and scarring around the affected area."

      "title": "Try a duct tape treatment.",
      "content": "Try a duct tape treatment. Studies have been mixed on the effectiveness of duct tape as a removal treatment for warts. Many physicians believe the duct tape treatment to be no better than a placebo and not a very effective way to remove warts. However, there has been some documented success with the use of duct tape on warts. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can try the duct tape method by covering the wart in duct tape or electrical tape for six days. After six days, you can soak the wart in water and then gently remove any dead skin on or around the wart with a pumice stone or an emery board. You will need to then let the wart be exposed to the open air for 12 hours and repeat the process again until the wart is removed."

      "content": "Use raw garlic. This home remedy claims that the caustic effect of garlic can make the warts blister and fall off. Keep in mind this is not a medically verified treatment and may not work as effectively as medical treatments for warts. [12] X Research source Crush one to two cloves of garlic in a mortar and pestle until it forms a paste. Apply the garlic to the warts and cover them with bandages so the garlic can interact with the warts. Re apply fresh garlic to the warts once a day but avoid putting the garlic on any of the healthy skin surrounding the warts. You can smear the healthy skin with petroleum jelly so the garlic does not stick to the skin."

      "title": "Soak the warts in apple cider vinegar.",
      "content": "Soak the warts in apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar will not kill the HPV that is causing the warts but it has a high acidity content that can help the skin on the wart to peel off and fall away. You may experience some soreness and swelling on the warts once you apply the apple cider vinegar, but this should fade after a few days. Keep in mind this is not a medically proven removal method for warts. [13] X Research source Soak one to two cotton balls in two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Squeeze out any excess vinegar from the cotton balls but make sure they are thoroughly soaked. Apply the cotton balls to your warts and secure each cotton ball with gauze or medical tape. Leave the apple cider vinegar on the warts overnight. Repeat this every night with fresh cotton balls for one to two weeks. After several days, the warts may appear darker or black, which is a good sign the apple cider vinegar is working. They will eventually fall off on their own."

      "title": "Apply basil leaves.",
      "content": "Apply basil leaves. Fresh basil contains several anti-viral components and can help to speed up the removal process of the warts. Be aware this is not a medically proven method for wart removal and should be used at your own discretion. [14] X Research source Use clean hands or a mortar and pestle to crush 1/4 cup of fresh basil leaves until they appear mushy and wet. Gently apply the crushed basil to your warts and cover the warts with a clean bandage or a clean cloth. Re apply the basil for one to two weeks until the warts fall off."

[16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should also avoid brushing, clipping or shaving any areas that have warts as this can irritate the warts and spread the virus. Keep your nails and hands clean. Always wash your hands well after touching your warts or any shared surfaces, such as exercise equipment at the gym or the handle on a bus."
