      "title": "Sign up for a Spotify Premium free trial.",
      "content": "Sign up for a Spotify Premium free trial. Spotify offers a 2-month free trial for all new Individual plan subscribers and a 1-month trial for Student plan subscribers ( learn more about the Student discount plan further down). You do have to provide a credit or debit card upon signing up so they can charge you when the trial period ends. But the upside is you can always cancel anytime before the end of the trial and avoid getting charged. You can try signing up for a new free trial when your current one ends, but you'll need to start over with a new email address and a brand-new profile. This can get tiring, especially considering you'll have to rebuild your music library every single time. But if you want to go free, the free trial is a legit way to go! After the free trial ends, the Individual plan costs $11.99 a month (about as much as 2 drinks from Starbucks!)."
