Dreams tell you things your subconscious mind might not pick up on, especially if you tend to avoid your emotions in waking life. Dreaming about kissing a stranger may be a sign to embrace your authentic self, instead of hiding who you are from the world. Be proud of your accomplishments, and feel free to share your unique thoughts and ideas! [1] X Research source If you’re worried about revealing your true personality to people, take it one step at a time. You could start by sharing one of your goals or childhood dreams, or recommend your favorite book, film, or album to someone.

Even if your beliefs are less mainstream, it doesn’t automatically mean that they’re “wrong.” Read books, befriend people of different backgrounds, and be confident in your intelligence and capabilities. Alternatively, dreaming about kissing a stranger could be a warning against short-term relationships."
