    {
      "title": "Make a light outline of a face.",
      "content": "Make a light outline of a face. Heads aren’t actually circular; they’re oval-shaped, like an egg. Sketch an oval outline that tapers down at the bottom where the chin would be. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide the oval in half vertically and horizontally.",
      "content": "Divide the oval in half vertically and horizontally. The easiest way to draw a face is to use dividing lines to map out the proportions of the features. First, draw a line down the center of the oval. Then cut the oval in half again, this time horizontally."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add another horizontal line to illustrate the nose.",
      "content": "Add another horizontal line to illustrate the nose. Divide the lower half of the oval again with another horizontal line. The point where the vertical line meets the lower horizontal line is the base of the nose. Sketch out the tip of the nose and add a nostril on each side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch out the mouth with a third horizontal line.",
      "content": "Sketch out the mouth with a third horizontal line. Divide the bottom of the oval in half again. Put the bottom of the lips on the dividing line you have just drawn. Draw a line for where the lips meet and then draw the top and bottom lips. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add two symmetrical eyes along the top line.",
      "content": "Add two symmetrical eyes along the top line. Draw two circular balls to make out the eyes across the central horizontal line. These are the eye sockets. The top of this circle is where the eyebrows go and the bottom is where the cheekbone sits. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Develop the eyebrows along the top of each eye socket.",
      "content": "Develop the eyebrows along the top of each eye socket. The eyebrows communicate a lot of expression. Craft the eyebrows evenly along the top line of each ball for a more neutral expression, angle the eyebrows inward for a more intense vibe, or raise them up a little to communicate surprise. Use a series of short, thin strokes to add individual hairs if you’re going for a more realistic look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Finish the eyes by adding pupils and eyelids.",
      "content": "Finish the eyes by adding pupils and eyelids. As a rule of thumb, the distance between the two eyes is the width of a third eye. A person’s eyes are almond-shaped, so bear this in mind as you sketch them out. Eyes come in every size and shape, so experiment with the form a bit until you’ve got the right look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Color the irises and develop the pupils.",
      "content": "Color the irises and develop the pupils. Draw the pupil, which is the darkest bit of the eye. Fill most of it in black and leave a little white. With your pencil flat, use a bit of shading for the base. Shade variant from medium to light in each iris. Use tightly-spaced short lines from the edge of the pupil to the white of the eye. Make some of the edges of each pupil lighter to give it a nice effect. Develop the eyebrows above. Then, rub out the guidelines below the eye."

      "content": "Draw the top of the eyelid over the top of each eye. The base of the eyelid comes down over the top of the iris and covers the top of it slightly. If you make the eyelids really big, the woman you’re drawing will look sleepy. Keep them even and thin."

    {
      "title": "Shade under the eyes to communicate depth.",
      "content": "Shade under the eyes to communicate depth. Add a little shading underneath the eye and where the eye meets the nose to define the socket. For a tired look, add shading and swooped lines at a more acute angle to the bottom eyelid."

    {
      "title": "Add an ear on each side of the head.",
      "content": "Add an ear on each side of the head. The base of each ear should be drawn in line with the bottom of the nose and the top of the ear in line with the eyebrows. Remember, the ears are flat against the side of the head. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add the neck coming from the base of the head.",
      "content": "Add the neck coming from the base of the head. Necks are thicker than you probably imagine. Draw two lines coming down from roughly where the bottom horizontal line meets the edges of the face. You can include shoulders if you’d like, or let the neck be the end of the body."

    {
      "title": "Include any details you feel you’re missing.",
      "content": "Include any details you feel you’re missing. You can add a bit of shading under the nose and accentuate the chin, or put expression lines around the mouth and shade in the corners. Outline the ridge of the nose. The more prominent you make these features, the older your face will look. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw clothes if you want a fuller portrait. Throw on a blouse, shirt, or jacket if you want to add a body. This is totally optional, so if you’re only interested in drawing the face, go ahead and skip this."
