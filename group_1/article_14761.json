      "title": "Dress up if you're ever in doubt about what to wear.",
      "content": "Dress up if you're ever in doubt about what to wear. Despite the name, \"business casual\" still involves dressing up for work. In fact, sometimes business casual dress for women can look similar to business formal attire. However, your style can be more relaxed, you typically have more freedom to express your personal style, and more casual shoes are acceptable. [1] X Research source If your workplace has a business casual code, your clothes should fit properly. Although you do not need to wear a tailored suit, you should still avoid baggy or tight clothing. Remember, casual does not mean less professional. Low-top blouses and high-slit skirts are not appropriate for work. Knee-length skirts and dresses are appropriate, as are dress slacks with a dress shirt or blouse."

      "title": "Dress down for a more laid-back office or on casual days.",
      "content": "Dress down for a more laid-back office or on casual days. Many offices now embrace a more relaxed dress code throughout the entire week, while other companies choose to have Casual Fridays or other days when it's acceptable to dress down. If that's the case, remember you still want to look professional. [2] X Research source Check what your coworkers wear before opting for extremely casual pieces like jeans or athletic shoes. If denim is sometimes appropriate, opt for a darker wash, which will look dressier and more professional than light-wash jeans."

      "title": "Wear casual, knee-length dresses and skirts for a feminine look.",
      "content": "Wear casual, knee-length dresses and skirts for a feminine look. To ensure you always look professional, your skirt should at least reach your knees when you're standing, and it should skim over your body rather than hugging it closely. Neutral colors like navy, black, gray, brown, and khaki typically look the most professional. However, in many settings, you may be able to wear bolder colors as well, especially if the rest of your outfit is toned down. If your skirt falls below your knees, it's fine to have a slit just above the knee. However, if the skirt is very long, the slit should come just to your knee, rather than above. Slits in the center-back of a skirt should not extend higher than the back of the knee. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Opt for dress slacks if you'd rather wear pants.",
      "content": "Opt for dress slacks if you'd rather wear pants. Dress slacks are a sensible, comfortable option if you prefer not to wear a skirt to work. Choose creased slacks that drape neatly from the hips through the hem, with a length that falls just at the top of your shoes. If your job requires you to do physical or manual labor, wearing dress pants is the more sensible choice."

    {
      "title": "Wear a dress shirt or blouse with a skirt or slacks.",
      "content": "Wear a dress shirt or blouse with a skirt or slacks. When you're choosing a top, opt for one that fits you comfortably, and stay away from anything that's sheer or tight or that shows your cleavage. A few good options include button-down shirts, blouses, fitted knit sweaters, or a shirt and vest. [4] X Research source Unlike business formal wear, it's fine to wear bright colors in a business casual dress code, if you like them. This can be a great way to inject a little personality into your look! Cotton, silk, and fabric blends are all appropriate for tops. However, it's best to avoid wearing velvet or any shimmery fabric, such as something you might wear to a party. If your job requires you to wear a button-down uniform shirt, wear it neatly pressed and tucked into your slacks or skirt."

    {
      "title": "Wear heels, pumps, or high-quality flats.",
      "content": "Wear heels, pumps, or high-quality flats. Your shoes should be made of leather, fabric, or another dressy-looking material like micro-fiber. Typically, closed-toe shoes are the most conservative, but sandals which aren't too dressy or too casual may sometimes be appropriate. Avoid shoes with thin straps, platforms, and spiky or chunky heels. Shoes should be black, navy, brown, tan, or taupe. White and pastels are typically not business appropriate. Choose shoes that fit comfortably and are easy to walk in. While your shoes shouldn't be flashy, you do have some versatility in what you wear, so choose shoes that you feel express your personality! For instance, if your style is more feminine, you might opt for sleek pumps, but if you're more athletic, you might opt for a nice pair of loafers."

      "content": "Opt for a dressier look if you're not sure to wear. While some industries are becoming more relaxed in their dress codes, it's still better to be overdressed rather than underdressed in a business setting. If you're not sure what the dress code will be, or if you're attending an important meeting, seminar, or other business-related event, wear a button-down shirt, tie, slacks, and dress shoes. In cool weather, you might add a jacket, as well. [5] X Research source If you discover that you're overdressed, you can remove your tie and jacket, and you can even roll your sleeves up to your elbows to feel more at ease in a very informal setting."

      "title": "Wear either a long-sleeved or short-sleeved collared shirt.",
      "content": "Wear either a long-sleeved or short-sleeved collared shirt. When you're choosing what to wear to work, you can never go wrong with a white, light blue, or conservatively-striped collared shirt. Button-downs are the most common choice, but polo shirts are also acceptable in most business casual situations. No matter what style you choose, your shirt should be neatly pressed and tucked in. [6] X Research source Shirts do not have to be tailored but should not be baggy. Though they can be less form-fitting, you must still look professional. Do not wear shirts with logos or words on the front. Some non-professional jobs have a standard uniform that all coworkers are required to wear. While this typically includes just a uniform shirt, your shirt should still be neatly pressed, reasonably sized, and tucked into your pants."

      "title": "Opt for a polo or a button-down without a tie on casual days.",
      "content": "Opt for a polo or a button-down without a tie on casual days. Your office might have certain days when it's okay to dress down, like Casual Fridays. Some offices might even have a more casual dress code year-round. In those cases, you can be professional and casual by sticking with a nice button-down top or polo with a pair of khakis or other slacks. [7] X Research source If jeans are acceptable in your office, opt for a darker wash, which looks dressier than light denim. Wear casual but dressy shoes like loafers unless athletic shoes are commonplace in your office."

      "title": "Wear pressed khaki, gabardine, or cotton pants.",
      "content": "Wear pressed khaki, gabardine, or cotton pants. Dress slacks are not required in business casual, although you can still wear them paired with business casual shirts. However, more casual fabrics like khaki and cotton are more common in a business casual setting. Your pants don't have to be tailored, but they should not be too tight or too baggy. Also, make sure that they aren't too long or short—in most cases, your pants should neatly skim the tops of your shoes. [8] X Research source The fit of your pants can help communicate your personal style. For instance, you might choose a pair of ankle-length, slim-fitting trousers to look more modern, while you might opt for a straight-leg fit if your style is more traditional. Black, brown, navy, and khaki-colored pants are preferable, although you can wear trousers in a bolder color if you wear them with a conservative shirt. Corduroy pants are also acceptable. Although jeans are sometimes acceptable in certain industries, observe your peers and bosses to see if they are truly acceptable in your workplace. If you do wear jeans, choose a dark color over lighter or faded colors."

      "content": "Wear a lighter colored sport coat or a high-quality sweater. In some places, you won't need to wear a jacket every day to work unless it's cold or you just prefer to, while in other companies, a jacket is expected regardless of the weather. If you do need to wear a jacket or sweater to work, you can't go wrong with options like a navy blazer, a tweed sports coat, a solid-colored V-neck sweater, a corduroy jacket, or a cardigan. [9] X Research source The jacket or sweater you choose is one of the best ways to express your personal style! For dress sweaters and cardigans, it's best to select snug sizes. However, when you're wearing a blazer, it's okay if it isn't quite as form-fitting. If you wear a V-neck sweater, it should only be deep enough to expose the collar of your dress shirt. Do not wear a black suit coat or blazer, as this likely will look too formal."

      "title": "Wear dress shoes that are comfortable yet still professional.",
      "content": "Wear dress shoes that are comfortable yet still professional. Make sure your shoes don't pinch your toes or rub against the heel of your foot, as you won't look very professional if you're limping around the office. The most common choices for business casual footwear are either leather boat shoes or loafers, so choose the ones you like the best. [10] X Research source Choose shoes in a conservative color like navy, black, or brown. In some situations, wearing sneakers that are specifically labeled \"business casual\" is also acceptable. These sneakers also tend to be brown or darkly colored. Some non-professional jobs require you to do manual or physical labor, such as stocking items in a back room. In this situation, athletic footwear may be the standard, but remember to observe your coworkers and ask your supervisors before switching to more casual shoes."

      "title": "Wear clothes that fit and that are not revealing.",
      "content": "Wear clothes that fit and that are not revealing. Dressing professionally means avoiding clothes that are provocative and distracting. Ensure that skirts come to your knees and cover your thighs when you sit, and do not wear shirts that are sheer or cut low enough to expose your cleavage. In addition, your clothing should never be too tight or too loose. Also, your undergarments should never show, including the seam lines or the hems of slips. Skirts should only have center-back slits that extend no higher than the back of your knee. These are acceptable because they allow you to walk and climb stairs more easily. However, slits designed to increase the view of your legs are not appropriate."

      "title": "Opt for a skirt suit to look dressy, feminine, and professional.",
      "content": "Opt for a skirt suit to look dressy, feminine, and professional. In a business formal setting, the most common attire for women is a skirt suit, which is a skirt and matching jacket with a blouse underneath. Be sure that the skirt extends to your knee and covers your thigh when you sit. [11] X Research source Longer skirts are also appropriate, but they should not be so narrow that you can't walk comfortably, nor should they be billowing. [12] X Research source Black and dark colors are the most professional-looking choices for business formal wear."

      "content": "Choose a dark-colored pants suit if you'd prefer to wear pants. If you'd rather not wear a skirt or dress, a pants suit can be a comfortable alternative. Choose pants that fit you neatly, paired with a nice blouse and a tailored jacket. [13] X Research source For the most professional look, the jacket should hit at about your hips. Your slacks should fall to the tops of your shoes, and they should not be tight across your hips or thighs when you sit. Wearing a tailored blazer is also acceptable, so long as it matches your bottom wear. Suits should be made of quality fabrics such as wool, wool blends, or heavy-weight synthetics."

      "title": "Wear a tailored blouse or shirt with a skirt or pants suit.",
      "content": "Wear a tailored blouse or shirt with a skirt or pants suit. When you're choosing the top to go with your suit, opt for a high-quality fabric, like cotton, silk, or a blend. Your top might be a shell or sleeved top, but you might also choose a knit sweater or sweater set. [14] X Research source Choose a top that's not sheer, tight, or low cut. The top should be made of quality fabric such as cotton, silk, or blends. Avoid velvet or shimmery fabrics you would wear to a party. While neutral tops are preferable in a business formal setting, the cut of your blouse can help you show off your personality. For instance, you might wear a structured top with a square boatneck if your style is more put-together and chic, or you might wear a flowy blouse under your suit if your style is more feminine and romantic."

      "title": "Select a dress for a simple alternative.",
      "content": "Select a dress for a simple alternative. A conservative dress can be a nice option for the office, especially when the weather is warm. A dress should extend to your knee or mid-calf, but wearing long dresses should typically be avoided, as they can look too formal. Do not wear backless dresses or dresses with spaghetti straps or plunging necklines. Sleeveless, short-sleeved, and long-sleeved dresses are all acceptable. If the weather is cool, wear a coordinating jacket with your dress. Choose solid-colored neutrals, including black, ivory, camel, grey, navy, and brown."

      "content": "Wear hosiery with your skirt or dress in cool weather. In a business formal setting, hose are generally preferred, as bare legs are considered more casual. However, depending on your workplace, it may be acceptable to leave your legs bare during the summer. [15] X Research source If you do wear hose, they should be solid-colored, with no patterns. Sheer hose is the best choice, as it's the most conservative. Dark hosiery that matches your suit and shoes is also appropriate, but avoid hosiery that's opaque."

      "content": "Wear either heels or pumps. In a business formal setting, opt for closed-toe heels and pumps. Do not wear heels that extend beyond 4 inches (10.2 cm), and avoid wearing sandals, chunky heels, flat-soled shoes, stilettos, and platforms. [16] X Research source For the most professional look, choose shoes that are made of leather, fabric, or micro-fiber. In a business formal setting, opt for sensible shoes, and avoid anything too flashy. It is important to be able to walk comfortably in your shoes. Hobbling in uncomfortable shoes looks clumsy and unprofessional."

    {
      "title": "Wear a suit or slacks and a jacket.",
      "content": "Wear a suit or slacks and a jacket. Business formal usually means wearing a suit, tie, dress shirt, and dress shoes. When you're choosing a suit, opt for conservative colors like black, grey, or navy blue. The material you choose should reflect the climate, so opt for heavier fabrics in cold weather and lighter (but still dressy) materials when it's warmer out. [17] X Research source Work attire should be snug without being constrictive. If your clothes are too tight, they'll be uncomfortable to work in, but if they're too loose, they'll look sloppy and unprofessional. Notice how your colleagues dress and use it as your standard. Try to dress at the same level as others in your workplace."

      "content": "Choose pants that fit neatly around your waist and cover your socks. Your pants should sit at your waist, above your hips—they should never sag. In addition, have your dress pants hemmed so they completely cover your socks and touch the tops of your shoes. [18] X Research source Pants cuts typically come in traditional cut, straight leg cut, or slim-fit cut. Traditional cut slacks are more relaxed from the thigh through the leg, straight cut are a little more narrow, but still fall in a straight line, and slim-fit cut pants become more narrow at the ankle. All are appropriate for business wear. Do not wear khaki or corduroy pants, as these materials are considered more casual."

Having a slightly bulkier or less form-fitting jacket is acceptable. [19] X Research source If your sport coat has two buttons, only button the top button. If it has three, only button the middle button. This is not only a function of style—it facilitates movement. [20] X Research source When you sit, unbutton your jacket. If you leave it fastened, the buttons may pop off when you sit. In addition, unbuttoning your jacket will help prevent wrinkles. Some workplaces do not require you to wear a blazer or full suit. If you are uncertain, opt for a two-piece matched suit as this is the safest and most professional-looking choice."

White looks the most formal, but pastel shirts are also acceptable. Wear either a solid colored shirt or one with subtle stripes. Always tuck your shirt into your dress slacks. Avoid loud colors such as bright yellow, orange, and red. If you are uncertain of about the fit of a shirt, ask a tailor what size looks the most professional."

      "content": "Wear a tie that matches your shirt, pants, or both. While you can use your tie to express your personality, be sure that the color you select is conservative. Ties with simple designs or solid colors are the best choice, but you can customize your look slightly by choosing different colors, subtle patterns, and a width you prefer. [21] X Research source Avoid ties that are brightly colored or with overly elaborate designs. This can be distracting and off-putting to some. Do not tie your tie too short—the bottom should stop just above the top of your belt. Don't worry about using fancy or special knots . Knots generally only affect the length and width of your tie. Any knot will do in a business formal setting."

Polish your shoes every few weeks and try to keep them looking shiny. [22] X Research source Find dress shoes that are no more than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) longer than your actual feet. Remember that dress shoes are cut differently and that your normal shoe size may not be the best fit for dress shoes. To help preserve their appearance, store your shoes in their original box when not in use. Always wear dark dress socks with your dress shoes. Never wear athletic white socks with traditional business attire."

A few well-chosen accessories can actually make you look more professional and put-together. Try opting for classic pieces that showcase your style without detracting from your professional appearance. [23] X Research source Examples of classic pieces might include a nice pair of cufflinks, a pendant necklace, or a pair of pearl earrings. Scarves, hats, and other optional clothing should be conservative and high quality. In most industries, you'll be expected to remove any piercings that aren't in your ears, as well as to cover up any tattoos."

If you have facial hair, be sure that you are well groomed every day. In addition, wearing some make-up can help you look more polished, but wearing too much can make you look unprofessional. [26] X Research source Try a simple look with a little concealer or foundation, blush, a neutral, matte eyeshadow, mascara, and a little lipstick. If you have really long hair, be sure to put it in a bun or ponytail so that it does not look messy. Avoid dyeing your hair extreme colors or styling it in overly elaborate ways as this will look distracting and unprofessional.
