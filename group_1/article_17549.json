      "title": "Place a finger under the loose string to put tension on it.",
      "content": "Place a finger under the loose string to put tension on it. Lift it slightly at the neck of the violin to separate it from the other 3 strings and take up the slack. To keep the soundpost and the bridge aligned, only adjust one string and peg at a time. [1] X Research source Hold the violin vertically in your lap when you do this."

      "title": "Loosen the problematic peg with your other hand.",
      "content": "Loosen the problematic peg with your other hand. To loosen a peg, turn it away from the scroll. To tighten a string, turn the peg toward the scroll. Turn the A and E strings counterclockwise or the D and G strings clockwise to loosen them."

    {
      "title": "Angle the loose string toward the head of the peg.",
      "content": "Angle the loose string toward the head of the peg. Gently pull the string with your finger toward the side of the violin where the loose peg is sticking out. Pull until the string is slightly taut, but not so hard that you risk unraveling the string from the peg or breaking it. [2] X Research source If you’re fixing the A or E string, pull to the right of the violin neck. Pull to the left for the G or D string."

      "title": "Wind the peg so the string coils towards the wall of the pegbox.",
      "content": "Wind the peg so the string coils towards the wall of the pegbox. Turn the peg towards the scroll to increase tension on the loose string. Maintain your outward tug on the string while you turn the peg so the coils move closer and closer to the wall of the pegbox (near the peg head). [3] X Research source Wind until the string can stay taut without you having to support it with your finger anymore. When the string is coiled against the wall of the pegbox, it provides the tension needed to hold the peg in place and prevent it from slipping. Push inward while you turn the peg to help it grip the edges of the pegbox holes. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tune the string",
      "content": "Tune the string and check the peg’s stability. Put the violin on your shoulder and bow the string you just rewound while you turn the peg towards the scroll. Gradually tighten the string to raise the pitch until the string is in tune (turn the peg away from the scroll to loosen it, and turn it toward the scroll to tighten it). Check the pitch with an electronic tuner . If the tension in the peg is restored, the pitch will hold constant while you play. The standard pitch for each string is: [5] X Research source G string (G3): 196 Hz D string (D4): 293.66 Hz A string (A4): 440 Hz E string (E5): 659.26 Hz"

Turn the peg counterclockwise (away from the scroll) to loosen the A and E strings, or clockwise (away from the scroll) to loosen the G and D strings. Slide the string out of the hole in the peg, then slide the peg out of the pegbox. [6] X Research source Check the peg for damage once it’s out—if it’s cracked or warped, you’ll need a replacement. Wipe the peg clean with a dry cloth to remove any grease or buildup that might be causing it to slip. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub peg compound on the parts of the peg that contact the pegbox.",
      "content": "Rub peg compound on the parts of the peg that contact the pegbox. Look at the peg—there should be 2 shiny rings that indicate where the peg rubs against the wood of the pegbox. Rub a small amount of compound on these rings, making sure to lightly cover the peg all the way around. [8] X Research source Peg compound often looks like a tube of chapstick. Remove the cap and twist the bottom of the tube to apply it. Some players use pencil lead, peg dope, wax, chalk, or rosin in place of compound for a quick fix, but these can be too abrasive and damage your peg or pegbox. [9] X Research source If there are no shiny rings around the peg, that means it is not a good fit for the peg hole and should be replaced."

      "content": "Reinsert the peg into the pegbox and turn it to distribute the compound. Spin the peg in either direction a few times to make sure it turns smoothly and to evenly coat the compound around the peg. Wipe away any excess compound before restringing the peg. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Restring",
      "content": "Restring and tighten the peg. Thread the end of the string through the small hole in the shaft of the peg. Continue winding the string towards the peg head so that it wraps up primarily against the wall of the peg box. This will help maintain tension on the peg. Wind until the string is taut and close to its final tension, and then push the peg gently inward as you turn the pegs in the hole. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Tune the string",

Gradually tighten the string by turning the peg clockwise (A and E string) or counterclockwise (G and D string) until the string resonates at the proper pitch. Use an electric tuner to check the pitch. If the peg is secure, the pitch on the string will remain largely constant throughout the day. The standard pitch for each string is: [12] X Research source G string (G3): 196 Hz D string (D4): 293.66 Hz A string (A4): 440 Hz E string (E5): 659.26 Hz"

      "content": "Apply peg drops in place of compound for a quick fix. To apply, unwind the loose peg and remove the string. Take the peg out of the pegbox and add a drop or two to the spots where the peg contacts the pegbox. [13] X Research source Reinsert the peg and turn it a few times to evenly distribute the drops. Wipe away any extra liquid on the peg, and be careful not to let the drops get on the varnish of your instrument."

      "title": "Push the peg gently inwards while you turn it.",
      "content": "Push the peg gently inwards while you turn it. Since pegs are slightly conical, the solution might be as simple as pushing the peg deeper into the pegbox. If you notice a peg slipping, grip it securely and push inward into the scroll while you turn it. [14] X Research source If needed, rest the head of the violin on a soft surface so you can apply more pressure to the peg while you turn it. [15] X Research source Pushing inwards is a short-term solution to constantly slipping pegs. If the problem continues, apply compound or rewind the string. Be careful not to push too hard."

      "title": "Wipe your pegs clean with a dry cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe your pegs clean with a dry cloth. Excess grease or oil on the pegs will make them lose their friction. Simply remove the peg and wipe it down with a clean, dry cloth to degrease it. If you’ve previously applied products like peg compound, use a small amount of soapy water. [16] X Research source If you use soapy water, wait for the peg to completely dry before you insert it back into the pegbox."

      "content": "Store your violin in a room with 30% to 50% humidity. When temperature and humidity increase, violin pegs swell and can get stuck. In cold, dry conditions, they’ll shrink and become loose. Store your violin indoors in a climate controlled environment to keep the pegs a consistent size. [17] X Research source If needed, purchase a violin case humidifier to maintain the right conditions inside your case. In a pinch, place a damp sponge in a plastic container inside your case to raise humidity."

      "title": "Add graphite to the bridge and nut to improve string tension.",
      "content": "Add graphite to the bridge and nut to improve string tension. If the string isn’t slipping correctly over the nut and the bridge, it might lose tension even though the peg is secure and working correctly. To fix it, just grab a pencil and “draw” over the string grooves on the bridge and the nut. [18] X Research source Graphite acts like a dry lubricant and will equalize the tension at all parts of the string. Graphite also helps pegs that are too tight. Remove the peg from the pegbox and apply graphite to the shiny bands where the peg rubs against the pegbox. Applying graphite is optional."
