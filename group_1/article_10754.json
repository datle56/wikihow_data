If your number of data points is too large to warrant this, you can also settle on a lower fraction (for example, the first eighth of the data). Select all odd- or even-numbered data . For example, in a set of 10 data points, you would either pick numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, or 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Select a number of random data points . This method works best for large sets of data where picking half of the information is too ambitious."
