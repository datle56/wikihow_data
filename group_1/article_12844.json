      "content": "Consider your sex and age. Research indicates that women are six times more likely to have piriformis syndrome than men. [2] X Research source Piriformis syndrome occurs most commonly in people between ages 30 and 50. The higher rate of diagnosis among women may be explained by the difference in biomechanics in men's and women's pelvises. Women may also develop piriformis syndrome during pregnancy. Because the pelvis widens during pregnancy, it can cause the attached muscles to contract. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Pregnant women also often develop a pelvic tilt to accommodate the baby's weight, which can also lead the attached muscles to become tight."

      "title": "Consider your activities.",
      "content": "Consider your activities. The majority of cases of piriformis syndrome are caused by what doctors call “macrotraumas” or “microtraumas.” [5] X Research source A macrotrauma is caused by a significant traumatic event, such as a fall or a car accident. Macro-trauma to the buttocks, which leads to inflammation of the soft tissue, muscle spasms, and nerve compression, is a common cause of piriformis syndrome. A microtrauma is a pattern of repeated minor injury to an area. For example, long-distance runners expose their legs to constant micro-trauma, which can eventually cause nerve inflammation and muscle spasm. Running, walking, climbing stairs, or even sitting for long periods of time can cause your piriformis muscle to compress and entrap the sciatic nerve, causing pain. Another form of microtrauma that may cause piriformis syndrome is “wallet neuritis.” This condition can occur when a person carries a wallet (or cellphone) in his back pocket, which can press against the sciatic nerve, causing irritation."

      "content": "Monitor the source, type, and intensity of pain. One of the more common symptoms of piriformis syndrome is pain felt in the buttocks, where the piriformis is located. If you consistently feel sharp pain in one of your buttocks, you may have piriformis syndrome. Other pain to look out for that could indicate this condition includes: [6] X Research source Pain radiating down the back of your thigh, and sometimes into the back of the calf and into the foot.

      "title": "Evaluate your gait.",
      "content": "Evaluate your gait. The compression of your sciatic nerve caused by piriformis syndrome can cause difficulty walking. Your leg may feel weakened as well. The two main things to look for when experiencing difficulty walking include: [11] X Research source Antalgic gait, which means a gait that develops to avoid pain. This usually leads to limping or shortening your gait to keep from feeling pain. Foot drop, which is when your forefoot drops without your control because of pain in your lower leg. You may not be able to pull the foot up towards your face."

      "title": "Consider seeing a specialist.",
      "content": "Consider seeing a specialist. Piriformis syndrome is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are generally the same as the more common lumbar radiculopathy (numbness in the leg caused by low back pain). Both conditions are caused by the compression of the sciatic nerve. The only difference is where the sciatic nerve is being compressed. Piriformis syndrome is far more rare than low back pain, and most primary care physicians are not given much training in this syndrome. Instead, consider seeing an orthopedist, a specialist in physical medicine, or an osteopathic physician. You may need to see your primary care physician first to ask for a referral to a specialist."

      "content": "Have your doctor conduct diagnostic tests. To determine if you have piriformis syndrome, your doctor will begin by evaluating your range of motion by asking you to perform several exercises including straight leg raises and leg rotations. There are a number of other tests that can indicate the presence of piriformis syndrome, including: [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The Lasègue sign : Your doctor will ask you to lie on your back, flex your hip at a 90 degree angle, and extend your knee straight out. A positive Lasègue sign means that pressure on the piriformis muscle while you are in this position causes you pain. The Freiberg Sign : In this test, your doctor will internally rotate and lift your leg while you lie flat on your back. Pain in your buttocks when doing this movement may indicate piriformis syndrome. The Pace Sign : In this test, you will lie on the unaffected side. Your doctor will flex your hip and knee, then rotate your hip while press down on your knee. If you feel pain, you may have piriformis syndrome. Your doctor may also “palpate” (examine with the fingers) your greater sciatic notch, a notch in one of your pelvic bones through which the piriformis muscle passes."

[16] X Research source Your doctor can also palpate your gluteus (the largest muscle in your buttocks) to determine the condition of the piriformis muscle. When the muscle is very tight and contracted, it can feel like a sausage. Your doctor will also check the amount of pain you experience from pressure on your gluteus muscle. If you experience pain or tenderness deep in the buttocks or hip region, this is a sign that your piriformis muscle is contracted. Your doctor will likely check for gluteal atrophy (shrinkage of the muscle). In chronic cases of piriformis syndrome, the muscle begins to wither and shrink. This can be seen in visual asymmetry, where the affected buttock is smaller than the unaffected buttock."

      "content": "Request a CT scan or an MRI. While doctors can check for signs by performing physical tests, there are currently no diagnostic tests that can fully diagnose piriformis syndrome. Because of this, your doctor may order a computed tomography scan (CAT scan or CT scan) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine whether something else is compressing your sciatic nerve. [17] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source A CT scan uses computer processes with x-rays to create 3D views of the inside of your body. This is achieved by taking cross-section views of your spine. A CT scan may help identify whether there are abnormalities near the piriformis muscle and can track any arthritic changes.

This method is often used when a doctor is trying to figure out whether you have piriformis syndrome or a herniated disc. If you have piriformis syndrome, the muscles around your piriformis will react normally to electromyography. On the other hand, your piriformis muscle and gluteus maximus will react abnormally to the electricity. If you have a herniated disc, all of the muscles in the area may react abnormally. Electromyography tests have two components: [19] X Research source A nerve conduction study will use electrodes taped to your skin to evaluate your motor neurons. A needle electrode exam will use a small needle inserted into your muscles to evaluate your muscles’ electrical activity."

These knots are usually present in the piriformis or gluteal muscles. Pressure on these knots can produce local and referred pain.

This is one reason why a lot of medical tests may come back negative, and may be the reason why doctors may under diagnose this condition.
