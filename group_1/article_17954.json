      "content": "Make a stack of cash with the largest bills on bottom and singles on top. This organization makes it convenient to pull small bills out from the center of your clip for everyday purchases. Most clips fit about a dozen bills. Aim to carry a variety of denominations. Singles often come in handy, and having several big bills means you can carry more money with less space. If you’re concerned about security and don’t want your big bills showing, put a few singles on the bottom of your stack."

      "content": "Include your ID and/or driver’s license plus your main credit card. Most clips can fit up to 3 cards in addition to cash, so be picky when you decide which ones to carry for the day. Unlike a traditional wallet, you won’t be able to fit every card you have. Think through the itinerary for your day and select the cards you know you’ll need. Some money clips have extra pockets or elastic bands for cards. In these cases, fit as many cards as you can or want to."

      "title": "Insert your cards into the folded cash to keep them secure.",
      "content": "Insert your cards into the folded cash to keep them secure. Combined, the folded cash and cards fill the clip snugly so nothing falls out. If you don’t have enough cash to fill the clip, fold your bills in half a second time and place your cards on the outside of the stack. If you prefer, place your cards on top or on bottom of your folded cash instead of inside. They'll be equally as secure this way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert your money and cards folded-end first into the clip.",
      "content": "Insert your money and cards folded-end first into the clip. Keeping the loose ends outside the clip makes it easier to see and pull out the bills you need quickly. Make sure the clip is secure and give the whole thing a shake to see if your stack will stay put. Your money should fit snugly into the clip without stretching it too far open. If your stack doesn’t fit, remove unnecessary bills or cards until you can slide it in."

      "title": "Keep your clip in a front or back pant pocket or inside of a blazer.",
      "content": "Keep your clip in a front or back pant pocket or inside of a blazer. Money clips are slimmer than wallets, so they’re more comfortable to sit on if you prefer a back pocket. Choose a front pocket if you’re concerned about pickpocketing—front pockets are deeper, and the clip’s thin size makes it less bulky or awkward to put in front. [1] X Research source Ultimately, the pocket you choose is entirely up to your preference. Some clips are designed to attach to the outside of your pockets or backpack straps for quick access."

    {
      "title": "Slide the individual bills or cards you need out of the clip.",
      "content": "Slide the individual bills or cards you need out of the clip. Since the stack was organized by denomination, your large bills will be towards the outsides and your small bills will be in the center. Thumb through the corners or edges of the bills and pull out what you need. Pinch the clip lightly to keep the stack in place while you slide out a bill so that your entire stack doesn’t spill out on accident. Practice using your money clip to get the feel for pulling cash quickly and easily. Alternatively, pull the entire stack out of the clip and remove the bills or cards you need, then reinsert the stack into the clip when you’re done."

      "title": "Some products, like Ridge wallets, have money clips on the outside.",
      "content": "Some products, like Ridge wallets, have money clips on the outside. For these money clip wallets , organize your cash like you would for a normal clip (largest bills on bottom, singles on top) and fold them in half twice so they don’t extend past the dimensions of the wallet. [2] X Research source These clips usually only hold a few bills, but the wallet portion has room for multiple cards."

      "title": "If your metal clip has become too loose, tighten it with hammer strokes.",
      "content": "If your metal clip has become too loose, tighten it with hammer strokes. Place the bent end of the clip on a scrap piece of leather on top of a steel block meant for jewelry work (or something similar). Squeeze the other end of the clip together so the metal is touching, then lightly tap the bend with the butt of the hammer handle. [3] X Research source Tap the bend in the center rather than near the edges. Check the grip of the clip after every few taps until it’s tight enough for your usual money stacks."
