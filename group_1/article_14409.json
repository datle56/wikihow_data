      "content": "Draw 3 overlapping circles to create an outline of the cat’s body. Sketch a small circle for the head and a larger circle slightly below it for the chest. Extend a line down at the right side of the second circle to create the cat’s front legs. Then, draw an even larger circle below and to the left of the second to make the cat’s body. Add two crossed lines in the center of the head to serve as grid lines. Finally, sketch a small curved line to connect the left side of the head to the body. [1] X Research source If you want to make your drawing larger, use the grid method . Print out an image of the cat and use a ruler and marker to create a grid on the paper. Then, take a larger, blank piece of paper and draw the same grid on it. Draw the lines and shapes that you see inside the squares of the reference image in the corresponding squares on your paper."
