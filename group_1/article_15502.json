      "title": "Properly grip the Oreo.",
      "content": "Properly grip the Oreo. Grasp each half of the Oreo cookie softly but firmly with the fingertips of both of your hands. Being smooth and stable is the key here. Don't grasp the Oreo too tight, and definitely don't wiggle the cookie back and forth. Grasping too tight or wiggling may lead to the filling failing to separate cleanly. Make sure that both the Oreo and your hands aren't too warm. Warm hands will warm the Oreo and soften its filling, making it more gooey and sticky. A warm Oreo is harder to separate. Don't grip the Oreo for too long. The longer you hold the Oreo without starting the next step, the more likely it is to start to warm up."
