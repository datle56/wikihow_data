Tap your name at the top to open your Apple ID details. Tap iCloud . Look for \"Messages\" in the list of backed-up items.

This sounds extreme, but as long as you back your data to iCloud, all of your data (including the text messages you had in your inbox at the time of the backup) will be placed back onto your iPhone automatically. Apps that claim to restore deleted texts can only pull them from backups. If you would rather not restore your entire iPhone to recover your texts, you can pay for an app like Phone Rescue ($49.99) or Enigma Recovery ($59.99) that allows you to restore messages only."
