If the person you're looking for has been released on parole, his listing in the inmate database would give you a clues to where he had been released. Inmate locators typically are designed to enable you to learn where a particular inmate is housed while he is incarcerated, and as such, information about someone out on parole may be limited.

The officer will have more information about the whereabouts of the person you're trying to find."
