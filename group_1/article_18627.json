      "content": "Max out your Friendship with Piccolo, as well as Gohan and Videl. Find Piccolo outside the Time Nest’s entrance (unless he’s your mentor; in that case, you’ll find fim near Orange Star High School and the Elder Kai instead). Gohan and Videl, who have a joint Friendship level, can be found in either the Orange Star High School area or the Resort area, depending on how far you’ve gotten in the game. [1] X Research source If you still need to get the maximum level of friendship with either trainer, you can get there by recruiting them as instructors, training with them, talking to them to get special dialogues, and bringing them along on parallel quests (PQs)."

      "title": "Talk to Piccolo and say, “I want to receive further training.”",
      "content": "Talk to Piccolo and say, “I want to receive further training.” Once your friendship level is maxed with both trainers, you’ll automatically get a notification about Piccolo. Go see him and initiate a dialogue; when you see the option to ask for further training, select it. Then, say, “Let’s spar.” From there, you’ll unlock a new side quest that’ll let you unlock Beast in the game. [2] X Research source The notification you’ll get about Beast form reads: “Fresh from another fight, Piccolo has returned to Conton City with a newfound power. If you train with him, you may awaken a new power too! Go see him to begin your training!”"

      "content": "Do Piccolo’s special side quest to get the Beast transformation. The mission culminates in a boss fight against Cell Max, an empowered version of the villain Cell (from the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie and Dragon Ball Super manga). Fight and defeat Cell Max; when you do, you’ll unlock Beast form and will be able to add it to your character! [3] X Research source To give your character Beast form, just select “Beast” in their Awoken Skill slot."

      "title": "Beast form is an Awoken Skill granting players a surge of power.",
      "content": "Beast form is an Awoken Skill granting players a surge of power. Its in-game description reads: “Unleash the beast within and gain a massive power boost! While transformed, your attacks and Ki recovery are boosted!” Offering numerous buffs to your Light and Heavy attacks when activated, Beast is a powerful Awoken Skill to have in your arsenal (even if it debuffs your defenses). [4] X Research source Keep in mind that Beast is different from Gohan (Beast), a Gohan appearance unlocked by purchasing the Hero of Justice DLC for Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. You can unlock Beast form for yourself without buying the DLC (or get the DLC if you like having the extra content it adds)."

      "title": "Beast form offers an appearance change and augments several attacks.",
      "content": "Beast form offers an appearance change and augments several attacks. Firstly, it adds a new combo string: H, L, H, H, H, H, H . You can use this combo string through any shortcut to the inputs that come before it, like L, L, H for Dashing. The combo string also adds teleports to both your Light Attack and charged Heavy Attack—but Super Attacks that can be charged won’t teleport. [5] X Research source Beast consumes 500 Ki when activated. It’ll also change your character’s appearance, giving them red eyes, a new aura, and a new stance. Even though Gohan (Beast) is already transformed into Beast form, the effect is just cosmetic. He doesn’t actually have any perks (or weaknesses) from Beast."

      "title": "Use Super Souls to recover quickly from Guard Breaks.",
      "content": "Use Super Souls to recover quickly from Guard Breaks. Beast form has a long channel time, meaning you’ll be vulnerable to charged Heavy Attacks and Reverse Burst Dashes. So, one solution is to use Super Souls that’ll help you recover from Guard Breaks (or just get a heavy break on your opponent). You can also use Super Souls with a DEF Up! Limit Burst to transform without taking as much damage. [6] X Research source For example, you can use Super Souls like \"You need to be more careful.\", \"I like you better when you are mad!\" or \"I'll surpass you as I am, with my OWN power!\" alongside Beast. Try using \"Shenron really went the extra mile” to reduce the damage you take. Alternatively, use Super Souls like \"As quiet as the sky...and as fast as lightning.\", \"I got my claws in you, and fangs too!\", \"I think I'm finally warmed up now!\" and \"Nothing beats flying!\" to buff your movement speed."

      "content": "Make a follow-up attack while using the Beast combo. When you’re in the middle of performing the special Beast combo (or you’ve just finished doing it), you can perform a follow-up attack as well. For example, if an opponent has low stamina, try doing a light stamina break once that opponent is stunned, and before the last knockbacks occur! [7] X Research source You can also do a Super or Ultimate Attack, like Darkness Rush (Melee), Demon Flurry, Demon Ray, Justice Combination, Sledgehammer, or Time Skip/Molotov."
