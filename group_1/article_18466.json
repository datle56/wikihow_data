      "content": "To play Hide and Seek , take turns hiding while one person (who is “it”) counts down—from 30 seconds, 20, or even 10, whatever you’d prefer. After that, have the person who counted search for everyone hiding; the last person to be found wins. Alternatively, if you’re looking to shake things up, try these variants: [1] X Research source Sardines . Change the rules so only one person hides while everyone else counts down. When someone finds the hidden player, they must hide with them until there’s only one “finder” left. In the dark. After the person who is “it” finishes counting down, they must use a flashlight to find the other players (and play the game in a totally dark area)."

Then, take turns drawing pieces of paper blindly and acting out the prompts on them while everyone else tries to guess what the mystery phrase is! Alternatively, you could assign each player a category (movies, songs, sports, animals) and have them act out words in that category. [2] X Research source Want to change up the game since you’re at a sleepover? Turn out the lights and use a flashlight to give every actor a “spotlight” when they act out their prompt."

You could take a quiz on any topic from world history to pop culture—and if you and your friends share some common interests, you could even come up with your own trivia questions and take turns quizzing each other. No matter how you decide to play a trivia game, the person who answers the most questions correctly wins! To make the trivia more challenging, set a time limit (5 to 10 seconds, for example) for each question. Add some fun stakes to the game by giving the winner a prize. You could make a trophy at home or get something small—like a gift card or dollar store toy."

When it’s your turn, ask someone in the group: “Truth or dare?” If they say “truth,” ask them a question that they must answer truthfully, and if they say “dare,” dare them to do something risky or fun. Then, when someone else asks you “Truth or dare,” choose one of the options and do the prompt they give you! Truth examples: Are you crushing on someone right now? What’s the most embarrassing thing that’s happened to you? When was the last time you cried? Do you believe in aliens? Dare examples: Try to juggle 3 things that the group chooses. Make up a song about your favorite movie. Eat a spoonful of mustard. Impersonate everyone else in the room."

Let everyone in the group write a few down so there are questions from all of you on the paper. Then, take turns reading and answering each question, and see how you all answer the different prompts! Example questions include: Would you rather carry a flip phone or use a desktop computer? Would you rather only use Netflix or only use Hulu? Would you rather be an only child or have ten siblings? Would you rather eat spicy wings or bite into ice cream? Would you rather be allergic to chocolate or allergic to bread? Would you rather have a mansion or a private jet?"

Anybody else in the circle who has done whatever they’re describing must put down a finger. Then, the next person in the circle must come up with their own phrase—and the game goes on. Once all your fingers are down, you’re out. The last person with fingers still up wins! Example “Never have I ever” phrases include: Never have I ever lived alone. Never have I ever broken a bone. Never have I ever sleepwalked. Never have I ever met a celebrity. Never have I ever broken the law. Never have I ever seen a ghost. Never have I ever been told I snore loudly."

Have everyone sit in a circle with a bottle in the middle (on its side). Take turns spinning the bottle—and whichever player it points to when it stops spinning can either answer a question of their choice or do something silly (like dancing or telling a quick story). If everyone in the group enjoys painting their nails, try playing Spin the Nail Polish! Set up several nail polish bottles on the floor around the spinner, and let the spinner determine which color you paint your nails."

You could step from a couch to a coffee table or chair or toss couch cushions to try and make a safe path across the room. Be creative—but be sure to step carefully and ask permission before walking on the furniture. To create a challenge, try setting a timer.

You decide how long each player has to move their candies. You might set a one-minute time limit, 30 seconds, or another amount. This is true for sleepovers, too."
