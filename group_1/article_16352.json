      "content": "Place dirt blocks in the area where you want mushrooms to grow. Mushrooms can spread to dirt blocks as long as there are no more than 4 of the same type of mushroom in a 9x9 square area. Decide how many mushrooms you want to farm and create a dirt area that is the appropriate size for your needs. [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can plant mushrooms on mycelium or podzol blocks and they can grow at any light level. Mycelium can be found on mushroom islands, and podzol can be found in old-growth taiga forests."

      "content": "Place torches sparsely around the growing area. Mushrooms only grow in areas where the light level is less than 12. Regular torches have a light level of 14, which drops by one light level every square. This means you need to make sure the torches are at least 2 squares away from the growing area. The light level should be dim, but bright enough to keep hostile mobs from spawning (they spawn at light levels 7 and below). [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can use soul torches, which have a light level of 10. Soul torches can be crafted from a stick, charcoal, and soul soil, which can be found in the Nether."

Once an area reaches its maximum number of mushrooms, hit them with your hand and then walk over them to collect them. Leave at least one mushroom per 9x9 area so they will continue to spread."

The light level should be below 12 so that mushrooms can be planted. If you are building an area inside of a cave, you need to make sure the ceiling is high enough for a large mushroom to grow. Large red mushrooms need an area that is 7x7 blocks wide and 6 blocks tall. Large brown mushrooms require an area that is 9x9 blocks wide and 8 blocks tall. Alternatively, you can plant mushrooms on mycelium or podzol blocks and they can grow at any light level.
