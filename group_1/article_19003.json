      "content": "Be on the lookout for free trials. Amazon Kindle's website and social media accounts announce when there's a new free trial out for grabs. You might be able to snag one of these free trials, which may net you months of using Kindle Unlimited for free! Some people claim [1] X Research source that if they have the free trial and cancel it immediately (you will have access to the free trial until the promo ends, not when you cancel it), they are given the chance to keep the subscription for much cheaper than the full price. Others claim that they see more free trial offers (like on Instagram) and are able to claim those, so they get a lot of free months of Kindle Unlimited. Some online posts say the 3-month free trial usually activates around Prime Week, so that's something to keep an eye on."

Your 4-month Kindle Unlimited membership will begin once your order has been successfully placed. If you want to start reading before you receive your Kindle, you can read with the free Kindle app for Android and iOS. For existing monthly or free trial Kindle Unlimited subscribers who redeem this offer, renewals will be temporarily suspended for the duration of the 4 months and will restart at its conclusion, unless you disable renewal during those 4 months. For existing Kindle Unlimited subscribers who are on prepaid plan(s), the 3-month plan will start when your current prepaid plan(s) end, and renewals will restart at its conclusion unless you disable renewal during those 4 months. https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17285110011"

      "title": "Here are some alternatives that are cheaper for you to try:",
      "content": "Here are some alternatives that are cheaper for you to try: Libby - Libby offers free access to ebooks, digital audiobooks, and magazines. You just need a library card and are good to go! Download the Libby app for your iPhone, iPad, Android, Amazon Fire tablet, Windows PC, Mac, or Chromebook, then sign in with your library card. Search for the book you want to borrow, and it will appear in your \"Shelf\" so you can read it! Note that you can read a Kindle book on your Kindle, computer, tablet, or phone. Read more about getting Libby on Kindle in this wikiHow article . Prime Reading â€”This is free if you're already an Amazon Prime member, and you can access it the same way you would access Kindle Unlimited: through the Kindle app or web browser. Prime Reading has a very limited selection compared to Kindle Unlimited, but it might be worth it if you aren't an avid reader. Google Play Books - While there's no monthly subscription for renting books, a lot of books also aren't available to rent. Instead, search for your book and see if there's a rental rate. This is the better option for KU if you don't want to pay a monthly subscription, but just need to borrow a specific book. Check your library in the Google Books app to see how long you have left in the rental. Kobo Plus - Like Kindle Unlimited, Kobo Plus is a reading subscription that offers access to both ebooks and audiobooks. Depending on your preferences, you can sign up for a plan that offers just ebooks, just audiobooks, or both! The first 30 days are free for new subscribers, so you can test it out before you commit to spending money. Everand - This subscription offers access to unlimited ebooks, audiobooks, newspapers, magazines, podcasts, and even sheet music. Like many of the other options listed here, Everand offers a free 30-day trial. Project Gutenberg - Go to Project Gutenberg's site to download free ebooks. You can choose between downloading a Kindle or epub format of the book, so you can read your ebooks on your Kindle or other devices. A strong Pro for this is that you don't need any additional apps or software to read the books you download! Internet Archive - Go to the Internet Archive's book selection to download or rent books for free. Some books are available to download for free while others are offered for rent. You can read books in your web browser or in the Kindle app, but you can only read rented books in the online book reader."
