      "content": "Do your research on eye drops. There are many different types of eye drops, each one recommended for different circumstances. For example, if you have red eyes and wear contact lenses, a blood vessel constricting drop may not work. It wouldn't be able to get through the lens to treat your redness. [1] X Research source Most eye drops work by constricting the blood vessels in the eyes. By making the blood vessels smaller, they reduce eye redness. Be careful of using these too much because your eyes may get dependent on them. Eventually if you don't use them, you'll get rebound redness which makes your eyes red just because it is craving the constricting agents. Preservative free eye drops tend to be the most natural for you eyes. They come in single vial uses which makes them very hygienic."

      "content": "Use ice or freeze-packs. Using ice is another common and effective way to soothe bloodshot eyes. Ice and freeze packs work the same way cold compresses do, by relieving swelling and reducing the amount of blood flow to the eyes. If you don't have a freeze-pack, place some ice cubes in a clean washcloth. Hold it over your eyes for 4 to 5 minutes. When using extremely cold products like ice or a freezer-pack, always protect your eyes with a thin cloth towel. This prevents ice burn."

It can take anywhere from a few days to two weeks.
