Purchase or make your own screens to seal up your windows and prevent any mosquitoes from making their way into your home. If it’s possible, install screen doors as well to block off another potential mosquito entrance point. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you already have window and door screens, inspect them periodically for holes and tears and replace them as needed. Pro tip: Small pests like ants and mosquitoes often get in your home through unnoticed cracks and crevices. Make sure your home is sealed with no openings so the pests will have no way of getting inside. Purchase caulk to do this yourself, or hire a pest control company to do it for you.

Still, it’s always better to be on the safe side when it comes to mosquitoes!"

Then, squeeze a few droplets of peppermint oil onto the surface of the water. Put the bowl out in a room where you’ve noticed a lot of mosquitoes hanging out—with any luck, the essential oil infusion will help keep them away.

      "content": "Kill mosquitoes on-sight with both hands. Spot a pesky critter buzzing around your head? Rather than swatting the insect with one hand, use 2 hands to “clap” the mosquito so it can’t escape. If the bug is resting on a flat surface, like a wall or table, just use one hand to slap the mosquito and kill it instantly. [4] X Research source Swatting a mosquito with just 1 hand actually makes it harder to kill the mosquito, since you end up driving the insect back over your hand. Using 2 hands prevents the mosquito from getting blown away. Don’t want to get your hands dirty? Try using a rolled-up newspaper or a mosquito swatter instead. Whenever possible, try to clap or swat the mosquitoes rather than using a chemical spray indoors."

Some of the best traps to consider are: [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source AGO traps : Set a variety of Autocidal Gravid Ovitrap (AGO) traps around your yard. They resemble appealing breeding spots, and trick female mosquitoes into laying their eggs on a sheet of adhesive paper rather than in a pool of water. Carbon dioxide traps: Traps like the Mosquito Magnet lure the insects in with carbon dioxide before catching and trapping them. Warning: Avoid bug-zapping types of traps.

Head to your local plant nursery and pick up plants like catnip, lavender, citronella, basil, lemon balm, pennyroyal, marigold, rosemary, peppermint, scented geraniums, and lemongrass.

Take a lap around your home and look for any type of standing water—rain barrels, empty wheelbarrows, plant pots, and bird baths are all potential offenders. The more standing water you get rid of, the less appealing your yard will be for female mosquitoes hoping to lay eggs. [24] X Research source Here are a few tips to keep standing water (and mosquitoes) out of your home: Clean out your gutters to prevent blockages. Empty and replace any outdoor pet water bowls regularly. Inspect any junk in your yard that could hold water, like toys or tires. Place a layer of sand beneath any plant pots to keep water from pooling underneath. Warning: Mosquitoes can reproduce in 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of stagnant water.
