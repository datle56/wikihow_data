    {
      "title": "Tell the assistant about your plan.",
      "content": "Tell the assistant about your plan. In this trick, sometimes called Black Magic , you'll point at objects in the room, and the assistant will say whether or not it's the object you are thinking of. They should keep answering \"No,\" then answer \"No\" again when you point to a black-colored object. The next object you point to after that will be the correct one, and they will answer \"Yes.\" Read the rest of the trick below if you don't get how it works yet."

      "title": "Return to the audience alone.",
      "content": "Return to the audience alone. Ask the assistant to wait in a separate room, where they can't hear the audience. Return to your audience and tell them \"I have cast a spell on the assistant, so they can read my mind. I'll prove it to you with this magic trick.\""

      "title": "Ask the audience to pick an object.",
      "content": "Ask the audience to pick an object. Ask an audience member to name any object in the room. Point to it, and say, \"Now my assistant will read my mind and tell you which object you chose.\""

    {
      "title": "Have the audience bring the assistant back.",
      "content": "Have the audience bring the assistant back. Send out at least two or three people in the audience to bring back the assistant. This way, no one will think you are sending someone to cheat and tell the assistant what to pick. If you want, you can make a big show of \"transmitting a psychic message\" by staring at the assistant and holding your fingers against the side of your head."
    },
    {
      "title": "Point to a few wrong objects.",
      "content": "Point to a few wrong objects. Point to something that the audience did not choose, and say \"Am I thinking of ___?\" Repeat this for a few objects. The assistant should say \"No,\" as you agreed on."

      "title": "Point to a black object.",
      "content": "Point to a black object. Point to another wrong object, but one that is colored black. Say \"Is this what I am thinking of?\" The assistant should say \"No\" again, but notice that this is black."

      "title": "Point to the correct object.",
      "content": "Point to the correct object. Point to the item the audience chose, and say \"Am I thinking of __?\" The assistant will now say \"Yes,\" since it is the first thing you pointed to after the black object. Smile and bow to the audience."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat if the audience is excited.",
      "content": "Repeat if the audience is excited. If the audience is trying to guess how it's done, send the assistant out of the room again, pick another object, and repeat. Distract the audience from the real code by pretending to use silly faces, gestures, or different ways of asking the question as a code. Do the trick two or three times, then stop so the audience doesn't guess your secret. You can also talk to your assistant again and come up with a different code for next time. For instance, ask them to say \"Yes\" for the fifth thing you point to."

    {
      "title": "Ask the audience to follow along with you.",
      "content": "Ask the audience to follow along with you. As you do this trick, ask the audience to copy your hand motions. Do each step slowly, and explain to the audience what you're doing. You'll actually be doing one extra step you aren't telling them about. The audience will end up with tangled hands and arms, while you will be showing them two thumbs up."

      "title": "Let go with one hand to point at someone.",
      "content": "Let go with one hand to point at someone. As your audience figures out how to copy you, keep talking to them to distract them from what you're doing. Say, \"not like that, cross your arms like me. Remember, your thumbs are pointing downward and you're holding your hands together. There! Look at her, she's doing it right.\" Keep your arms crossed over each other, but let go of your hands so you can point at the audience member you're talking about. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rotate one arm and clasp your hands again.",
      "content": "Rotate one arm and clasp your hands again. Quickly, while the audience is still looking where you pointed, turn over the hand you pointed with. Flip that hand over completely, so your palms are touching again, then grasp your hands together. This will look similar to the position your audience members are in, but it is much less twisted. If you're trying to practice this and don't understand it, stop and put both hands in front of you with the thumbs facing up . Clasp your hands together, then turn them so the thumbs are pointing down. This is the position you want to end up in after this step. Keep talking and looking at your audience while you do this, not at your hands."

The audience will try to copy you, but because they're in a different position, they'll end up with their hands twisted, their arms still crossed, or other tangled gestures."

      "title": "Pretend to get irritated and repeat.",
      "content": "Pretend to get irritated and repeat. Tell them they must be doing it wrong, and repeat the trick from the beginning. You can usually do this several times, while the audience laughs and wonders why they can't get it right. Use different distraction methods each time, so the audience doesn't get suspicious: Pull your hands apart to hold an audience member's hands, and guide them in the \"right\" position. Clasp your hands together again in the fake position only you know. Wave your hands around while clasped, shout \"Abracadabra\" or other \"magic words,\" then spin around while changing the position of your hand."

      "title": "Use this for one person.",
      "content": "Use this for one person. You can use a single volunteer from a large audience, but only one person will really feel the strange effect this magic trick results in.

      "content": "Ask them to push against your hands. Push inward on both their hands as hard as you can. At the same time, they should be pushing outward with their hands against yours. Do this for about 60 seconds. Optionally, chant \"magic words\" while you do this."

      "title": "Stop pushing.",
      "content": "Stop pushing. After about a minute, ask them to stop pushing. Remove your hands, and ask if they feel anything. They should feel an \"invisible bubble\" pushing their hands outward, even though nothing is touching them."

      "content": "Practice this in advance. This is a difficult trick to pull off, since the audience needs to be looking from exactly the right angle.

      "content": "Stand at an angle away from your audience. This is where a friend will come in handy, since you might have to experiment with this at different angles to find out where the illusion looks most convincing. Usually, the magician stands about 45º away from the audience, so the audience can see the back of your heels and your entire left foot, but cannot see the tip of your right foot. [3] X Research source You can also think of this as standing on a clock face. Your toes are pointed at 10:30 or 11:00, and the audience is standing at 6:00."

Push up on the toe of your right foot only, where the audience can't see your foot. Raise your right heel, and your entire left foot, trying to keep them even with each other.
