Menstruation begins after puberty in people with the required, functioning organs; womb, ovaries, etc. The menstrual cycle is divided into separate phases (follicular, ovulation and luteal) and the first day of your cycle describes the luteal phase that involves your uterus shedding its blood-rich lining through the vagina, known as menstruation or a period. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source Menstrual cycles tend to occur every 21 – 35 days in adults and 21 – 45 days in younger teenagers. The cycle is counted from the first day of your period to the first day of your next period. Menstrual cycle is linked to fluctuations in estrogen levels, luteinizing hormone and follicular stimulating hormone. During the first half your cycle (follicular phase), your body is estrogen-rich and the uterine lining becomes thickened in preparation for implantation of a fertilized egg. Halfway through your cycle, your ovary releases an egg into your fallopian tube. This phase is known as ovulation. Conception can occur if intercourse happens in the couple days preceding ovulation. If it occurs at the time of ovulation, the chance of pregnancy is small, because there is not enough time for the sperm to travel to the egg. If an egg released during the ovulation phase does not get fertilized and implant within the lining of the uterus, your progesterone and estrogen levels will drop, causing the uterus to shed its thickened lining during the luteal phase."

[8] X Research source Once you have tracked your periods and established your cycle length, you can start marking your calendar to determine the first day of your subsequent periods. For example, if your cycle length is 28 days, mark your calendar (starting from the first day of your next period) with an “X” for every 28 days — this will represent the first day of your subsequent periods. If you are taking hormonal birth control pills, you will typically have the 28-day cycle due to the scheduling of the pills. Many packs of pills contains 21 hormonally active pills and seven sugar pills. On the day you run out of hormonally active pills, you typically begin your period. The period lasts the seven days (or less) during which you are eating the sugar pills. You may have no pills to take for seven days, it depends on the type of contraception pill you use. If you are taking extended or continuous use hormonal birth control pills, your periods will happen less frequently. Seasonale contains 84 active pills and seven days of inactive pills.
