      "title": "Drink more water.",
      "content": "Drink more water. It may seem contradictory to try to lose water by consuming water. But staying hydrated is essential to helping your body release fluids (including water) and cleanse your body of any food that may be causing bloating. If your body is dehydrated, it will store water to compensate, leading to more water weight. Ensure you have at least eight glasses of water a day. [1] X Research source Try to sip, rather than chug, water. Sipping water allows your body to digest food properly. Chugging water can actually make your belly swell up."

      "title": "Reduce your salt intake.",
      "content": "Reduce your salt intake. Eating high amounts of sodium can cause your body to store water and lead to bloating. [2] X Research source Your diet should include no more than 2000-2500mg of sodium a day to allow your metabolism to function properly without leading to water retention. [3] X Research source Avoid canned soups and frozen meals as salt is used as a preservative in these foods. Go for fresh meat from the butcher over deli meats, which is full of sodium. Use table salt sparingly in your cooking and use less spices in your food to cut back on sodium. Avoid pre-made salad dressings and sauces, as these are often high in sodium. Cheese is also a high sodium food, so cut back on cheese if possible."

      "title": "Eat more fiber.",
      "content": "Eat more fiber. Consuming fiber rich foods helps to cleanse your urinary tract, kidneys, and your colon, thereby releasing excess fluids. [4] X Research source Have a breakfast high in fiber, like a bowl of whole grain cereal, or add a few tablespoons of flax seed to your breakfast cereal, your yogurt, or your morning smoothie. Flaxseed is high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. They can be ground in a coffee grinder or a food processor to then add to foods. Have steamed or raw vegetables as part of your lunch and dinner. Avoid boiling or roasting your vegetables as this removes a lot of the nutrients and healthy fiber. [5] X Research source Be sure to snack on fruits like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are packed with fiber and other antioxidants."

      "title": "Consume more coffee, tea, or cranberry juice.",
      "content": "Consume more coffee, tea, or cranberry juice. Coffee and tea are known diuretics, which help to release fluids from your body. Always balance your coffee and tea consumption with glasses of water to prevent dehydration. [6] X Research source You can also drink cranberry juice, a natural diuretic that will help to flush toxins and fluids from your body. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Spend time in a sauna or a steam room.",
      "content": "Spend time in a sauna or a steam room. Sweating out water is one of the quickest ways to drop water weight. If you have access to a sauna or a steam room, take a 30 minute soak to sweat out the fluids and toxins in your body. [8] X Research source Spend only 30 minutes at a time in the sauna to avoid dehydration. You will likely gain the water weight back after drinking or eating, but this is a good way to temporary shed water weight for the night."

      "title": "Cut back on your alcohol consumption.",
      "content": "Cut back on your alcohol consumption. Drinking alcohol can lead to dehydration, which will then force your body to store excess water to stay hydrated. Avoid that glass of wine or pint of beer before and after exercise to stay hydrated and skip alcoholic beverages for the night if you want to avoid carrying any water weight. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust your exercise routine for the week.",
      "content": "Adjust your exercise routine for the week. Get your heart pounding to pump fresh blood and oxygen to all your tissues, increasing circulation of body fluid and helping the excretory system get rid of waste. Increase the frequency and intensity of your workout for the week to encourage your body to release water weight through sweat. Exercise also elevates your cortisol levels to a healthy level, which helps you work through stress and tension. High intensity interval training (HIIT) can help you burn fat and sweat out water weight. This type of training is structured around simple, intense exercises, followed by short bursts for recovery or rest.You can perform HIIT exercises with gym equipment, or an exercise mat and a few free weights. There are several popular HIIT programs listed here ."
