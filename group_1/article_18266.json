      "content": "Choose small to medium turnips for freezing. Larger turnips are tougher and can have a stronger flavor that makes them unappealing when you take them out of storage. Look for small or medium-sized turnips and give them a good squeeze to make sure they’re tender. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source Large turnips are better for storing in your fridge unpeeled in an unsealed plastic bag and will last for up to a month. [2] X Research source Smaller turnips are usually younger, making them more tender."

As you rinse them, use your fingers to scrub off dirt and residue that may be stuck on the surface.

      "content": "Peel the skin off of the turnips with a vegetable peeler. Hold 1 turnip in your hand with a firm grip so it doesn’t slip out. Take a vegetable peeler and run it over the surface of the turnips to strip off the peel. Peel all of the turnips so the nice and tender inner flesh is exposed. Discard the peels or keep the collected peels to boil and make a vegetable stock with them!"

Take a kitchen knife or a sharp paring knife and cut them up into cubes about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) in size so they blanch evenly. [4] X Research source"

Once the water is boiling, carefully add the turnips into the pot and set a timer for 2 minutes.

Use a strainer or a spoon to scoop out the blanched turnips and add them into the bowl to stop them from cooking any further.

If they’re cool to the touch and don’t feel warm at all, then they’re done cooking and good to go. Drain the water out of the bowl into a sink. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source You could use a strainer or simply cover the bowl and pour out the water. If the turnips are still warm, just wait another minute or so. It’s really important that they’re fully cooled and don’t cook any further before you store them so they keep their texture, flavor, and color."
