      "content": "Understand Microsoft Paint's limitations. Unfortunately, you can't use Paint to create a transparent image in Windows 10; since icons are usually partially transparent to allow for the desktop to display behind them, this means that your image will both be square and use different colors in the final product than you used to create the icon. In Windows 11, however, Paint can create transparent backgrounds. One solution to the transparency issue is to save your Paint project as an image (rather than as an icon) and then use an online converter to turn the image into an icon. When using Microsoft Paint to create an icon, it's best to stick to black and white as other colors can appear distorted in the final product."
