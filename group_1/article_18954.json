However, if you will be administered anesthesia, the facility may require someone who is able to take you home accompany you to the facility. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Aside from the necessity of getting a ride home, a friend or family member can prove invaluable following your procedure.

If I schedule the procedure for the afternoon, would you be able to join me, and potentially sleep over at my place to make sure there aren't any complications?\""

[4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source While facility staff will likely offer you information on your procedure without prompting, make sure you know whether the procedure was as successful as expected. For more information, ask questions like, “Did the procedure have any immediate effects on my condition?” Don’t be concerned about grogginess or nausea. If you feel hazy, groggy, or nauseous after your procedure, don’t worry. This is entirely normal, and it’s partly why many facilities require another adult to accompany you and ensure you get home safe.
