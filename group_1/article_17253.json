      "content": "Catch Relicanth. Wild Relicanth can be found underwater around Sootopolis City. All you need to do is dive underwater and look in the patches of seaweed. Finding Relicanth might take a while because Clamperl mostly appear, but after a few encounters one will be sure to show up. Using a Dive Ball or a Net Ball would be best because Relicanth has such a low catch rate with other Poké Balls. [1] X Research source"

You will come to a cave entrance. Go in there and you will find a cave with slabs of rock with Braille on them. Go to the far end of the cave and stand in front of the middle Braille. You need a Pokémon that knows Dig. Now put Wailord in the front of your party and Relicanth last. Have your Dig Pokémon use Dig. An earthquake should occur next. [3] X Research source"
