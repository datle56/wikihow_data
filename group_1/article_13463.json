    {
      "title": "Use the full footnote format the first time you cite a work.",
      "content": "Use the full footnote format the first time you cite a work. The first time you cite a work in your paper, place a superscript number at the end of the sentence and include a footnote with all of the same information that you have in your bibliography entry. However, in a footnote, you list the author's first name first and separate the elements of the citation with commas. The publication information is enclosed in parentheses. Add the page number or range to the end. [3] X Research source Example of full footnote format for a book: F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby (New York: Scriber, 2004), 88."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shorten the footnote format for any subsequent citations.",
      "content": "Shorten the footnote format for any subsequent citations. After you've provided the publication information once, there's no need to include it again. If you cite the same source a second time, type the author's name and title, followed by the page number. [4] X Research source Example of shortened footnote format for a book: F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby , 92-94."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cite to \"Ibid.\"",
      "content": "Cite to \"Ibid.\" if you cite the source again consecutively. Use \"Ibid.\" after the shortened footnote format if you cite to the same source a third time in a row. This tells your reader that you're still referencing the same work. [5] X Research source Example of consecutive citations: 1. F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby (New York: Scriber, 2004), 88. 2. F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby , 92-94. 3. Ibid."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the page numbers if they differ from the shortened note.",
      "content": "Add the page numbers if they differ from the shortened note. You need a footnote after every sentence in which you discuss, paraphrase, or quote a work. If you use \"Ibid.\" by itself, you're directing your reader to the same page number or page range as the previous note. If the material you discussed in the subsequent sentence occurs on a different page, add the page numbers to let your readers know. [6] X Research source Example of consecutive citations with page numbers: 1. F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby (New York: Scriber, 2004), 88. 2. F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby , 92-94. 3. Ibid. 4. Ibid., 96-98."

    {
      "title": "Create a full footnote for your initial citation.",
      "content": "Create a full footnote for your initial citation. Shortened citations are only appropriate after you've already provided the full citation, including publication information, at least once. A full footnote includes all the same information as the bibliography entry, although it is formatted differently.

      "content": "Use only the author's last name and page number when citing a work just cited. If you're following the guidelines of the 17th edition of CMOS, you would replace both the intermediate step of a shortened citation and \"Ibid.\" with a new shortened form. Simply type the author's last name followed by a comma, then the page number or page range where the material appears. Place a period after the page numbers. [8] X Research source Example of consecutive citations using shortened format: 1. Ernest Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls (New York: Scribner, 1995), 112. 2. Hemingway, 114-116. 3. Hemingway, 122."

      "content": "Include the title in nonconsecutive shortened citations. Use the author and page number citation format only for works that you cite 2 times or more in a row. If there is an intervening note to a different work, provide the title as well. Different works by the same author would be considered intervening notes.
