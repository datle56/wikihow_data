You may have to rotate or shimmy the tip out of place since it will have a tight fit. Once you remove the tip from the shoe, you can throw it away. [2] X Research source If the rubber on the tip is completely worn away, then grab the metal dowel instead. Don’t grab above the rubber tip since you could damage the actual heel of your shoe. Try replacing the tips on your high heels before the rubber wears away since it’s easier to remove."
