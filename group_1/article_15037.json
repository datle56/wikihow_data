      "content": "Select an LED lamp over a UV lamp for a quicker drying time. LED nail lamps typically cure gel polish in less than half the time of UV nail lamps. This will save a lot of time for your overall manicure. [1] X Research source LED lamps tend to be more expensive than UV lamps, but it may be worth the investment if you want to save time."

      "content": "Plug the LED nail lamp into an electrical outlet. Choose an LED nail lamp that’s at least 36 watts. Place it onto a table near where you’ll be painting your nails, and plug the end of the power cord into a nearby electrical outlet. Some mini LED nail lamps come with a USB cord. You can either plug the USB into an external battery, a computer, or an adapter for an electrical outlet. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your painted nails directly below the lamp.",
      "content": "Place your painted nails directly below the lamp. After applying a coat of LED-compatible gel nail polish to 1 hand, slide your polished nails beneath the lamp. Make sure the polish faces upwards. [3] X Research source Keep your palms flat on the table or the base of the lamp and separate your fingers slightly. Be careful not to touch the sides or top of the lamp as you might damage your polish. Choose a lamp with a removable base for a pedicure. This way, you can easily set the lamp over your toenails.

      "title": "Select a 30-second cycle to cure the polish.",
      "content": "Select a 30-second cycle to cure the polish. With 1 hand under the lamp, adjust the settings on the lamp with your other hand to select a 30-second cycle. The lamp may have a dial or a designated button for each amount of time. Press the start button and you’ll see the lights come on. Keep your hands still beneath the light for the entire duration of the cycle. Some lamps have just 1 button that you can press once for a shorter cycle or hold down for a longer cycle. [5] X Research source Check the directions from the polish manufacturer to ensure you cure your gel polish for the right amount of time. Some polish can cure after just 10 seconds while some might require 45 seconds. Refer to the lamp manufacturer’s directions for how to correctly operate your lamp."

      "title": "Remove your hand once the light turns off.",
      "content": "Remove your hand once the light turns off. When the cycle is complete, the light will shut off and you’re free to slide your hands out from under the lamp. Now you’re ready to add additional coats of gel polish. Cure the gel polish under the lamp between every coat, including the base and top coats."

    {
      "title": "Paint and cure 1 hand at a time.",
      "content": "Paint and cure 1 hand at a time. For the best manicure results, work on 1 hand at a time. Use the nail lamp to cure the polish on 1 hand before using that hand to apply polish to the other. Apply the gel polish in thin, even layers. After about 2 to 4 coats you’ll have a glossy, opaque finish. This way, you’ll avoid smudging and damaging the gel polish. It will also make applying polish with your non-dominant a little easier since you won’t have to worry about messing up your nails. Try painting and curing your index, middle, ring, and pinky finger first and do your thumbnail separately. [6] X Research source This will help the thumbnail polish cure under more direct light exposure."

      "title": "Wipe your cured nails with alcohol to remove the tacky residue.",
      "content": "Wipe your cured nails with alcohol to remove the tacky residue. Cured gel polish results in a sticky dispersion layer. Once you’ve finished painting and curing your nails, saturate a cotton pad or paper towel with gel cleanser or alcohol. Wipe it gently across the cured polish to remove the stickiness. This step is best done after a gel topcoat. There’s no need to do this in between layers of gel polish."

      "content": "Wear sunscreen or UV-absorbant gloves to protect your skin. While it’s not necessary, you can apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen to your hands before painting your nails to help filter out the UV rays from your skin. Or you can slip on fingerless UV-absorbent gloves before applying the gel polish. [7] X Research source With proper use, the skin-damaging effects of UV lamps are considered low-risk by the FDA. [8] X Research source But it doesn’t hurt to take extra precautions. Avoid using any other kind of cosmetic products on your hands since they may cause skin sensitivity under the UV radiation."

Make sure your nails are facing polish-side up. Try not to stick your entire hand under the lamp. Aim to get your nails directly under the lamp but minimize the amount of skin you expose to the UV radiation."

Keep your hand in place for the full duration of the drying cycle. [10] X Research source Refer to the polish manufacturer’s directions for the exact curing time requirements. Depending on the product you’re using, you may only need to run a 1-minute cycle. You’ll need to cure each layer of gel polish completely before applying another layer. To be safe, don’t run the UV lamp for more than 10 minutes total on each hand. This would mean you can do a total of 5 coats of polish, such as a basecoat, topcoat, and 3 coats of colored polish.

It will also make applying polish to your dominant hand easier since your polish will be dry. Try to apply 1 thin coat of polish at a time to build up an even, professional-looking finish. Try painting and drying your thumbnails separately to avoid smudges or if directed by the manufacturer. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Replace the UV bulb after about 2 to 4 months of heavy use. Unlike LED nail lamps, the bulbs in UV nail lamps can wear out over time and lose their effectiveness. Buy a new set of bulbs from the manufacturer and install them according to the directions. If you’re using the UV lamp on a daily basis to dry clients’ nails, replace the bulbs after 2 to 4 months. You may not need to replace the lamp for 1 or 2 years if you use it intermittently."

Look for the words “no light” on the packaging. [13] X Research source The clear topcoat will usually come in an opaque bottle to protect it from natural UV exposure. If you already have the top coat, only use it with the same brand’s polishes to ensure your manicure dries correctly. Read the instructions on the product’s packaging to ensure the gel doesn’t require LED or UV light to cure."

After painting on the first coat of no-light gel polish, wait between 5 to 10 minutes for the polish to air-dry. Then proceed to paint on the second coat. Dry this coat for another 5 to 10 minutes. [14] X Research source With no-light gel polish, the UV radiation in the natural daylight helps cure the polish. Dry your nails during the day or near a bright window if possible to speed up this process."

Apply the clear top coat over the entire surface of the gel polish, from the cuticle area to the free edge of your nail. Allow this to air-dry completely until the polish is hard and dry to the touch. [15] X Research source When using a no-light polish, the topcoat is essential to the curing process. The polish won’t set correctly without it."
