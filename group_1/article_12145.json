[1] X Research source Diwali also marks the start of the new year, so getting rid of old clutter and negativity feels like a fresh start for many. Many Hindus and even non-Hindus also wait for Diwali to redecorate and paint their walls. To add some extra style without painting the whole house, you might sponge paint your room or just a single wall. Usually, the guests and relatives are seated in the living room during celebrations. So you can take a little extra care to decorate your living room. Don't worry if your living room is not very big or fancy; having a clean, aromatic and well-lit room does the trick."

      "content": "Use colored rice, sand, or painted materials to create rangoli . Rangoli, traditional art designs made on the floor during Diwali and other Hindu festivals, are traditionally made of colored granular substances, such as rice or sand. You can buy stencils to make rangoli on your own floor easily, or you can use chalk to draw the design for your own rangoli on the floor. Then use a funnel with a small opening to slowly pour the rice or sand on top of the design. You can usually buy colored rice or sand at arts and crafts stores. However, you can also create your own colored rice by mixing 1 cup (240 mL) of rice, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vinegar, and 10 drops of food coloring in a container, covering the container, and shaking the ingredients together for 2 minutes. Make any pattern of your choice like flowers , the Goddess Lakshmi, a Mandala , etc. If you’re on a budget or simply don’t want to deal with the hassle, simply paint elaborate designs on cardboard or pieces of wood and lay these on the floor as your rangoli. Make your wooden rangoli more elaborate by placing stones, mirrors, or beads on top of them to enhance the painted designs. The general purpose of rangoli is to add decoration to your home and to bring good luck for your family. In some parts of South Asia, unmarried young women draw rangoli during the month of Margazhi to welcome the god Thirumal into their home and to hopefully find a husband in the near future."

Beyond simple decoration, toran also serve a religious purpose: they’re used to attract and welcome Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, into your home."

      "content": "Make plain candles festive with pressed flowers. Embed flowers in a plain white candle by placing a small amount of glue on them and pressing them flat against the candle. Then, heat some clear wax in a double boiler to 150 °F (66 °C), dip the candle in the wax for 30 seconds, then dip it into cold water and dry.

However, you can repeat the process of dipping the candle in the hot wax and then dipping it in the cold water until you achieve the preferred amount of thickness. Make sure you dip the candle in and out of the wax in a smooth motion to avoid making it lumpy. The water you use doesn’t have to be ice cold; it just needs to be colder than room temperature. You can use flowers of any shape, size, or species to press into your candles, so long as they’re colorful! If you’d like your candles to have more religious significance, some examples of flowers preferred by Hindu gods include red hibiscus, lotus, marigold, and jasmine.
