      "content": "Shuffle and cut the cards. Take the deck of cards out from the box and thoroughly mix them together. Use multiple techniques, such as riffle or overhand shuffles, to ensure the cards are randomized. Then, ask another player to place a red cut card anywhere in the middle of the deck. Once they place it, split the deck so the red cut card is on the bottom of one of the stacks. Place the other stack on top to finish the shuffle. [1] X Research source The cut card is a solid red card placed in the deck that marks where the cards should be separated during the cut. It's not totally necessary, but it can be helpful when cutting the deck. If you’re playing with a large group, you can combine up to 6 or 8 decks to change the odds of the game."

      "content": "Have the players place their bets for their hands. If you’re on a blackjack table, then have the players set their bets in the small circle in front of them. Wait until each player has either placed their chips for the bet or until they decide to leave the table. Make sure not to deal any cards before they place their bets. You do not place bets on your hand as a dealer."

Flip the card face-up while you’re sliding it and set it in the box in front of the player. Keep giving 1 card to each player from left to right across the table. [2] X Research source Try to place the card in the box without having to readjust it. Practice sliding the cards across the table if you can. Don’t let the players touch the cards, especially if you’re dealing in a professional setting."

      "content": "Set 1 card face-down in front of you. Take the next card from the deck and slide it face-down in front of you. Make sure you keep the card pressed flat on the table so the players don’t see what card’s value is. Don’t look at the card after you deal it. [3] X Research source"

Flip the card face-up and set it on top of the first card so you can still read the numbers in the corner. Keep dealing cards to the players around the table, and then set 1 card face-up in front of you. You can then start your round of blackjack.

      "content": "Deal 1 card if the player wants to hit. Ask the player directly to your left what they want to do with their hand. If they want to get closer to 21, they’ll ask to hit. Take the top card from the deck and slide it over to their hand, and flip it over to set it on top. Total the card values and tell the player the new total. If the player wants to hit again, give them another card. [5] X Research source"

Collect that player’s cards and set them aside as a discard pile. Then, take the busted player’s chips they placed as a bet and put them along with the rest of the chips in the chip holder. [6] X Research source Players who bust automatically lose the round and lose their entire bet. You win the bet as the dealer, but the chips go to the bank rather than paid out to you."

When a player stands, stop dealing them cards and move on to the next player. Keep working across the table from left to right, dealing cards to each player one at a time.

Reveal the card you dealt yourself at the beginning of the round and total the value of your cards. If you had a 10 or face card and reveal an ace, then you got a blackjack and automatically win against players with a smaller hand."

If the total of your cards is 16 or lower, then draw a card from the top of the deck and set it face-up next to the other cards in your hand. If the total is still under 17, then draw cards until your hand is over 17. If you draw a card that puts your total over 21, then you bust, and the other players who are still in win the hand.

If the player won with a blackjack, showing a 10 and an ace, then they are usually paid 3:2 on their bet, meaning they get 2.5 times the amount they bet. If you have a “push” where you have the same total as another player, neither you nor the player wins. The player then gets their bet back.

Let the players pay up to half of their initial bet as their insurance. Look at your face-down card and reveal it if it’s a 10. If it is, take the initial bets from any players who lost against your hand. Then pay any players with insurance double the amount they paid. [9] X Research source For example, if a player paid 3 chips for insurance, then they would get 6 chips from the bank if you have a blackjack. If a player pays insurance, they won't lose as many chips if you have a blackjack right when you begin dealing. If you don’t have a blackjack, then take the chips the players paid for insurance and put them in the bank."

If they want to double down, wait for them to place their additional bet on the table before dealing them 1 more card. Lay the card horizontally across the top of their hand to show they cannot hit on that hand anymore. [10] X Research source If the player that doubled down wins against your hand, then they win double the amount of money. For example, if the player bet 5 chips initially and then won after doubling down, they would win 20 chips from the bank."

[11] X Research source If a player gets a blackjack on a split hand, they win 1:1 payout rather than 3:2."
