If your device is a tablet, 2-in-1 PC, or desktop with a rotatable screen, then you can rotate the monitor to fix the issue. If that does not work, then check that rotation lock is not enabled by opening the action center. If you do not see rotation lock in the action center, then try reconnecting the USB cable (not HDMI or VGA) cable for your monitor. This should fix the rotation sensor."
