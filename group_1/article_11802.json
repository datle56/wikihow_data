      "content": "Make a list of what you like about yourself. If you find yourself taking it personally or doubting yourself, try to build your confidence instead. Make a list of your favorite things about yourself and spend time nurturing these traits. That way, if someone else doesn’t appreciate you, it won’t seem so important because you know and appreciate yourself. For example, maybe you like that you are a loyal friend or maybe you like that you are kind to people. Write down the great qualities that you have and focus on these. Don’t take it personally. Your crush's rejection likely has nothing to do with you. Your crush not having feelings for you is not a statement about you; it’s a statement about them. You are a perfectly lovely person who simply wasn’t meant to be with your crush. There are so many reasons that your crush might not be interested, and almost none of them have to do with you. Maybe your crush wasn’t ready for a relationship. Maybe they don’t have time right now. Maybe they don’t want to make a commitment to someone. Maybe they have feelings for someone else. Don’t question yourself. It’s their loss!"

There are probably millions of people who have similar characteristics as your crush. Now that you know what kind of person you are looking for, you can open your eyes to all the other wonderful people out there. Over your lifetime, there will likely be many people who you like and many who like you. Sometimes you will like someone, and they won’t like you back.

Spend time with people who put a smile on your face. Watch a funny tv show. Do an activity that you enjoy. Spend time with an animal that makes you happy. Make deliberate choices to put yourself in a happy environment rather than wallowing over what you can’t have. When your crush doesn’t like you, it’s easy to feel powerless and like a victim of their rejection. But ultimately, your happiness and your emotions are your responsibility and not anyone else’s. If you have placed your potential happiness in the hands of your crush, it’s time to take it back and be responsible for yourself. Take ownership of your feelings and make the choice to find happiness for yourself. [2] X Research source Change your thoughts about what happened. Instead of seeing this as a terrible tragedy, look at it as an opportunity for growth and exploration. One person didn’t like you back, but lots of other people will. Now that you know there isn’t a future with this person, you can find the right people."

There's no need to badmouth them or respond defensively. You don't need to be best friends, but you can still help them if they need it sometime. It’s ok that they don’t feel the same way. There are lots of people that you don’t feel that way about. Sometimes it just doesn’t work out, and that’s to be expected. It doesn’t mean your crush is a bad person and it doesn’t mean you are. Two great people just didn’t happen to feel the same way. Control what you can. You can’t control your crush’s feelings, but you can control your response to them. You are far from a passive observer in this. You have full control over how you will respond and how you will move forward. Choose to think good thoughts, to adjust your expectations, and to respond in healthy ways. [3] X Research source Don’t let your crush’s rejection change you. Your crush doesn’t need to have that kind of power over you. If you feel hurt, that’s ok, but that doesn’t need to make you an angry, bitter person.

If that’s the case, you can help yourself to feel differently. You could do a fun activity that makes you feel happy, fulfilled, and connected to someone, such as playing a fun game with a group of close friends. You have the power to influence your emotions. When your crush doesn’t like you, this is a form of loss. No, it’s not the same as losing a loved one, but you are still missing someone who mattered to you.

Spend a bit of time feeling these negative emotions so that you can process them and move past them. You don’t need to pretend to be perfectly fine when you’re not. No one feels great all the time!"
