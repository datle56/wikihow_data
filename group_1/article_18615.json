Kissing Sarah at the party was the worst thing I’ve ever done. I’ll do anything to make this better. Can we just talk?” She might say \"no,\" but don't lose hope just yet. Instead, text back, \"I totally understand. Is it okay if I check back with you next week?\" If she says \"no\" again, text, \"I'll leave you alone. Just know that you can text me anytime if you change your mind.\" Hopefully, she'll have a change of heart.
