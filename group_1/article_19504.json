[1] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. Simply place a hose attachment onto your vacuum and place a sock or stocking on the end of the hose. Vacuum up each ladybug you spot, then take your vacuum outside and remove the sock to set the ladybugs free. [2] X Research source Ladybugs are beneficial insects, so don’t kill them when possible. They eat lots of pests like aphids that damage plants, vegetables, and fruits. While it’s annoying to have ladybugs infesting your house, they’re not harmful. They don’t eat wood, food, or clothes and rarely bite when they’re threatened. Their greatest nuisance is releasing yellow blood that can stain your walls, furniture, or clothes.

      "content": "Use pieces of tape to catch roaming ladybugs. For hard to reach ladybugs, just place rolled-up pieces of duct tape near them. When they walk over the tape, they’ll get stuck. Just check on the traps often, remove them when they’re full of ladybugs, and take them outside to release the ladybugs into your yard. [4] X Research source For a more direct approach, wrap a piece of tape around your finger. Then, gently press the tape against any ladybugs you find and release them back outside."

      "content": "Make a DIY light trap to capture ladybugs in dark areas. If you notice that a dark area like a cupboard or the attic has a ladybug infestation, use light to trap them. Just cut a 2-liter plastic bottle in half and place an LED light in the bottom piece. Then, turn the top piece upside down and set it inside the bottom to create a funnel. Simply place the trap where you see ladybugs and turn on the light. [5] X Research source Check on your trap regularly to see if you’ve caught any ladybugs. When you have, simply take the trap outside and open it to release the ladybugs. Ladybugs are attracted to light. When they see the light, they fly towards it but instead fall into the trap. They can't get out until you release them. If you don’t want to make your own trap, buy a commercial light trap."

      "content": "Add dish soap and water to a bowl to trap and kill ladybugs. If you’re dealing with a lot of ladybugs, use this method to get rid of them in batches. Just fill a small bowl with water and a few drops of dish soap. Then, place the bowl in an area full of light, like next to a window or a bright lamp. Ladybugs are drawn to light, so they’ll land in the water and drown. [6] X Research source The dish soap removes the surface tension of the water, which makes it harder for the ladybugs to escape."

      "content": "Spray a vinegar solution on surfaces where you’ve seen ladybugs. Ladybugs release pheromones that alert other ladybugs to their location, causing more to invade your home. To get rid of their signal, pour 1 part white vinegar and 1 part water into an empty spray bottle. Then, look around your home and generously spray all of the surfaces where you’ve seen ladybugs moving. [9] X Research source White vinegar neutralizes the pheromones that ladybugs release.

It works by dehydrating the ladybugs, killing them once they touch it. To apply diatomaceous earth, put on goggles and a respirator mask. Then, generously spread the diatomaceous earth around your yard or garden beds. [15] X Research source Diatomaceous earth is safe for pets and children. However, it can kill other beneficial insects like honeybees. The goggles and face mask are only to prevent you from inhaling the powder as it settles. Once it has settled, you can remove your safety gear. If the ladybugs are getting inside, sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the outside of your doors, windows, and other entrances to get rid of them."
