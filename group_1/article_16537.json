You also get 15 HP added to your total HP, which is a great boon if you've been struggling with staying alive in the mines. [1] X Research source Each weapon in Stardew Valley does a different amount of damage. To determine how much damage your weapon will do with the Fighter profession, find your weapon on the Stardew Valley Wiki and multiply the damage numbers by 1.1."

      "content": "If you select Fighter at level 5, you can pick Brute or Defender at level 10. Brute gives you a further 15% damage bonus (that stacks with the 10% from Fighter, increasing your damage by 25% total). Defender gives you an additional 25 HP. Either one of these options are a great choice, but you can only unlock them by selecting Fighter as your level 5 profession."

      "content": "Scout increases your critical strike chance by 50%. You don't get an HP increase with Scout. It should be noted that the 50% increase in crit strike chance is multiplicative, which means you would take the base crit chance score and multiply it by 1.5 to get your new crit chance. Most weapons have a critical strike chance of 2%. If you only have the Scout profession with no additional items or buffs to increase your crit chance, your crit chance will only be 3% for most weapons. [2] X Research source"

Acrobat cuts the cooldown on special moves in half, and Desperado doubles the damage you do when you hit critical strikes. If you do decide to get the Scout profession, Desperado is the better level 10 choice due to drastically increasing your critical hit damage."

      "content": "Fighter is the better option for most players. While you can increase your critical hit chance quite a bit by the time you get to endgame gameplay, most players will benefit from the increased damage over an additional 1% of critical hit chance. The extra HP from the Fighter profession will also help you stay alive longer when you explore the mines."

If you like the idea of making a special combat build to increase your critical hit chance, Scout would be the best choice for you. You can drastically increase how much damage you do if you select Scout (and further on select Desperado at level 10 combat) with the right build that focuses on increasing crit."
