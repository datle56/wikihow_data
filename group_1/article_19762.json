If you believe you are experiencing an allergic reaction to antibiotics, seek medical help immediately, no matter how severe your symptoms are. Many allergic reactions are confined to skin rashes and will not result in any complications, but it's important to talk to your doctor about any reaction. Some rashes can be caused by Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe complication that needs hospitalization.

      "content": "Stop taking the medicine. If you're experiencing any allergic reactions to an antibiotic, you must discontinue using that medication, and avoid all exposure to it. Exposure can happen accidentally, so it's important to take preventative action. Tell healthcare workers about your allergy any time you are receiving medical treatment of any kind. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ensure that this is included in your medical records for future reference, but don't ever assume medical personnel have seen the chart or know of your allergy. It is your responsibility to communicate your allergies when being treated. Wear a medical alert bracelet. These bracelets can be invaluable, especially if you ever require emergency care while unconscious. It alerts healthcare workers about your allergy in times when you cannot communicate your allergy.

      "content": "Ask your doctor about desensitization. In most cases, if you have a known allergy, your doctor will prescribe an alternative drug. In some very isolated cases where benefit outweighs the risk, and there are no alternative treatments, that may not be an option. If you must take a particular drug and have a known allergy to that medication, your doctor may work with you through a drug desensitization treatment. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source During drug desensitization treatments, your doctor will administer a minimal dose of the drug you're allergic to and will monitor your symptoms. Then they will administer an increasingly larger dose every 15 to 30 minutes, over the course of several hours or even days. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you can tolerate the desired dosage without any adverse reactions, your doctor may then safely prescribe a regular course of the medication.

      "title": "Take oral antihistamines.",
      "content": "Take oral antihistamines. Antihistamines increase the passage of white blood cells in your body while reducing your body's production of histamine, which your immune system releases in response to an allergen. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Depending on the severity of your reaction, your doctor may recommend a prescription-strength antihistamine, or they may advise you to use an over-the-counter antihistamine. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). In the case of severe allergy, it is always good to use diphenhydramine (Benadryl) as this is a strong antihistamine. Consider keeping some in your first aid kit for emergencies. Other common over-the-counter antihistamines include loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or chlorpheniramine (Aller-Chlor). The dosage you take will depend on some factors, including your age and the particular antihistamine you are taking. Follow the instructions on the package, or ask a doctor or pharmacist for dosage instructions. Do not drive or operate machinery after taking antihistamines, as most first-generation antihistamines (like Benadryl) can cause severe drowsiness, making it difficult to function. Do not use antihistamines if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. These medications may cause adverse side effects in infants and could cause birth defects in developing fetuses. Do not give antihistamines to children under four years of age. If your little one is experiencing a severe allergy, take them to the emergency room. Do not wait it out with respiratory difficulties or facial swelling â€” get emergency care as soon as possible. Some elderly patients experience adverse side effects from an antihistamine. These side effects include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, and irritability. This places them at risk for falling. Falling and breaking hips can be fatal to the elderly, as their immune systems are not as robust as young to middle-aged adults."
