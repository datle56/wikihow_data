      "content": "Know exactly what it is you want and be able to explain it fully. If you don’t know exactly what you need or want, and if you don’t have a clear statement of how they can help you and of what your position is, it is less likely that you’ll hang up feeling satisfied. If you have a technical issue with an electronic or online service, make sure you can clearly state what it is. Technical support usually needs as much information as possible to help provide you a solution. If you are disputing a charge, make sure you’ve gone over the bill and come up with a rationalization for why you think the bill is wrong. In any event, make sure to have it clear in your mind what resolution will make you happy, and what resolution is reasonable."

So you need to think about this before you call or visit them. There are a number of things you should consider: Waiting 10-20 minutes to talk to an agent. Speaking with the agent for 10 minutes. Being transferred to another department and re-explaining your issue. Escalating your issue to a supervisor, waiting for the supervisor, and then explaining your issue to the supervisor. Keep in mind the time of day you are visiting or calling, as some times are busier than others."

Agents have metrics that they need to adhere to, which means they may have specific scripts they must read to you, or they may have a specific call time they must maintain. An agent cannot spend hours dealing with your problem. They must maintain an average handle time. They may be required to pitch certain new services/items to you."

But remember: Supervisors are not employed just to deal with customers all the time. You might have to restate your situation to the supervisor. The supervisor might fall back on the same policies that the initial representative did, and you might not be happy with this. Be polite. Supervisors are people, too. Set the tone of the conversation by telling the supervisor that you are confident that they will leave you completely satisfied. If you’re not happy with how that supervisor is treating you, thank them, and call back or revisit the office later. You might wind up getting someone else who can be more helpful."

Try to get the following information: Ask politely for the agent’s name or employee ID: \"May I please have your name and employee ID?\" Similarly, politely ask for the call center location, if you choose to call.
