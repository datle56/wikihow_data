      "content": "Find out if they really and truly hate you. Hate is a strong emotion, one very few people feel casually. Do they actually hate you? Or are you possibly projecting your own negative perception of yourself onto them?

[2] X Research source That said, the following signs could mean there is some beef between both of you. Intentionally making your life difficult (deliberately annoying you, messing with your work, for instance). Ignoring your words and conversations, especially when you're trying to speak with him/her. Talking trash about you behind your back. Throwing unwarranted cruel language and insults your way at every opportunity. Acting rude to you, but being very kind to others. Also, if he/she suddenly acts angry or annoyed around you when he/she didn't seem to be before, that's a sign that they don't like you."

      "content": "Dig into the reason they dislike you so much. Just be straightforward and ask them. 90% of the jerks harboring hateful feelings won't have much to say back to you -- they're just angry people. When confronted, they'll stammer, hem, and haw, because there is usually no good reason to hate you. But, if they do respond, you'll have a chance to make things right: If they are uncomfortable, just flash them your pearly whites and say, \"It's all right. Let's just try and be better friends in the future.\" If that seems a bit condescending, you can go with, \"I understand if you'd rather not talk about it. I just noticed that you don't seem to like me and was curious.\" If they tell you a reason why, say \"That's good to know. I'm working on being a better person, and not doing ________.\" If you can give them a concrete step, like you're trying to make less of a mess in the work kitchen to be more respectful, let them know. If their reason is unreasonable or dumb, just admit that not everyone's perfect and move on. Don't waste any more breath trying to tame a jerk who doesn't want to be tamed or hates you for a really immature reason. They might say that they \"just don't like you\". If that's the case, accept that some people just can't bring themselves to like certain others. It's nothing personal."

Maybe you've been a bit braggadocious lately without even knowing it -- complaining about a the maid being late when they can hardly afford a broom, for example. Really dive deep into your personal interactions with them (you're not perfect either!) and then try and make it right by bringing up any slights."

Don't get snippy and fight them (\"I was not rude to you, you were just being a sensitive wuss!\"). Smile, apologize when needed, and make a plan to do better next time. [3] X Research source Tell them that you know you’ve had your disagreements, but that you just wanted to be straight with them and work things out. Most people will respect this. If they don’t, at least you tried to be mature about the situation. Be direct without being pushy. For example, say one of your coworkers hates you because you backed into his car a few weeks ago. \"Listen, I'm really sorry about your car. I made a mistake, and I shouldn't have been so careless. I feel horrible, and I want to find a way to make it up to you.\" If you still don't know what caused the problem, say something like, \"Hey, I'm not sure what's up, but I've noticed that you're kind of upset with me. I hope I haven't done something to piss you off. What's up?\""

There’s no benefit to having someone like that around, so block their calls, ignore them on your way in the door, and banish their existence from your brain. Most bullies and haters will run out of material once you stop interacting with them. Don't give them your time. Don’t put yourself at risk of verbal abuse."

Find ways to be supportive and helpful around this person, in ways that make the most of your own strengths. Just do small things without calling attention to the favor. You're not \"winning them back\" or courting them, you're just being a good person. Be casual kind: don't make a big deal of it or ask for thanks, just get it done. [7] X Research source If they don't have any lunch at lunch time, offer to give them something of yours. If they make a joke that they and their friends find funny, laugh.

Its the best kind of reverse psychology, and is the result of something called \"cognitive dissonance.\" Trying to win over someone by harming yourself is pointless.
