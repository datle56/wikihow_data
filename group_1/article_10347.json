On the other hand, never use \"raz\", when you describe the quantity of something. [2] X Research source For example to say \"one pickle, please,\" say \"ah-DEEN.\" Children learning to count in school would also not use \"raz\"."

Each of the numbers will change its spelling and pronunciation when used in particular ways. Most of the time numbers are used in the nominative case such as when the number is the subject of a sentence or modifies the subject of the sentence.This means you can usually use them in their regular form."
