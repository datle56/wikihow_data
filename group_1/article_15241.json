      "content": "Perform a patch test. A patch test is an easy way to check for allergens at home. This step is very important, especially if you have sensitive skin. If you go straight to dyeing your whole head without checking, you may end up with an itchy scalp or permanent hair loss. Dab a small amount of dye onto a cotton adhesive pad and place it somewhere on your skin that isn’t too sensitive or typically exposed like your upper back. Leave the patch on for however long you plan on leaving the dye in your hair (usually an hour). Remove the patch and rinse the dye from your skin. Wait another 48 hours before dyeing your hair. Do not use this dye if your skin experiences itching, redness, or swelling. If your skin starts itching while the patch is still on, remove it immediately and scrub away the dye with soap and water.

Semi-permanent dye is usually easy to remove from skin with a good scrubbing, but the process may take a few days. It's less work to prevent making a mess than cleaning it up later. Wear some clothes that you don't mind staining. Put a towel down on the floor in the area where you’re working. Wear exam gloves.

      "content": "Figure out color placement. You can dye all of your hair the same shade or you can get more creative. Here are a few options to consider: Dye only your highlights. Many people with dark hair go for this look with bright colors. Dye just the ends. This is called the \"dip dye\" look, since it seems like the hair has been dipped in paint. Section off your hair with plastic clips and you can use multiple colors for this method. Two colors from the same brand can be mixed. You can dye your tips one color, the hair near your roots another, and mix the two in the middle for an “ombré” look. Try a wild, multi-colored look or make a pattern by keeping certain sections of your hair un-dyed. Put a little conditioner on the parts of your hair that you want protected."

      "content": "Apply the hair dye. Place a thick amount of hair dye wherever you want it. The best way to do this varies based on your style: If you’re dyeing a large area or your whole head, the best way to do this is by massaging the dye in by hand. Grab a palm full of dye and work it into your hair as if you were shampooing. If your hair is long, you will need to do this a few times with more dye to spread the color evenly throughout. You can also try dyeing thicker hair in sections. If you’re dyeing a smaller section, use a special tools called a tint brushes. Dip the brush into the dye and \"paint\" your hair. This will help you to both control where the color goes and make sure all your hair is coated. Go over each section a few times to make sure the dye is even."

Unlike permanent dyes, which contain harsh chemicals that can damage your hair and skin, there is usually no \"too long\" with semi-permanent colors. If you want to leave your work area while the dye sets, put your hair in a shower cap to keep from making a mess."

      "title": "Rinse out the dye.",
      "content": "Rinse out the dye. Rinsing in the sink will reduce the chance of dyeing your skin but may be inconvenient. Rinsing in the shower is usually fine, even with dark colors. Soak your hair thoroughly with running water. This is more important if you've left the dye in so long that it has dried out. Gently wash your hair with color care shampoo. Keeping your hair moisturized will help maintain the color. Keep rinsing your hair until the water starts running clear. If you leave any dye in, you will end up staining anything your hair touches. Apply conditioner. This will also help keep your hair moist. Allow your hair to air dry. Blow drying will dry out your hair too much and make your new color fade faster."
