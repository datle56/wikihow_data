If there are streaks, wash it again. When you rinse and dry the glass, it should be perfectly clear. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Attach your image and the glass to cardboard.",
      "content": "Attach your image and the glass to cardboard. The cardboard will provide a sturdy base to work from. It will also prevent tracing paper from tearing. Use two 4-inch strips of masking tape to attach the traced image to a piece of white cardboard, larger than your glass pane. Place the strips over the top corners of the traced image. [2] X Research source Attach the glass to the cardboard with small (2-inch) masking tape rings on the underside of the glass, so that you do not cover your painting surface with tape. As you handle the glass, consider wearing gloves to avoid leaving oily fingerprints on the glass face. [3] X Research source Make sure the image is centered under the glass. Use white cardboard so that the lines from your image are visible and un-muddied by a dark color behind them."

      "title": "Decide which parts of the painting you will do that day.",
      "content": "Decide which parts of the painting you will do that day. You will need to paint in sections, allowing different areas time to dry. Drying typically takes 24 hours. For this reason, only mix colors that are needed in a specific area, to avoid having wasted, unused paint on your palette. The first colors to pour are those for line work and small detail. The last colors you will want to do are the background of the image, like the sky."

      "content": "Get your desired paint colors ready. You should buy oil paint; 37 ml tubes should be sufficient, unless your glass is very large. [5] X Research source If you do not have the exact paint shades that you would like for your painting, begin by mixing paints to get your desired colors. Squeeze the amount needed (small for a small area, more for a large area) of a light color onto palette paper, wax paper, aluminum foil, or a mixing palette. Add a small dab of the darker primary color to the light color. Mix well with a palette knife or brush. Keep adding small amounts of dark or light until you get the desired shade."

Because glass is non-porous, it does not take paint well. You must use gilding size to help the paint adhere to and dry quicker on the glass. Pour a small amount of size directly onto your already-mixed paint and begin blending it in. Add size as needed to larger paint piles. The desired ratio is 1/2 paint to 1/2 size. Blend thoroughly with a palette knife or paint brush. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Begin painting. Reverse glass paintings must be painted from front to back (reverse painting order) because of how the image is viewed through the glass. [7] X Research source Keep this in mind when setting up paint colors and selecting brushes. You want to start with the small details and end with the big things. It's the opposite of how you would paint a typical painting. Use a variety of brand-name, good quality paint brushes to avoid streaking. You can go to an art store and ask the people who work there which brushes are best for your purposes."

[8] X Research source Use the original image as a reference to make sure that you only paint solid lines where they should be.Sometimes, you may trace lines in an image because they indicate a color break or change, but you must remember they may not be actual solid lines. Once all of the lines have been painted, wait 24 hours before continuing. This will allow the paint to dry properly and avoid smudging. [9] X Research source"

As you paint, make sure that you avoid painting adjacent areas at the same time. If there are areas close to each other that are included in foreground but are different colors, wait for the first area you paint to dry before continuing. Placing different colors of wet paint next to each other may cause unwanted color mixture. [10] X Research source Allow the painted areas 24 hours to dry."

Dip an angled shader brush in lighter fluid, wipe it on a paper towel, and then brush it over the mistake. Doing this will remove unwanted paint from the glass. Carefully blot the area dry with a clean, cotton rag or allow it to air dry before reapplying paint. [12] X Research source"
