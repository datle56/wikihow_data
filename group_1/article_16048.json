Sneasel was introduced in Generation II (Gold, Silver, and Crystal), but its evolution Weavile wasn't created until Generation IV (Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum). This means you won't be able to evolve Sneasel unless you're playing a Generation IV or later game. You can't transfer Generation II Pokémon to later Generations. To transfer your Generation III Pokémon to Generation IV, you'll need to beat the Generation IV game and then transfer the Generation III Pokémon over using Pal Park."
