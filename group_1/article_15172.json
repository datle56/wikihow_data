      "content": "Wash your clothes before dyeing them. Follow any instructions for pre-washing that come with your dye. Usually, you will need to put the clothes through the washing machine on a warm, gentle cycle using mild detergent. [1] X Research source Make sure that all stains are removed before proceeding. You do not need to dry your clothes after washing them. They actually need to be wet for the dyeing process."

      "title": "Fill your washing machine with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill your washing machine with hot water. Use the hottest water possible, as long as it is safe to use with the type of fabric you are dyeing. Set the washing machine to fill with enough water for a small load. [2] X Research source If you fill the machine all the way, you will dilute the dye too much and end up with a faded garment."

      "title": "Pour the dye into the water as the washing machine fills.",
      "content": "Pour the dye into the water as the washing machine fills. Do not add the clothes yet. By adding the dye to the machine as it fills with water, you do not need to stir it. The rapid flow of water into the basin will stir the dye in. [3] X Research source Follow package instructions for how much dye to use. You will usually use a full package of powder dye or half a bottle of liquid dye."

      "title": "Add a fixative to the dye bath.",
      "content": "Add a fixative to the dye bath. If you are dyeing cotton or linen, add 1 cup (273 g) of salt to the bath. If you are dyeing silk or nylon, add 1 cup (200 mL) of white vinegar to the bath. [4] X Research source The fixative will help the dye adhere to the fibers."

Reset the washing cycle so that it takes a full 30 minutes to complete. Set the machine to a longer cycle if you want to produce a stronger color. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the washing machine through another rinse cycle using warm water. Let the clothes go through a full rinse cycle in your washing machine to strain out some of the excess dye. Warm water will draw out the excess dye more readily than cold water. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash the clothes with detergent in a normal cycle. Wash the clothes in a normal cycle with cold water and mild detergent. The cold water will set the dye. Meanwhile, this wash cycle will clean the clothes after they have soaked in the dye bath and fixative. [7] X Research source Do not wash any other clothes with the dyed garments. Dry the clothes in a dryer or by hanging them on a drying rack."

To make the clean-up easier, cover your workspace with a plastic drop cloth or several layers of newspaper. Protect your skin from any harmful materials or stains by wearing gloves. Wear old clothes you don't mind staining. Keep sponges and paper towels nearby in case any dye spills as you work"

Use the right kind of fixative based on the type of fabric you are dyeing: [10] X Research source For natural fibers, like cotton and silk, add 1 cup (273 g) of salt to the water as it comes to a boil. For synthetic fibers, like nylon, add 1 cup (250 mL) of white vinegar to the water."

Follow the instructions provided on the package to determine the correct amount of dye to use. This differs based on whether you are using granular dye or liquid dye: [11] X Research source If you are using a box of powder dye, you will usually pour the entire package into the simmering water. If you are using liquid dye, you will usually use half of the bottle."

Run hot water over your garment, gradually decreasing the temperature until the water is very cold and runs clear. Squeeze out any excess dye and water with your hands. Empty your dye bath in a metal sink to dispose of it. A lot of dye will come out as you rinse the fabric. This is normal. Using cold water at the end sets the dye in the fabric."

      "content": "Scour the clothes you want to dye using detergent or soda ash. For protein-based fibers, like cashmere, wool, and silk, soak the garment in mild dishwashing detergent and warm water (cool water for wool). For cellulose-based fibers like cotton, linen, and hemp, soak the garment in soda ash and warm water. Soak the clothes for at least 1-2 hours, or up to 4 hours. Keep them on the stove over a low heat. [13] X Research source You can make soda ash by putting baking soda in the oven at 200 °F (93 °C) for 1 hour."

      "title": "Soak the clothes in a mordant for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the clothes in a mordant for 20 minutes. A mordant is a mixture of a mineral and water that allows the dye to adhere to the fibers. Soak the clothes for about 20 minutes in a stockpot full of water and mordant at a low simmer, then turn off the heat and allow the clothes and water to cool. Use different mordants depending on the result you want: [14] X Research source Alum is the most readily available mordant. You can find it in some supermarkets, craft stores, or online. Use 1 ⁄ 4 pound (0.11 kg) of alum in a warm water bath for every 1 pound (0.45 kg) of material you want to dye. Using too much alum can make the fibers sticky. Iron is an effective mordant but will darken the end result with a brownish tint. Use iron for earth tone results. To create an iron bath, boil a few old nails in a large pot of water. Use copper to give your end result a greenish tint. Make a copper bath with a few old pennies (from before 1982) in boiling water, or buy copper sulfate online. Copper is toxic to consume, so don't use a pot that you use for cooking and work in a well-ventilated area. Use a small amount of tin for clear, color-fast results. Use a very small amount, and as with copper, don't use a pot that you will make food in and work in a well-ventilated area."

      "title": "Let the clothes soak in a fixative for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Let the clothes soak in a fixative for 1 hour. Dye fixatives allow your clothes to absorb the dye more readily and prevent the dye from washing out later. The best type of fixative will depend on the type of dye you are using: [15] X Research source When dyeing with berries, prepare a salt fixative. Combine 1/2 cup (136.5 g) of salt with 8 cups (2 L) of cold water. When making dye from other plants, prepare a vinegar fixative. Combine 1 part white vinegar with 4 parts cold water."

      "content": "Rinse the clothes in cool water before dyeing them. Rinse out the excess fixative and mordant by placing the clothes under cool running water. Rinse until the water runs clear. [16] X Research source Your clothes need to be wet in order to dye, so they can go straight from rinsing into a dye bath."

      "title": "Gather ripe plant materials to make natural dyes.",
      "content": "Gather ripe plant materials to make natural dyes. To get the best colors, fruit needs to be fully ripe, nuts need to be mature, flowers should be in full bloom and near the end of their life cycle. Seeds, leaves, and stems can be harvested as soon as they grow in. Combine materials to make a stronger color, or a mixed color: [17] X Research source Create orange dye with onion skin, carrot roots, butternut seed husks, or gold lichen. Create brown dye using dandelion roots, oak bark, walnut husks and hulls, tea bags, coffee, acorns, or goldenrod shoots. Make pink dye using strawberries, cherries, red raspberries, or grand fir bark. Create blue-purple dye with dogwood bark, red cabbage, lavender elderberries, purple mulberries, cornflower petals, blueberries, purple grapes, or purple iris. Make a red-brown dye using elderberries, red onion skin, pomegranates, beets, bamboo, or dried hibiscus flowers. Form a gray to black dye using blackberries, walnut hulls, oak galls, or butternut hulls. Make a red-purple dye with daylilies, huckleberries, or basil. Go for a green dye by using artichokes, sorrel roots, spinach leaves, Black-eyed Susans, snapdragons, lilac flowers, grass, or yarrow flowers. Make yellow dye using bay leaves, alfalfa seeds, marigold blossoms, St. John's Wort, dandelion flowers, daffodil flower heads, paprika, or turmeric."

To create the strongest dye, leave the plant material in the water overnight without heat. Or, leave the mixture simmering for 1-4 hours while you keep an eye on it.

      "content": "Simmer the clothes in the dye for 1-8 hours. Place your wet clothes in the dye bath and simmer them over medium heat until the desired color is achieved. Stir the clothes occasionally to dye them evenly. Remember that the clothes will dry lighter than the color you see in the bath. [21] X Research source At minimum, you will need to let the clothes sit in the dye bath for 1 hour. This will result in a light dye. For a rich shade, let the clothes sit in the dye bath 8 hours or overnight."
