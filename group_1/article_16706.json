To check which level you are on, press F3 on your keyboard and look for the X, Y, and Z coordinates. The Y coordinate indicates the level you are at in your world heightwise. Lower Pickaxes, like a Stone Pickaxe, will ruin Diamonds. Instead, you need to use an Iron or better Pickaxe ."

      "content": "Make sure you have enough supplies to mine. Your mission is to find Diamonds and get them, but you can't just punch them out with your hands. The following tools are near essentials when you are trying to mine: [2] X Research source Torches . You need multiple stacks to mine a long distance, but you can place them 15 blocks away and prevent hostile mobs from spawning. Food , preferably bread or cooked meat, to keep health and hunger up during mining sessions. Iron, Diamond, or Netherite Pickaxe . You can also bring stone pickaxes for clearing out stone and iron. Iron, Diamond, or Netherite armor , in case mobs ambush you. To see how to fight mobs, check this guide: Fight Mobs in Minecraft A shield . A shield blocks nearly all damage, including creeper explosions, which can damage a large amount of your health. This can be valuable in life-or-death situations! A water bucket is also useful if you drop from a long distance, or if you have to scale a wall. Water can also save you from lava and fire."

      "title": "Branch mine.",
      "content": "Branch mine. If caving is not your preferred method of mining, dig a staircase down to at least level -56 for the most concentration of Diamonds. Mine a long hallway, and begin making your way. Make sure each branch is 2 blocks away from each other to maximize the space you can find Diamonds in without mining blocks you don't need to. [3] X Research source Mine down each branch from the main hall for about 50 blocks or so. Don't spend too much time on one branch. This way, your search will be more spread out across the chunks of deep slate you are in, making it more likely you will find Diamonds. Keep in mind even with branch-mining, luck plays a part as well. It may take a while before you find any Diamonds."

You can also do this in caves. The directions to mine should be closed by a door so mobs can't wander into the room. Have a bed in your room and a water source. A bed allows you to sleep and respawn there if you die. You can place these nearby areas you feel like you may die in. [4] X Research source A water source allows you to get a bucket with water to save yourself in dangerous situations."

You can enchant your pickaxe with Unbreaking to help it mine for longer, or you can enchant it with Fortune to help you get more ores. You can enchant tools at an enchanting table, which can be made with 4 Obsidian, 2 Diamonds, and a book. You can get Obsidian by pouring water over a lava source, and you can get a book via leather and paper. The higher the enchantment level, the more powerful it is, so a Fortune I pickaxe will get fewer ores on average than a Fortune III pickaxe. Here is a list of enchantments and where they are applied when mining: [5] X Research source Fortune: Increases how many ores you get when you mine an ore block (Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel, Hoe) Efficiency: Allows you to mine faster (Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel) Unbreaking: Chance to not consume durability when using something (Any tool/armor) Mending: Recover durability when you get XP (Any tool/armor) Protection: Percentage of damage reduced per level (Armor (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots) Sharpness: Do more damage to anything (Sword, Axe) Smite: Do more damage to just undead mobs, does more damage than sharpness (Sword, Axe)"

Diamonds can only be found in villages with blacksmiths. The blacksmith's house will have a chance of generating chests with iron ingots, iron armor, and Diamonds. This is not guaranteed, however. Mineshaft chests have a chance of generating Diamonds."
