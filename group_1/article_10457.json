      "title": "Pull your arm across your body.",
      "content": "Pull your arm across your body. One of the easiest ways to crack your shoulder blades can be done from a standing or seated position. Start with your spine tall and extend your right arm straight in front of you, parallel to the floor. Cross your right arm over your chest, keeping the elbow slightly bent. Take hold of your right forearm with your left hand and gently pull it further across your body. Roll your right shoulder down to apply more pressure to the stretch. Hold for twenty seconds and repeat on the opposite side. [3] X Research source If you don’t feel or hear a pop in your shoulder blade right away, try repeating up to three times on each side. You can also add a bit of force with your pulling arm if needed, but never yank your shoulder or elbow to the point of pain or you’ll risk injuring your muscles and joints. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Lean one hand on a table and swing the other arm. Place one hand on a waist-height table to stabilize yourself and try to relax your shoulders. Let the other arm hang towards the floor and swing it forward and backward (like a pendulum) a few times to see if your shoulder blades will pop. If not, try swinging the arm in a circular motion about 1 foot (0.30 m) in diameter. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If this doesn’t pop your shoulder blades, try increasing the diameter of your swing. However, be careful not to push it further than is comfortable."

      "title": "Perform a standing back extension.",
      "content": "Perform a standing back extension. Start standing and place your palms onto your lower back (just above your bottom) with all ten fingers pointing down and your pinky fingers on either side of your spine. Stand up straight to prepare and then arch your spine backward, using your palms to apply light pressure to your back. You may feel a crack between your shoulder blades as soon as you lean back. Hold the position for 10 to 20 seconds and remember to breathe. This method requires some range of motion in your shoulders, neck, and back. If it feels painful, skip it and try something else. Do not lean back further than feels stable and comfortable. If you don’t feel a pop or crack at first, try arching a bit further or slightly walking your hands up your back."

      "title": "Interlace your palms and stretch your arms overhead.",
      "content": "Interlace your palms and stretch your arms overhead. Start standing with your legs shoulder-width apart and arms hanging by your sides. Then interlace your fingers with your palms facing towards the ground. Slowly raise your arms over your head, keeping your palms facing away from your body the entire time. Hold the stretch over your head, with fingers still interlaced and palms facing up to the ceiling. [6] X Research source Many people will feel a crack in their shoulder blades as they raise their arms, but you may need to hold the stretch for up to twenty seconds before you feel a pop. If you’re unable to interlace your fingers, try holding a long pole (like a broomstick) with hands shoulder-distance apart. Slowly raise the pole overhead, keeping the pole parallel to the floor.

      "content": "Stretch using a towel or exercise band behind your back. Begin standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a medium-sized towel or exercise band in your right hand. Raise your right arm straight up towards the ceiling so that the towel or band extends down your back. Reach your left arm behind your back to grab the other end of the towel or band. Gently pull up with your right arm (it’s okay if your elbow is slightly bent). Hold for 20 seconds and then repeat using opposite arms. [8] X Research source You should feel a stretch in both shoulders, but are more likely to crack the lower shoulder blade."

      "title": "Work from a seated position and twist your spine.",
      "content": "Work from a seated position and twist your spine. Begin by sitting on the floor with your right leg bent (knee pointing upward) and left leg extended in front of you. Cross your right leg over your left by placing the sole of your foot on the outside of your left thigh. Twist your body to the right, placing your left elbow on the outside of your right knee and gazing over your right shoulder. For added stability, place your right hand on the ground behind your hips. Hold until you feel a stretch or crack (about 30 seconds) and then repeat on the opposite side. [9] X Research source To deepen the stretch, gently press your arm and knee into each other. However, if you feel sharp pain in either joint, ease up the stretch and rotate back towards the center. This stretch can help you crack your entire spine as well as your shoulder blades."

      "title": "Lie on your back and cross your arms over your chest.",
      "content": "Lie on your back and cross your arms over your chest. Start by lying face-up with your knees bent and the soles of your feet flat on the ground. Extend your arms straight up towards the ceiling and then cross your arms over your chest, trying to take hold of the opposite shoulder blade. Lift your chest and shoulder blades off the floor slightly, as if you are doing a sit-up, and then return your back to the floor. Repeat two or three times. If you’re struggling to crack your shoulder blades from a standing or seated position, this can be a better method. Make sure to lie on a padded surface, like a carpet or yoga mat, to protect your spine."

      "content": "Visit a chiropractor for an adjustment if your shoulder blades are chronically stiff. Not everyone can crack their shoulders at home, even with the help of another person. If you feel the need to crack your shoulder blades frequently and aren't having luck by yourself, try making an appointment with a chiropractor in your area. Be sure to tell them that you’re interested in a shoulder or upper-back adjustment. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Chiropractors are licensed healthcare professionals that specialize in the skeletal system. They are trained in manual therapy, including spinal manipulation, to improve joint motion and function. [11] X Research source During a standard session, your chiropractor will use techniques that range from stretching and sustained pressure to specific joint manipulations (such as cracking), usually delivered with a quick, gentle thrust.

      "content": "Book a massage to help release tension and pain. Massage therapists can help you crack your shoulder blades if you can’t do it yourself. Massage therapy can also improve the range of motion in your shoulder joint by releasing tension in the surrounding tissue, lengthening muscle fibers, releasing trigger points, and stretching tendons. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Consider deep tissue massage, which works across the grain of your muscles, or a Swedish massage, which works with the grain. Both can help crack your shoulder blades and relieve tension, stiffness, and pain. Massage therapy may also help you avoid similar strains in the future, reducing the need to crack your shoulder blades going forward.

And by that, I mean work the soft tissue and don’t lean on the spine because that's where you see things get a little squirrely with home remedies.” [15] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 17 March 2021."

      "title": "Go to the emergency room if you think you may have dislocated your shoulder.",
      "content": "Go to the emergency room if you think you may have dislocated your shoulder. A dislocated shoulder means that the top of your arm bone has popped out of the shoulder blade socket. If you think you may have dislocated your shoulder, seek medical attention immediately rather than trying to pop it back in yourself, which can be very painful and cause more long-term damage. A medical professional can gently push the upper arm bone back into the socket for you. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can dislocate your shoulder by overextending your arm (when throwing a ball or reaching for something, for example). Dislocations can also occur due to a fall, collision, or strong force (like a car accident). If you have a dislocated shoulder, you will likely experience intense pain, decreased range of motion in your arm, swelling, weakness, numbness, and tingling. You may also notice that your shoulder is visibly drooping or otherwise out of shape."
