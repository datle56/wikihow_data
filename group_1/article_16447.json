When you notice yourself starting to feel tense, stop what you're doing and focus on taking a few long breaths. Once your body starts to relax, it will be easier to work through your thoughts. [1] X Research source As your breathing slows, it will stop the fight-flight-freeze reaction happening in your nervous system, so your body will slowly return to normal. Sometimes it can be hard to inhale deeply, especially if you're experiencing anxiety. If that's the case, start by exhaling as slowly as you can. Reader Poll: We asked 846 wikiHow readers, and 49% of them admitted that they typically respond to negative emotions by lashing out at others .

You might already know exactly what's bothering you—like a recent breakup, trouble at work, or a fight with someone you love. Sometimes, the issue is a little harder to pinpoint, like feeling inadequate or being overwhelmed by the state of the world. Either way, it can be surprisingly helpful to simply acknowledge what it is that's really bothering you.

Once you figure out what's wrong, start thinking about whether there's anything you can do to make the problem better. If there is, brainstorm a few steps you might take to start changing that. If you're feeling sad but there doesn't seem to be a certain reason why, you might be experiencing depression. It's a good idea to talk to your doctor if you think that might be the case."

It can seem like you need to already be in a good mood to laugh, but laughing can actually make your body and mind feel better. When you laugh, you take in more air and your brain releases endorphins, so you feel more physically relaxed and happy. Try watching a silly movie, standup video, or TV show for a quick mood boost.
