This means that you're just finding the average of the x and y coordinates of the two sets of points, which leads you to the midpoint of the two coordinates. Let's say we're working with the (x 1 , y 1 ) coordinates of (2, 5) and the (x 2 , y 2 ) coordinates of (8, 3). Here's how you find the midpoint for those two points: [1] X Research source [(2+8)/2, (5 +3)/2] = (10/2, 8/2) = (5, 4) The coordinates of the midpoint of (2, 5) and (8, 3) are (5, 4)."

The slope of a line measures the distance of its vertical change over the distance of its horizontal change. Here's how to find the slope of the line that goes through the points (2, 5) and (8, 3): [2] X Research source (3-5)/(8-2) = -2/6 = -1/3 The slope of the line is -1/3. To find this slope, you have to reduce 2/6 to its lowest terms, 1/3, since both 2 and 6 are evenly divisible by 2."

      "content": "Find the negative reciprocal of the slope of the two points. To find the negative reciprocal of a slope, simply take the reciprocal of the slope and change the sign. You can take the negative reciprocal of a number simply by flipping the x and y coordinates and changing the sign. The normal reciprocal of 1/2 would be 2/1 and the negative reciprocal is -2/1, or just -2; the reciprocal of -4 is 1/4. [3] X Research source The negative reciprocal of -1/3 is 3 because 3/1 is the reciprocal of 1/3 and the sign has been changed from negative to positive."
