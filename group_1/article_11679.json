The more reaction they will see coming from you, the more encouraging it is for them to keep bullying. Respond with one word, monotone answers. If someone makes up an elaborate insult and you just respond with \"Cool\" then it will make them look bad. Plus, it lets the bully know that you have tough skin and that they can't get to you just by saying a few words. Do not get into a physical fight with the bully, no matter how angry you are. You don’t want to be the one who gets in trouble."

Bullies also often have cognitive distortions, which means that they see their situations in such a way that they truly feel they can justify their bullying behavior, even if we can see that it is wrong. Bullies like to rebuild their internal sense of control that they may have felt was lost. When they feel powerless and afraid, they show it through aggressive behavior because that's what makes him feel more in control."
