Take all the pieces of the mirror and grind them down to dust, then scatter the powder in the wind. Alternatively, wrap a single piece of the mirror (big enough to reflect but not big or sharp enough to be dangerous to yourself or anything else) in a black cloth. Wait until the next full moon to bury it and release the negative energy. [2] X Research source Many believe that, by throwing away the broken shards of mirror, you’re effectively sealing your fate and giving yourself seven long years of bad luck.

      "content": "Burn incense to get rid of bad luck and negative energy. When you burn incense , choose pungent scents like sandalwood or jasmine. If you’re burning more than one incense stick , make sure to use an odd number rather than an even number. [4] X Research source If you are experiencing bad luck in your personal life, burn the incense at home. Carry the incense from one room to the next, letting the scented smoke fill all four corners of your home. If you are experiencing bad luck at work, burn the incense in your office. However, be aware that some employers forbid burning incense on their premises. Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine Karina Menali recommends “having your windows open and maybe running an air purifier. The smoke from incense is an irritant to the lungs!” Menali also recommends “using incense that is pure and scented naturally.”"

      "content": "Carry protective charms to draw good luck. Small, good-luck charms with protective symbols are a great way to ward off bad luck as you go about your daily life. [5] X Research source Spiritual Director Jennifer McVey says that good luck charms—such as the four-leaf clover, the horseshoe, rabbit’s feet, the color green, the number 7, and pennies—are recognized as symbols of fortune across many cultures. Wear these symbols on a chain or bracelet, or carry one around in your pocket. Some of the most common protective charms include: [6] X Research source Keys : Key charms have been used to bring good luck since ancient times. Wearing three keys together is said to unlock the three doors of wealth, health, and love. Shamrock and clover : Wearing a fresh shamrock or 4-leafed clover (or a charm in the shape of a clover ) is a popular way to draw good luck. Each of the four leaves represents a lucky characteristic: wealth, fame, love, and health . Horseshoe : Horseshoes are said to be lucky, as they ward off the \"evil eye.\" Hang one in your home for protection, or wear a Horseshoe symbol on a chain—just make sure the ends are pointed upwards. Otherwise, the good luck can \"escape.\" [7] X Research source Rabbit foot : A rabbit's foot is believed to bring good luck and protection in many cultures. However, not any rabbit foot will do . It must be the left hind foot. [8] X Research source In addition, the foot must be stroked or rubbed in order to activate the good luck."

      "content": "Cleanse your space with a smoke-cleansing ritual. People of various cultures have used smoke cleansing as a way of clearing out negative energy. Plants like palo santo , copal, or bay leaves are commonly used in smoke-cleansing rituals. [9] X Research source Some people burn sage or “smudge” their space to remove negative energy. Many Indigenous people feel that using white sage is an offensive type of cultural appropriation. They burn sage to pray, not to cleanse space, so it’s best to choose another type of plant for smoke cleansing. Buy a stick of palo santo . Carefully light the plant and let it smolder rather than burn. Carry it around your home, waving the smoke away from you into every corner of the house. Open the doors and windows to clear out the negative energy . If you like, burn some sweetgrass afterwards to invite positive energy into your home. [10] X Research source"

Helping others is also good for your mental health, which can help make you feel better about your luck.

Go to source This is a way of paying for any bad things you've done in this life or a previous one. Improve your karma by making a donation to charity or by helping people in need, such as the homeless, older adults, or orphaned children. It’s important to do good deeds out of a sincere desire to help others. If you’re only performing good deeds to win good karma and make your own life easier, it’s not as effective for drawing good luck.

      "content": "Cleanse your chakras with fresh flowers. Use fresh flowers to cleanse your seven chakras , get rid of negative energy, and invite good fortune into your life. Choose different flowers to match the energy of each chakra. For example, use hibiscus for your root chakra, tiger lily for your sacral chakra, dandelions for your solar plexus chakra, roses for your heart chakra, morning glories for your throat chakra, lavender for your third eye chakra, and jasmine for your crown chakra. [13] X Research source You will need at least seven different types of flowers in as many colors as possible (any color but white). Remove stems and leaves, leaving just the blooms. Place the flowers in a basin of water and put them outside to soak in the sun for an hour. This allows the water to soak up the positive energy of the flowers. Bring the basin to the bathroom and use a washcloth to bathe in the flower-energized water. As you bathe, concentrate on a patch of light emanating from the center of your forehead. Allow this light to spread all over your body. McVey instructs to “bring that light down through the crown and through your entire body. Then, let it beam outward from whichever chakra or energy center you're comfortable with. Push out everything negative. You just kind of push it out of your body and out of your energy field.” When you’ve finished bathing, carefully collect the flowers, place them in a paper bag, and dispose of them. Imagine your bad luck being thrown away with the flowers."

      "content": "Pray regularly to bring more blessings into your life. Praying to God , or whatever spiritual being you believe in, helps you to regain good luck because you focus on the positive aspects of your life. Remember to pray regularly and ask for forgiveness for past wrongdoings and negative thoughts. Holy Bible Expert Olivia Woodford says that “the first thing to do is to express gratitude. There's so much that we take for granted: the air that we breathe, the beauty of the flowers, and the foods that we eat. All the nature around us that supports us…is just given to us without us having to do anything.” Take some time during your prayer sessions to reflect on who you are as a person and whether you could take any steps to better yourself. Thank God for all of the good things in your life - this simple action could change your perspective on your perceived \"bad luck\" and make you realize that you are, in fact, blessed."
