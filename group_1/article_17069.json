If you're not able to read the serial number on your lightbulb and the bulb is already connected to your network, you can look up the MAC address (as well as individual IP address) via your router . To access your router, enter your router's default IP into your internet browser address bar. You can find your router's IP in a few locations: Printed on your router, usually on the back or on the bottom. On Windows, press Ctrl + R and type cmd , then press ↵ Enter . In the Command Prompt write ipconfig and press ↵ Enter . The router's default IP address is listed under Default Gateway .
