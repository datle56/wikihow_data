      "content": "Choose a gentle shampoo . To keep your hair silky, you need to keep it clean, but not too clean. The natural oils in your hair are what helps to keep it strong and healthy, but those oils can also trap dirt and become greasy, making you hair dirty. You need to strike a balance between too much cleaning and not enough to have silky hair, meaning that a gentle shampoo is an essential part of your cleaning routine. Try to use shampoo made with natural ingredients, and avoid shampoo with strong artificial fragrances. These dry out the hair over time and affect the hair's ability to form its own natural oils. Read the ingredients and avoid shampoos with parabens and sulfates. It’s especially important to avoid sulfates if you have curly or wavy hair. [1] X Expert Source Patrick Evan Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. Even if you are not a child, children or baby shampoos can be quite effective in maintaining silkiness and using a minimum number of ingredients. These are usually gentle on the hair and on the eyes, as well as pretty cheap and available, making it an effective purchase, regardless of how old you are."

      "title": "Use natural conditioner as well.",
      "content": "Use natural conditioner as well. One of the best ways to get silky hair is by regularly conditioning, even if you're not washing your hair. Conditioner helps to strengthen the tips of your hair, keeping the individual strands strong and healthy, avoiding split ends and other hair problems that can affect the texture of hair. Just as you would with shampoo, look for conditioner that lacks in artificial fragrances and dyes. If you have a short hairstyle, you will not be able to avoid getting conditioner on your scalp. Use a mild or volumizing conditioner to keep your hair from getting weighed down. Though they're commonly marketed to guys, Try to avoid using Two-in-One shampoo and conditioner combos, as well as body wash-shampoo combos, which won't allow you to condition your hair separately, and can have a long-term drying affect, counteractive to the purpose of conditioner. Buy separate products."

Depending on the natural oiliness of your hair, it may be good to supplement your cleaning routine by combing a small amount of oil into your hair, which can help enrich and strengthen it, as well as create the silky texture that you desire. Coarse hair is commonly treated by combing some variety of oil into it daily, or a few times a week. Rather than replacing anything in your hair routine, hair oils are great to use in addition to your usual hair care products like shampoo and conditioner.

      "content": "Avoid the use of styling products. Hair gel, mousse, and spray are the quickest way to gunk up your hair and leave it feeling like straw. Use natural oils and caps to help style your hair if necessary, and avoid the use of styling products. If you must use artificial styling products, rinse them out of your hair thoroughly at the end of the day and condition your hair with natural oils to help replenish them. Most styling products involve alcohol, which leech the moisture from your hair and ruin its ability to stay moisturized naturally. Don't get in the way of your body by using styling products, let your body work for you. If you really want to use styling products, try waxes and pomades made with natural oils and beeswax. These products allow you to style and moisturize your hair at the same time."

      "content": "Rinse your hair daily. For the silkiest hair, it's good to rinse the dirt and grime out at the end of each day to keep your hair clean and smooth. Using clean fresh water to rinse your hair will help to keep the healthy effects of the natural oils, and will make it easier for them to replenish. It's not necessary to shampoo your hair daily, and doing so will dry your hair out in time. If you can't take a whole shower, combing a wet comb through your hair, or even rinsing your hair in the sink can be a perfectly effective way of keeping it clean. If you do take showers daily, you don't need to shampoo every time."

      "title": "Don’t wash your hair too often.",
      "content": "Don’t wash your hair too often. In general, it’s best not to wash your hair more than once every three days. Depending on how oily your hair is naturally, you may need to shampoo more or less often. For some people, once a week is sufficient to keep hair clean, lustrous, and healthy, while others may want to shampoo as often as every other day. Use shampoo sparingly, no more than a small pea-sized amount. Wet your hands and create a lather in your hands before massaging it into your hair, focusing on the tips of your hair and working in toward your scalp. Massage gently and rinse thoroughly with warm water. If you don’t use any heat treatments (like straightening or blow-drying your hair) and your hair is not dry, you may be able to wash your hair every day."

      "content": "Condition the tips of your hair. Some people elect to condition their hair more regularly than shampooing, perhaps choosing to shampoo once a week and condition the hair three times throughout the week to keep the hair feeling silky, depending on the health of the hair and the oiliness. Use the same technique as when you wash with shampoo, then rinse thoroughly with warm water. It's very important to get all the shampoo and conditioner out of your hair every time you wash. If you have longer hair, it's somewhat difficult to get it all rinsed out, which can make your hair gunky and sticky when it dries and forms a residue."
