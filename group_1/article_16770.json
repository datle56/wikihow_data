      "content": "Ask to see the lien release if any liens are listed on the vehicle’s title. A lien release is an official document or certification that an outstanding lien has been fully satisfied. Depending on the state issuing the vehicle’s title, the lien release may either be noted on the title or in a separate document. Ask to see any lien releases even if the title shows the vehicle has transferred ownership from the lienholder. Vehicles can be sold even with outstanding liens, so you want to make sure that one is lien-free before you buy it. Any lien release documents should be transferred to you if you purchase the car, so that you can show proof any time it is necessary (such as if you sell the car yourself in the future)."

      "content": "Watch out for suspicious practices. Reputable dealers and sellers will have all documents completed and ready for you to review, or else will be able to request them. If the seller cannot or will not produce the proper documents, it may be a sign that something is wrong with the car or the sale. Never buy a vehicle if the seller can’t show you the title in the seller’s name, or can't produce lien releases for any liens listed on the title. The title is proof that the seller owns the vehicle and is permitted to sell it. If the seller can’t find the title, he or she should be able to request a new one from their department of motor vehicle services (or equivalent). It is the seller’s responsibility to do so. If the seller won’t request a new title, it may be a sign that the title is held by a bank or other lending institution and has an outstanding lien, or that the car is not the seller’s to sell. You will need the title and for the vehicle to be lien-free so that you can properly insure it, and so that no one requests the remainder of the lien payment from you."

      "content": "Determine if a lien notice is on a title by mistake. Local laws typically require either the lender or buyer to notify a tax office or department of motor vehicle services once a lien has been satisfied. If the car you want to purchase carries a lien notice on its title, even though the seller (or previous owner) has satisfied the lien, then it may be because the tax office/department of motor vehicle services has not been properly notified. Usually, this problem can be corrected without much hassle by going to the tax office or department of vehicles with the title and certification of lien release. There may be a fee to correct the title. If the lien release is lost, you will have to contact the lending institution for a new copy. If the lending institution is out of business, has merged, or does not respond to your request, contact your department of motor vehicle services for more information. If you have receipts, cancelled checks, or other proof that the lien was satisfied, it will make the process easier. [9] X Research source You may also contact an attorney for assistance."
