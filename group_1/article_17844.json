      "content": "Flirt with girls online through an online dating website. There are dozens of online dating websites now, so do your research about them and choose one that might attract the type of girls you like. Google “online dating sites” and add other keywords to help narrow down your search. [1] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. For example, look for a dating site that focuses on your particular age group, religious beliefs, the type of relationship you are seeking, or a type of membership (free or paid). Common online dating websites include eHarmony, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, Match.com, ChristianMingle, and OkCupid. Once you find a site, sign up for a membership and establish your profile. Answer the questions about yourself honestly, as this helps the algorithms of the website match you to girls who fit your type. Upload at least one good photo of yourself so that matches can see what you look like. A well-lit selfie is a great option! Reader Poll: We asked 473 wikiHow readers who've met girls online, and 50% of them agreed that the best profile picture to use is an attractive selfie that shows off your good side. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Talk to girls through social media profiles. Social media is incredibly prevalent in our society and it has become a common way for people to flirt and find relationships. Find girls to flirt with on social media through mutual friends or interests so you have something in common to talk about. [2] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. Sign up for a social media account like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to flirt with girls. Avoid flirting on LinkedIn because it’s meant to be a strictly professional site. Set up your profile with basic information about yourself and a profile photo. Decide whether you want your profile to be public or private. Setting it to private could block girls from interacting with you. Search hashtags or groups for things in which you are interested to find girls who have those interests in common with you."

      "content": "Use a dating app. Dating apps are full of other singles looking for love! Choose and download a dating app (or two) on your smartphone and create a profile to get started. Upload a picture and a bio, then start swiping to get matched with girls who are interested in talking to you too. [3] X Research source A few of the most common dating apps are Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Happn, and Lumen. Some dating apps are designed for certain types of people. For example, Lumen is targeted at people above the age of 50."

      "content": "Give her a genuine compliment. Think hard about what you like about a girl based on what you know from her online profile. Start a conversation with her by complimenting her on something that you find interesting or beautiful about her. [4] X Research source For example, maybe she has a gorgeous smile, so compliment her by saying: “Hey! I really love your smile.” Or, if she has really pretty eyes, start the conversation by saying something like: “Wow! Your eyes are so unique and beautiful!” Or, if you know that the girl is into rock climbing from her profile, say something like: “Hi! It’s so cool that you rock climb!” Don’t compliment a girl on her body right off the bat, which can come across as sleazy."

      "title": "Show off your sense of humor.",
      "content": "Show off your sense of humor. When you’re first starting to talk to and flirt with a girl online, try to work in some topical or observational humor. Or, tell her a funny story you have or talk about something funny that you saw earlier in the day. [5] X Research source For example, if something funny happened to you at the grocery store earlier, start by saying something like: “You won’t believe what happened to me while I was grocery shopping today…” and continue to tell the story. Or, you could talk about something funny that you read in the news. Avoid making fun of people or making jokes at the expense of others, which can make you seem mean."

      "content": "Be patient while you’re chatting. Give her time to respond to messages and don’t bombard her with messages when she isn’t talking to you. This gives her a chance to open up to you and helps avoid coming on too strong. [6] X Research source Remember that people are busy and have different schedules. If you send a girl a message and she doesn’t respond as soon as you’d hoped, it doesn’t mean she’s ignoring you. Give her a chance to respond when she’s ready to."

      "title": "Tell the truth about yourself.",
      "content": "Tell the truth about yourself. Never tell lies about yourself in an effort to impress a girl online — it’s just going to come back and bite you eventually! Be honest about who you are, what you look like, and what your hobbies and interests are right from the beginning. That way, the girl you’re flirting with gets to know the real you. [7] X Research source For example, don’t lie and say you play basketball all the time if you’re 30 and you haven’t played basketball since high school. Definitely don’t lie about your height, weight, or other aspects of your physical appearance. Otherwise, it’s bound to be awkward when you eventually meet the girl you’re chatting with in person."

      "title": "Try to match the level of interest of the person you’re talking to.",
      "content": "Try to match the level of interest of the person you’re talking to. If you’re trying to flirt with a girl online, pay close attention to how interested she seems to be in talking to you. Don’t send her 100 messages for every 1 she sends you or reply with blocks of text if she’s only sending you 1 to 2 word messages. [8] X Research source If a girl you’re talking to doesn’t seem to be as interested as you are at first, she’s maybe just being cautious, which is totally normal because girls get messages from creepy guys all the time. Keep talking to the girl you’re interested in and see if she starts to open up. Then, as long as the conversation feels natural and not forced, try to gradually ramp it up by sending more or longer messages."

      "title": "Respect when the person you’re talking to says no to something you ask.",
      "content": "Respect when the person you’re talking to says no to something you ask. If you ask a girl you’re talking to for her phone number or ask her if she wants to meet in person and she says no, don’t push it. It doesn’t necessarily mean she’s not interested, but you should always listen to and respect what a girl says (in real life and online) and understand that no means no! [9] X Research source This also goes for talking about certain subjects. For example, if you ask a girl what part of town she lives in and she says she doesn’t want to tell you right now, drop it. If you still think something could blossom from talking to a girl online, by all means continue the conversation. Just don’t be pushy about things she seems uninterested in at the moment."

      "content": "Send emoticons in your chat messages. Emoticons are a fun and flirty way to communicate in a non-creepy way. Add different smiley faces to your messages to convey different emotions or try to replace certain words or sentences with emoticons in a creative way. [10] X Research source For example, if you want to say “Good morning!” to a girl you’re chatting with, add a sunshine emoticon and a blushing smiley face at the end of the message to make it more flirty and fun in a totally non-creepy way."

      "content": "Whenever you feel comfortable with the person and ready to meet. There is no set-in-stone rule for how long you should wait before meeting someone you’ve been chatting to online. Whenever you feel comfortable enough after talking with a girl to meet in real life, and think that she is comfortable with you as well, suggest a date in a public place. [11] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. Dinner dates feel intimidating to some women for first dates, so an afternoon date might be more her style. Choose an activity that is laid back and low pressure for the first date. For example, seeing a local band play or painting clay pottery gives you something else to focus on to take pressure off of making conversation the entire time. Be willing to accommodate whatever time she suggests, as well as ideas that she has for what you can do on your date. Show her that you welcome and appreciate her input and sense of security."
