      "title": "Freeze your lemon before thawing and heating it.",
      "content": "Freeze your lemon before thawing and heating it. To get the maximum amount of juice from your lemon, freeze it before juicing. After freezing solid, take it out and let it thaw for 4-8 hours, until the rind reaches room temperature. When you heat it afterwards, the frozen juice will expand in the membrane of the fruit and break down. This will make the juicing process more efficient and give you the most juice possible. [1] X Research source It’s actually a lot harder to juice a lemon when it’s cold or at room temperature. Heating the lemon before cutting it is the best way to juice your fruit."

      "title": "Put a whole lemon in the microwave for 10-20 seconds.",
      "content": "Put a whole lemon in the microwave for 10-20 seconds. Place the lemon onto a paper towel or plate. Set the lemon in the center of a microwave. Heat the lemon on medium power for 10-20 seconds. [2] X Research source This is faster than soaking the lemon in warm water, but it’s a little riskier. If there are any tiny holes in the lemon’s rind, you’ll end up evaporating some of the juice. If your lemon is at room temperature, heat it for 10 seconds. If it was in the refrigerator, microwave it for 20 seconds."

      "title": "Soak the lemon in a bowl of warm water for 30-40 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the lemon in a bowl of warm water for 30-40 minutes. Grab a large bowl and fill it with hot water from your sink. Place your lemon in the bowl and let it sink to the bottom. Let the lemon soak for 30-40 minutes, replacing the water once every 10 minutes to ensure that it stays warm. [3] X Research source This is more time-consuming than microwaving your lemon, but you won’t cause any of the juice to evaporate."

      "title": "Roll the lemon around before cutting it to loosen the juices.",
      "content": "Roll the lemon around before cutting it to loosen the juices. Before you cut your lemon, roll it around on your countertop or cutting board. Set the lemon down so that it lays on its side. Place your palm on top and press down with moderate pressure. Then, roll the lemon back and forth between your palm and the hard surface. Do this for 30-45 seconds to soften the membrane inside the lemon. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your lemon and set it out on a cutting board.",
      "content": "Wash your lemon and set it out on a cutting board. Wash your hands with soap and water before rinsing the lemon under cool water. Shake it over the sink and dry it with a paper towel to remove the excess water. Set your fruit out on a clean cutting board. [5] X Research source This process can get kind of messy, so wash your hands to keep the juice free of contaminants."

    {
      "title": "Cut the lemon lengthwise in half through the center for a clean cut.",
      "content": "Cut the lemon lengthwise in half through the center for a clean cut. Grab a non-serrated chef’s knife with a sharp edge. Brace the lemon with your nondominant hand and place your knife directly over the center of your lemon. Puncture the lemon with the blade of your knife and remove your nondominant hand to get it out of the way. Press all the way through the center to cut it in half. [6] X Research source The idea here is to expose as much of the membrane as possible. When people cut a lemon horizontally, they end up trapping a lot of the juice near the stems."

    {
      "title": "Peel the lemon over a strainer to extract the juice.",
      "content": "Peel the lemon over a strainer to extract the juice. Hold the uncut lemon upright on your cutting board. Brace the lemon with your nondominant hand. Starting at the top of the lemon, cut into the rind at an angle away from you. Carve through the rind by moving your knife back and forth between the skin and the membrane. Repeat this process by rotating the lemon to remove the skin. [7] X Research source Peeling your lemon is a little messy, but it’s the only way to access the juice from every part of the lemon. Always cut away from your nondominant hand as you brace the lemon. If your lemon is too small or your hands are too big, you can hold it in place by gripping it with tongs."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze the lemon hard while holding it over a large bowl.",
      "content": "Squeeze the lemon hard while holding it over a large bowl. Take your lemon and hold it over a large bowl, just beneath the rim. Wrap your palm around the peeled lemon and point the exposed membrane down towards the bowl. Squeeze hard to remove the majority of the juice. With slices, hold the opposite ends between your index finger and thumb. Squeeze your fingers together to remove most of the juice. [8] X Research source Place a strainer over your bowl if you don’t want any of the membrane to end up in the juice. If your bowl is too small, you’ll end up sending lemon juice all over the place. Get a bowl that is at least 4-5 times the size of your lemon."

    {
      "title": "Use the tines of a fork to poke the membrane before squeezing again.",
      "content": "Use the tines of a fork to poke the membrane before squeezing again. After you’ve given your lemon an initial squeeze, grab a fork. Use the tines of the fork to poke holes in the surface of your lemon. Poke each section 5-10 times to break the membrane apart. Then, squeeze the lemon again to extract even more juice. [10] X Research source You can use a knife instead of a fork if you’d like. The tines of a fork make it easy to puncture the lemon multiple times at once, though."

      "title": "Use a hand juicer to extract the juice cleanly.",
      "content": "Use a hand juicer to extract the juice cleanly. A juicer is an excellent tool when it comes to extracting liquid from a fruit. Cut the lemon in half width-wise if you’re going to use a juicer. After cutting your lemon, place one half on top of your juicer with the skin facing up. Press down while twisting the lemon into the blades. Do this for 45-60 seconds to extract the juice. Repeat this process with the other half of your lemon. [11] X Research source Twist the top of the hand juicer off by hand to access the juice that collects underneath."
