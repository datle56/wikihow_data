      "content": "Apply a curl cream or leave-in conditioner to damp hair. This will enhance your curls and make them smoother. Look for products that say they hydrate and enhance curls on the label. Squirt a dollop of product into your palm and massage it into your hair, starting at the roots. While your hair shouldn't be dripping wet, it should be damp as if you just towel dried it. [1] X Research source If you need to brush your hair, do so before you put the product in your hair. Use a mousse that’s designed for curly hair or a regular leave-in conditioner. Consider using a heat protectant on your hair instead of mousse so the hair dryer won't cause damage."

      "content": "Use a diffuser attachment to dry your curls without causing frizz. If you just use the regular blow dryer nozzle to dry your naturally curly hair, it will likely create frizz. Place the diffuser on the end of your blow dryer nozzle so that it distributes the air more evenly. [2] X Research source If you don’t already have a diffuser attachment for your blow dryer, purchase one at a big box store or online. It’s best to use the diffuser on a medium to low setting."

      "content": "Start the diffuser at your roots to begin drying your hair. Place the diffuser near your roots, flipping your head over to make it easier and to give your hair more volume, if desired. Move the diffuser around your head, placing strands of hair at the nozzle to help enhance the curls. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dry your hair with the blow dryer until it’s 80% dry. If you use the diffuser on your hair until it’s completely dry, it could end up drying out your hair too much and causing frizz. Instead, use the diffuser to dry your hair until it’s mostly dry, and then let your hair finish drying naturally to preserve the curls you’ve created. [4] X Research source To see if your hair is mostly dry, do a touch test. If your hair feels just slightly damp in several places, it’s time to let it finish air drying."

      "title": "Clip up the top layer of your hair.",
      "content": "Clip up the top layer of your hair. Create 2 sections of hair, the top layer and the bottom layer, dividing the sections at the top of your ears. Use a hair tie or a large clip to gather the top layer of your hair and section it off on top of your head. This will make it easier to curl the bottom layer of your hair first. [5] X Research source If you have super thick hair, consider separating your hair into more than just 2 sections to make it easier to manage, such as 1 top layer and a bottom layer that's divided into 2 sections."

      "title": "Brush out your damp hair and apply a mousse or gel, if desired.",
      "content": "Brush out your damp hair and apply a mousse or gel, if desired. Use a brush or comb to detangle your hair and remove any knots to ensure you have smooth curls. If you normally use a product like mousse in your hair when you style it, squeeze out a tiny palmful of the product and distribute it through your hair evenly using your hands. [6] X Research source Towel dry your hair beforehand to ensure it's not dripping wet. A wide-tooth comb is best on damp hair to prevent breakage. As an alternative to using mousse or gel, spray a heat protectant on your hair to protect it from the blow dryer’s heat. It's not necessary to use both a heat protectant and mousse."

Choose your round brush depending on the type of curls you’re going for: a small round brush will produce tighter curls, while a large round brush produces bigger curls. [7] X Expert Source Noël Reid-Killings Celebrity Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 25 November 2020. Choose a section of hair from the bottom layer and place the brush right in the center.

Continue pulling and twisting using the round brush until you get to the end of the strand. This is what creates the curls in your hair.

Move the blow dryer as you move the brush down the length of hair, aiming the nozzle downwards to avoid frizz. [10] X Research source Use a medium heat setting as you dry your hair, and finish it off with a cold setting to set your curls. The blow dryer heats up the metal brush, helping to form the curls."
