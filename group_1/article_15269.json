You may experience hair loss if you have diabetes or lupus, a scalp infection such as ringworm, or trichotillomania (a hair-pulling disorder). Here are some other common medical conditions that cause hair loss: [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Alopecia areata: A small, circular area of sudden hair loss with no other symptoms. This type of hair loss may also impact facial hair, like beards and eyebrows. Telogen effluvium: A reversible type of hair loss that occurs after a particularly stressful event, like hospitalization, or as a result of a new medication. Tinea capitis: A fungal infection on your scalp that can cause scaly spots and pustules on your scalp and may result in permanent scarring hair loss. Cicatricial alopecia: A general term for hair loss that creates permanent scarring. The hair follicles left behind are destroyed and form scar tissue rather than growing more hair. This term covers several conditions that permanently damage hair follicles."

Hot oil treatments and perms can also cause hair to fall out. If scarring occurs, this hair loss can become permanent. [13] X Research source Foster says, “In the African American community, we do a lot of weaves and braids. [There’s] a lot of pulling, tight ponytails, tight styles, and a lot of chemicals.

If you’re experiencing hair loss, get tested to see if you’re deficient in iron, vitamin D, zinc, or other nutrients. Additionally, low calorie diets and protein restriction may also lead to hair loss because your hair isn’t getting the amino acids it needs to grow properly.

Use a detangler and avoid tugging when you brush or comb your hair, especially when it’s wet. Using a wide-tooth comb may help prevent your hair from getting pulled out as you comb it. Avoid harsh treatments like hot rollers, curling irons, hot oil treatments, or perms, and try to avoid hairstyles that use rubber bands, barrettes, braids, or anything else that puts tension on your hair. [21] X Research source Be aware that not all types of hair loss are preventable, like baldness caused by genetics. To improve your hair health, Foster says to “maintain moisture and shampoo often.” This won’t bring back the hair you’ve lost, but it can help you maintain the hair you have."
