Friendship breakups sometimes feel even harder than romantic breakups, so you’re allowed to feel sad, wallow, and grieve—regardless of what side of the conflict or breakup you were on. Take a few days or a couple of weeks to really be down in the dumps about the end of your friendship, then do whatever you’d normally do to get over a romantic ex. [2] X Research source Eat guilty pleasure treats , seek out quality time with your loved ones, spend time doing your favorite hobbies, watch your favorite tearjerker films, and get plenty of rest."

      "content": "Reframe the story to consider both sides—without beating yourself up. After a friendship breakup, you might be placing a lot of blame on yourself or on your friend, depending on the situation. Even if you were the one to dump a friend, you might feel a sense of shame for not being able to work through the issues in your relationship or having a so-called “failed” friendship. [3] X Research source Take a moment to step back and look at the situation objectively—try to see your ex-best friend’s perspective and how they might be feeling, and avoid beating yourself up over anything you did to lead to the dissolution of the friendship. While it’s great to take a look at areas you could work on in order to be a better friend, it does more harm than good to spiral about being a bad person or bad friend, especially if your best friend was the one to end things . Instead, reflect on how both you and your friend contributed to your conflicts, and keep in mind that everyone has relational traits they can work on—and no one has kept every single friend they’ve ever made in their life!"

      "content": "Write your friend a letter or email to create a sense of closure. To be happy, you will need to acknowledge your feelings, process them, and move on to the next stage of your life. Write a letter or email to your friend that expresses all of your feelings. Keep it brief but sincere—you might explain why the friendship ended, how it made you feel, and clearly state that it’s over. Try to use kind and neutral language—this letter isn’t the place for blaming, although you can express your anger and frustration. [4] X Research source If you feel it’s best not to contact your friend at all, you can write the letter and not send it, or instead perform a ritual to symbolize the end of the friendship and find some internal closure. For a ritual, take a meaningful item that your friend gave you and bury it, burn it, or throw it away."

Take a moment to appreciate the friends that they do have and all the ways they love and support you. Then, try to develop some burgeoning friendships or go out of your way to make new friends. Join a class, attend a Meetup activity, or ask a coworker or classmate to go for coffee. By putting more effort into your current and future relationships outside of your ex-bestie, you’ll begin to realize that there are other people for you to build great connections with.

Start with small changes like eating well and getting enough sleep. Do things that you enjoy doing, and allow yourself to do thoughtful things for someone else. [6] X Research source These tasks may feel daunting at first, but you’ll feel so much better once you do them. Go watch movies that you like, eat at your favorite restaurants, and try new things to see what makes you happiest. Don't be afraid to seek comfort in other people.

      "content": "Talk to a counselor or therapist about the situation. Friendship breakups are emotional, life-altering events, just like a romantic breakup. In these situations, it can be extremely helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor so that you can process your feelings and get help moving on. Whether you were the friend who initiated the breakup or not, you probably have lots of thoughts and feelings about the relationship bouncing around in your brain—a mental health professional can give you tools to help you calm these thoughts, recognize your triggers, and deal with your former friendship’s fallout. [7] X Research source It’s normal to have these sorts of spiraling thoughts after a major emotional event, especially one that you feel guilty or shameful about. These thoughts are called intrusive thoughts, which Dr. Brown explains as “unwelcome thoughts that permeate our conscious and subconscious.” [8] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022."

Take a step back from any activities that you used to do together, locales you used to frequent, or routines that heavily involved your ex-BFF. Mute or unfollow your friend on social media and decline (some) invites to group hangs with mutual friends. [9] X Research source There will be instances where you and your former friend have to co-exist, but limit contact with them as much as possible. If you go to school with this ex-friend, you might explain the situation to your teacher by saying that seating you together or pairing you together for projects may keep you from focusing on your task. Similarly, if you work together, you might speak to your HR department and ask to be placed in different departments or on different projects and shifts whenever possible."

      "content": "Set boundaries about and prepare yourself for future encounters. You might be in a situation where you have to see your ex-best friend often—such as if you work together, go to school together, or still have mutual friends. Or, maybe you run the risk of bumping into them by accident or even being asked by your former friend to rekindle the friendship later on. The best way to prepare for these situations is to decide now how you want to deal with your ex-bestie if and when you see them in the future or if they ever mention being friends again. If you have to see each other on a daily basis, you may want to tell your friend that you don’t feel comfortable speaking to or seeing them more than is strictly necessary. You can agree to both be polite, but don’t need to act overly friendly toward each other. If you have mutual friends, decide together what events and group hangs you’ll both be attending or alternating attendance at. You may also want to speak to your friends about the friendship breakup, but avoid sharing too many details with them or speaking badly about your former friend. If you think your ex-friend may ask to reconnect in the future, practice saying something like “I am flattered that you want to be my friend again, but I think it’s best we don’t go there.” Apply this to social media as well by declining any friend requests. You could send a private message with a similar statement."

If you can avoid talking altogether, that’s great. If not, say hello and be polite. [10] X Research source However, being polite doesn’t mean that you have to entertain your ex-best friend for a long period of time. Answer any questions briefly, if you’re comfortable answering them at all, and avoid asking questions in return—they only invite more conversation. If you see your old friend at a party and they ask how you have been, respond with something like “I’ve been doing well. I hope you are well, too.” If you run into your former friend at a school event, just acknowledge them and keep going on your way. Be polite if they try to start a casual conversation. For example, if they ask about your mom, say something like “My mom is doing well, thanks.\" The key here is not to add anything that might continue the conversation, such as \"I hope your parents are well\" or \"How is your mom?\""

If you have no interest in rekindling your friendship, do not be too friendly while interacting with your ex-best friend. Be polite in the moment, and leave that moment with closure. If you make it appear as though you miss your ex-best friend, then that opens the door to restarting the friendship back up. [11] X Research source You don't have to say “It’s great to see you,” or “See you again soon.” Unless they’re sincere, these polite phrases may give your ex-bestie false hope for reigniting the friendship. End the conversation with something like “I’m glad you're doing well, but if you’ll excuse me, I need to go talk to my date (or any other person you can think of). Goodbye.”"

Your former best friend may make the unfortunate choice to spread rumors about you or otherwise make nasty comments or rude gestures (whether to your face or behind your back). As hurt as you may feel by these behaviors, the key to dealing with this drama is to ignore it. [12] X Research source If these comments are being made to other people, “setting the record straight” or retaliating with similar comments about them will just have you playing into the dramatic feud between the two of you, and it may even jeopardize your other friendships and keep you from moving on. If the comments are made to your face, they’re probably done to get a reaction out of you. If you don’t give your ex-friend a reaction, they’ll probably leave you alone that much faster. Stay positive by realizing that what your ex-best friend says about you doesn’t actually define you. You should also allow yourself to feel good for ignoring the immaturity and letting the situation go."

Avoid gossiping about your ex-best friend to mutual friends—if you need to vent, do so with a family member, therapist, or friend that’s outside your mutual friend group. If you feel resentful that your friends are still friends with your ex-bestie, try to make your peace with it—unless your ex-BFF did something egregiously hurtful to you, they have every right to choose their own friends.

      "content": "Reflect on the factors that led to the breakup before deciding to reconnect. Before rekindling the friendship, consider why it ended in the first place. Sometimes, two people just need some time and space before coming back together to the same (or an even stronger) friendship. However, some friendships end due to crucial conflicts, so it’s important to ask yourself why you and your ex-best friend parted ways and if the circumstances around that decision have changed. Try asking yourself the following questions: [14] X Research source What was the reason for the breakup? Did your friendship end over deeper-rooted issues? Have those issues been resolved? If they haven’t (or you don’t think they will be), will anything be different this time around? If not, it may not be the right time for rekindling. Why do you want to reconnect? Do you think this person will contribute joy and happiness to your future self? Or do you just miss them because you feel nostalgic about the memories you shared together in the past? If the latter, it may not really help to reconnect. Are you prepared for rejection? If your friend tells you that they’re not interested in reconnecting, will you be deeply hurt? Will it start the friendship breakup healing process all over again? Or will you be able to accept their answer and continue to move forward? If you run the risk of getting really hurt, it may be better to press pause on rekindling."

      "content": "Friendship breakups can be difficult for a number of reasons. Many people describe their platonic breakups as equally (or even more) painful as their romantic ones. There are many complex reasons for this phenomenon, including a lost support system, shared history, and the societal norms around the value and longevity of friendships. [16] X Research source Loss of support: Close friends provide us with emotional support, so losing a friend often feels like losing a crucial confidante and key part of your life. Shared histories: Friends share mutual memories of secrets, trips, adventures, and losses. Losing a best friend can feel like they’re taking that history with them as well. Societal norms: Friendships aren’t treated with the same importance as romantic relationships—but they should be!
