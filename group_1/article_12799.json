      "content": "Download Visual Studio 2019 Community. Visual Studio is Microsoft's suite of development tools used to create software (programs/applications) for the Windows operating system. Fortunately, Microsoft provides a completely free version of Visual Studio named \"Community\" for those who collaborates in open-source projects or makes software as a hobby."

      "title": "Purchase a reverse engineering tool.",
      "content": "Purchase a reverse engineering tool. The process of reverse engineering is dissecting a program's internals in order to study its behavior or its code. In Roblox exploiting, this is necessary as you need to know how Roblox works in the inside in order to make hacks for its client. There are many reverse engineering tools out here, but the most prominent ones are IDA Pro and Binary Ninja."

    {
      "title": "Obtain a free reverse engineering tool.",
      "content": "Obtain a free reverse engineering tool. If you are unwilling to buy a reverse engineering tool, there there are always free reverse engineering tools out here, such as radare2 [1] X Research source or Ghidra [2] X Research source . However, it's important to note that their compatibility with your operating system is not guaranteed."

      "title": "Obtain a debugger.",
      "content": "Obtain a debugger. A debugger is used to locate and fix bugs in software, and in some cases, it's also used to modify a program's behavior. While not completely necessary, using a debugger may help you in diagnosing issues in either Roblox' s code or your very own exploits. If you purchased (or plan to purchase) IDA Pro, then you don't have to obtain a debugger as it already comes with one (the IDA debugger). Else, you can obtain a free debugger from the Internet, such as OllyDbg. Alternatively, if you have Cheat Engine (a popular cheating tool for video games), then you could also use its debugging features, albeit they're known for their instability."

      "title": "Learn a programming language that compiles to native code and is (preferably) natively compatible with the Windows operating system.",
      "content": "Learn a programming language that compiles to native code and is (preferably) natively compatible with the Windows operating system. High level languages such as Lua, Python or Go lacks the features and compatibility needed to develop Roblox exploits, whereas low level languages such as C/C++ and Ada can manipulate structures that are necessary to make a working hack. Additionally, considering that the Roblox client is programmed in C++, it would make sense for you to make your hacks in that language too (but it's not necessary). Check out resources like Free Code Camp , or consider attending a boot camp where you learn more about coding."

      "title": "Read up guides about software reverse engineering.",
      "content": "Read up guides about software reverse engineering. A lot of free ebooks/PDFs about reverse engineering can be found through a simple Google search. Some of them may require deep understanding of how a computer works, but if you narrow down your search to the subjects you specifically need to know (such as reversing C/C++ software), then you can find some relatively easy guides that'll help you understand the process of reverse engineering."

      "title": "Join a community focused on exploiting Roblox.",
      "content": "Join a community focused on exploiting Roblox . Roblox' s largest exploiting community out here, V3rmillion, contains plenty of guides related to developing and using Roblox exploits. While the majority of users on V3rmillion doesn't like people who are new to the exploiting scene, some can be highly welcoming and will help you in developing an exploit."

      "title": "Read the Roblox source code.",
      "content": "Read the Roblox source code. In January 2017, a copy of Roblox's source code was leaked to the public. If you were to obtain a copy of this source code, you could easily study how Roblox's engine works without having to reverse it through a reverse engineering utility. Beware that obtaining the aforementioned source code can cause issues, either legally or technically (as users were known to infect the source code with malware). However, if you stay around known safe communities, then the chances of finding a clean leak of the source code are higher than anywhere else on the Internet."

      "content": "Ask for help from competent reverse engineers and software developers. There is a collection of veteran programmers out here always willing to lend a hand in software development, especially exploit building. Alternatively, you could watch self-teaching videos on reverse engineering, such as the suite of videos offered by GuidedHacking [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a medium to release your exploit.",
      "content": "Find a medium to release your exploit. While some users want to keep their hack(s) to themselves, some want to release them to the public for the greater good of the Roblox exploiting community. You can easily locate a website to publish your exploit. In fact, any video-game-cheating websites is a good website to post your exploit on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up a community for your exploit.",
      "content": "Set up a community for your exploit. Some exploits that grew big formed a big, organized community usually revolving around a group chat. Communication software such as Discord is perfect for your exploit's users as they are free and usually bug-free, but keep in mind that exploiting communities aren't usually welcome on Discord and you may find yourself or your peers banned. Please note that you don't have to create a centralized community for your exploit: most free exploits out here doesn't grow big (this is almost always the case), so their creators usually doesn't spend their precious time creating a Discord server for their exploits."

      "title": "Bring it one step further and consider selling your exploit.",
      "content": "Bring it one step further and consider selling your exploit. Selling or releasing your exploit for free is entirely up to you, but if you happen to be low on funds, then selling your exploit might help you get some money. However, expect selling exploits to be akin to opening a lemonade stand: profits will be modest depending on your advertising strategy. A good price to sell an exploit in accordance with today's standards is within the range of $15 to $20. Take note that selling an overpriced exploit will always decrease sales, so make sure your exploit's price is adjusted depending on your hack's capabilities."
