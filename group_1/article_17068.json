      "content": "Sign up on a couple of dating sites. Sites like eHarmony, OkCupid, Hinge, and Match.com are good places to start if you haven't done much online dating. These tend to draw a broad crowd, so you'll find a mix of people who are looking for a long-term relationship and people who are just dating casually. On the other hand, it's probably better to avoid sites like Tinder or Grindr, where people are mostly looking to hook up. [1] X Research source If finding a partner who shares your faith is important, consider using a site like Christian Mingle, Catholic Match, Jdate (for Jewish singles), or Muslima. If you're over 50, you might use a site like OurTime or Silver Singles. Dating sites and apps can take up a lot of your time, so it's best to only sign up for about 1-3 sites."

      "content": "Make a profile that tells people you're looking for long-time love. Create a short description of yourself that explains a little about you and what you're looking for. Be open about the fact that you're looking for a serious partnership, and share a few of your interests that show why you're fun and unique. [2] X Research source Be yourself—if you're not athletic, don't pretend to be just because you'd like a partner with a muscular build! Also, upload a couple of pictures so matches can see what you look like. You can never go wrong with a headshot where you have an open, friendly smile. Just avoid pictures that are risque or revealing, since they don't really give the impression that you're looking for a serious relationship. Include a few things you're really passionate about, like that you love mountain climbing or going to museums on the weekends."

What would it look like if you found someone perfectly compatible with you? Then, when you're chatting with people online, try to get a feel for how well they match up with your wish list. [3] X Research source If having a family is really important to you, look for someone who's also hoping to settle down and have kids. Don't be too specific when it comes to your partner's looks. For instance, your life partner might be a little taller or shorter than you imagined, and they might have blonde hair instead of brown."

Once your profile is all set up, browse potential matches and send a quick message to the people who seem interesting to you. This is where you'll really catch the eye of a match, so be playful and flirtatious , and ask thoughtful questions that will help you get to know the person better. [4] X Research source Don't be afraid to do a little sleuthing. For instance, you might do a reverse image search to make sure the person is really using their own picture and not someone else's.

      "content": "Meet up in public if you find someone you vibe with. Messaging online is fine, but the best way to really get to know someone is to hang out with them in person. Once you've chatted back and forth a couple of times, make plans to go on a date and see how you get along in person. Because you're dealing with someone you don't know, it's important to take extra safety precautions when you meet in person. Agree on a place the two of you can meet up, like a coffee shop, bar, or public park. Don't have them come to your house or pick you up from work until you've met a few times and you're sure you're comfortable with that.

[7] X Research source It's okay if they don't necessarily tick every single box—you might want someone who loves to read, but your date might be really into podcasts instead. That still shows that they have a passion for learning new things, though, so they might be a better match than you thought at first. [8] X Research source Don't budge on really important things, though. If you want someone who's career-focused, you probably shouldn't spend much time with someone who can't hold down a job."

Do they make you feel comfortable? Do they make you laugh? Do you feel like you can really be yourself? These are the kinds of things that are going to really determine whether your relationship will work in the long run. [9] X Research source Don't necessarily base your whole decision off the first date. Your match might be a little nervous or shy when they first meet you, which could throw off the chemistry.

      "content": "Build trust gradually. When you're learning whether you can trust someone, it's important to pay close attention to their actions—not just the things they say. As you start getting to know your potential match better, really notice whether they're reliable. If you notice that they follow up on the things they say they do and they communicate openly with you, it's probably okay to start opening up to them.

If they seem really apologetic and they don't make a habit of it, it's probably not a deal-breaker."
