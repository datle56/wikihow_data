      "title": "Get the highest quality shark meat available.",
      "content": "Get the highest quality shark meat available. Shark meat tends to spoil quickly and can be ruined if it isn’t handled properly. Choose shark meat with moist, translucent flesh. Make sure it isn’t flaky. [3] X Research source Buy shark from reputable supermarkets and fishmongers to ensure you get the best quality."

      "title": "Soak the meat in milk for 4 hours.",
      "content": "Soak the meat in milk for 4 hours. Set the shark meat in a refrigerator-safe dish and submerge it in milk. Allowing it to soak eliminates the smell of ammonia and gamey flavor that a lot of fresh catches have. If you buy the shark from a quality source, it may have already been treated. If you don’t smell any ammonia, you may not need to soak the meat, although you can still do so to make sure the meat is at its best. [4] X Research source Fresh-caught shark needs to be soaked right after it is cleaned, or else the meat can become inedible. It doesn’t really matter what type of milk you use. Most people use any type of cow’s milk or buttermilk, but alternatives like soy milk or even lemon juice do well in a pinch. Plain milk is less acidic than buttermilk and lemon juice, so it can be a good option if you aren't making a ceviche."

      "title": "Trim off the dark meat and skin with a paring knife.",
      "content": "Trim off the dark meat and skin with a paring knife. The dark meat comes from the areas around the shark’s skin. It includes blood lines and has a strong, unpleasant taste. Most recipes don’t call for shark skin, so you can remove it as well. If you’re buying shark from a store, chances are someone took care of this ahead of time, so you don’t need to worry about it. [5] X Research source You can remove the skin after you cook the meat. Leaving the skin on may help the meat retain more moisture."

      "title": "Cut the shark into steaks between 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) thick.",
      "content": "Cut the shark into steaks between 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) thick. Slice the shark horizontally with a sharp knife to divide it up into smaller pieces. Avoid cutting the shark too thick or too thin. Shark meat is lean, so it can easily dry out when you cook it. [6] X Research source Marinating the shark after you slice it can help prevent it from drying out. Although steaks are a common way to cook and eat shark, you can also chop the steaks up into smaller pieces, such as when making kebabs or a ceviche."

      "title": "Mix a marinade to season the shark.",
      "content": "Mix a marinade to season the shark. You have plenty of options when adding flavor to grilled shark. For a simple but flavorful marinade, try combining 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of orange juice with 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of soy sauce and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of lemon juice. Stir in 1 clove of minced garlic, ¼ teaspoon (0.57 g) of pepper, and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil. [7] X Research source Choose a bowl big enough to hold the shark. You can also pour the marinade into resealable bags with the shark. Some other seasoning options include paprika, ginger, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and rice wine vinegar. For simpler steaks, rub them with olive oil, then sprinkle on salt and pepper. You can skip the marinade and throw them onto the grill right away. Try serving the shark with a sauce, such as a mango salsa. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Marinate the shark in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Put the shark pieces in the marinade, making sure they are completely covered. Store the bowl in the refrigerator. For the best results, turn the shark pieces in the marinade after 15 minutes. [9] X Research source Expect to need the whole 30 minutes for the marinade to seep into the meat. You can leave the shark in the marinade for 1 or 2 hours to give it more flavor."

      "content": "Preheat an oiled grill on a medium setting. Take out the grate first, then rub or spray it with olive oil. A medium heat setting is about 350 °F (177 °C). To test the grill, hold your hand about 4 in (10 cm) over the grate. At the correct temperature, you will be able to hold your hand there for only 3 to 4 seconds. [10] X Research source If the grill gets too hot, it can scorch or dry out the meat. Watch the shark carefully if you use a different temperature."

      "title": "Grill the shark for 5 to 6 minutes per side.",
      "content": "Grill the shark for 5 to 6 minutes per side. Leave the shark on the grill without moving it until you need to flip it. Use tongs or a spatula to carefully turn the shark over. When it is done cooking, it will be white and flaky. You can test it by cutting into it or touching it with a fork. The length of time you need to cook the shark may vary depending on your grill and the thickness of the steak. Expect a 1 in (2.5 cm)-thick steak to take about 5 minutes per side."

      "content": "Refrigerate the shark in a bag with lemon slices for 30 minutes. Set the shark pieces in the bag, then top them with a few lemon slices. Store the pieces, giving them plenty of time to absorb the lemon juice. [12] X Research source The shark’s age when it is caught can affect how it tastes. Older sharks tend to have a gamey flavor. Lemons help neutralize the unpleasant flavor and prepare the meat for searing."

      "content": "Toss the shark cubes with citrus juice and other seasonings. Add the shark pieces to a glass or ceramic casserole dish. For a basic ceviche, try using 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of both lime and lemon juice. Also add ½ a cup (75 g) of diced red onions and 1 cup (200 g) of chopped tomatoes. For seasonings, mix in 1 chopped serrano chili, 2 teaspoons (11.38 g) of salt, 1 teaspoon (1.0 g) of oregano, and 1 teaspoon (1.80 g) of cayenne pepper. [22] X Research source You can add or leave out additional ingredients. For instance, add cilantro for flavoring or leave out the cayenne pepper if you don’t like spicy food. In a ceviche, the acid in the citrus juices breaks down and cures shark meat similar to the way heat does without cooking it. Avoid making ceviche if you aren’t comfortable eating raw meat."

      "content": "Refrigerate the leftovers for about 1 day. Remove the shark pieces from the dish, storing them separately. Rinse off the shark pieces to stop them from continuing to marinate. Then, move the leftovers into resealable plastic bags or containers as soon as possible. Ceviche made from fresh fish may last as long as 3 days, but throw the ceviche away if it starts smelling rancid or looks slimy. [26] X Research source Unfortunately freezing a ceviche doesn’t work too well. The shark tends to lose its texture, although it will still be edible."
