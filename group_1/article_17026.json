Some states prohibit the use of criminal records. Hawaii, for example, prohibits any inquiry into criminal history until after the employer has extended a conditional offer. Massachusetts also prohibits employers from even asking about criminal history on an initial job application. The use of an applicant’s credit history may also be limited or prohibited.
