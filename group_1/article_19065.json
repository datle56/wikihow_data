      "title": "Get your Sims inspired.",
      "content": "Get your Sims inspired. Inspired Sims earn more Simoleons when they complete tasks. You can inspire Sims by fulfilling their needs: Select a Sim to see their needs. Take note of the bars that are low. Use the fridge to address Hunger. Use the TV or computer to address Fun. Use your pet, other Sims, or the phone to address Social."

      "title": "Caffeinate your Sims.",
      "content": "Caffeinate your Sims. A large chunk of the day is often lost because your Sims have to rest; you can change this by allowing them to drink coffee. When your Sims drink coffee, they can work through the night rather than resting."

      "title": "Use the Sim's dog to dig up money and Lifestyle Points.",
      "content": "Use the Sim's dog to dig up money and Lifestyle Points. After the dog digs up Lifestyle Points, praise him so he knows that he will get praised if he digs up Lifestyle Points. This will mean more rewards for you later. You can also buy the bone for 2LP for your dog. It will get you Simoleons and LPs faster. The more expensive your cat or dog is, the faster it will gather Simoleons and LP. If your dog doesn't have the dig/pounce sign on it, get a toddler to play with it or an adult to praise it. Do this twice and it should run or slowly walk away. Usually this will lead it to find something, and repeating the process can get you even more stuff."

    {
      "title": "Go to work.",
      "content": "Go to work. When your Sims go to work, they earn money, which they keep. Similarly, when you go to work regularly, you get promoted, which will earn more Simoleons and XP after a work day. Working regularly will help you achieve a large number of the goals in the game as well."

      "title": "Grow vegetables.",
      "content": "Grow vegetables. When they are completed, you will earn more money depending on what you grew. Overnight, while you're asleep, have your Sims gardening (all the ones who aren't at work or busy). If you garden 7 or 8 hour crops at night, you'll wake up to lots of Simoleons and XP. Make sure they are inspired because they'll earn 1.5X the Simoleons. Try planting bell pepper seeds, as bell pepper seeds are free and it only takes 30 seconds for them to grow and be ready to sell! After they are ready you can sell them for a few Simoleons. Carrots are another good choice when farming Simoleons. You can dedicate one lot in your town to gardening. Place at least one garden on the lot per Sim in your town, get all or most of your Sims inspired at once, and take them all to the lot to garden."

      "content": "Save your Simoleons and LP. Be smart about what you buy. Don't waste your money on anything you won't use. Like in real life, this habit is key to a successful budget. Save items you can reuse. For example, put a cradle in the inventory once a baby is born; other couples can use it and it saves money so you don't have to buy a new one. Be careful of spending real money. Don't waste your real money for Simoleons and LPs. You can earn plenty if you're patient, and spending real money on this can become a habit."
