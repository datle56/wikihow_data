By inserting the timeout command into your batch file, you can prompt the batch file to wait a specified number of seconds (or for a key press) before proceeding. [1] X Research source This command is available on all modern versions of windows, including Windows 10 . timeout /t <timeoutinseconds> [/nobreak] . [2] X Research source To pause for 30 seconds and prevent the user from interrupting the pause with a keystroke, you'd enter timeout /t 30 /nobreak . [3] X Research source The user will see Waiting for 30 seconds, press CTRL+C to quit ... To delay 100 seconds and allow the user to interrupt the delay, you'd use timeout /t 100 . The user will see Waiting for 100 seconds, press a key to continue ... To delay indefinitely until a user enters a keystroke, use timeout /t -1 . The user will see Press any key to continue … If you don't want to display a message to the user during the delay, add >nul to the end of your timeout command."

This simple command doesn't require any flags and you can place it anywhere in your script to prevent further action. When the pause command runs in the batch file, the user will see Press any key to continue . . . on a new line. When the user presses a key, the script continues. [4] X Research source You might use pause right before a section of the batch file that you might not want to process, or before providing instructions to the user to insert a disk before continuing. [5] X Research source At the pause, you can stop the batch program completely by pressing Ctrl + C and then Y ."

      "content": "Use ping to delay the next command in the script until a ping is complete. You can add a ping anywhere in your batch file, enter any hostname or IP address (including a nonexistent address), and specify the time in milliseconds to delay the next command. You'll also be able to hide the output of the ping so the user won't see what's happening in the background. [6] X Research source ping /n 1 /w <timeout in milliseconds> localhost >nul Ping has many more available flags, but for the purpose of delaying a batch file, you'll only need to use a few. In this case, we'll ping ourselves by using localhost as our destination. To pause quietly for 10 seconds, you'd use ping /n 1 /w 10000 localhost >nul"

      "content": "Use the choice command to delay until a user selects an option from a list. You can customize the list of choices, use the default options of Y or N , or choose not to display any choices at all and simply delay your script for a specific period of time. [7] X Research source choice [/c [<choice1><choice2><…>]] [/n] [/cs] [/t <seconds> /d <choice>] [/m <text>] /c <choice1><choice2><…> : Specifies the choices you'd like to create, which can include a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and ASCII characters 128-254. /t <seconds> : Use this flag to specify how many seconds to wait before the default choice is selected. You can set this value to any number between 0 (which instantly selects the default choice) and 9999. /d <choice> : Specifies the default choice from the list of choices created with /c. /n (optional) : hides the list of choices, but still allows the user to select one. /m <text> (optional): displays a message before the choice list. If you don't include this flag but don't hide the choice list, the choices will still be displayed. /cs (optional): This specifies that choices are case-sensitive, which is important if you want to assign different functions to capital and lowercase letters. To create a delay with CHOICE without displaying a message or forcing the user to choose something, use rem | choice /c:AB /T:A,30 >nul . This command simply delays the batch file for 30 seconds (similar to using Timeout with no message), provides no choices to the user, and continues after the delay. You can replace 30 with any value up to 9999 (in seconds)."

This command will not work in any newer versions of Windows starting with Windows Vista, but is the easiest way to add wait time to batch files running on older systems. sleep <seconds> The sleep command only requires the number of seconds you want to delay the batch file. For example, to wait 30 seconds before continuing, you'd use sleep 30 ."
