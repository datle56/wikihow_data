During the early stages of a career, employers largely judge you based on your educational background. Plus, having that background will enable you to get a higher salary at the start of your career and in the long run.

This gives you even more money to live on in the here and now while setting aside a little with each paycheck. Basically, the more income you have access to, the more you can stockpile your wealth for the future. [3] X Research source Even if you don’t get a proper “job” as your second source of income, you could start up a small side hustle and devote several hours each week to it. Consider your skills and talents. You could start a side hustle doing odd jobs, taking art commissions, or delivering food."

If you’re still picking your career or feel your current career isn’t getting you enough money, you might want to consider choosing a new career that typically pays well.

In most cases, they make upwards of $135,000 per year. Lawyers top out at just above $130,000 per year, making it a lucrative field if you can put in the time. IT managers and software engineers can make around $125,000 per year. If you're good at programming and a whiz at computers, consider this very well-compensated field."

You can increase your pay and experience different corporate cultures by changing your environment. Don't be afraid to do this several times! If you're a valued employee, your current employer may offer you a raise or other benefits to keep you. [5] X Research source On the other hand, you might be able to get an entry-level job and then work your way up the ranks if you work for a company that pays well and typically promotes internally. Stick it out at your current job if you’re comfortable and see the potential for the future, but don’t be afraid to look for something better if you’d rather be doing something else! Think about the best place to live, too. Certain careers are easier to pursue in specific areas. For example, entertainment jobs are usually numerous in cities like New York and Los Angeles."

      "content": "Set financial goals and decide how much you want to save. The first step to saving money is making a plan. Start by asking yourself questions to determine your exact financial goals. When do you want to retire? Are you saving up for things like a family or a child? What do you want to do once you’re wealthy? Set your goals and figure out roughly how much money you need to save to fulfill your idea of “rich.” [6] X Research source When determining how much money you want to accumulate, be sure to make an emergency fund one of your goals if you don’t already have one. Emergency funds typically equal 3 to 6 months of living expenses. Should anything happen, like the loss of a job or a medical emergency—they allow you to pay for what you need without experiencing financial turmoil."

Calculate 15% of each paycheck and commit to saving that amount every time you’re paid. Then, see if you can start saving even more as time goes on; 15% is a good minimum, but 20% of your total income is an even better goal. [7] X Research source Getting rich usually isn’t an immediate process; it’s the result of dedicating saving, budgeting, and investing. The more you save now, the more you’ll have later! Remember: it can be tempting to buy fun things with the leftover money in your paychecks, but being a little more conservative and focusing on savings can help you get rich in the long run."

Debt will keep draining your money as you make it, making it pretty hard to get rich as long as you have any debt attached to your name. If you have any debt, make paying it off one of your top financial priorities. Once you’re debt-free, do your best to stay that way for the foreseeable future! [10] X Research source Try to use cash (or debit) more than you use a credit card. People who use credit cards for purchases often end up spending more money, and it’s easy to get into debt if you can’t pay off your card every month. If you do keep using a credit card regularly, try to pay off the full balance each month on time to gain interest-free credit and avoid late fees. Consider refinancing your home if you have a large 30-year mortgage, take on a 15-year mortgage instead. That way, you can pay off your debt faster and save money by paying fewer interest fees."

[11] X Research source If you’re looking for dramatic ways to reduce your living expenses, consider downgrading your car or house. You might be able to make do with an apartment instead of a house or buy a used car instead of a new one. Avoid going to Starbucks every morning.

It's hard enough to make a living without spending your hard-earned cash on things that don’t matter and won’t help you get ahead. Reevaluate the things you spend money on, and work on managing your money wisely . Figure out when things are truly “worth it” and when it’s just frivolous spending. [13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, things like casinos and lottery tickets are statistically unlikely to help you get rich and are more likely to drain your wallet over time. Consider whether something like a first-class plane ticket is worth the extra $1,000 (or more). Sure, it’s comfortable, but you’ll reach your destination just fine in coach—and you can save that extra money. Avoid purchases that depreciate rapidly—like buying a new car worth $50,000 or more. That can be a waste because it won’t be worth half that much in 5 years; a cheaper car can serve you just as well and be more financially efficient."

You might not instinctively associate “retirement funds” with “getting rich,” but the truth is, if you save (and invest) your money wisely, you can retire with millions!

The tax treatment they provide will help you save money faster. [14] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source Roth IRAs are especially valuable. Working individuals can contribute an annual sum of up to $5,500 in their Roth IRA, and their money then gathers compound interest . So, if you wait until retirement age to take money out of your Roth IRA, it won’t be taxed because it was already taxed when you first earned it. Basically, you’ll make a ton of money without having to give any away! Set up a Roth IRA account as soon as possible, even if you can’t contribute much money at first. The earlier you start investing, the more money you’ll have later."

Be sure to take advantage of it if your employer offers. Don’t rely entirely on Social Security for your retirement. Social Security was never designed to be the only resource for retirees in their later years, so it’s important for you to invest your own money too!"

      "content": "Put money in the stock market. Invest money in stocks , bonds, or other vehicles of investment that’ll give you an annual return on investment (ROI) large enough to last you through retirement. Choose wisely: look for good stocks and passive funds with solid fundamentals and excellent leadership in industries that are poised to grow in the future. Then, let your stock sit and make you money over time. For instance, if you have one million dollars invested and you get a reliable 7% ROI, that's $70,000 per year, less inflation. If you're starting with a small amount of money to invest, index funds might be a good option for you, as they have low fees and can give you some relatively safe exposure to the stock market. Don't be fooled by day traders who promise you quick profits. Buying and selling dozens of stocks every day is essentially gambling. If you make a few bad trades — which is easy to do — you can lose a lot of money."
