Clean the area and then line it with something that’s slightly soft and won't scratch your glass, like a piece of cardboard, cork, or even a towel. [1] X Research source Avoid working over the carpet so you don’t get glass shards on the floor if your piece of glass shatters. For their safety, keep pets and children away from your workspace and materials."

      "content": "Measure and mark the desired score line. The experts at Bicycle Glass recommend measuring carefully and then marking the score line along the entire length of the glass because the score must run from one edge of the glass to the other to prevent breakage. Write on the glass with a marker (preferably with a straight edge if cutting a straight line). Or, mark your line on paper and place the glass on top of the paper. [3] X Research source Keep lines under 2 feet (61 cm). Scores longer than 2 feet (61 cm) have a high failure rate when breaking. Make sure your marks leave about 6 inches (15 cm) of glass on each side to grip and break. If you cut smaller pieces, use special tools, like grozer pliers, to break off glass you can't get a hold of."

      "title": "Lay out a straight edge along the mark you made on the glass.",
      "content": "Lay out a straight edge along the mark you made on the glass. Use a yardstick or a normal desk ruler with a thick enough profile that it won't catch on the cutting wheel. The cutting wheel is offset by about ⅛ inch (3 mm), so compensate for this as you line up your straight edge. [4] X Research source Use tape to secure the straight edge to the glass so it doesn’t slip as you’re making the cut. If you don’t have a straight edge, place masking tape along the edge of your mark to help you gauge your cut."

      "title": "Dip the glass cutter in cutting oil and grasp it like a pencil.",
      "content": "Dip the glass cutter in cutting oil and grasp it like a pencil. The experts at Bicycle Glass say glass cutters are the most straightforward way to cut plate glass. Oiling the glass cutter with a cutting oil creates a smoother score line. [5] X Research source Glass cutters are about the size of a pencil and use a diamond or a hardened wheel to mark a score into the glass so it breaks cleanly along a line."

      "title": "Use even pressure to roll the glass cutter’s wheel along your mark.",
      "content": "Use even pressure to roll the glass cutter’s wheel along your mark. Pull the cutter along the surface in one long motion, listening for a smooth sound like ripping silk. A gritty sound means that you’re using too much pressure or that you didn’t oil your cutter. The less sound you make, the cleaner your score will be. [6] X Research source Aim to make a uniform score along the entire length of the glass. If you push too hard (a very common mistake), your cut gets \"hot,\" meaning that it snaps and pops. This creates microscopic imperfections in your score, and the glass won’t break cleanly. Do not run back and forth over the line if you miss a spot. Wipe a little of the oil away to check that your score is barely visible. Carbide scribes and large nails are also capable of cutting a straight line in glass and can be handy if you don’t have a glass cutter. After cleaning and marking your glass, place a straight edge along your mark. Dip the tip of the scribe or nail in cutting oil. Then, hold the scribe or nail at a 45-degree angle as you score the glass using the mark and straight edge as a guide."

      "title": "Grasp each side of the cut carefully and apply light pressure.",
      "content": "Grasp each side of the cut carefully and apply light pressure. Wearing safety gloves, hold the glass as if you were trying to break a potato chip in half with two hands. Bicycle Glass recommends applying minor pressure from the wrist to break the glass along your score line. Simply twist your wrists (your right wrist will turn clockwise and your left will turn counterclockwise) without moving your elbow. Alternatively, place the glass so the score line is along the edge of a table. Use one hand to hold the glass against the table and the other to grasp the free edge. Applying gentle, even pressure, snap the glass. [7] X Research source Brown also recommends putting a pencil underneath the glass along the score line and then pressing it down so you're creating a fulcrum point for the glass to snap along the score line. Using the tapper on the opposite end of your glass gutter to tap the backside of the glass along the line you scored before you try to snap it helps it break more easily. When the glass breaks, it may simply start as a \"run.\" If it only runs an inch or so, apply a little more twisting pressure and it will continue to run. This method is also used to cut plexiglass ."

      "title": "Use fine sandpaper or a glass grinding stone to remove the sharp edge.",
      "content": "Use fine sandpaper or a glass grinding stone to remove the sharp edge. This edge was created along your score line and can be very sharp. Not only does smoothing glass edges reduces the chances of being cut, looks more professional, is less likely to chip along the edges, and has some added strength. [8] X Research source The experts at Bicycle Glass recommend starting with a rougher grinding surface and moving to finer surfaces as you grind the glass. 80-grit grinding stones and sandpaper are a good place to start for the initial rough grinding. 400-grit and up are good for creating a smoother finish."

Place a towel or piece of cardboard on the surface and put the glass on top to prevent scratches. Mark your lines with a marker or set your glass over your pattern. [9] X Research source This method is frequently used for cutting stained glass. It’s also possible to cut glass with a circle cutter . A glass circle cutter has a suction cup that sticks to the glass with a scoring tip on an adjustable arm."

      "content": "Use your glass cutter freehand to score along the mark. Move your hand as smoothly as possible to keep the score even along the entire curve. This helps you make a clean break. [10] X Research source Don’t forget to dip your glass cutter in cutting oil before making the cut. To cut an inside curve, score a series of shallow arcs inside the one you just made. Make each arc increasingly deeper until you get close to your original cut. [11] X Research source For a sharp outside curve, make a series of straight marks that start at different places on the curve and skew off at a tangent outside the piece all the way to the edge of the glass. These score marks look like sun rays coming off your curve. Use grozing pliers to remove the smaller pieces of glass until you reach the first cut you made. Place the edge of the grozer pliers along the edge of each score line and gently tug the smaller piece to remove it. [12] X Research source Once you reach the first cut, use the pliers to “nibble” along the edge of the score line to remove even smaller sections of the glass. [13] X Research source"

If your score is too close to the edge of a piece of glass, it may crack to the edge instead of along your score because that is the easiest path for the run to take.

Holding one end against the glass, wrap the string around the glass bottle or jar. Tie the two ends so the string stays on the jar but is loose enough to work it off. [16] X Research source Don’t use wool or acrylic. Wool is mildly flame retardant, and acrylic yarn will melt instead of burn."

As the string burns, gently rotate the jar to help the fire spread evenly. [18] X Research source Remember to wear protective gloves, goggles, and a mask to keep your skin, eyes, and lungs safe. Alternatively, Brown recommends hot popping a bottle to cut it. Score a line around the glass bottle. Then, spin it around using a record player or lazy susan while applying a butane torch to the score line."

When you notice the string is nearly burned out, place it into a bucket of ice water. The sudden change in temperature causes the glass to break along the string, cutting the glass bottle or jar. [19] X Research source The experts at Bicycle Glass recommend scoring the bottle or jar before attempting to cut it using heat. “There's no guarantee that method will always be successful. And a lot of it depends on how well the glass was sealed in the first place.”"

Hold the bottle steady and place the edge of the cutting wheel along the mark. Try to keep the other edge of the cutting wheel in the running water as much as possible. [22] X Research source It’s not necessary to keep the whole cutting wheel or the bottle in the water. Just skim the water along the most convenient edge of the wheel. Water helps the cutting wheel cut the glass more efficiently. Continue cutting around the bottle until you’ve moved around the entire circumference. Remember to wear protective gear to keep your eyes, lungs, and skin protected while cutting glass."

For example, diamonds (10 Mohs) and quartz (7 Mohs) are capable of cutting glass. [28] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Additionally, people also cut glass with tools made of tungsten carbide and hardened steel. Some believe it’s possible to cut glass with paper, but this is a myth. It may be possible to use boiling water to help cut a glass bottle. After scoring a line around the bottle, pour boiling water over the score line and then dunk the botting in cold water. However, this isn’t a reliable way to cut glass. If the boiling water runs past the area of the score line, it may warm the rest of the bottle, which causes it to shatter when placed in cold water. Razor blades are sometimes able to scratch glass, but they aren’t strong enough to make a score line."

      "title": "What are the notches on a glass cutter for?",
      "content": "What are the notches on a glass cutter for? After you score the glass, the 3 grooves at the end of a glass cutter help you snap smaller slivers of glass off the edge of a larger piece. They’re helpful if the piece you’re cutting off is too narrow to snap along the score line using your hands or the edge of a table. [29] X Research source After scoring, simply fit the edge of the glass into one of the notches and push the handle of the glass cutter toward the edge as leverage to break the glass along the score line."
