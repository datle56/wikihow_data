      "title": "Keep batteries out of your regular recycling bin.",
      "content": "Keep batteries out of your regular recycling bin. Household batteries are recycled separately from other items. Mixing batteries in with other recyclables can result in a fire, as the battery can spark. You'll need to take your batteries to a facility that collects batteries. Even a battery that has lost its charge can spark. If youâ€™re recycling an item that contains rechargeable batteries, like a cell phone or laptop, you may need to take the batteries out first and recycle them separately."

      "content": "Search for a store that collects lithium batteries for a convenient option. Many chain and big box stores recycle various types of batteries on behalf of customers. Stores often collect batteries for free, but some charge a small fee for certain types of lithium batteries. These services are meant to help with household waste, so the stores may limit how many batteries you can turn in at a time. You can search for a store or recycling center in your area here: https://earth911.com/ . Several chain stores that sell electronics or batteries collect lithium batteries for recycling, including the following: Best Buy Staples Lowes Home Depot"

      "content": "Ask your local library or community center about battery collection. Some libraries and community centers have battery collection bins or host battery collection events. While not all areas offer this service, it's a good idea to check with your local library or community center. [1] X Research source For example, they may have a special recycling bin where you can deposit batteries. They may collect the batteries on certain days, so check in advance to make sure your batteries will be collected."

      "title": "Take them to a household hazardous waste center if your area has one.",
      "content": "Take them to a household hazardous waste center if your area has one. Some local governments collect household hazardous waste from citizens, which includes lithium batteries. In some cases, they may have a designated center that collects the items year-round, which is called a household hazardous waste center. However, some areas host recurring collection events for hazardous waste. You can find your local center by visiting your state or local government's website. If your area doesn't have a household hazardous waste center, see if your local or regional government hosts a Household Hazardous Waste Collection event. These events often occur regularly, such as annually. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider using a mail-in program if it's more convenient. A mail-in program can be a great option if you regularly need to recycle lithium batteries. For example, you might work in an office that uses lithium batteries. Mail-in programs are also helpful if you don't live close to a recycling collection center. [3] X Research source You may be able to mail in the battery to the manufacturer. To find a mail-in program, search online for an option that meets your needs. For example, you might try https://biggreenbox.com/ or https://www.wm.com/us/en/home/recycle-by-mail . You may need to purchase supplies to mail in your batteries, which you can buy online from recycling sites."

      "content": "Call to confirm lithium batteries are accepted and check for fees. Some collection sites only collect certain types of batteries, so check to make sure the site collects lithium batteries. Although some centers will take your batteries for free, lithium and lithium-ion batteries sometimes require a fee. If the center collects a fee, check with other collection sites to see if there is a free option in your area."

      "title": "Tape over the ends of your battery using clear or electrical tape.",
      "content": "Tape over the ends of your battery using clear or electrical tape. Since dead batteries can still spark, the ends of the battery can be dangerous. Tape helps prevent sparking or the discharge of energy. As soon as you remove the battery from your electronic item, cover the ends in tape. [4] X Research source You can safely layer the tape over the ends."

      "title": "Place your battery in a plastic bag, as an alternative.",
      "content": "Place your battery in a plastic bag, as an alternative. You can tape it prior to bagging it, but this isn't necessary. It's best to leave the bag unsealed if you store it, as the battery can give off gases. If you're mailing it, seal each battery in a separate bag. [5] X Research source If you're leaving the bag unsealed, wrap it around the battery to fully cover the battery."

      "title": "Put them in a vented plastic container or cardboard box, if storing.",
      "content": "Put them in a vented plastic container or cardboard box, if storing. Batteries often give off gases, so they should not be stored in an airtight container. Choose a box that allows air to escape, or put the batteries in a cardboard box. You can still close the box, just make sure it's not sealed."
