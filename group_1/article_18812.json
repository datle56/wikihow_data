      "title": "Exercise your ankles.",
      "content": "Exercise your ankles. By working your ankles out, you’ll build ankle strength and flexibility. Increased strength and flexibility will help you start faster and turn quicker. To accomplish this, commit to exercises like: Skipping rope Standing on one leg Squats Ankle rockers. Do this by sitting on the back of your ankles, leaning back, and lifting your knees upward. Try to hold this for about a minute or two. Do several repetitions. Ankle rotations. Simply rotate your ankles around in circles 15 to 20 times. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Balance your kick.",
      "content": "Balance your kick. A balanced kick will help you move through the water in a much more consistent fashion. To improve your kick, commit to a vertical kicking training routine. To do this, stand in a moderately deep part of the pool and work on your swimming kick while standing up. To further improve the balance of your kick: Use a weight belt or drag sox. Try kicking with swim fins. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Kick backwards.",
      "content": "Kick backwards. One of the biggest problems people have is that they kick downward rather than backward. Instead of this, move your legs (as a whole) backwards -- as if you are pushing back -- instead of kicking downward. [3] X Research source Think of your legs as one large fin moving back and forth in the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick with purpose.",
      "content": "Kick with purpose. Concentrate and make sure that your kicks are deliberate. Make sure you are focused on how your body and legs are moving together. If you’re unfocused, you may kick, but you won’t kick with purpose and in an effective manner. In the end, you may wind up zig-zagging or slowing yourself down. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Point your head forward.",
      "content": "Point your head forward. Your head should be pointed forward just slightly. Make sure to avoid straining your neck. If your head is turned to the side slightly or you move it around, you’ll wind up slowing yourself down. Your neck should not be buried in your shoulders. Avoid tucking your chin down. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold your hands flat.",
      "content": "Hold your hands flat. Your hands should be held flat at shoulder width. Your pinkies and thumbs should be parallel with your other fingers. This should give you a lot more power as you move through the water. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Catch the water with your hands.",
      "content": "Catch the water with your hands. Your fingertips should point down toward the bottom of the pool as you paddle through the water. If they’re not, you’ll lose energy and won’t be able to move as fast as you could otherwise. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid rotating your shoulders too much.",
      "content": "Avoid rotating your shoulders too much. By rotating your shoulders, you’ll wind up making your hips turn. This will ultimately slow you down and make you lose power and momentum. Instead, focus on moving your arms as if you are paddling on a surfboard. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Swim straight.",
      "content": "Swim straight. Try to follow the line on the bottom of the pool as best as you can. If there is no line, make sure you stay straight in your swimming lane. In addition, make sure your arms don’t cross over the middle of your body when you are completing your strokes. Your right or left hand should never go near the opposite side of the body.

      "title": "Breathe regularly.",
      "content": "Breathe regularly. Take moderate-sized breaths as your head turns to the side. Then, slowly exhale as your head moves underwater. Do not: Breathe too deeply. Ultimately, moderate sized, regular breaths are more important than deep breaths. Hold your breath. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Take a break after your arms enter the water.",
      "content": "Take a break after your arms enter the water. Once your arms have entered the water, take a slight pause. This way, you’ll let the momentum of your stroke move you. You’ll also be able to recharge a little bit before continuing with the next stroke. The pause you should take will be very short, perhaps about a second or so. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow your release and recovery to be natural. Don’t force your release and recovery after your power phase. Let it all happen naturally – your arm should naturally move into recovery as your hand moves close to your hip. The angle of your elbow doesn’t really matter during release and recovery.

      "content": "Create a routine. While it’s probably impossible for you to spend every day in the pool, you can create a regular routine that will provide you with the experience needed to swim faster. Set a goal of swimming for one hour per day, at least three days a week. [13] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019. Set time aside before or after work or school. Spend part of a weekend day swimming."

      "content": "Increase the number of yards you swim per week. One of the most important factors in swimming faster is pushing yourself to beat your old records. As a result, you should constantly push yourself to improve the number of yards you swim for any given amount of time. Try increasing your time or distance by 10% each week. [14] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019. If you swim 1500 yards an hour, challenge yourself to eventually move up to 3000 yards an hour. While this may seem like a big increase, you’ll be able to do it over time. Use a timer to challenge yourself to go further in a certain mount of time. Set goals for yourself so you can more easily track your progress. [15] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019."

      "content": "Do some closed-fist swimming. Instead holding your hand out flat or cupped as you swim, make a fist. This will lessen the momentum you make with your hands, and force your arms to work harder. This will help train you to use your forearms more than you normally do. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Swim with your head up.",
      "content": "Swim with your head up. Instead of tilting your head underwater as you swim, keep it above water the entire time. This requires you to kick harder and faster to move straight and quick. After doing it for a while, you’ll find you have better control of your body.
