      "title": "Avoid washing your hair for 48 hours before you bleach.",
      "content": "Avoid washing your hair for 48 hours before you bleach. Bleach is a strong chemical; it can irritate and even burn your scalp and skin. The natural oils that build up when you do not wash your hair will protect your scalp from these harsh irritants. Give your hair at least a 48-hour break from shampooing before you begin the bleaching process. Deep-condition your hair a week before you plan to bleach. This can help minimize hair damage and breakage associated with bleaching."

    {
      "title": "Choose a developer strength.",
      "content": "Choose a developer strength. Unless you were born with very light red hair, you will probably have to bleach first to achieve a true color change. Developer is the chemical that lifts color from your hair. The strength you need depends on how many shades you have to lift. [2] X Research source Dark red hair will need a stronger developer than lighter red shades. Volume 40 is the strongest developer. Because it lifts your hair more quickly than lower volumes, it's also harsher on your hair. If you are concerned about using a volume 40 developer, you can use repeated treatments of a volume 20 or 30 developer over the course of a few weeks."

      "title": "Mix the developer and bleach powder together.",
      "content": "Mix the developer and bleach powder together. Pick up the developer strength you need and bleach powder at a beauty supply store. Grab an applicator and a pair of plastic gloves, too. Put on the protective gloves and pour equal parts bleach powder and developer in a large plastic bowl. Stir until they are fully incorporated. Drape a towel around your shoulders to protect them from the bleach right before you begin."

      "title": "Use a plastic comb to divide your hair into four sections.",
      "content": "Use a plastic comb to divide your hair into four sections. Bleaching is an easier process if you start by dividing your hair up into four manageable sections. Part your hair down the middle, from crown to nape. Then divide those sections in half horizontally, from one ear to the other. Use plastic hair clips to secure each section on top of your head. [3] X Research source Working in sections also helps you get the most even coverage and results."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint bleach onto the first section using the applicator.",
      "content": "Paint bleach onto the first section using the applicator. Bleach the bottom sections first. Remove the hair clip from one of the bottom sections of hair. Apply the bleach mixture to that section of hair with the applicator, working from root to tip. Get as close to the roots as you can, but do not get the bleach on your scalp. Completely saturate that section of hair, then carefully clip it back up."

      "title": "Apply the bleach mixture to the other three sections of hair.",
      "content": "Apply the bleach mixture to the other three sections of hair. Remove the clip from the next section and apply the bleach in the exact same way. Clip it back up and repeat until you have finished saturating all four sections of hair with the mixture. Paint the mixture on in thin layers to make sure you get full and even coverage. If you like, you can wrap your hair up with saran wrap or place a shower cap over it to prevent dripping, but you do not have to. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wait 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Wait 30 minutes. The exact time frame depends on the current color of your hair and the specific products you are using, but 30-45 minutes is the typical range. Never leave bleach on your hair longer than 60 minutes. If it helps, set a timer so you will not lose track of time. Check your hair every ten minutes or so to gauge progress."

    {
      "title": "Rinse out the bleach mixture thoroughly with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse out the bleach mixture thoroughly with cold water. Cold water reacts with the bleach chemicals and causes them to stop processing your hair immediately. Rinse the bleach mixture out carefully and thoroughly. Follow up the rinse by shampooing twice to ensure you have completely removed all of the bleach mixture. If the bleach left yellow or brassy shades in your hair, use a purple shampoo to tone it."

Part your hair down the center, from the crown of your head to the nape of your neck. Then divide those sections in half, horizontally, from ear to ear.

Try to go a few days between shampoos, since your hair color will fade slightly with every wash. Use cold water when shampooing, which is easier on color-treated hair.
