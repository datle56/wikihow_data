It can be any punch/kick as long as you're getting a workout. If you don't have a heavy bag punch the air. When your punches get good enough add wrist weights or dumbbells, but be careful, because they can hurt your joints. Remember to do them slowly. Be sure to use proper form. Learn how to align your shoulder, elbow and wrist properly, so that you can deliver a lot of force while staying stable and withstanding the returning force. Otherwise, you risk breaking your hand."
