Both the INFJ and ENFJ value mutual support with a partner whom they can have a caring and compassionate relationship with. [1] X Research source This pair has strong chemistry, thanks to their high emotional intelligence and willingness to share every part of themselves with the other. However, this relationship may feel like more of a “slow burn.” ENFPs and INFJs can be slow to trust others in a relationship, but they build deep trust over time with honest and authentic conversations."

This pair easily finds common ground since both personalities enjoy talking about emotions and big-picture ideals. [2] X Research source However, the INFJ is much more of a listener than the extraverted ENFP, which can lead to them feeling like they’ve barely participated in a discussion. [3] X Research source An ENFP can also help improve their communication with an INFJ by asking them direct questions and making sure they feel heard. The INFJ needs to advocate for themselves and speak up to not be steamrolled by the ENFP."

A child raised by an INFJ and ENFP pair may feel pressure to carve out a unique path in life. However, they will also be equipped with an innate understanding of right vs. wrong, as well as the freedom to express themselves."

      "content": "ENFP and INFJs develop close friendships around shared emotions. ENFPs long for friendships with meaningful connections and emotion, just like the INFJ. [16] X Research source INFJs also value loyalty, compassion, and new experiences in their friendships–all of which are easily provided by the ENFP. [17] X Research source Because these two personality types are equally generous with their time and energy, they are unlikely to develop resentment like they might with other personality types. However, their different social needs may put strain on the relationship. ENFPs prefer large social groups and events with lots of more people. Meanwhile, INFJs prefer small social settings with close friends. The ENFP and INFJ friendship pair will do well if they accept their differences and the fact that they may not always be interested in the same activities. That’s okay! They can have space to do their own thing while learning from each other’s social styles."

[19] X Research source To resolve a professional conflict, INFJ and ENFP colleagues can appeal to each other’s emotional side, explain to the other how they’ve been affected, and try to work together toward a compromise. While their opposite workplace habits may cause conflict, INFJ and ENFP colleagues can also balance each other out if working as a team. INFJs can help ENFPs have more structure and discipline, while ENFPs can help INFJs think outside the box and tap into their creative side."
