      "content": "Know that your body cleans out vaginal discharge, blood, and semen on its own. Many women douche in order to clean themselves after a period, rinse out vaginal discharge, or to clean out semen after sex. The great thing about the human body though, is that it is built to do these things on its own: “the vagina is a self-cleaning organ that needs no cleaning,” states Dr. Basinski. The vagina cleans itself without douching, meaning that you don’t have to refer to man-made soaps and rinses in order to keep your vagina in healthy, working condition.

      "content": "Douche at your doctor’s suggestion. The last few years of studies have offered up important research that shows that douching can be more harmful than beneficial to your body. The vagina naturally cleans itself with its high acidity and natural mucous, which douching removes.

      "content": "Don’t douche to remove itching or burning sensations. Some women feel like they need to douche in order to get rid of itching or burning they feel near or inside their vagina. These are symptoms of an infection though, and douching simply covers them up. Rather than trying to wash away these symptoms, meet with your doctor and explain what you’re experiencing.

      "content": "Don’t douche to remove a strong odor. Although the vagina may have a very mild, constant odor, if you are experiencing a strong odor (outside of your menstrual cycle), it is likely a symptom of a possible infection. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Instead of trying to rinse out the odor, talk to your doctor and ask for their advice. They may or may not support the idea of douching, but it is best to go to them first rather than possibly making things worse. Most doctors, as Dr. Basinski affirms, will remind their patients that “they don’t need to do anything to their vaginas…you actually shouldn’t do those kinds of things because you may upset the pH of your vagina and actually increase your risk for either bacterial vaginosis or yeast infections.”"

Therefore, don’t douche in attempts to prevent an STD/STI or pregnancy after sex, as it will be ineffective.

      "content": "Wash the outside of your vagina as an alternative to douching. If you are concerned about keeping your vagina clean and odor-free in general, stick to washing the outside of your vagina instead. Use a mild soap and warm water in the shower or bath to remove any sweat or grime that might have built up on the outside of your vagina and vulva, instructs Dr. Basinski, while your body does the work of cleaning the inside on its own."

Look through the available douching products at your local drugstore to choose an option that looks best for you—most products are sold as a prepackaged mix of water and vinegar, baking soda, or iodine. [8] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source Avoid any solution that contains scents or dyes, confirms Dr. Basinski, as these are much more likely to cause irritation or infection. Some people choose to create their own homemade douching solution or otherwise attempt to clean their vagina with vinegar.
