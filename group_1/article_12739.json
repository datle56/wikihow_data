Start to eliminate all the foods that are a burden to your liver and your colon. This includes coffee, white sugar, white flour, dairy, and alcohol. Stop eating processed sweets, which are full of white sugar and flour. Also avoid excess amounts of cheese or ice cream.

      "content": "Eat foods that help your body detox. There are certain foods that will help you detox your body. These include vegetables in the Brassica family, such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, collard greens, and cabbage. These vegetables contain many nutrients and specific complexes called sulforaphanes that are very important in helping your body detox. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Also make sure to eat plenty of fiber, because fiber-rich foods scrub the walls of the colon and push food through the intestines quickly. Some great high-fiber foods are green vegetables, apples, berries, and brown rice.

      "content": "Eliminate all food allergies and intolerances. If you have never been tested for food intolerances, you may want to visit a doctor or natural doctor to have this done. Eating foods that your body has an intolerance to slows down colon functioning and increases the likelihood of bowel toxicity."

      "content": "Eat foods rich in chlorophyll to reduce toxins. There are certain foods that will help reduce the toxins in your blood. Studies have shown that chlorophyll reduces the absorption of toxins and helps with toxin excretion. Dark, leafy greens are very high in chlorophyll. Increase your intake of spinach, kale, collard greens, parsley, wheatgrass and seaweed.

      "title": "Take probiotics.",
      "content": "Take probiotics. Probiotics are good for overall colon health and also specifically help with detoxification. Probiotics decrease an enzyme in your body that causes your colon to hold onto toxins instead of excreting them. While it is a good idea to take a probiotic capsule every day for general health, you may want to take 1 to 2 extra probiotic capsules per day during a colon cleanse. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source [9] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source You can also get probiotics through yogurt and other foods as well. If you take a probiotic supplement, choose one with 1 billion CFU per dosage. Buy them from a reputable health food or grocery store and make sure they aren't expired. Probiotics are live organisms, so most need to be kept in the fridge. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "Drink more water.",
      "content": "Drink more water. Your body needs lots of water to help flush toxins. Most people should drink half their body weight in ounces per day for optimal bowel health. This means that, for example, you weigh 140 pounds, you need to drink 70 ounces of water per day, especially if you want to increase your colon health. [11] X Research source This may seem like a lot of water, but if you incorporate a glass or two every few hours, it won't seem like so much. Don't try to drink it all at once. This can make you very sick. It is especially important to increase water intake when increasing fiber intake or taking a fiber supplement. The added fiber in the diet needs added water consumption in order to digest properly. Speak with your doctor about how much water is right for you, especially if you have kidney disease."

      "title": "Ask your doctor to recommend a supplement.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor to recommend a supplement. There are many colon-cleansing supplements on the market today. Some are designed to help to flush the colon of impurities, while others are made to support your organs in the act of detoxification. Before you take any of these supplements, you should consult with your doctor to make sure these products are safe for you."

      "title": "Use laxatives.",
      "content": "Use laxatives. Laxatives are products that stimulate your colon to work faster and to empty its contents. Take great caution with laxatives, because they can cause uncomfortable cramping and diarrhea if taken in high doses. They can also cause other side effects such as belching, bloating, gas, or stomach cramps. Try brands such as Milk of Magnesia, Miralax, or Dulcolax. If you use laxatives on a long-term basis, your colon will actually become dependent on them, so make sure to use them only for a few days a time.

Step 1 to 2 tea bags of Yogi Tea Soothing Mint Get Regular Tea in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drink the tea at night and 6 to 8 hours later you should have a normal bowel movement."

      "title": "Take fiber supplements.",
      "content": "Take fiber supplements. In addition to fiber-rich foods, supplements that contain fiber bind toxins and help the colon excrete them. Add 2 tablespoons (~7.4 g) per day of rice bran, psyllium, or oat bran fiber. An easy way to consume fiber is to add it directly to smoothies or oatmeal. Make sure to drink lots of water when you are adding fiber supplements. Otherwise, fiber can cause constipation or intestinal obstruction. You can also take dissolvable fiber supplements, such as Benefiber and Metamucil.

      "content": "Consider magnesium. Magnesium gently draws water into your colon and has a natural laxative effect. Unlike herbal or over-the-counter laxatives, magnesium is non-addicting and will not cause dependence when used long-term. Take 300 to 600 mg of magnesium citrate per day. Make sure not to exceed 900 mg per day because excessive magnesium can cause health issues. You can also buy liquid magnesium citrate and drink it instead of using a supplement. Make sure the amount in the drink does not exceed 900 mg of magnesium a day. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask about N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a precursor to glutathione, which is one of the major detoxifying substances in the body. It is found in many natural foods such as some yogurt and protein rich poultry, but it can also be taken as a supplement when you are detoxing your colon. When you supplement with NAC, your body turns it into glutathione that can be used to help you detox more quickly and effectively. Take 500 to 1500 mg of NAC per day in capsule form during a cleanse. You can buy these supplements in health stores or pharmacies.

      "content": "Use castor oil packs. Castor oil packs aid in the elimination and detoxification of the colon. Get a cotton or wool cloth, plastic wrap, a bath towel, a hot water bottle or heating pad, and castor oil. Pour the oil onto the cloth until it is well moistened. Lie down and place the cloth directly onto your abdomen. Place plastic wrap over all sides of the cloth to prevent staining of your clothes or bedding. Wrap the towel around your torso over the plastic. Then apply the hot water bottle or heating pad (set to medium) over the towel. Rest for 10-30 minutes.

Make sure you don't fall asleep with the heating pad on as it could burn you or make you overheated."

When you do an enema, you inject fluid into your colon in order to stimulate a bowel movement and help flush the colon of impurities. Like laxatives, enemas can cause dependence if used too frequently, but they are safe and effective when performed properly during a short-term cleanse.

      "content": "Consider a colonic. Colon therapists perform colonics, or colon irrigation procedures, at their offices each day. Colonics can be somewhat uncomfortable, but they can be very effective in detoxifying the colon. Make sure you go to a colon therapist who is trained in practicing safe and sanitary procedures."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about the procedure.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about the procedure. If you are having colon issues, ask your doctor about a colonic and what to expect. During a colonic the colon therapist gently inserts a tube in your rectum. The tube is attached to a pump that forces water or some other liquid into your large intestine. After your colon is saturated, the therapist removes the first tube and carefully inserts a new tube. The therapist will massage your abdomen to expel the water and waste from your colon. The therapist may repeat the process to fully cleanse the bowels. Up to 16 gallons (61 L) of water can be pumped and expelled during this procedure. Subsequent procedures may involve water treated with probiotics, herbs, or coffee, which help extract things from your colon."

      "title": "Make sure you have at least 1 bowel movement per day.",
      "content": "Make sure you have at least 1 bowel movement per day. The longer that stool stays in your colon, the more time your body has to re-absorb toxins. Many of the changes listed above should help you to have a daily bowel movement if this is not happening for you currently. If you have improved your diet and tried other options to help and are still not going once a day, it is a good idea for you to visit your doctor for further evaluation and advice. If you are having more than 2 bowel movements per day or your bowel movements are loose, consider consulting with a doctor before proceeding."
