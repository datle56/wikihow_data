    {
      "title": "Read your “Cure or Quit” notice.",
      "content": "Read your “Cure or Quit” notice. Depending on the jurisdiction, the landlord may be legally required to give you this notice before filing an eviction suit. It will tell you what lease provision you have violated. The notice also typically gives you a certain amount of time to fix (“cure”) the problem. If you don’t fix the problem by the deadline, then the landlord will terminate your lease. [1] X Research source Read the notice to find out what term of the lease you are alleged to have violated. For example, leases often require that you not have pets, not use grills outside or on the stairwell, and use common areas reasonably. If you failed to pay rent, then you should receive a “Pay or Quit” notice. You must pay all of the owed rent before the deadline."

    {
      "title": "Document that you haven’t violated the lease.",
      "content": "Document that you haven’t violated the lease. The landlord might have wrongly accused you of violating the lease. For example, if you live in an apartment building, then someone else in the building might have committed the lease violation. Get letters or emails from your neighbors. For example, your landlord might accuse you of having a pet. You can get neighbors to write that it isn’t you with the pet. Take pictures. If you are accused of damaging your apartment, then take pictures or video to document the lack of damage. These pictures will be useful if you are later sued and have to defend yourself in court."

    {
      "title": "Write a letter to your landlord.",
      "content": "Write a letter to your landlord. You should gather your proof that you haven’t violated the lease and write a letter to your landlord disputing the allegations. You can include your proof and ask the landlord to call you with questions. Set the letter up like a professional business letter . Keep your tone formal but friendly. You could write, “Dear Mr. Smith. I received your Notice to Cure or Quit yesterday. According to the notice, you believe that I have violated our lease agreement because I am keeping a pet. I do not have a pet. Instead, the new tenants in the apartment beside me have a dog. I have included an email from Mrs. Tyler, who lives upstairs, testifying that my neighbors have the dog, not me. I would be happy to discuss this issue with you further.” You can send the letter via Certified Mail, or even send it via email, particularly if you can show that you have previously communicated with your landlord via email."

      "title": "Follow up with a personal conversation.",
      "content": "Follow up with a personal conversation. Negotiation works best when you can talk in person, so that you can gauge how someone is responding to what you say. You can often resolve a dispute quickly in person. The key to discussing the alleged violation is to keep your cool. You shouldn’t mimic your landlord’s behavior. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Instead, listen closely to what they say. Firmly point out that you haven’t violated the lease. For example, you could say, “I didn’t trash the common area last Friday because I was staying with a friend that evening. I can give you her phone number, if you want to confirm that.”"

    {
      "title": "Mediate the dispute.",
      "content": "Mediate the dispute. If you have been a good tenant, always on-time with the rent, then the landlord might not want to lose you. In this situation, your landlord might be willing to mediate the dispute so that you can come to a resolution that works for both of you. In mediation, the mediator listens to both sides and helps guide you toward solutions you can agree on. Mediation is a good way to maintain the landlord-tenant relationship, so you should consider mediation if you definitely don’t want to move. You can find mediators through your courthouse or by contacting your local/state bar association. Ask for a referral."

      "title": "Cure the problem, if necessary.",
      "content": "Cure the problem, if necessary. You might have no choice but to fix the problem. If you really did violate the lease and don’t want to move out, then your best option might be to cure before the deadline stated on your notice. Let your landlord know as soon as possible that you have fixed the violation and that you intend to stay in your apartment."

      "content": "Read your landlord’s complaint. If you don’t voluntarily leave, then your landlord cannot throw you out. Instead, they must file an “unlawful detainer” action, which is a lawsuit in court. You will receive a copy of the complaint filed, along with a “summons.” [3] X Trustworthy Source Pine Tree Legal Association Legal advocacy group providing public resources related to civil rights and and services and the justice system Go to source The summons should tell you the deadline for responding to the lawsuit.

      "title": "Document any landlord self-help.",
      "content": "Document any landlord self-help. It is illegal for your landlord to try and evict you themselves. Instead, they must file a lawsuit and get a court order to evict you. If your landlord tries to evict you, then you should document the action your landlord took. For example, your landlord cannot: [4] X Research source Change the locks. Throw you or your belongings onto the sidewalk. Threaten to physically remove you or your belongings. Order you to leave. Cut off the utilities to your apartment."

      "title": "Draft your response.",
      "content": "Draft your response. You will respond to the lawsuit by filing an “answer” with the court. In the answer, you respond to each allegation made by your landlord and raise defenses. Your court should have printed “fill in the blank” forms you can use. [5] X Research source Stop into court and ask. Alternately, many local legal aid organizations might provide printed answer forms. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Raise your defenses.",
      "content": "Raise your defenses. There are several defenses you could raise depending on the circumstances. Make sure you have evidence supporting a defense before raising it. Common defenses include: [7] X Research source [8] X Research source Insufficient notice. Some states require that the notice contain certain language or give you a certain amount of time to cure. If your landlord didn’t follow the law, then you can raise this as a defense. Self-help. If your landlord tried to evict you using self-help, then you should raise that as a defense. Retaliatory eviction. You can’t be evicted because you complained to your local or state government about the conditions of your apartment building. For example, if you complain that insufficient heat is provided, then your landlord can’t turn around and try to evict you. Housing discrimination. It is illegal under federal and state law to discriminate against you on the basis of certain protected characteristics—race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, and familial status.

You can also testify on your behalf. If you think your landlord is retaliating against you, then you should get a copy of your complaint to the health and safety department you complained to, as well as any report issued.

This means dress pants, a button-up dress shirt, and a tie. Also wear dress shoes (not sneakers) and dark-colored socks. Women can wear dress slacks or skirts, along with a nice sweater or blouse.
