      "content": "Know what causes damage. These are some of the most common things that can cause damage to your hands: [1] X Research source Dry air sucks the moisture out of your skin. This occurs during the winter months in dry climates, or in air-conditioned places such as airplanes and shopping malls year-round. Water removes the skin’s natural oils. People who wash their hands a lot — for example, those who work in the health and hospitality industries — will often struggle with keeping their hands well moisturized. [2] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. Chemicals dry out and damage the skin. Hair stylists and people who work in cleaning jobs will often have dry, chapped hands if they don’t take the necessary precautions (the main one being wearing gloves). Some types of soap (particularly old-fashioned bars and commercial soaps) can disrupt the skin’s pH balance and cause dryness and cracking. Medical conditions such as psoriasis and eczema as well as particular allergies and medications can lead to dry, chapped hands."

      "title": "Moisturize your skin.",
      "content": "Moisturize your skin. Because of how often you use your hands, you need to moisturize them more often than once or twice a day. Aim for 5 or 6 applications each day. This is the No. 1 most recommended thing you can do to improve your hands. Experts recommend applying moisturizer preventatively, before your hands become dry. [3] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. Use a moisturizer with a built-in sunscreen if you’ll be outside for a while. This will help protect your hands from discoloration such as sunburns or age spots. Drinking water is not enough to keep your skin hydrated: you need to apply moisturizer directly to your skin to reap the full benefits."

      "content": "Keep a good-quality moisturizer close-by at all times. This will help you remember to use it more often. For instance, keep one in your bag, one at your desk, and one at your bedside. Put on moisturizer after you wash your hands. [4] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. A good-quality moisturizer must contain emollients and humectants. Emollients like lanolin, jojoba oil, squalene, and isopropyl palmitate lubricate and smooth the skin. Humectants like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and urea transfer moisture from the environment to the skin."

      "title": "Use heavier moisturizers for really damaged skin.",
      "content": "Use heavier moisturizers for really damaged skin. If your skin is cracked, chapped, sore, and/or bleeding, regular moisturizers might not be enough. A great remedy for this is the following overnight treatment: At bedtime, apply a lot of petroleum jelly or another heavy moisturizer containing dimethicone, cocoa or shea butter, or beeswax to your hands. Then, put on a pair of cotton gloves and leave them on overnight. [5] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. Coconut oil and aloe vera are great natural moisturizers. With coconut oil, slather it on to your hands and then put on a pair of gloves. Aloe vera is less oily and more suitable for healing any cracks or sores you may have on your hands. [6] X Research source"

Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. [8] X Research source Avoid soaps that contain fragrances, preservatives, and sulphates, which are drying. A mild, moisturizing, soap-free cleanser would be ideal. [9] X Research source To dry your hands, pat them gently with a towel or paper towel, and then apply moisturizer immediately after. [10] X Research source Avoid using a hot-air dryer as this could further dry out your hands. [11] X Research source Some experts recommend that people who have to wash their hands more than 12 times a day alternate their hand-washing with moisturizing hand-sanitizing gel or wipes. The alcohol in the sanitizers can be drying, but not as drying as regular soap and water sessions. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear gloves.",
      "content": "Wear gloves. Wear gloves or mittens when you go outside in the winter if it’s for more than a few minutes. Wear rubber gloves when you wash dishes or clean the house. [13] X Research source If you dye your hair, garden, or do anything else that can dry out your hands, make sure that you wear gloves. If you have eczema or sensitive skin, you can benefit from wearing cotton gloves when doing household chores like folding laundry or dusting. You can cover these with neoprene or lined vinyl gloves if you need waterproofing. Avoid vinyl gloves, which can dry out your skin. The best options are cotton or leather or, if you must wear waterproof gloves, disposable vinyl. [14] X Research source"

Grind oats (quick or old-fashioned are fine) down using a mixer or a mortar and pestle, then sprinkle them into the bathtub as you fill it with warm water. Soak for at least 15 minutes. [16] X Research source [17] X Research source If you don’t have time for a bath, you can soak only your hands in a tub of warm water and ground oats for at least 15 minutes. You can also mix ground oats in a basin with warm olive or jojoba oil, and then soak your hands in that for 10 to 15 minutes. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Exfoliate your hands (optional). Do not do this if your hands are severely dry or chapped. This is more for if you have relatively healthy hands that just look a bit dull. Do this up to two times a week, being sure to moisturize immediately afterwards. [19] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. [20] X Research source Pay close attention to how your hands respond to the exfoliation. If your hands become worse, decrease how many times you exfoliate them each week. If they don’t improve, discontinue exfoliating all together. A natural exfoliant you can make with ingredients in your pantry comprises 1 to 2 tablespoons of sugar (avoid the coarse raw stuff) mixed with olive oil. [21] X Research source If your hands are particularly dry and calloused, you might need to use something stronger than an exfoliating cream — for instance, a pumice stone. [22] X Research source"

When you cut or otherwise manipulate them, you not only break that barrier, but you also risk your cuticles becoming inflamed or ragged. It can be tempting to push back your cuticles in order to make your nails appear longer, but don’t do it! If you regularly get manicures, ask that your aesthetician leave your cuticles alone, too."

Cuticles and nails can become dry too, so be sure to keep them well moisturized so that they look their best. Putting oil around the cuticle is a great way to keep your cuticle and nails looking great. You can use household oils like olive oil or coconut oil, or invest in a cuticle oil, which you can find at most drugstores."

      "content": "Paint your nails . When painting your nails, start with a protective base coat (there are ones that also contain ridge-fillers). After you’ve painted your nails, follow it up with a top coat, which will help lock in the color. Experts recommend using nail shellac instead of nail polish. Shellac lasts longer and helps prevent brittle nails by boosting their hydration. Be aware that nail polishes can contain toxic chemicals that will weaken your nails or worse. Try to find polishes that don’t contain toxic chemicals. Even then, give your nails a paint-free break once in a while."

      "content": "Skip the manicure. Getting regular manicures and pedicures can actually worsen the appearance of your hands by increasing the risk of infection. In addition, hands and nails can become dry from the chemicals used at the salon. If you don’t want to give up your manicures, consider bringing your own tools to the salon to lower the risk of infection. If you must get fake nails, choose tips instead of ones that fully cover your actual nails. This will minimize the risk of damage to your nails."
