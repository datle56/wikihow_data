      "content": "Catch silverfish in a glass jar wrapped with masking tape. Use a tall mason jar or another deep glass container. Wrap the outside of the container with a piece of masking tape, making sure it reaches all the way to the top. Add bait to the bottom of the glass, like a piece of bread or some raw flour. The silverfish will climb into the glass looking for a meal, but they won’t be able to climb back out the slippery inside. [1] X Research source Place the traps near furniture corners and along the edges of the walls where silverfish are most likely to forage for food. Check your traps every few days to empty them and replace the bait. Find and share more tips for getting rid of silverfish for good on the \"How do I get rid of these silverfish? So gross\" forum ."

      "content": "Trap silverfish in a moist rolled-up newspaper. Roll up an old newspaper, put rubber bands around the ends, and lightly moisten it with a spray bottle until it’s damp. Put the newspaper in an area where you’ve noticed silverfish and leave it until the next morning. Without unrolling the paper, throw it into your trash outside to get rid of the silverfish. [2] X Research source Leave out a new newspaper every night until you don’t see any more signs of silverfish in your home. Silverfish are attracted to damp spaces and eat paper products, so silverfish burrow into the paper overnight."

Wrap a piece of duct tape around the cardboard so the sticky side faces up. Stick the trap onto the floor in the spot where you’ve seen silverfish. Add bait to the middle, like a small piece of bread or flour to attract silverfish to the trap.

      "content": "Use commercial roach traps to catch and kill silverfish. Place the adhesive traps along wall edges and near furniture corners where silverfish are most likely to be. Bait them with small pieces of bread, flour, or another starch. Leave the traps out and come back after a few nights to check them. If you notice any dead silverfish, replace the trap with a new one. Put your sticky traps in moist areas, like bathrooms and laundry rooms, since that’s where you’ll catch the most silverfish. Keep sticky traps away from pets since the adhesives could catch on your animal’s fur."

      "content": "Spray cedar oil or citrus oil in areas where you’ve seen silverfish. Put a few drops of essential oil into a spray bottle with water and apply it directly on the cracks and seams near floorboards and furniture. Since silverfish are repelled by the smell of cedar, they’ll avoid any areas where you apply the oil. [4] X Research source You could also try sprinkling cedar shavings along the edges of your attic or basement to keep silverfish out naturally ."

Make sure the dust coats the surface evenly so the silverfish can’t avoid it. The next morning, vacuum up the powder and any dead silverfish along with it. [6] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Wear a face mask when you're sprinkling diatomaceous earth since it can irritate your lungs.
