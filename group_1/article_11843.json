Watch out for increases in alcohol consumption or drug use. If your parent has changed habits with alcohol or drugs (including prescription medications and sleeping pills), this may be related to depression."

      "content": "Recognize myths about depression. Many people don't know much about depression. Understanding how it works can help you know what's going on. Here are some important things to know: [2] X Research source [3] X Research source There isn't always a clear cause. Depression isn't always caused by one bad thing. Sometimes, people get sick. Pills won't change who your parent is. Meds help them feel more \"normal,\" like they were before the depression. Their personality won't change. (Though if your parent has a strange reaction to the wrong meds, that's called a side effect, and they should ask their doctor about stopping the meds safely.) It's not on purpose. Depression is an illness, not a bad mood or a personal weakness. If your parent could magically make it go away, they would. It's not contagious. You can't catch depression from anyone. Talking about it is healthy. Some people worry that talking about depression will make it worse. Actually, talking about it can help the person feel less alone."

But that's not an excuse to be cruel. Your parent may be abusive if they do one or more of these to you or someone else: Name-calling, insulting, or belittling (even after you ask them to stop) Screaming at you Threatening your safety Blaming you for things you can't control, like being born Cutting you off from the rest of the world Breaking things in order to scare you Telling you to steal, bully someone, or commit a crime Hitting, pushing, kicking, etc. (even if it doesn't leave a mark)"

It's scary to think about, but familiarizing yourself with suicidal behaviors is important if your parent has depression.

If you are concerned and feel like things will not get better, it’s okay to start a conversation about depression. Approach your parent from a place of concern and care. Remind your parent how important he is to you, and that you want to see him happy. Say, “I’m concerned about you and your health. Have things changed? How are you doing?” You can also say, “I’ve noticed things have changed, and you seem sadder than usual. Is everything okay?” If your parent says something about how they \"don't want to be here anymore,\" you should seek help right away."

Even if you're struggling to find their words, staying with them and holding their hand can mean a great deal. Here are some examples of helpful things to say: \"I can see how hard this is for you.\" \"What can I do to help?\" \"What do you need right now?\" \"I know you're doing your best.\" \"We'll get through this together.\" \"I love you.\""

Severe depression can make someone too tired to do the most basic tasks—showering, going to work, making dinner, cleaning the house, doing laundry, etc. Your parent neglecting themselves might mean your needs are neglected, too. If your needs are being neglected, you need to reach out for help. For example, perhaps you live with your dad and your stepmom, and your dad has depression. You can try talking to her about what's going on with dad and say that you think he needs help. You can also call a grandparent, aunt or uncle, or even a friend's parent or teacher. If you are an adult, talk to your parent about getting help. If they're reluctant to see a therapist, you may have better luck convincing them to go in to his doctor for a general checkup. Set boundaries about what you are willing and able to do for your parent. Remember that you can't fix your parent. They won't get better unless they're willing to accept help."

[11] X Research source There are usually many reasons why a person gets depressed, making the occurrence of depression more complex than just one or two reasons. Many people become depressed because they have factors in their backgrounds that make them more vulnerable to developing depression. Avoid beating yourself up for your mistakes. You didn't cause your parent's depression, and blame and guilt won't fix anything. Even if you aren't a perfect child, that still doesn't cause depression. Depression often comes from chemical imbalances in the brain, genetic predispositions, and/or severely unhealthy circumstances (e.g. abuse victimization or a very toxic work environment)."

[12] X Research source You may feel like you are the cause of stress in your parent’s life. Knowing that your parent’s emotions are different — which can cause behavior changes — can help you realize that these things are not true. If your parent says something upsetting, take a deep breath and say \"That hurt my feelings\" or \"If you're going to keep talking to me this way, then I'm going to leave.\" You can also speak up after the fact, if you were too confused or startled to respond in the moment. During a calm time, say \"It really hurt my feelings earlier when you said _____.\" This gives them the opportunity to apologize and try to do better. After they apologize, do your best to let it go. Remember that depression messes with people's minds, and that people can say things that they don't mean."

Don’t let your parent’s care and household duties become your life. It’s not your responsibility to be the caretaker. Offer your help but don’t let it take over. It's important to set boundaries with your parent. If your parent relies on you to make him feel good or whole, this is an unhealthy dynamic that can have major repercussions on your own mental health. [14] X Research source Try setting small boundaries at first, and try to do so without anger or judgement. For instance, if your parent over-shares with you, telling you more about his problems than is appropriate, you could say something like, \"Dad, I love talking with you, but this is a little more than I can handle. I think Aunt Susan could really help you with this problem.\""
