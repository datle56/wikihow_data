      "title": "Get a pair of dark jeans that fit you well for a go-to piece.",
      "content": "Get a pair of dark jeans that fit you well for a go-to piece. Dark blue jeans look great with almost any type of top, and you can dress them up or dress them down. If you don't already own a great pair of jeans, find a pair! Look for darker washes, such as indigo. Also, try to find a pair of jeans that have a bit of stretch for a more flattering look. Avoid anything that's tight or that has a strong waist. Instead, look for clothing with elastic waists in lightweight fabrics so you'll be more comfortable. [1] X Research source Katie Quinn. Stylist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020. If you like jeans that are embellished, make sure to consider where the details are located. Jeans that have too much flash in certain areas can be unflattering. For example, if you are trying to minimize larger thighs, then a pair of jeans with gems or sequins along the thighs might have the opposite effect. Opt for high-waisted jeans to help smooth out your midsection. Avoid low-riders. The waistband of your jeans should also fit comfortably on you and it should not create extra bumps around your middle."

      "content": "Invest in a nice, white dress shirt to create classic, clean lines. A white dress shirt is a great go-to piece that creates clean, slimming lines. You can wear it for work with a 2-piece suit or blazer and skirt, or you can wear it with a pair of jeans to go on a date. Make sure that the shirt fits you well and is made from quality materials, such as 100% cotton. If you are not sure about your size, you might want to get measured in the store to find the best fit for you."

      "content": "Purchase a 2-piece suit to mix and match. A 2-piece suit is a must-have for anyone's wardrobe. It is a professional staple and you can also wear it on dates and to special events. You can dress a 2-piece suit up or down with different shirts and accessories. Make sure that the suit fits you well for the most slimming effect. Opt for darker colors as well, such as navy, black, or dark grey. A 2-piece suit can be expensive, so you might consider how much you will use it before buying. If you can wear it for your job, then it would likely be worth splurging on a high-end 2-piece suit. However, if you don't have a job where you could wear it, then watch for a sale or skip this item altogether."

      "content": "Buy some tunic tops in different colors to cover wide hips and thighs. Tunic-style shirts are those that come down to your hips and they are the ultimate slimming top. They have a slimming effect because they are so long. Get a few tunic tops (or longer shirts) in different colors to mix and match with the rest of your wardrobe. Look for tunics or longer cardigans in lightweight fabrics like jersey and rayon. [2] X Research source Katie Quinn. Stylist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020. Try pairing a tunic top with a pair of jeans for a casual look, or wear a tunic top with a 2-piece suit for a professional/dressy look."

      "title": "Find some quality shapewear to help you achieve a smoother look.",
      "content": "Find some quality shapewear to help you achieve a smoother look. Shapewear is what you wear under your clothing to make your clothes look better on you! There is a lot of great shapewear available for just about every shaping need. You can get shapers that will slim your waist, hips, and thighs, or just 1 of these areas. You can also get pantyhose that will provide all over shaping benefits for your legs, waist, hips, and thighs. When you're choosing a bra, the most important area to fit is the band. That's where most of the support comes from, so if the bra doesn't fit you there, it won't fit overall. [3] X Research source Katie Quinn. Stylist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020. Try on the shapewear before you buy it to ensure that it does what you want it to do. Make sure to put your clothes on over the shapewear to see how effective it is."

      "title": "Opt for longer tops to flatter your midsection.",
      "content": "Opt for longer tops to flatter your midsection. Avoid clothes that do not cover your midsection completely. Midriff-baring tops are best left to the younger crowd, and they are also not the best choice if you are concerned about your midsection. Instead, stick with long, flattering tops that cover your entire waist and that go down to your hips. [4] X Research source For example, you could wear a long tank top or t-shirt for a casual look. Try a long sweater or tunic-style blouse for something a bit dressier."

      "content": "Wear an A-line skirt to flatter heavier hips and thighs. A-line shaped skirts are those that flare out at the waist going down towards the hips. They hide wider hips and thighs with this shape, and they are the most flattering if you are bottom-heavy. Pick a few A-line skirts in different colors, but stick with darker colors to further minimize your bottom half. For example, you could get an A-line skirt in navy, black, dark grey, or plum."

      "content": "Wear dark colors on the part of your body that is the biggest. You can use color to accentuate the top or bottom section of your body and minimize the appearance of the other section. If you are bottom-heavy, try wearing a dark colored bottom with a light or bold color top. If you are top-heavy, pair a light or bold colored bottom with a dark colored top. [9] X Research source For example, you could balance a bigger bottom by wearing a pair of black leggings or an indigo pencil skirt with a magenta blouse or Kelly green sweater on your top half.
