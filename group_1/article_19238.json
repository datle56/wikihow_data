If you get a digital test, then the screen will say if you are ovulating or not.

Some disorders you'll want to catch before pregnancy include: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which can interfere with ovulation. Endometriosis, which can generally inhibit fertility. Diabetes: If you can catch and manage diabetes before conceiving, you'll be able to avoid birth defects commonly associated with the disease.
