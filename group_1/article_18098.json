      "content": "Admit to yourself that you were in the wrong. While it might feel painful now, it will help you move on faster and forgive yourself quicker. If there’s anyone in your life that you trust, you could even open up to them about what happened. It can be as simple as saying “Yes, I did that,” or, “I take responsibility for what I did.” It’s important to not make excuses, either. Even if you think you had a good reason, it doesn’t negate the fact that you hurt someone."

      "content": "Apologize for what you did. Reach out to them and ask if you can meet up to talk. Sincerely apologize, admit that what you did was wrong, and acknowledge that you hurt their feelings. Apologize and ask for forgiveness in-person if possible. See if there is a way to talk with them one-on-one rather than in public. If seeing them face to face isn't possible, then a phone call is the next best thing. For example, let's say that you ignored your best friend who was going through a really hard time with her family because you wanted to spend the weekend with your new boyfriend. When you talk with her, say, \"I'm sorry for not being there for you. I realize now that ignoring your calls and not telling you what I was doing was wrong.\""

If you aren’t sure how, just ask them if there’s anything you can do that will make them feel better.

[2] X Expert Source Wes Pinkston Certified Holistic Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 January 2022. What led you to make the mistake that you made? Were you doing it out of fear or anger? If you can catch yourself before you hurt someone else, maybe it wasn’t all for nothing. [3] X Research source For instance, maybe you said something insulting to your partner during an argument. If you reacted out of anger, take that as a sign to slow down and calm your emotions before reacting next time. Or, maybe you blew someone off when they asked to hang out because you were afraid of making a close connection with someone new. But Pinkston advises not to dwell too long here: “Don’t forget to get back into the present after considering past events. Once you have learned from them, let them go.” [4] X Expert Source Wes Pinkston Certified Holistic Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 January 2022."

Remind yourself that every mistake is an opportunity to learn, and to be grateful for that tool as a way of growing. Tell yourself, \"I am thankful for the opportunity to make mistakes, to learn, to grow, and to become a better person.\" “Removing self-judgment can go a long way from shifting a regret into a learning lesson,” Pinkston says. “While nothing from the past changed, you have shifted the framework in which you view the past event.” [5] X Expert Source Wes Pinkston Certified Holistic Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 January 2022."

Exploring your behavior will help you to move forward. [6] X Research source Consider writing about your motives as a way to open yourself up to your emotions and behavior. For example, let’s say you lied to your significant other. You felt like you wanted to protect them, but instead hurt them worse. Do you have difficulty talking with your partner? Are you afraid to open up to them fully because you think they’ll leave?"

Remember that no one is perfect. Sometimes we hurt others by accident, and we have to find a way to move on. Rather than repressing or ignoring what you feel, see acceptance as a form of catharsis. [8] X Research source For example, let's say that you had a really busy day at work, and forgot that you had plans to meet with your sister after work. When you realize what's happened, call your sister and take ownership of your mistake. When you have negative thoughts about yourself and who you hurt, tell yourself, “I accept my mistakes. I have learned from them.” Forgiving yourself may also make it easier to have compassion for others: “True kindness starts with you being kind to yourself,” Pinkston notes. “If you start from that point, you’ll soon notice you have countless moments throughout the day where you are being overly hard on yourself…. By…bringing our awareness to [this]...we begin to have more compassion and kindness to ourselves, and eventually those around us.” [9] X Expert Source Wes Pinkston Certified Holistic Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 January 2022."

If your friend told you they had done what you’ve done and don’t know how to move forward, would you tell them they could never overcome the past, never forgive themselves, or never be a good person? Probably not. You’d probably tell them everyone makes mistakes, and that since they’re really sorry, all they need to do is accept responsibility, move on, and try not to repeat the past. When you begin to criticize yourself, ask yourself if you would say those things to your friend in the same situation. Would you ever tell your friend they were a terrible person because they made a mistake?"

When you catch your negative thoughts and push back on them, you can work toward treating yourself with kindness. [10] X Research source Your negative thoughts are not necessarily the truth. Just because you think \"I'm a terrible friend,\" doesn't make it true. Try making a list of all the ways that you have been a good friend in the past. Soften your criticism. It is good to be self-critical sometimes, but not to the point where you can't move forward and forgive yourself, or if it is ruining your self-esteem. When you think \"I'm a terrible friend,\" stop and restate it in a softer (and more truthful) way. \"I hurt my friend's feelings, but it was unintentional and I have apologized. I'm a human and I make mistakes.\""
