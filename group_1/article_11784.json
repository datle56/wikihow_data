      "content": "Know what qualifies as stalking. Stalking is a type of harassment, which is the act of making repeated or inappropriate contact with you that is unwanted and unreciprocated. Stalking may take place in-person, with someone following you, spying on you, or approaching you at your home or workplace. The following may be signs of stalking receiving unwanted gifts, being followed, receiving unwanted mail or email messages, receiving unwanted or repetitive phone calls. Stalking can also occur online, in the form of cyber-stalking or cyber-bullying. These types of contact can be difficult to prosecute, but you may be able to avoid this harassment more easily by changing your online privacy settings or email address. Any instance of cyber-stalking that then transitions into in-person stalking should be considered very serious and should be reported immediately."

      "content": "Determine the type of stalker you have. Some types of stalkers are more dangerous than others, and knowing the type of stalker you are dealing with can help you notify the police appropriately and defend yourself if necessary. [1] X Research source Most stalkers are known as simple stalkers. These are individuals who you know that you may have had a romantic or friendly relationship in the past. The relationship ended for you, but not for the other person. Love obsession stalkers are individuals who you have never met (or very casual acquaintances) who latch onto you and think that they are in a relationship with you. People who stalk celebrities are in this category. Stalkers who have a psychotic fantasy about a relationship with their victims will often turn from unwanted attention to threats or intimidation. When this fails, they may escalate to violence. Sometimes the abuser in an abusive relationship or marriage becomes a stalker, following his ex and watching from afar, then moving closer, and eventually repeating or escalating violent attacks. This can be one of the most dangerous stalkers."

An abusive ex-husband who has threatened you may try to kill you if you let your guard down. [2] X Research source If you are being stalked online, decide whether it is likely that the stalker has any information about your real-life whereabouts. Be sure to maintain a secure online presence and never reveal your home address or even your hometown on public pages. You should trust your instincts, be cognizant of the history of the person's behavior (if you are aware of it), and be realistic about the danger you're in. If you truly feel like you or your family members are in danger, you should seek help at your local police or sheriff's office or with a victim's services organization. If you think danger is imminent, call Emergency Services immediately."

      "content": "Avoid contact with your stalker. Stalkers often feel as though they are in a relationship with their victims, and any contact the victims make with them is perceived as validation of their “relationship,” which is nonexistent. If you are being stalked, do not call, write to, or speak to your stalker in person if you can avoid it at all."

Sometimes stalking victims yell at or talk to their stalkers, but even overt rudeness can be misconstrued by stalkers (who are frequently mentally disturbed) as communication of affection or interest. [4] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source If you are being stalked online, do not respond in any way to any messages, regardless of how angry you become.

      "content": "Hide your personal information. If a stalker does not have personal information about you such as your phone number, home address, or email address, do not let them find it. Do not give your home phone number aloud to anyone in public places. If you find that you must provide a phone number, try using a work phone instead, or writing the number down then shredding it. Avoid putting your home address in writing. In cases of extreme stalking, you may want to get a PO Box for your mailing address so that it's less likely that you will need to provide anyone with your home address. Do not share your home address or place of work online or on social media. This may give an online stalker the opportunity to find you in person."

If you do so, you may want to consult an organization such as a battered women's shelter for tips about how to make yourself truly disappear. Do not have your mail forwarded directly to your new home. Be careful when registering to vote in a new place. You can request anonymous registration. If you purchase property, your name may be on the public record as the land's owner. Sometimes these records are tied to searchable databases, so you may want to rent to remain more anonymous."

      "content": "Tell a variety of people about your problem. While you may not want to post on social media or announce to a large crowd of people that you have a stalker, it is important to tell enough people that if something were to happen, you may have witnesses. You may want to tell your parents, your boss, a co-worker or two, your spouse, your neighbors, and the office management or doorman if you live in an apartment building. [6] X Research source If possible, show people a photograph of your stalker. If not, give them a detailed description. Tell people what they should do if they see the stalker with or without you being around. Should they call you? Call the police? Tell the stalker to leave?"

[7] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Be sure to include any and all signs of stalking, as many police departments need to have evidence of at least 2-3 unwanted contacts before they can charge someone with stalking. Be aware that the authorities may not be able to do anything until the stalking has escalated to or near the point of threats or violence. Ask them what you should do to keep track of incidents, when and how to call for help if necessary, and if they have any tips for developing a safety plan. Call the police frequently if you feel as though they do not take your complaint seriously at first.

[10] X Research source Try to avoid being alone in vulnerable situations, like walking to and from your workplace or home, particularly at night. Be sure you tell a trusted friend your safety plan.

Your first instinct may be to destroy anything related to the stalker who is making you uncomfortable, but it is best to keep the evidence in case you need to build a case against him. [11] X Research source Print any electronic correspondence. Be sure that details such as date and time print as well. Keeping the items doesn't mean that you have to look at them.

      "content": "Tell the stalker that you are not interested in a relationship. If you believe that your stalker is nonviolent and will back down with confrontation, you might try speaking to him directly. Telling the person who is stalking you that you are not interested in any kind of relationship with him might make him back off. Consider having another person present to help protect you in case of escalation to violence and to act as a witness to the conversation. However, don't ask your boyfriend to help you, as one or both of the men could become upset by the other's presence. Instead, ask a friend or relative to be there for you. Try not to be too nice with your rejection. Being nice to a stalker can unwittingly encourage him, and he may try to “read between the lines” and listen to your tone rather than your words."
