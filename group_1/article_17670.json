[2] X Research source Your dentist and dental hygienist will deep clean your teeth, taking care to deep clean the pockets that otherwise can't be cleaned by brushing or flossing. [3] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Calculus gets under the gums creating a constant deposit of aggressive bacteria, which leads to inflamed gums, gum recession and bone loss. If you have gingivitis or periodontitis, talk with your dentist about getting more frequent cleanings."

Take a toothbrush with soft bristles and set it against your gums at a 45-degree angle. Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of your teeth using small short strokes. Brush each surface about 10 times using gentle pressure. Don't forget to hold the brush vertically and brush up-and-down to clean the inside surfaces of your front teeth. Brush your tongue, spit out the toothpaste, and leave the foam in your mouth without rinsing. [5] X Research source Brush your teeth and tongue with a tartar-control toothpaste at least twice a day. Leaving the toothbrush foam on your teeth gives the minerals some time to be absorbed into your teeth, especially if you use a fluoride toothpaste which has more than 1200ppm."

      "content": "Floss daily. [6] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Unwind about 18 inches of dental floss and wind most of it around the middle finger of one hand with the rest around the middle finger of your other hand. Firmly hold the floss between your thumb and forefinger. Guide the floss between each tooth, gently using a back and forth and side to side motion to gently move the floss between your teeth without causing it to snap. Be sure to rub each side of each tooth before unwinding more floss and moving to the next tooth. Or, you can use a \"water pick\" (a handheld device that steadily sprays water between your teeth and gums). Consider using a \"water pick\" if you don't like flossing, have braces, have bridges, or can't floss. Fill it with a 50:50 solution of mouthwash and water to increase the antibacterial protection."

      "content": "Use antibiotics or antiseptic rinses. Your dentist might prescribe one of these to use daily if you have gum disease. You may need to take oral antibiotics like low-dose doxycycline to control bacteria that damages the gums, which may last for up to three months. Or, your dentist could recommend that you use an antimicrobial rinse as a mouthwash. [7] X Research source You may be told to place antiseptic chips or gel packets in the deep pockets between your gums and teeth. If you are not too handy ask a member of your household to help you, or schedule an appointment with your dentist. These can control harmful bacteria."

It's fine to drink well or tap water, which contain minerals unique to your area. [19] X Research source Tap water in much of the US is treated with fluoride to help prevent tooth decay.

      "content": "Take a mineral supplement. Your multivitamin should contain minerals, especially calcium and magnesium. Magnesium is important in preventing calcium loss, which can weaken your bones and teeth. Try to get at least 1000 mg of calcium and 300 to 400 mg of magnesium every day if you do not consume products such as milk, cheese or yogurt. Otherwise you will have an increased rate of calculus deposits. If you're a man over 71 or a woman over 51, try to get 1200 mg of calcium every day. Children taking children's vitamins have different magnesium needs. From birth to 3 years old, they need 40 to 80 mg a day; for kids between three and six years old, they need 120 mg a day; and for kids up to 10 years old, they need 170 mg a day."
