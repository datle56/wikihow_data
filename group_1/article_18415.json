Before you begin working on regaining your partner’s respect, remind yourself that all you can change is your own behavior.

      "content": "Own up to your mistakes and weaknesses. No matter how hard you try to do the right thing, you’re bound to make mistakes in a relationship from time to time. When it happens, don’t try to deny it, minimize it, or place the blame on someone else. Simply acknowledge your mistake and apologize sincerely to your partner. Assure them that you’ll try not to repeat the behavior again.

Earn their trust by following through on your promises and being honest if you mess up or fail to follow through.

If something prevents you from getting home on time, call your partner right away and let them know.

For example, you might say, “I know I said I wasn’t going to drink anything tonight, but I gave in and had a couple beers with my friend from work. I’m sorry.”"

      "content": "Communicate openly and honestly about how you feel. A lot of relationship problems boil down to a lack of good communication. It’s possible that your partner doesn’t even realize that you see their behavior as disrespectful. Take a moment to sit down with your partner when you’re both calm and talk about how you’re feeling and how their actions affect you. Make sure to listen actively to what they have to say, as well.

Use “I” statements to show that you own your feelings and prevent your partner from feeling defensive. For example, “I feel really isolated when you keep playing on your phone when we’re together. I feel like I don’t matter that much.” Avoid using accusatory language and broad generalizations, like “You never spend time with me anymore,” or “You’re so selfish!” Reader Poll: We asked 148 wikiHow readers who've dealt with conflict in a relationship, and 55% of them agreed that the most crucial step in rebuilding trust is open and honest communication .

      "content": "Enforce your boundaries with your partner. Boundaries are an important part of any mutually respectful relationship. If your partner has gotten used to doing things that make you uncomfortable or feel disrespectful to you, it’s time to establish some clear ground rules about what you find acceptable. Explain to your partner clearly that you’re not willing to tolerate certain behaviors from them, and tell them what the consequences will be if they violate those boundaries. For example, you might say, “When you look through the texts on my phone, I feel very violated and like you don’t trust me. If you won’t respect my privacy, I’ll have to move out.” Make sure to follow through on any consequences you establish. Otherwise, your partner might not take your boundaries seriously."

I’m going to make the decision to start treating her with the respect she deserves.” It’s natural to feel negatively about your partner sometimes, but try to refocus your attitude so that you’re critical of their actions instead of who they are as a person. For example, if you catch yourself thinking “He’s such a slob,” replace that thought with “I hate it when he leaves his dirty dishes around.”"
