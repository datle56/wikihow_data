      "content": "Use a vinyl cleaning brush for a deeper clean. Place the record on your turntable and start the turntable so the vinyl is rotating. Hold a vinyl cleaning brush gently against the surface of the record at a 90-degree angle. Allow the record to turn so the brush cleans along the grooves. Gradually move the brush from the inside grooves to the outside grooves. [2] X Research source You can find vinyl cleaning brushes at music supply shops or by ordering one online. Don’t use a wire or bristled brush or you could damage the record."

      "content": "Try using a record cleaning solution for stubborn grime. Record cleaning solutions are specially formulated to remove dust and grime from your records without leaving residue behind or stripping the vinyl. Locate the areas with dusty buildup on your record and spray them with the cleaning solution. Then, take a clean microfiber cloth and gently rub in a soft, circular motion to lift any dusty buildup from the surface. A few drops or spritzes will do just fine. Don’t apply so much that it streaks off the record. Avoid getting any of the liquid on the label in the center of the record or it could damage or discolor it. You can find record cleaning solution at music supply shops and by ordering it online."
