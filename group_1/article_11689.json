    {
      "title": "Switch to low sugar foods.",
      "content": "Switch to low sugar foods. If your hamster has diabetes, it will be difficult for them to break down and convert sugar to energy. As a result, you should read the ingredients on your current hamster feed and check for added sugars, such as molasses, sugar cane, corn syrup, or fructose. If the food contains these sugars, you should change their food to a low sugar feed. There is no special diabetic food mix on the market for hamsters, but you can ask your vet to recommend a food mix for your diabetic hamster."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid giving sugary treats.",
      "content": "Avoid giving sugary treats. Sugary treats, such as fresh fruits, processed treats, and even carrots are difficult for a diabetic hamster to break down. Instead, try giving it washed and cut celery, broccoli, or spinach as a treat. Only give your hamster one treat per day and make sure to remove the treat from the cage if it is not consumed within a day. Fresh vegetables may rot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed your hamster a high protein and high fiber diet.",
      "content": "Feed your hamster a high protein and high fiber diet. Diabetic hamsters should eat a diet made up of 10-15% protein and 50% fiber. You can supplement their regular hamster feed by giving them sources of protein, such as plain tofu, cooked chicken and turkey, or scrambled egg. These should be given in small amounts daily. Some fiber sources include: Alfalfa. Timothy hay. Vegetables such as broccoli, cucumber, cauliflower, and spinach."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your hamster complex carbs.",
      "content": "Give your hamster complex carbs. Carbohydrates should be reduced but not completely removed from their diet. When giving hamsters carbohydrates, always choose complex carbs, such as oat bran, whole-grain pasta, and brown rice. Most hamster food mixes will contain an adequate amount of carbohydrates, ask your vet if you should supplement the food with complex carbs."

    {
      "title": "Ensure your hamster exercises regularly.",
      "content": "Ensure your hamster exercises regularly . Regular exercise can also help to prevent and manage diabetes in hamsters. Make sure that your hamster has lots of space to move around their cage. You should also give them access to a running wheel. This can delay the onset of diabetes in some hamsters. Make sure to purchase a running wheel that is plastic or mesh to reduce the chances of injury. If your hamster's back bends while running on the wheel, you need to get a larger wheel. Hamster balls can also be a great form of exercise if used correctly. Make sure the ball is clear and that the area is carpeted. You should always watch the hamster while using an exercise ball."

    {
      "title": "Talk with your vet about treatment options.",
      "content": "Talk with your vet about treatment options. There are some medications that have been successful for treating diabetes in hamsters. Medical treatment of diabetes can be risky because the wrong dose could lead to serious health complications and even death. Ask your vet if there are any medical treatments that are suitable for your hamster's specific health needs. You should consider the cost associated with different types of treatment when making your decision."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try oral medications.",
      "content": "Try oral medications. Glipizide and Fenugreek are common oral medications for treating diabetes in hamsters. Both of these treatment options are administered orally and will need to be prescribed by a vet. To administer, follow the instructions provided by your vet. Glipizide tablets are usually ground up and mixed with water and then fed to the hamster. Fenugreek comes in tablets or powder that are crushed and brewed into a tea and then fed to the hamster. It can be difficult to control the dose. Keep in mind that there are possible complications associated with these oral medications, including comas. Talk to your vet about the risks before your hamster starts treatment."

    {
      "title": "Use insulin injections.",
      "content": "Use insulin injections. Insulin can be purchased over the counter, but you should speak with a vet about proper dosage and how to administer the injections. The injections will likely be given twice a day. However, your vet may need to adjust the dosage based on how your hamster responds. If you choose to give your hamster insulin, it will need to have its blood tested weekly to see how it is responding to the medication. Because hamsters are so small, it can be difficult to find the right insulin dosage to use. Talk to your vet about precautions you can take to avoid accidentally overdosing your hamster."

      "title": "Look for excessive drinking and urination.",
      "content": "Look for excessive drinking and urination. One of the first signs of diabetes in hamsters is excessive urination. For example, you may notice that the area of their cage used for urination is constantly wet. This excessive urination is also accompanied by excessive drinking, and you will likely be filling their water more frequently. This is a potential sign that your hamster has diabetes. Hamsters with diabetes will also eat more, but this can be challenging to notice because even healthy hamsters hoard food. Keep in mind that excessive drinking and urination could be a sign of a different health problem that isn't diabetes."

      "title": "Notice if your hamster loses weight quickly.",
      "content": "Notice if your hamster loses weight quickly. Hamsters with diabetes, despite eating and drinking more than normal, will lose weight rapidly. Weigh your hamsters once a day if you suspect that they may have diabetes. If it has lost 10% or more of its body weight in a short period of time, it may have diabetes. Place your hamster on a kitchen scale at the same time each day in order to weigh it. Weight loss in your hamster could also be a sign of a different health issue other than diabetes."

      "title": "Check for yellow nails.",
      "content": "Check for yellow nails. The appearance of thick yellow nails is relatively easy to see and often indicates that your hamster has diabetes. That being said, yellow nails can be common in hamsters. Don't rely on this symptom alone when diagnosing a hamster with diabetes. Instead, test your hamster for diabetes if yellow nails develop."

    {
      "title": "Test its urine for glucose.",
      "content": "Test its urine for glucose. You can diagnose your hamster for diabetes at home using Keto-Diastix test strips. These can be purchased at your local pharmacy. Simply place your hamster in a small enclosure with no bedding. When the hamster urinates, dip the test strip in the urine. The strip will change colours. Compare the strip to the information on the package to see if your hamster has diabetes. It should not take longer than 20 minutes for a diabetic hamster to urinate. If your hamster does not urinate within 20 minutes, return it to its cage and try again later."

    {
      "title": "Take your hamster to the vet.",
      "content": "Take your hamster to the vet. If your hamster tests positive for diabetes, you should take it to the vet to discuss treatment options. Your vet will likely ask you to change their diet and may suggest other medical options depending on the age and health of your hamster. If your hamster is showing signs of diabetes, but a urine test comes back negative, you should still seek medical attention. They may have another health issue that needs treatment."
