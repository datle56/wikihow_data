Make sure your entire hand is slightly tilted towards you. Spectators should be able to see the face of the coin easily, but turning your hand to you will make the trick easier. Use a larger coin, especially if you are a beginner. A quarter or half dollar works well. You can hold the coin in whichever hand feels more comfortable. For the purpose of explaining the trick, the coin will be in the left hand."

[1] X Research source As you drop the coin to palm it, squeeze your right hand over your left thumb. Doing this will make it look like you're grabbing the coin. Then pull your left thumb out. Create misdirection here by moving your right hand, the one without the coin, away from your left. People will expect that the coin is in your right hand and follow your movement.

Then grab a dollar from your wallet, or ask someone for a dollar bill. The nickel will be used to balance the folded dollar on your thumb. Your audience shouldn’t know that you have the nickel. [3] X Research source This is a simple trick to do pretty much anywhere. A nickel works well because it’s small and heavy enough to provide a counterbalance."

Then unfold the bill from the back to show the other side of the bill. What you are doing here is showing that this is an ordinary bill. While you are unfolding it, you are flipping the bill while keeping the nickel in place with your thumb. This is a simple flourish move. While doing this, talk to your audience explaining that there is nothing magical or special about this bill."

      "title": "Fold your bill around the nickel.",
      "content": "Fold your bill around the nickel. Fold the bill in half the long way, hot dog style. With the nickel still placed on the backside of the bill, fold the bill up. Keep the nickel in place with your thumb and middle finger while you fold the half of the bill down and toward you with your index fingers. Then fold your bill in half again. You will now have a bill that’s folded into fourths. Keep the nickel pinched between your thumb and middle finger, sliding it down to the lower half of your bill. This will allow you to fold the upper half over it. Once you’ve folded the bill in half, position it so the crease is on the bottom and the two open ends are at the top. Let the nickel slide down into the crease. Then, using the same folding method, fold the top of the bill down toward you again. Pinch and crease the folds with your free hand. This will help to trap the nickel in place."

      "content": "Balance or “levitate” the bill. With the nickel at one end of the bill, pinch the ends of the bill between your thumbs and forefingers. Slowly release your grip on the bill with the hand that is not holding the nickel. While you do this, release your forefinger that is pinching the nickel. The nickel will balance on your thumb, making it look like you are slightly levitating the bill. You can turn your hands slightly and position your other fingers to block the view of your thumb which is balancing the bill for more of an effect. If you have a good sense of balance, you can also move your hand up and down slightly to give some motion to the trick. Keep talking to help distract your audience. Explain how you are using your magical energy to float or levitate the dollar."

You may have to loosen the folds on the bill slightly to get the nickel to drop. When you hand the bill over, quickly slide the nickel into your pocket while the audience is distracted."

This trick does involve a bit of preparation. You will take the two Jokers and place each in the deck facing the opposite direction from the rest of the deck. [4] X Research source To help you with practicing, you can write the number 43 on one Joker, and the number 18 on the other. During the performance of this trick you don’t need to have these numbers written on your Joker cards, you just need to remember each number."

Place that pile on the bottom. [5] X Research source You have now placed the Jokers in the 10 and 29 positions in your deck. This allows you to ask a spectator to cut a third of the deck. It is unlikely that the spectator will cut before the 10th card, your first Joker, and after the 29th card, your second Joker."

Once the deck is cut, place the pile that was cut from the deck down on the table. If you don’t feel confident that your spectator will cut the deck correctly, you can hold the deck and run your thumb along the edges of the card asking the spectator to say stop. This will give you control over how fast you go, ensuring that when a third of the deck is cut, it is after the first Joker and before the second."

Once again, if you want to ensure that the cut is correct, run your thumb along the edges of the cards and have your spectator tell you to stop at about the halfway point."

You will have three separate piles again. The Joker should be the last card in your break. So when you separate the cards, the card to the right of each Joker is the bottom card on the first two piles. You will once again have three piles of cards.

Count out 18 cards, flipping the 18th card over. This last card will be Spectator One’s card. Point to the other Joker and say this one will tell you the location of the second card. Continue counting up from 18 to get to the 43rd card, which is Spectator Two’s card. Flip it over to reveal. This trick uses simple math to help you find the cards. The Jokers mark the number of cards you will count to find the right ones. The way to remember the positions of cards is simple. The first position, 9, when doubled is 18. 18+25=43, which is the position of the second card. During the trick, keep your audience engaged by spinning a story about two tricky Jokers who have been spying on the cards. These Jokers have been speaking to you, telling where to find the spectators’ cards in the deck."
