Dogs have a different pH skin balance than humans, so avoiding human hair dye is essential to ensuring your dog’s comfort and safety. Instead, seek out alternative dyes that can be found naturally. The less synthetic the dyes, the better they will be for your dog. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use edible foods. Edible foods, that are safe for your dog to eat, will produce light hair dyes. These dyes can be made in a variety of ways , from juicing fresh vegetables to boiling and dehydrating. However, the sugar in many fruits can also cause your dog’s fur to become sticky, and can also cause mild skin irritations. Try to stick to vegetables or fruits with low sugar contents. [3] X Research source Try using vegetables like carrots, beets, and spinach, or spices like turmeric. [4] X Research source Although fruit dyes should try and be avoided, they do often produce the most vibrant color. Try to thin or dilute any dyes made from juice to avoid skin irritation. Most dyes made from edible foods are impermanent and will begin to fade within a week."

Some food dyes are made with artificial dyes that have been linked to negative health effects if congested on a daily basis for many years. However, these dyes should not pose any problems when used in dyeing dog fur. Try using all natural organic food coloring to avoid unwanted artificial colors, like India Tree. Food coloring will be semi-impermanent and hold color longer than dyes made from edible foods."

      "content": "Apply ointment to your dog’s eyes. Apply a sterile ophthalmic ointment to your dog's eyes, especially if you plan on dyeing the fur around their eyes or on their face. Ophthalmic ointments will help prevent any dye irritating their eyes and will reduce the chance of infection in case dye invariably does get in their eye. [6] X Research source Although using ointment is a good idea regardless of where you are dyeing, it won’t be essential if you are dyeing minimal parts of their body, like the tail. Each ointment will come with a set of directions for applying the ointment in your dog’s eye."

      "content": "Comb or brush their fur. Once your dog is clean and relatively dry, use a comb or brush to prepare their fur for the application of the hair dye. Simply brush the area you plan on dyeing with a comb to straighten their fur so that the dye can be applied as evenly as possible. The better and more thorough their hair is brushed the easier it will be to evenly apply the hair dye."

Hair chalk can be rubbed directly into your dog’s fur, whereas bottle dyes will need to be applied by hand with gloves. However you are applying the dye, be sure to do so evenly so that your dog’s fur isn’t patchy. Make sure to cover the entire area you are dying before going over it with a second coat.

Dry dyes, like chalk, will only need to be left for a few minutes before they set, whereas dyes that have been sprayed on will need to sit for around 15-20 minutes. You can use a hairdryer on a low setting to decrease your dog’s drying time."
