      "content": "The glitch was patched in 2013, but it may still be possible to use. Basically, the glitch isn’t a sure thing anymore—some Skyrim players nowadays report getting it just fine, and others say it’s no longer available for them. Patch 1.9 (in 2013) removed the original glitch from the game, but current players report being able to get the glitch slightly differently; it isn’t infinite anymore and can only be used 2 to 3 times. [1] X Research source If you’re willing to experiment, you might still be able to get the Oghma Infinium glitch by following this guide. If you can’t get it, it’s likely due to Bethesda’s official patch fix. It’s also unclear if the glitch is available for specific platforms. PlayStation, PC, Switch, and Xbox players all have mixed reviews—some players get it, some don’t. Skyrim players in 2013 were understandably annoyed when patch 1.9 was released since the glitch was an easy way to level up !"

Some players report having the best results when using an empty bookshelf, so fast-travel to a home in Skyrim with a bookshelf you can use. If you own a house with a bookshelf, that’s the ideal spot to go. [2] X Research source Clear the bookshelf if you have to. You can do this by opening the bookshelf and removing everything on it, minimizing the chances of breaking the glitch. One of the easiest homes to get is Whiterun’s Breezehome. After completing the Bleak Falls Barrow quest, you can buy it from Proventus Avenicci for 5,000 gold."

For each platform, that means: [5] X Research source PlayStation: Press X, L2, and R2 at the same time. Xbox: Press A, LT, and RT at the same time. PC: Press E, M1, and M2 at the same time.

For example, you could try selecting the Path of Magic three times in a row or select each path once—any combination should work!
