      "content": "This step varies slightly, depending on which game version you have. If you're playing Pokémon Sun, go to the Altar of the Sunne during the nighttime. If you're playing Pokémon Moon, go to the Altar of the Moone during the daytime. Either way, once you're there, go through the rift to appear at either the Altar of the Moone in Pokémon Sun or the Altar of the Sunne in Pokémon Moon. The fastest way to make it there is to use the Charizard Glide."

Once you're there, you'll see a cutscene where a Cosmog appears. After the cutscene ends, go up to the Cosmog and press A to get your very own Cosmog."
