      "content": "Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar with 1 cup (240 ml) of warm water. Pour each of the ingredients into a spray bottle . Then, shake the solution gently until it’s mixed thoroughly. [1] X Research source White vinegar is a natural disinfectant and stain remover, making it a perfect combination for stubborn dog pee stains. If you use a spray bottle that had something else in it previously, wash it thoroughly before adding the new mixture."

      "title": "Spray your mixture on the urine stain and let it sit for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Spray your mixture on the urine stain and let it sit for 15 minutes. Hold the spray bottle 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) over the stain and pull the trigger to apply the solution. Coat the entire stain with the solution so your carpet is completely saturated, and then let it soak in for 15 minutes. [2] X Research source Vinegar works well on dry or wet urine stains. Avoid patting the vinegar dry; it needs time to soak into the pad underneath the carpet to fully eliminate the odor."

      "title": "Dab the carpet with a cloth or sponge to remove excess vinegar.",
      "content": "Dab the carpet with a cloth or sponge to remove excess vinegar. Press onto the wet sprayed stain with an old cleaning cloth or sponge. Work across the entire stain so the carpet isn’t soaking wet. Avoid rubbing the carpet—stick to patting—otherwise, the vinegar and urine will work deeper into the carpet. When you’re finished, immediately wash the cloth or throw it away. [3] X Research source Wear cleaning gloves if you don’t want to get any vinegar or urine on your hands while you’re working."

      "title": "Cover the vinegar solution with baking soda and leave it for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover the vinegar solution with baking soda and leave it for 30 minutes. Coat the entire surface of the stain with a thin layer of baking soda, and press it into the fabric with a cloth. Once the baking soda is applied, let it sit for about 30 minutes or until it forms a dry crust on top of the carpet. [4] X Research source Baking soda has natural absorbent and antibacterial properties, which makes it perfect for lifting and cleaning tough stains. [5] X Research source If you’re worried about the vinegar and baking soda changing the color of your carpet, test the mixture in a small, inconspicuous area before covering the stain. Mix a few drops of your favorite essential oil with the baking soda before sprinkling it on for an extra odor-fighting boost. Tea tree , lavender , or lemongrass oil are all good options."

      "title": "Vacuum the baking soda once it’s dry.",
      "content": "Vacuum the baking soda once it’s dry. When the baking soda is completely dry (after about an hour or so), vacuum over the area to lift it out of your carpet. Go over the spot multiple times in different directions to ensure that all of it is removed. When you’re done, smell the stained area to see if there’s still a urine scent. [6] X Research source If you still smell urine, apply the solution again or try another cleaning method."

      "title": "Dry up as much urine as possible with paper towels.",
      "content": "Dry up as much urine as possible with paper towels. Set a layer of paper towels over a fresh, wet urine stain, and firmly press the paper towel into the carpet. Use dabbing motions until the carpet is as dry as you can get it. Avoid scrubbing stain, as this could work the urine deeper into the pad underneath. [7] X Research source Try stepping on the paper towel to apply more pressure and absorb more liquid. This cleaning method works best on fresh stains that are still wet."

      "title": "Spray an enzymatic cleaner directly on the stain.",
      "content": "Spray an enzymatic cleaner directly on the stain. Hold the bottle of cleaner about 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) from the stain and spray it until the carpet is completely saturated. [8] X Research source Enzymatic cleaners break down protein bonds in the stain, making the stain and odor easier to remove. [9] X Research source Look for enzymatic cleaners specifically made for dog urine and pet stains to get the most out of the product."

      "title": "Let the cleaner soak into your carpet for 24 hours and dry on its own.",
      "content": "Let the cleaner soak into your carpet for 24 hours and dry on its own. Read the cleaner’s label to see how long it takes to work. Typically, enzymatic cleaners need up to 24 hours to fully dissolve a stain. Following the cleaner’s instructions, let it soak into the stain for the desired amount of time. Then, sniff your carpet to see if it still smells. [10] X Research source If it still smells, you may need to shampoo your carpet ."

      "title": "Combine hydrogen peroxide, liquid dish soap, and baking soda.",
      "content": "Combine hydrogen peroxide , liquid dish soap , and baking soda. Stir 1 1 ⁄ 2 US tbsp (22 ml) of hydrogen peroxide, 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of dish soap, and 2 tbsp (28 g) of baking soda together in a plastic bowl until they form a paste. A foaming, bubbly reaction may occur—that’s normal! Hydrogen peroxide breaks up chemical bonds and makes stains invisible while baking soda and dish soap deodorize and disinfect it. [11] X Research source This DIY cleaning solution works best on light-colored carpets for dry or wet urine stains. If you want to use it on a dark carpet, test a small amount on the edge of the fabric before treating the stain, as hydrogen peroxide can cause discoloration."

      "title": "Apply the paste to the urine stain with a spoon and leave it for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Apply the paste to the urine stain with a spoon and leave it for 1 hour. Use a spoon to scoop and spread the paste onto the dry or wet urine stain. Press down on the paste to work it into the carpet. Once the paste is spread over the entire stain, leave it alone for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. The baking soda and hydrogen peroxide react with one another to trap and deodorize the urine odor so your carpet doesn’t smell. [12] X Research source The longer you leave the paste on the stain, the more likely the stench will go away."

      "title": "Dab the paste off your carpet with a wet cloth.",
      "content": "Dab the paste off your carpet with a wet cloth. Wet a cleaning cloth with warm water and wring it out. Then, push the damp cloth firmly into the paste to lift it out of your carpet. Rewet the cleaning cloth if it dries out, and keep dabbing the stain until you remove as much of the paste as you can."

      "content": "Dry your carpet with paper towels or a dry cleaning cloth. Place a layer of paper towels over the carpet’s wet spot and press down to absorb any leftover liquid. Avoid wiping the paper towel from side to side, as this can push the water further into the carpet. If there’s leftover paste on the carpet, let it dry completely and vacuum over the area to remove it."

      "title": "Pour a small amount of club soda over the entire stain.",
      "content": "Pour a small amount of club soda over the entire stain. Slowly pour club soda over a fresh dog urine stain. A fizzing reaction may occur, which is completely normal—it’s working! Let it sit on the stain for 10 to 15 minutes. Club soda is essentially water with carbon dioxide and salt. Because of its weak acidity and bubbly nature, it can help lift and remove new wet stains. [13] X Research source This cleaning method works best on fresh urine stains."

      "title": "Blot the stain with a dry cleaning cloth or sponge.",
      "content": "Blot the stain with a dry cleaning cloth or sponge. Place a cleaning rag on top of the stain and press firmly to lift out the soda. If the cloth gets too wet, wring it out or use another to continue blotting the stain. Do this over the entire stain until it’s damp. Avoid wiping back and forth with the cloth, as this could work the stain and odor deeper into the carpet."

      "content": "Dry the area with paper towels. Cover the stain with 2 layers of paper towels and pat it dry. Push down with your hand to absorb any club soda deep within the carpet pad. Keep pressing across the entirety of the stain until you can’t pull up any more liquid. Try wearing shoes and stepping on the paper towels to apply more force and absorb more liquid."

      "title": "Spray an air freshener on your carpet for a refreshing scent.",
      "content": "Spray an air freshener on your carpet for a refreshing scent. Club soda will help lift the stain but may not completely deodorize the carpet. To compensate, pick your favorite scent of air freshener or essential oil and spray it on the carpet to cover up any residual odors. Spritz enough to mask the smell, then check your carpet in a few hours to see if you can still smell the urine. Look for odor-eliminating air fresheners to kill odor-causing bacteria rather than covering them up. If you still smell urine, you may need to try another cleaning method."
