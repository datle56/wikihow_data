      "title": "Bring a sweater.",
      "content": "Bring a sweater. When you're traveling, you might be changing climates, and it may be different air temperatures in the airplane or the airport. To be prepared for that, wear a lightweight sweater or jacket, or bring one with you if it's too warm outside to wear it as you're traveling to the airport. [1] X Research source Katie Quinn. Stylist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020. Even if you’re going to a warm climate, bringing along a zip-up sweatshirt or a simple cardigan sweater is a good idea. Some knits can look pretty stylish. Dark clothing is better because it will hide spills that could happen on the plane. If you’re traveling in winter, you might want to bring a puffy down jacket if you have one because it won’t wrinkle if you need to place it into the overhead bin. To make your life easier, start removing layered items, such as a sweatshirt before you get to the metal detector. A lightweight jacket could also work."

      "title": "Wear a bra that has no metal in it.",
      "content": "Wear a bra that has no metal in it. It depends on the bra, of course, but some underwire bras can set off airport metal detectors. That costs you time. It’s also likely to cause you to have to succumb to a pat-down inspection. Not only are those sometimes embarrassing, but it will delay you. Instead, try metal-free bras. A simple padded brassiere could work, and sports bras are perfect for airport travel. If you like your underwire bra, just pack it in your suitcase instead of wearing it to the airport. Underwire bras could also be uncomfortable during a long flight."

      "title": "Wear comfortable bottoms.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable bottoms. You’ll want to be comfortable at the airport (no stiletto heels!), but that doesn’t mean you can’t still look good. Victoria Beckham has said the airport is her runway. Lots of people end up in the airport in sweatpants or a track suit because they're so comfortable. If that's not for you, try a nice pair of leggings instead. Match them with long sweaters, hoodies, or long tops. You can dress up a dressed down look by carrying a nice, statement handbag. Celebrities tend to wear sunglasses inside airports a lot and hats too. Go for comfort but with style. Celebrities walk through airports all the time, and they manage to look both comfortable and stylish. Try relaxed trousers with a blazer like actress Cate Blanchett. Try jeans with flats and a simple black blouse like the model Miranda Kerr."

      "title": "Wear loose clothing.",
      "content": "Wear loose clothing. Loose sweaters are extremely comfortable, especially if you pair them with jeans or leggings. Loose fitting dresses or pants are also a good choice for flying. A loose sweater will keep you warm and will feel comfortable, including if you end up sitting in the airport or on the plane for hours. [2] X Research source If you want to wear a skirt, go with a long maxi skirt and don't choose anything too tight and short. Wear an oversize pashmina scarf with the sweater (or just with a shirt) and it can almost double as a blanket on the plane. The other benefit of loose clothing is that it can help prevent blood clots. Although synthetic clothing can be flammable, it's also less likely to wrinkle, which can make it a good choice for planes. A graphic T-shirt is another option if you’re in a warm climate. It’s casual but still trendy, so you will look stylish without sacrificing comfort. Avoid T-shirts with offensive sayings, though. It could cause you trouble in an airport."

      "title": "Layer it up.",
      "content": "Layer it up. Often when you’re traveling, you will be shifting between different climates or temperatures. Maybe you’re going somewhere warmer or colder. Or maybe the temperature on the plane will shift. Come prepared. If you layer clothes on your body, you won’t have to pack as much. You can remove one layer (say a sweater) and enjoy the tank top underneath once you land somewhere warmer (or vice versa). You should dress for the colder climate if you’re flying between locales with different temperatures. Wearing a Pashmina, shawl, scarves, or wrap can be turned into makeshift pillows, allowing you to sleep more easily on the plane, if necessary. [3] X Research source Get prepared for the plane to be cold at times even if the climate outside is not. You will also want to wear fabrics that breathe and allow air to pass, such as silk or cotton. You will feel cleaner and fresher for longer."

      "title": "Leave the belt off.",
      "content": "Leave the belt off. If you wear a belt to the airport, it’s going to be a big hassle. Save yourself some time, and leave it in your suitcase or at home. At security, you will probably be asked to remove your belt if you wear one. That means it will take you longer to get through the metal detector. It also means you might annoy people behind you. Although if you are a member of TSA PRE CHECK you maybe able to keep your belt on but it depends on the airport you go to. [4] X Research source A key point to remember when dressing for the airport is convenience is important. Consider how to make the experience easier. Make sure to choose pants that will stay up without a belt if you forgot one, though!"

      "title": "Avoid lots of jewelry.",
      "content": "Avoid lots of jewelry. If you’re wearing a ton of jewelry to the airport – or hard to remove pieces, like small earrings with small clasps – it could be a hassle. At the metal detector, you may have to remove most of it. Body piercings could set it off and significantly delay you. The other problem with wearing a lot of jewelry is that it could make you a mark for thieves or pick pockets. It’s usually not a good idea to flash your wealth in an airport. You could keep the jewelry in a pocket within your carry on, and then put it on once you land and leave the destination airport."

      "title": "Go simple on the beauty routine.",
      "content": "Go simple on the beauty routine. Lots of makeup and elaborate hair probably looks great when you board the plane and not so great after a multiple hour flight. Simpler is better! Your skin is likely to feel dehydrated after a flight, so do bring a small bottle of moisturizer and tube of chapstick. Pull your hair in a ponytail! Leave behind big bottles of beauty products. Maybe you like using your own shampoo. Or maybe it’s saline solution, sunscreen, or expensive face lotion you’re bringing along. You know the rules. You can only get bottles the size of 3 fluid ounces (89 mL) through security. Follow the rules, and it will go faster."

      "title": "Bring a big purse.",
      "content": "Bring a big purse. It can be really handy in an airport to carry a big purse. For one, you’ll have somewhere to put items you buy, like reading material or gum. For another, a nice, statement purse can dress up an otherwise low-key outfit, allowing you to look chic in an airport while staying comfortable. A big purse can almost double as another carry-on bag. Some women like to bring a hair brush and makeup on the plane with them, so they can freshen up right before they land. A too-small purse can be easier to lose. A larger purse is almost always a better bet when going to an airport. Clothing with pockets can also be useful."

      "title": "Wear comfortable shoes.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable shoes. You’re going to regret it if you try to walk around an airport in heels. It will be even worse if you have to run because you’re late. Save the heels for the suitcase. Sure, they look good, but you may have to walk for long destinations, and if your plane is late for a connecting flight, you might have to step it up. A better choice in airport shoes: comfortable flats that easily slip off your feet. That makes them easy to remove at security. Wearing your heaviest shoes, though, can reduce the weight of your luggage and free up more room for backing. You will also want to avoid boots or sandals with excessive lacing, buckles, zippers or the like, again because they will take forever to take off and put back on at security. Avoid tight shoes because your feet will likely expand over a long flight. If you're a girl who is under 13, you can wear any shoes as long as they don't have metal. That is because if you're under 13, you keep your shoes on at security. Or if you're pre check you can wear anything as long it doesn't have metal, because you keep your shoes on."

      "title": "Wear socks.",
      "content": "Wear socks. You might think those flip flops are comfortable, but they don’t provide much support. Worse, they can be a germ haven. Think about how many people have walked through the metal detector before you. Do you really want to go through with bare feet? You’ll likely be asked to remove your shoes. Although if you're under 13, pre check or over 75 it's most likely you're not going to be asked to remove your shoes. Wear socks to protect your feet. They will also stay warmer there if the air conditioning makes the airport a bit cold or the plane is chilly inside. Socks will also help cushion your feet as you walk through the airport. Some airports are quite a trek from one side to the other or even require taking a tram."

      "title": "Wear compression socks or leg wear.",
      "content": "Wear compression socks or leg wear. Getting blood cots is a danger of flying when you will be in cramped conditions. There are special garments designed to help prevent this. Support your pregnancy. If you’re pregnant, check with your doctor before flying. However, some doctors will recommend that you wear special clothing when flying. Some pregnant women wear compression leg wear or socks while flying. These will help stop your legs from swelling because they spur blood circulation. You can usually get these garments at drug stores or pharmacies or online through travel-supply stores. Wearing loose-fitting clothing can also reduce the possibility of getting blood clots. Avoid super tight clothing, socks, nylons, or even skinny jeans. Some people with other preexisting medical conditions may want to wear the garments too. The same is true of travelers who fly a lot. They help avoid a condition called deep vein thrombosis"
