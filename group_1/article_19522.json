      "content": "Look for mouse droppings to tell you’re dealing with mice. The best way to figure out what’s in your walls is to take a look inside dark, quiet areas, like pantries, cabinets, and closets. Try to find mouse droppings, or mouse poop, which are little oval pellets (and there’s usually a lot of them in one spot). Once you find those droppings, you’ll know you’re dealing with mice running around your walls. [2] X Research source Mice droppings are usually around 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) long with pointed ends. Rat droppings are usually around 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) long with blunt ends. Controlling mice and rats in the walls is pretty much the same, but rat traps are usually bigger to accommodate their larger bodies."

      "title": "Set up traps near where the mice live.",
      "content": "Set up traps near where the mice live. Although mice might live in your walls primarily, they almost always take a trip out into your home for food at night. Try to find the area where the mice exit the wall (usually, there will be a small hole near the floor). Then, set up your trap of choice near the hole so the mice have to encounter it when they leave. There are a couple of different mice trap styles to choose from, including: [3] X Research source Two-door cage traps: this non-lethal trap lures the mice in with food (like peanut butter), then shuts a door behind them. Once you catch a mouse, you’ll need to take the trap and release the live mouse into the wild, far away from your home so they don’t run back inside. Snap traps: the classic mouse trap, it kills mice by snapping down on top of them. Bucket traps: these involve filling a bucket full of water and baiting the middle with food (usually by filling up a metal can with food, then hanging it on a metal rod to balance on the bucket ledge). When the mice go after it, they’ll drown in the bucket. [4] X Research source Glue board/sticky traps: these traps work by trapping the mice in place. Usually, they kill mice by suffocation, since the mouse will try to bite their way out of the trap and then get glue in their mouth. [5] X Research source However, glue traps are widely considered inhumane, and they are even illegal in parts of the US and the UK. Electric traps: when mice enter the trap, they’ll get shocked with a small burst of electricity. It wouldn’t be harmful to us, but it would kill the mice instantly. [6] X Research source Poison traps and deterrent sprays are sometimes recommended in mice control, but they aren’t as effective as other traps, and they won’t get rid of an entire mouse infestation.

      "content": "Bait the traps with food, like peanut butter or meat. Crunchy peanut butter, freshly-fried bacon, fruit, nutmeats, or gumdrops are popular choices that might tempt a mouse. When you set up your traps, be sure to load them up with tasty treats to get the mice to investigate. [8] X Research source Try to eliminate other food sources, like pet food bowls or garbage bags. That way, the mice have no choice but to check out your traps. Although poison traps are sometimes an option, they aren’t ideal for mice in the walls. If a mouse crawls back into the wall to die, you probably won’t be able to retrieve the body very easily."

      "content": "Angle the traps so the baited end is closest to the wall. If you know that the mice are living in your walls, you want to tempt them out with the food. Set the baited traps with the food facing the wall so that the mice can smell it. Add 1 trap per meter (yard) along the wall to cover the entire section. [9] X Research source Or, if you can see the visible mouse hole, add 5 to 10 traps nearby. Mice and rats usually have 6 to 12 pups on average. [10] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. If you see one mouse, you can probably bet there are at least a few more in your walls. Be sure to keep the traps out of the way of children and pets."

Then, pick up the trap, trying not to touch the dead mouse directly. Throw the mouse into the trash, then set up the trap again with new food. [12] X Research source Dead mice can carry dangerous diseases that are harmful to human health. Never touch a dead mouse directly, and throw away dead mice as soon as you can."

Spread the traps out further down the walls or pick a different spot in your home where you think mice might be lurking. Small animals love dark, quiet spaces, so they might also be in your attic or your crawl space. [13] X Research source If your traps haven’t worked after a week or so, call a professional pest control company."

Walk outside the perimeter of your home and seal the openings with a permanent material, like silicone caulk. Once the mice leave, they won’t be able to get back in, which means they’ll leave your walls. [14] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. Mice usually don’t stay in your home all day—they’ll leave to go find food elsewhere. If you can seal the entry points while they’re gone, you can get them out of your walls in no time."
