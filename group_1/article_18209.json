Click the checkbox next to each category of files or items you want to delete from your computer, making sure to uncheck any checkboxes next to items you want to keep. Some of the categories are as follows, though you may see more categories than these: Windows Update — Removes the last Windows Update files from your computer (this does not remove the current update). Service Pack Backup Files — Removes files left over from the most recent SP update. Downloaded Program Files — Removes unnecessary files from programs. Temporary Internet Files — Removes saved Internet files. System created Windows Error Reporting — Removes error reporting files. Recycle Bin — Removes any files stored in the Recycle Bin. Temporary files — Removes other temporary files created by programs or web use. User file history — Removes browsing and other histories. Everything in this menu can be deleted safely, but removing things like the Windows Update cache will prevent you from being able to roll back to the previous version of the Windows update."

Mercer also recommends using CC Cleaner, a free third-party tool, to clean up files in Windows 7. \"It's the most reputable, and it works,\" he explains. \"CC Cleaner goes through and gets rid of all the junk files. You just scan it and run the cleaner.\""

To delete a file or folder, select it, press the delete key on your keyboard, and follow the on-screen instructions. You may notice a lot of large files and folders in C:\\Users\\(yourusername)\\AppData. When you uninstall programs, the associated files are not always removed from this folder.
