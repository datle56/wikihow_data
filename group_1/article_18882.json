Chances of encountering a Haunter on any given floor is about 1-15%; higher floors will yield better chances. You will have much more luck catching a Gastly, but the process of evolving it takes longer. An alternative to catching a Haunter is catching a Ghastly, which can then be evolved into a Haunter by levelling up to LvL25 and using a rare candy. Keep in mind that both Ghastly and Haunter are Ghost-type Pokémon, making them immune to Normal, Fighting, and Ground attacks. If you catch a Gastly, you will need to evolve it into a Haunter before proceeding."
