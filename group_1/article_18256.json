      "content": "Pick or purchase ripe plums . Look for plums that are in good shape, free of blemishes, wrinkles and spots. [1] X Research source Plums should be frozen when they are at the peak of their ripeness, deliciously sweet and flavorful. Don't freeze plums that are a little green or overripe, because they won't have good flavor or texture when you thaw them out. Do a taste test before freezing a batch of plums. Bite into one of the plums. If purply-red juice drips down your chin, and the plum is sweet and flavorful, the rest are probably good to freeze. If it's too tart, or too grainy, you might not want to freeze this batch of plums. [2] X Research source If the plums are a little hard, you can leave them at room temperature for a few days to ripen. Freeze them when they are just ripe."

      "content": "Put the plum slices in a freezer storage bag and freeze. Fill the bag to within an inch of the top, and squeeze out as much excess air as possible (or use a vacuum sealer, which sucks out the air for you). You can use a straw to suck out the extra air and close the bag tightly. Air trapped in the bag will cause the plums to get freezer burn more quickly. Dry-frozen slices of plum will keep in the freezer for up to 6 months. To keep plums for longer than 6 months, you need to pack them in syrup to prevent freezer burn."

      "title": "Peel the plums.",
      "content": "Peel the plums. Packing plums in syrup and freezing them, then reconstituting them causes the peels to lose their pleasant texture and get a little mushy. You can skip this step if you prefer to keep the peels, but it might be worth the extra effort in the long run. You can peel plums using the same technique that is used to peel tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Use a knife to make an \"x\" in the skin at the tip of each plum. Place the plums in the boil water and blanch them for 30 seconds. Remove them from the boiling water and plunge them in the ice bath for 30 seconds. Remove them from the ice bath and pull away the skin in strips to peel the plums. Blanching the plums loosens the skin, making it easy to peel."

Continue until you've sliced and pitted every plum. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source If you wish, you can cut the plums into smaller slices. The plums will retain their texture better if they're left in halves. If you're worried about the plums darkening in the freezer, you can toss them with lemon juice, coating their surfaces. The citric acid preserves their color. You may also buy a product you can sprinkle on the fruit to achieve the same effect. If you'd prefer not to cut the plums in half, you still need to remove the core. Buy a plum or peach corer, which easily pops out the core without cutting into the rest of the fruit's flesh."

Put the plums in a bowl and pour in just enough solution to cover them completely. Here are a few options to use as a sugar solution: [7] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source Light syrup. To make this, just heat 3 cups of water and add 1 cup of sugar in a saucepan. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves, then cool the solution before you pour it over the plums. Heavy syrup. If you want a very sweet solution, heat 3 cups of water and 2 cups of sugar in a saucepan. Stir until the sugar dissolves, cool the syrup, then pour it over the plums. [8] X Research source Fruit juice. Try plum juice, grape juice or apple juice. There's no need to heat it; just pour enough over the plums to cover. Plain sugar. Some people use plain sugar to draw out the plum's juices. This is a delicious, but extremely sweet and sugary choice. To do it, pour white sugar into the bottom of your freezer container. Add a layer of plums. Sprinkle more sugar over the layer. Continue layering plums and sugar until the container is full."
