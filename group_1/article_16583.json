You will need this information when completing the quitclaim deed. The legal description of property should be under the words “Legal Description” or just “Description.” There are generally two types of legal descriptions: Subdivision description. If the property is part of a subdivision, then the legal description on the deed will list the name of the subdivision and the lot number. You may find the plat map for the subdivision in the same county office. Metes and bounds. This description situates the property according to points of reference, such as landmarks. A metes and bounds description will often tell a person where to begin and then where to go to walk off the property’s boundary. For example: “Commencing at the intersection of the west line of Hampton Road and the north line of Thompson Lane; thence west 200 feet along the north line of Thompson Lane, ….”"
