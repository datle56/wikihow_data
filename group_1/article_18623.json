You should create a thin coat of baking soda, so get a large box of baking soda for each room that you plan to treat. If it clumps in spots, use your hand to spread it out. [1] X Research source You can also add Borax to baking soda for better results. Simply measure one part baking soda with one part Borax and mix well. Add a few drops of an essential oil if you'd like it to be scented. Then use as you would baking soda."
