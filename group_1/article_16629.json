      "content": "Decide if you’ll wrap the items before putting them in the stocking. This is a fun way to make the stocking last a little while longer as the person is opening it while keeping the contents a surprise. Use normal wrapping paper or newspaper to wrap up the stocking items. [1] X Research source The scrap pieces of wrapping paper left over from wrapping large gifts are great for wrapping stocking stuffers."

      "content": "Place small, round objects at the bottom of the stocking. These objects will be used to fill the toe of the stocking. Look at the items that go in the stocking and see which ones would fit well at the bottom, making sure they aren't fragile or easily crushed, as they'll be holding the weight of the rest of the stocking. [2] X Research source Many people put oranges at the toe of the stocking."

      "content": "Place unwrapped or special items at the top of the stocking. If you've wrapped most of the items in the stocking but kept one or two unwrapped just for looks, place these peeking out of the top of the stocking. This will tie together your stocking, making it look festive and creative. For example, leave a tiny stuffed animal at the top of the stocking, peeking over the side."

This will help you create a list of possible ideas (as well as places to shop) for their stocking stuffers. For example, if the person loves nature or asked for a stocking full of fun items, you might look for a mini flashlight, patterned gloves, travel games, and stickers with animals on them."

      "content": "Choose a budget for each stocking, if desired.

      "content": "Make sure the items are age-appropriate. When choosing stocking stuffers for children, think about their age when selecting the items to ensure they’re safe and appropriate choices. This is especially important when picking out items for toddlers or young children, as small items may be a choking hazard. If you need ideas related to a specific age group, such as babies, preschoolers, or middle schoolers, do a quick online search to find lists of suggested items. For example, a stocking for a baby might include a pacifier, holiday bib, or soft socks. A stocking for a preschooler could have things like animal finger puppets, a small doll, crayons, or bubbles."
