      "content": "Make small cuts straight across your nail. Cut your nails using a series of small cuts rather than one large cut. As Nagorska explains, cutting the entire nail in one go will “unnecessarily bend and weaken your nail at the sides. Instead, clip the nail a few times, starting at one side, going across the nail to the other side.” [2] X Expert Source Marta Nagorska Nail Artist Expert Interview. 26 May 2021. Round out the nail at the edge with a small cut. This helps the nail stay strong and reduces the chance of developing ingrown nails .

[5] X Expert Source Marta Nagorska Nail Artist Expert Interview. 26 May 2021. Always file gently, in one long stroke, from the side to the center of the nail. Use the coarse, shaping side first if you need to remove more nail. Then, use the finer-grade shaping side to smooth your nails out. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You don’t have to file your nails, but the process can help shape your nails exactly as you want them. Jagged nails can catch on clothes, socks, and pantyhose. If your nails catch on something, they may tear or break. Aim to make your nails slightly triangular or ovular but never pointed. This helps keep them from breaking. Nails can weaken if you file too deeply into the corners and sides.

If your nails begin to hurt at the edges, you might be developing an ingrown nail ; try to trim away the painful growth before it goes too deep, but it would be wiser to seek a health care professional."

      "content": "Choose the cutting tool that’s best for you. You can use nail clippers or manicure scissors to trim your nails. The choice is largely a matter of preference. Consider the pros and cons of each option: [12] X Research source Nail clippers are cheap, simple, and widely available. They cut your nails along a set concave edge—which can be very convenient if the clippers fit your nails, but frustrating if the crescent is too large or too small. Toenail clippers usually feature a heavier bite and a straighter edge to contend with thicker nails and the risk of ingrown toenails. Manicure scissors are less common than nail clippers, but some people greatly prefer them. You may need somewhat more finesse to trim your nails with manicure scissors. However, you also have more control over the arc of the cut. Avoid using any other sharp-cutting tools—such as knives, razor blades, or regular scissors—to trim your nails. The tool may slip and injure the skin surrounding the nail."

Hold your fingers and toes directly over the receptacle, and try to track down the clippings that fly astray. Try not to clip your nails in public spaces. You can compost fingernails and toenails. They won't add much bulk to the pile, but they are organic matter and will decompose. Don't try to compost fake nails (acrylics) or excessively polished nails, as these artificial materials will not degrade."
