[2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make a warm compress by dipping a washcloth in hot water and wringing it out, or from a hot water bottle or heat pack purchased at a pharmacy. Do not make it so hot that it scalds the skin. Keep the compress on your ear as long as you like. Also try icing it. Put a bag of ice on the area for 10 minutes. Then place a warm compress on for another 10 minutes. Repeat two to three times."

If symptoms persist for more than 2–3 days for adults or more than 2 days for children, the earache is in a child under 8 weeks old, the neck becomes stiff, or if a fever develops, see a doctor immediately. While earaches are common, they can become a very serious infection that can lead to other complications if left untreated. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If the cause of the earache is bacterial, a doctor can prescribe a course of antibiotics to stem the infection and analgesics to mitigate the pain. An untreated ear infection can result in permanent hearing loss, so it's important that you seek treatment if symptoms worsen or persist."

      "content": "Clear the nose. Earaches are often caused by a buildup of fluid caught in the Eustachian tube, a tiny tube that connects the ear, nose, and throat. By clearing the nose, you can relieve pressure on the eardrum. [6] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital.

      "content": "Wiggle the ear gently. Earaches can cause pressure in the Eustachian tubes, which can be relieved with gentle popping (much like with air pressure on airplanes). This process can allow fluids trapped in the canal to drain. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hold the outer ear with your thumb and forefinger close to the head and gently tug and rotate the ear as much as possible without causing discomfort. Also try inducing yawning by faking a yawn, which can have a similar effect of popping the Eustachian tubes. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Inhale soothing steam. Hot steam can help the fluids in the Eustachian tubes to drain by causing your nose to run, which relieves pressure in the inner ear. [11] X Research source Adding certain medications or scents to the steam can add the additional benefit of a gentle anesthetic for the ear pain. Prepare a steam inhalation by adding several drops of eucalyptus essential oil or a teaspoon of Vicks or similar vapor rub to nearly boiling water in a bowl. [12] X Research source Place a towel over your head and inhale the steam through the nose three times a day until pain subsides. This will help to open the Eustachian tubes, easing pressure and help to drain the fluids from the ear. Do not place a small child's head under a towel over a very hot bowl of water, as the child may get burned or even drown in the water. Instead, apply a small amount of Vicks BabyRub (which is specially formulated for small babies and children) to the baby's chest or back, and then either stand in a very warm shower holding the baby, or let the baby play in a bathroom while a hot shower runs. The steam from the shower will mix with the vapors of the medication and create a soothing effect. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Try olive oil. To alleviate pain , place a few drops of warm olive oil in the ear. The oil may help with pain caused by earwax blockages by softening the wax for easier removal, but otherwise, it only soothes the irritated inner ear temporarily. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Place the bottle in a small glass of warm water for a few minutes to get it warm. Drop the oil directly into the ear, then plug the ear loosely with a cotton ball. If using this method on a baby, try it when the baby is napping and you can prop them on their side in order to keep the oil in place. You should not put cotton balls in a small baby's ear. Be aware that there is no peer-reviewed evidence suggesting that this does anything aside from placebo effect. Do not use olive oil if you suspect the eardrum has burst, and note that olive oil will not help treat an infection. [15] X Research source"

One of the most common causes of earache is the common cold, and while there is no cure for the cold virus, you can take precautionary steps to avoid contracting it in the first place. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Wash your hands regularly, especially after you've been in public places and before eating. [17] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you don't have access to a sink, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. The cold virus is notoriously resilient and can live for hours on surfaces, so even if you don't see anyone who appears sick, it’s possible to contract a cold simply from going to the library or the grocery store. Exercise regularly. People who exercise regularly have healthier immune responses, so their bodies are able to better fight off infection and resist the cold virus. [18] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Eat a vitamin-rich, balanced diet . Eat nutrient-dense, whole foods, focusing on lean proteins, vegetables, and fruits. The phytochemicals in plants like peppers, oranges, and dark leafy greens actually help your body absorb vitamins, so it's best to stick to natural foods for your immune-supporting vitamins.

      "content": "Prevent ear infections in babies. Ear infections in babies are common, but can be reduced or prevented using particular feeding strategies. Vaccinate your child. One of the common infectious agents for ear infections is part of the routine vaccine series. [21] X Research source Try to breastfeed for at least the first 12 months of your baby's life. Breast milk contains antibodies that have been shown to reduce ear infections, so breastfed babies tend to get earaches less often than formula-fed babies. If you bottle feed, be sure to hold the baby at a 45-degree angle or upright. Never feed the baby flat on their back or laying in their crib. [22] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Doing so can cause liquid to pool in the inner ear, resulting in an earache. Try to wean the baby from the bottle to a sippy cup between ages 9 and 12 months in order to reduce the rate of ear infections associated with bottles. [23] X Research source"
