      "content": "Brush off any mold or mildew you see on the shoes. Any green spots you notice on the shoes are bound to get in the way of your repairs. Take the shoes outside first to prevent the mold or mildew spores from getting into your home. Then, scrub the spots with a soft-bristled brush or a dry cloth. Dampen the brush or towel in a little bit of warm water if you’re having a hard time clearing off the green spots. Consider throwing away the brush or towel after using it to avoid spreading mold spores. A great tool to use for scrubbing is an old toothbrush. You can dispose of it when you’re done. Check the storage area for mold and mildew as well. Many times, the spores grow in warm or damp storage areas. Dilute bleach in water to neutralize the spores."

      "content": "Wipe off as much grime as possible with a damp cloth or brush. Use a cotton cloth, microfiber cloth, or a decent scrub brush. Dampen your scrubber very lightly in warm water. Then, wipe the entire shoe from top to bottom, removing as much visible grime as possible. Repeat this with the other shoe to lightly clean it and moisten it. [1] X Research source Make sure the cloth or brush isn’t dripping wet. Leather isn’t meant to be soaked in water. A light coating doesn’t harm it and also helps the cleaner you use next. Shoe care specialist Rio Jongsae Kim suggests using a horsehair brush for this step in the process. Fellow shoe care specialist Marc Sigal reminds us never to try to polish or do any work on dirty shoes. Hey says, “If you try to polish shoes that are dirty, it'll just take the dirt into the shoe and it won’t look very good.”"

      "content": "Spread a leather cleaner evenly over both shoes. Saddle soap is a common choice for restoring damaged leather , but there are many alternative cleaners available. Dip a shoe dauber or a cotton cloth into the soap, then scrub the shoes in a circular motion. Watch for the leather to lighten in color as the lather draws out dirt and moisture. Scrub the shoes until the leather feels dry and flexible. Lye is harsh on leather shoes, so avoid cleaners with heavy amounts of lye. Instead, make your own or get a product specifically designed for shoes. Any leather treatment product you need, including soap , is available online. Also, check at your nearest general, home improvement store, or any place that specializes in leather goods. Another option is to buy a leather maintenance kit . A good kit contains almost everything you need, including a cleaner, conditioner, filler, and applicators."

      "content": "Wipe the leather dry with a clean cloth. Use another cotton or microfiber cloth to remove the dirt, cleaner, and water right away. Buff the leather in a circular motion until you have scrubbed the entirety of both shoes. Pay particular attention to the cracks. Scrub those areas with a little extra strength to ensure you get any dirt hiding in the cracks. [2] X Research source Another option is to leave the cleaner to dry overnight. This is safe to do with saddle soap, but check the manufacturer’s recommendations for other products. If your shoes are still dirty or you plan on working on them right away, dry them off by hand instead."

      "content": "Stuff newspaper or rags into the shoes to hold their shape. Crumple the newspaper into balls or roll the rags up. Fill the shoes completely, leaving as little empty space inside as possible. Stuffing the shoes maintains their form while you work on them. The newspaper or towels also absorb any moisture that leaks inside. Consider also stuffing the shoes when you’re not using them, particularly if you put them in storage. Shoe care expert Mallika Sharma suggests using acid-free tissue paper to stuff the shoes."

      "title": "Apply mink oil or another moisturizer to rehydrate the leather.",
      "content": "Apply mink oil or another moisturizer to rehydrate the leather. Mink oil is solid, so you don’t really need anything other than your fingers to apply it. Most other moisturizers are liquid and have to be applied with an applicator brush or cotton cloth. Spread the moisturizer onto the cracks first. Push the moisturizer down into the cracks to rehydrate them and make them less severe. [3] X Research source Heating the leather slightly, such as with a space heater or hair dryer, helps it absorb the oil. Cleaning leather with soap dries it out, so take the time to rehydrate both shoes now. Focus on the cracks, but don’t neglect other areas. Mink oil is a good match for leather, but some people find that bottled moisturizers last longer and offer more protection. These products are often made with beeswax and other natural oils. Purchase moisturizer online, at a general store, or at a clothing store that carries leather products."

      "title": "Apply a leather filler with a sponge to fill in most cracks.",
      "content": "Apply a leather filler with a sponge to fill in most cracks. Most leather fillers are water-based acrylics that blend in medium to deep cracks . Use the sponge to dab the compound into the crack. For massive cracks you can’t quite fill with a sponge alone, try using a plastic palette knife. Fill the crack until the material is even with the surface of the leather. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that you can’t exactly “fix” leather. Cracks are permanent because the fibers in leather pull apart. The best you can do is fill noticeable cracks to hide them."

      "title": "Let the leather dry for at least 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the leather dry for at least 30 minutes. The drying time varies depending on the moisturizer you used and how much filler you had to apply. For the best result, wait for the leather to completely dry, which takes no longer than 24 hours. Deep cracks with filler generally take about 30 minutes to solidify. [5] X Research source Consult the manufacturer’s instructions on the product you use for the recommended drying time. At the very least, wait for the filler material to solidify before adding more of it."

    {
      "title": "Use more filler as needed to finish filling in the cracks.",
      "content": "Use more filler as needed to finish filling in the cracks. Check each crack to see how well it blends in with the leather around it. If it is still noticeable, go back over it again. Add more of the filler material to level out the crack. When you’re done, wait again for the filler to dry before continuing."

      "title": "Buff the filler smooth with 220-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Buff the filler smooth with 220-grit sandpaper. Press the sandpaper against the treated areas with light but steady pressure. Scrub the cracks until they blend in completely with the surrounding leather. When everything looks good, wipe your shoes off again with a dry rag to remove any dust. [6] X Research source Use only fine-grit sandpaper. Using anything coarser can add new scratches to your shoes."

      "title": "Use a shoe cream if your shoes look discolored.",
      "content": "Use a shoe cream if your shoes look discolored. Polish the leather by applying the cream over the filler with a shoe dauber or cotton cloth. Work the cream into the leather in a circular motion. Shoe creams polish and add color to leather, so make sure you choose a color you don’t mind wearing. Try to select a cream that matches the color of your shoes. [7] X Research source Creams work very well on repaired cracks, but you can also use them to color the rest of the leather."

      "title": "Buff the shoes with a clean cotton cloth for 4 minutes.",
      "content": "Buff the shoes with a clean cotton cloth for 4 minutes. Use a cotton or microfiber cloth to restore the leather back to its normal state. Starting at the top of each shoe, rub the leather with small, circular motions. Buff both shoes equally to get them to look the same. Make sure you treat all parts of the shoe the same way so the leather looks uniform all over. [8] X Research source Check the shoes again to see how they look. With proper treatment, the cracks will no longer be visible. Use more filler, cream, or other products as needed."

      "title": "Treat your shoes with a leather conditioner once a week.",
      "content": "Treat your shoes with a leather conditioner once a week. A great time to start conditioning is after you finish with the repairs. Use a clean cotton or microfiber cloth to avoid working dirt into the leather. Apply the conditioner in a thin, even layer by buffing the leather with small, circular motions. Work on one part of the shoe at a time until you have it completely covered. [9] X Research source As an animal material, leather needs regular oiling to prevent it from drying out and cracking. Regular conditioning also masks old cracks and prevents them from reappearing. Sigal says, “Apply leather conditioner throughout the shoe, wait a few minutes, let it dry, and then brush off any excess conditioner.” He notes that “these conditioners tend to come in different colors, so always try to match up the closest color shade to the shoe.” He advises that you “test a small area of the conditioner on the shoe” before spreading it all over. Sharma recommends using melatonin wax as a good alternative to conditioner."

      "title": "Clean your shoes regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your shoes regularly. Use a gentle and effective soap, like saddle soap, to wash your leather shoes after each use. It’s much easier to prevent cracks in the leather from happening than it is to repair them, so taking these cautionary measures is key. While using a damp cloth to wash off dirt and grime is perfectly fine, Sigal warns against getting them wet in any other condition, stating, “Definitely don't wear your leather shoes in the rain. Leather and water don't go well, and getting your shoes wet will shrink them.”"

      "title": "Condition and hydrate your shoes.",
      "content": "Condition and hydrate your shoes. Sigal describes leather as a very “finicky” material, noting that it will “dry and crack” if not treated correctly. Think of leather as the shoe’s skin, which requires moisture in order to thrive. Remember to always clean the shoe first and then apply your moisturizer of choice. Afterwards, you can apply shoe cream or polish, which will help seal in the moisture. [10] X Research source Mink oil is another great way to introduce moisture to your leather footwear."

      "title": "Stuff your shoes.",
      "content": "Stuff your shoes. Stuffing your shoes with newspaper, acid free tissue paper, or shoe trees will help them maintain their shape. Keeping them on a shoe rack or in individual shoe boxes can also keep them in tip-top condition. Sharma offers some storage tips, sharing, “Always store shoes in shoe trees, never stack them on top of each other.” She adds, “Storing in shoe racks or shoe boxes is ideal!”"
