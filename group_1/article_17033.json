      "content": "Look for any expired driver's licenses . If you have any expired driver's licenses issued by the same licensing agency, they'll typically have the same number as the one you lost. If you saved them in your personal records, you may be able to find your number that way. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that different licensing agencies use different numbers. For example, if you have a US driver's license from one state, your license number typically won't be the same if you find an expired license that was issued in another state. If you had a learner's permit, it may have a different number than a full driver's license."

Even if you haven't written a personal check in a while, you may be able to find digital images of canceled checks archived in your online account with your bank."

      "content": "Contact your auto insurance company. Typically, auto insurers require you to provide your driver's license number when you start a policy. While your driver's license number may not be listed on your policy, it should be in the insurance company's records. [4] X Research source If you have an online account with your insurance company, you may be able to find your driver's license number there. Look for a copy of your initial application or your initial policy quote."

      "content": "Call the agency that issued your license. Some licensing agencies can tell you the number of your driver's license over the phone. Typically, the customer service representative will ask you several questions to verify your identity before releasing that information. [5] X Research source Even if the agency has a policy not to release the number over the phone, you'll likely be able to find out if you can get your driver's license number without having to visit a local agency office in person."

      "content": "Gather original documents to prove your identity and address. If you knew your driver's license number, you could likely get a replacement without having to produce documents that prove your identity. However, without your driver's license number, you'll likely need to re-establish your identity before a new card will be issued. [6] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Most driver's license agencies accept documents such as a passport or birth certificate to prove your identity. Other documents, such as a national insurance card (Social Security card in the US) might also be accepted. The driver's license agency will typically have a list of acceptable documents to prove your identity on its website. To find that website, do a search for the name of the agency followed by the name of the place where you live. For example, if you live in the US, you could find the right site by searching for \"department of motor vehicles\" along with the name of your state."

      "content": "Visit a local office in person. If you need to prove your identity to get a replacement license, you typically must do this in person. You'll need to show original documents to demonstrate that you are who you say you are and that you are entitled to be issued a license. [7] X Research source If you had a license issued previously by that agency, you are likely already in the system. You'll still have to prove that you are that person in the system. However, you typically won't have to take a driver's test or otherwise prove that you know how to drive a vehicle."

      "content": "Complete an application for a replacement license. Some agencies expect you to have the application completed before you come to request your replacement license. Even if this isn't a requirement, it's a good idea to fill it out in advance if possible. [8] X Research source Check the website of the licensing agency to see if they have an application available that you can download and print. That way you can fill it out before you get there. The application typically isn't long, and shouldn't take you that much time to fill out. Basically, it will ask for identifying information and the type of license you want. You may need to include information about the type of vehicle you plan to drive, particularly if you're trying to get a replacement commercial license."

      "content": "Wait for your new license to arrive in the mail. Some agencies may print your license immediately. However, it's more typical that you'll get a temporary license at your visit, with a permanent card mailed to you. [9] X Research source If your permanent card is not printed immediately, the agent who processed your application will let you know when it will be mailed to you. If you need your permanent card urgently, such as if you have an international flight planned, ask the agent processing your application if there's any way you can expedite your card or come pick it up in person."
