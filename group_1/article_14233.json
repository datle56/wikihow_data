      "content": "Understand how a torrent client works. A torrent client is a program, such as qBitTorrent or uTorrent , that can read your downloaded torrent, gather the torrent's files, and begin downloading the files onto your computer. When you download a torrent online, you'll first download a torrent file, and then open it in the torrent client. The torrent client reads the information in the file and finds people on the internet who are sharing that file. For the purposes of this article, we'll use qBitTorrent to open our torrent files. This is because qBitTorrent isn't ad-supported and thus will not spam us while we download our torrent's files."

The safest way to download torrents is to use a private tracker, which is an invite-only list of torrents. But if you don't have an invite, you can search Google for the file you want and the word \"torrent.\" qBitTorrent also has a large user community, many of whom have created search plugins for the app. [1] X Research source These plugins make it easy to search for torrents from qBitTorrent. Check out the list of search plugins at https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins . Pirate Bay is one of the most popular torrent tracker sites, but they change their URL often to avoid being tracked by authorities. To find the latest location for The Pirate Bay, check out the /r/ThePirateBays subreddit. Sites like 1337x.to and rutracker.org are also very popular, and considered to contain less malware than The Pirate Bay. [2] X Research source Torrent databases can be unreliable as they are often suspended or taken down, so you may also search for a torrent by using a search engine."

Once you've downloaded a torrent file, you can open it in qBitTorrent in order to prompt the torrent's files to download; however, you cannot \"open\" a torrent to view its contents in a traditional sense. While you can use an advanced text editor such as Notepad++ to view a torrent's code, much of what you're able to view will be encrypted or otherwise impossible to read. Before continuing, it is strongly recommended that you use a VPN to hide your IP address. Not doing so could get you in trouble with your ISP, or even legal authorities. [3] X Research source"

The torrent will begin downloading onto your computer. In some cases, you'll just click the torrent's name or click the .torrent file link. Popular torrenting sites will also offer a magnet icon, which can be used to open the torrent file directly in qBitTorrent and skip the need to download it first. Be wary of clicking any flashing arrows or download buttons, as these are often ads designed to trick you into clicking them.
