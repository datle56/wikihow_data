      "content": "Identify the state where the LLC was formed . An LLC is a type of business entity that you can create through state legislation—there's no such thing as a federal or national LLC. For that reason, if you want to know anything about who owns an LLC, you have to go back to the state where the members originally formed it. [1] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source Most LLCs are pretty small and are only doing business in one state, so definitely start with the state you're in. Don't worry, you can usually do all of this online—you won't have to physically go anywhere. In other words, if you live in California and you find out the LLC was formed in Massachusetts, there's not likely to be any reason for you to travel to Massachusetts."

      "content": "Go to the website for the state's secretary of state (SOS) office . Mehdiani notes that \"an LLC, like a corporation, is an entity… filed at the state level.\" There's a single government office that manages all of the business filings in the state, usually the SOS office. \"Most states have a secretary of state if not something equivalent,\" Mehdiani continues. Since anything filed with the SOS office is a public document, you can search all of those documents directly. Many SOS offices allow you to search and access documents directly through the website on your own. The National Association of Secretaries of State roster lists the comparable office for each state with a link to each office's website for your convenience."

      "content": "Search SOS databases for LLC formation documents. Since not all states make it mandatory for LLCs to file these documents, you might not find them. But if you do, they'll almost always tell you exactly who the owners of the LLC are. Here are a couple of documents to look for specifically: [2] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source Articles of Organization: Look for the names of people listed as \"members.\" You might also see people listed as \"managers\" or as a \"registered agent\"—they might be members, but don't necessarily have to be. Operating Agreement: As with the Articles of Organization, look for the names of people who are specifically listed as members."

      "title": "Access a request for information form through the SOS office.",
      "content": "Access a request for information form through the SOS office. Sometimes, not all documents are available for you to search through yourself on the SOS website. In that case, SOS offices typically provide a form that you can use to request that they pull information related to the LLC for you. If you're looking for older documents, they might only be available through a formal request. Not all SOS offices have digitized all documents. Even if you were able to find some documents on the website, if you weren't able to determine the owners, your request might produce more documents that help you uncover the names you're looking for. Some states, such as California, only publish limited information about LLCs online to protect the privacy of LLC owners. For those states, you can only get this information through a formal request. [3] X Research source If you can't find an information request form on the website, contact the SOS office using the phone or email information available on the website and someone will assist you."

      "title": "Submit your form to the SOS office.",
      "content": "Submit your form to the SOS office. Some SOS offices are set up to receive requests for information electronically through their websites. For others, you'll have to print the form and mail it. Look for instructions on the form itself. [4] X Research source Some SOS offices will send you an email or letter acknowledging receipt of your request and providing you with additional details about the next steps of the process. If you submitted your form electronically, you'll generally get some form of electronic confirmation as well."

      "content": "Follow up on your request with the SOS office. The time frame it takes for the SOS office to get back to you depends on a lot of different factors, including the scope of your request and how busy the office is. But generally, you should expect to get a response to your request within 30 days. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that everything is going to take longer if you're relying on mail rather than electronic delivery. If you requested paper copies of any documents produced in response to your request, the SOS office might charge you a small copying fee."

      "title": "Navigate to the \"About\" page on the LLC's website.",
      "content": "Navigate to the \"About\" page on the LLC's website. Many LLCs have an official website for the business that might have the names of the owners listed, usually on an \"About\" page. If the LLC doesn't have a website, check for social media accounts. It might take some sleuthing to figure out who the owners are. The people listed on the \"About\" page might not even be the owners, but their names are a good place to start. You'll likely see people with executive-type titles or leadership roles. In an LLC, these roles are technically filled by \"managers\" who might be owners—but they might also be outside hires. Mehdiani mentions that \"certain states won't allow you to set up an LLC as a licensed professional\" (such as a doctor or a lawyer). If you see those credentials, that's a name you could potentially eliminate as an owner. On the other hand, if the LLC is actually called a PLLC or a \"professional LLC,\" that's an indication that the owners are licensed professionals."

      "title": "Browse any public personnel listings.",
      "content": "Browse any public personnel listings. Any sort of personnel directory or staff page is a treasure trove of information about the people who work at an LLC. Since most LLCs are small, hands-on affairs, it's likely that your owners are among those listed. Don't forget to think about the name of the LLC as well. If there's a last name included in the LLC and people with that last name also work there, some (or all) of them might be members! Similarly, if you see several people with the same last name, that could indicate that the LLC is a family business and some (or all) of those people own it."

      "content": "Search names you find on LinkedIn. If someone is a member of an LLC, chances are they've mentioned it on their LinkedIn page (if they have one). They might also have more information about their role in the LLC generally. Even if this information doesn't definitively identify the owners of the LLC, it can at least help you eliminate possibilities. It might also give you a connection that you could talk to and find out more information. For example, if you find out that you have a mutual contact, you might reach out to them and ask what they know about the person. If you feel comfortable, you might also be able to reach out directly to someone who works there through LinkedIn or other social media and ask them who owns the LLC."

Since they're public records and you're a member of the public, you're free to search them. Business dealings that the LLC has done in the county have potentially been recorded. [6] X Research source If you find any documents that mention the LLC, pay attention to who signed the document on behalf of the LLC. They are likely to be a member. You can check their name on LinkedIn or with other sources to find out for sure."

      "title": "Check deeds and property records specifically.",
      "content": "Check deeds and property records specifically. LLCs are often formed for the explicit purpose of buying, selling, or leasing real property. Aside from that, a lot of LLCs either buy or lease property—which makes it likely the business will show up in a search. When you find documents related to the LLC, write down the names of any authorized signatures. [7] X Research source Authorized signers for anything relating to real property are almost always members of the LLC. This might be one of the easiest ways to uncover those names."

      "content": "Search the state or county DBA database. You might feel like you hit a wall if an authorized signature turns out to be an assumed name or another business name. Not to worry—if someone uses an assumed name to conduct business (also called a \"DBA,\" for \"doing business as\"), they have to register that name with the state. The state keeps records of all of those names to make sure businesses don't choose names that are deceptively similar to each other. [8] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source In some states, you can access this database from the SOS office's website—the same place where you looked up the LLC registration. Some states keep these records at a county level rather than at a state level. Be sure to check all nearby counties as well, especially if you live in a sprawling metropolitan area. This search can also help if you're not even sure the name of the business is the name of the LLC. Mehdiani notes that \"you could actually set up a very vague name for your LLC and then register a fictitious name.\""

      "content": "Check trademark records if the LLC has a distinctive name. A trademark would be registered by an owner of the LLC and trademarks are public records. If you can find a trademark related to the LLC's name, the owner's names will be listed on the trademark application. [9] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source Trademarks are registered at both the federal and state level. Some large metropolitan areas also have their own trademark authority for an additional layer of local protection. Generally, look at the smallest level that makes sense for the size of the business. While a small local business might have a registered federal trademark, it makes far more sense that it would simply be registered with the state. State trademark databases are typically available on the secretary of state's website or wherever you looked up business name listings."

      "content": "Search for news reports about the LLC's formation. This is a long shot—most LLCs are too small to get any publicity when they start up. But you might get lucky and find something, especially if one of the members is well-known. Keep in mind that if there are news articles that mention the members, it's probably going to be really easy for you to find their names through other means as well. Publicity typically means the owners aren't intentionally keeping their identities a secret, so you could probably just ask someone."

      "content": "Go back and cross-check new information. As you get a new name or date, you want to make sure that you validate it so you don't waste time following a dead lead. If you're consistently eliminating names associated with the LLC, you might eventually zero in on the owners by process of elimination. For example, you might learn that one of the members of the LLC is another LLC. When you dig up information about that LLC, you might find 3 names that you can check on LinkedIn."

      "content": "What is an LLC? An LLC is a specific way to organize your business that's created through state law. In a nutshell, it provides the limited liability of a corporate structure with the simplified reporting requirements of a partnership. Using an LLC also allows members to shield their identity to some extent. [10] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source Typically, when you're dealing with an LLC, all you ever see is the name of the LLC—not the names of any of the particular members. LLCs don't have the longevity of corporations. When one member leaves, if the remaining members want to continue to do business, they have to reform their LLC without the departed member."

      "title": "Why would someone need to know the owner of an LLC?",
      "content": "Why would someone need to know the owner of an LLC? Knowing who you're dealing with helps with transparency. Sometimes it's just nice to know who you're dealing with. It might also be important if you have some sort of complaint or issue that you want to take up directly with one of the owners. Because of the limited liability nature of an LLC, you don't need to know the names of the owners to file a lawsuit because you would sue the LLC, not the individual members."

      "content": "What are owners of LLCs called? Owners of LLCs are called \"members\" (although you will occasionally see them just called \"owners\" as well). Most members will continue to hang on to this title, even if they take on some other management role in the company. [11] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source For example, you might see someone listed as \"CEO and Member\" or \"President and Owner.\""

      "content": "What's the difference between a member and a manager? A member is an owner of the LLC. They might take on a manager role (and frequently do, since most LLCs are pretty small), but they don't have to. And it's also not necessary for a manager to be a member—they could be an outside hire. [12] X Research source The biggest difference between a member and a manager is that members share in the profits of the LLC, while managers typically don't."

      "title": "Can people register LLCs anonymously?",
      "content": "Can people register LLCs anonymously? It's possible. Mehdiani notes that while \"different states have different reporting requirements,\" in some states \"you may be able to form an LLC without showing who the members are.\" He adds that it's \"more of a legal question, so… it would be best to get advice from an attorney on how to do that.\" Keep in mind that an LLC can be a member of an LLC, which could at least add another layer people would have to dig through to determine the true owners. [13] X Research source Mehdiani mentions this possibility because even though you can't create an anonymous LLC in California, \"you could potentially set up an LLC [there] that's owned by an LLC that's anonymous in another state.\""
