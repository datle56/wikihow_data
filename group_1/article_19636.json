      "content": "Use dryer sheets to quickly get rid of static. If you have dryer sheets around the house, use one to wipe your hair down when static hairs are sticking up. You can also use the dryer sheets to wipe down your brushes and combs, helping prevent static. Line the drawer you keep your brushes in with dryer sheets, or stick a dryer sheet under your pillow at night while you’re sleeping to help prevent static. There are anti-static sheets specifically designed for getting rid of static in your hair, too."

      "content": "Tame the frizziness with a little lotion. Use any regular lotion that you have around the house, such as hand lotion. Place a dime-sized dollop into the palm of your hand, and rub it around in your palms before massaging it into your hair evenly and thoroughly. [1] X Research source Only use a small amount of lotion. Too much can weigh your hair down. Run your fingers through your hair to spread the lotion. Focus on the ends and any areas with notable fly-aways."

      "content": "Pull your hair up so that it’s out of your face. If you don’t want to deal with static in your hair, pull your hair into a bun . You can also braid it , creating thin braids with the hair around your face, or a larger braid to contain all of your hair at once. [2] X Research source If you’re in an environment that produces static in your hair, pull your hair up out of your face just until you leave."

      "content": "Switch up the part in your hair if you’re wearing a hat. Before you put on your hat, move your natural part to a different part. Once you take the hat off after wearing it, you can switch the part in your hair back to how it usually is, and you won’t have to deal with any static or hairs sticking up. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Trade rubber-soled shoes for leather-soled shoes.",
      "content": "Trade rubber-soled shoes for leather-soled shoes. Rubber-soles are more likely to pass electric charges through your body, from your feet all the way to your hair. To avoid this, opt for leather-soled shoes instead. This way, you’ll avoid the small electric shock that comes along with static."

    {
      "title": "Change into clothes made with natural fabrics to reduce static charge.",
      "content": "Change into clothes made with natural fabrics to reduce static charge. Synthetic materials are much more likely to contract a charge, which then in turn produce lots of static. By choosing clothing made of fabrics such as cotton, silk, or wool, you’ll be less likely to have static in your hair. For example, you could try sleeping with your hair tied in a silk scarf or using a silk pillowcase to protect your hair from static. Stay away from synthetic materials like polyester or nylon."

      "title": "Shampoo your hair less frequently.",
      "content": "Shampoo your hair less frequently. Instead of washing your hair with shampoo every day, try to skip a day or two. It’s better for your hair if you’re only washing it when it’s truly needed, and you’ll help reduce static since your hair will keep more of its natural oils. [4] X Research source If your hair tends to get greasy easily, this might not be the best method for you. Try using dry shampoo on days you don’t wash your hair with shampoo. This will help to control the grease."

      "title": "Use brushes and combs made of rubber or metal.",
      "content": "Use brushes and combs made of rubber or metal. Plastic is a huge conductor of electricity, and by brushing your hair with plastic brushes, you’re much more likely to have static in your hair. Try to find brushes made of metal or rubber to have smooth, static-free hair. [5] X Research source Using natural bristles as opposed to plastic ones will also greatly reduce static."

      "title": "Wrap your hair in a microfiber towel or T-shirt when drying.",
      "content": "Wrap your hair in a microfiber towel or T-shirt when drying. A regular terry cloth towel can increase frizz and static, as well as dry out your hair. Instead, buy a microfiber towel or find a soft cotton T-shirt and wrap your hair in this instead. [6] X Research source This is especially helpful for preventing frizz in curly and wavy hair types. If you’re wrapping your hair in a T-shirt, try to find a large one that will accommodate all of your hair easily."

      "title": "Swap out your old hair dryer for an ionic one.",
      "content": "Swap out your old hair dryer for an ionic one. Ionic hair dryers help neutralize the charge that results in static. If it’s been awhile since you last bought a hair dryer, try upgrading to an ionic model to dry your hair faster while also achieving a static-free look. Before you use the hair dryer, spray a heat protectant on your hair. This will help prevent static while also protecting your hair from getting damaged."

      "title": "Apply a thermal protectant to your hair before straightening or curling it.",
      "content": "Apply a thermal protectant to your hair before straightening or curling it. If you're experiencing static in your hair after you've used a hair straightener or curler, it could be because you're not properly protecting your hair. Spray a heat protectant on your hair before applying heat to it, using a brush to spread the protectant evenly throughout your hair. [7] X Research source Remember to wait until your hair is completely dry before using a hot tool on it to prevent damage."

      "title": "Buy a leave-in conditioner to prevent static when you're on-the-go.",
      "content": "Buy a leave-in conditioner to prevent static when you're on-the-go. Static-prone hair is dry, so keeping your hair moisturized can help to prevent static. If you’re running errands, at school, or just need a quick fix, try keeping a small bottle of leave-in conditioner with you. Squeeze out a dime-sized dab into your hands and massage it into your hair, helping to reduce the static. [8] X Research source Hair oil and moisturizing creams are also options for a quick, on-the-go fix. You can find hair oil and moisturizing creams at a beauty supply or big box store, as well as online."

      "content": "Look for conditioners that contain silicone to neutralize static in your hair. Conditioner is super important to maintaining healthy-looking hair, especially if your hair tends to dry out easily. If you tend to skip the conditioner step when showering, or aren’t using conditioner at all, consider finding a quality conditioner to help with the static. [9] X Research source Use a conditioner every time you shampoo for best results. When picking out your conditioner or other hair care products, try to stay away from ingredients that dry your hair out, such as alcohol."

      "title": "Select a hairspray that's alcohol-free.",
      "content": "Select a hairspray that's alcohol-free. A lot of hairsprays contain alcohol, which can cause your hair to have more static. To avoid this, look for a hairspray that's alcohol-free. It should say \"alcohol-free\" right on the label, or you can check the ingredients list on the back. Applying a moderate amount of alcohol-free hairspray to your hair can actually help prevent static."

      "title": "Try an anti-frizz cream to control frizz and static.",
      "content": "Try an anti-frizz cream to control frizz and static. Visit your local drug or big box store to pick out an anti-frizz cream. Squeeze out a dime-sized amount and rub it into your hair, focusing on the sections below your ears so that the top of your hair doesn't get greasy. [10] X Research source Rub your fingers through your hair to evenly distribute the cream. Avoid putting too much anti-frizz cream on your scalp, especially if you have fine or straight hair. These products tend to be a bit heavy, and when they mix with the natural oils of your scalp, your hair can look greasy and flat."
