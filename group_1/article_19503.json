[2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source They tend to feel tighter and denser than the surrounding muscles, much like a knot in a rope (hence the name). Although knots can feel tight and denser, there are times that the most painful knots don't feel tight at all. Focus more on the fact that pressing into a knot produces pain, rather than looking for a \"tight\" muscle. If you press on a knot, it may cause pain to radiate outward. This suggests that it is a trigger point. “Tender spots” do not usually cause pain in other areas of your body. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Knots are usually your body's way of preventing you from moving in a specific way. For example, if you have a joint problem and it hurts to move, you may feel a knot there. [4] X Expert Source Ashley Mak, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 3 March 2020."

This may help release tense muscle fibers. You may also find that simply pressing on the knot helps relieve the pain. Apply firm pressure to the knot and hold it for about a minute. [5] X Research source If it is difficult or impossible for you to massage the knot yourself, ask a friend to help you."

Line it up on top of the point where you feel the most pressure. You may feel discomfort at first, but it should subside as you continue to apply pressure. [6] X Research source Pin the tennis ball between the knot and the hard surface until the pain ceases. Take breaks as necessary. At the beginning, you may find that you can only hold it there for a few seconds. As you continue this exercise, that time will increase. You can use other types of balls, but firmer balls such as racquetballs may apply too much pressure, at least at first."

Spending too much time on a sore spot can actually cause increased damage to your muscles, especially if you’re unfamiliar with foam rolling techniques. Spend 15–30 seconds on a knot before moving on. Place the foam roller on the ground horizontally. Lie on it perpendicular to the roller. Find your sore areas and roll yourself slowly across them. Don’t use a foam roller for more than three minutes at a time. [8] X Research source Do not use a foam roller on your lower back, as you could cause nerve damage. Above all, never use a foam roller while lying flat on your back. This can hyperextend the low back and cause joint damage and pain."

Just as with the tennis ball, hold it there until the knot seems to dissipate.

Poor posture, especially while sitting for long periods of time, can cause back pain and knots. [20] X Research source Try to be conscious of slouching — that's putting constant pressure on the same muscles. If you work at a desk, take time to get up and walk around (and stretch) every hour or so. Keep your head from slumping forward when you stand or sit. Slumping can put strain on your shoulders and back and contribute to knots. If you lift weights, monitor your form. Putting weights down too quickly causes the muscles to forcibly contract, jarring them."

When it comes to exercises that can strengthen your back, yoga is certainly up there. It can relieve back soreness in addition to strengthening your muscles and increasing your flexibility. Here are a few positions to try: [22] X Research source The downward-facing dog will help your lower back. It targets your back extensors — those muscles that help you stand and lift objects. Start on all fours. Make sure your knees are directly below your hips and your hands are just slightly in front of your shoulders. As you exhale, press your knees up toward the ceiling, stretching out your legs. Stretch your heels toward the floor. Straighten your legs, but do not lock your knees. Your body will form a sort of arch. [23] X Research source The child's pose will elongate your back muscles. Begin on all fours. Sit back until your buttocks touch your heels. Stretch your arms forward and lower your head to the ground. [24] X Research source The pigeon pose stretches your hip rotators and flexors. Sometimes we forget that our whole body is connected — poor hip alignment can totally ruin an otherwise healthy back. Lie on your back with your knees bent. Cross your left ankle onto your right thigh. Place your hands around the back of your right thigh and pull your right knee toward your chest. Keep your upper body relaxed as you hold this position. Repeat on the other side. [25] X Research source The triangle pose will strengthen your back and legs and stretch the sides of your torso and hip muscles. Stand on a yoga mat with your feet about 4 feet (1 m) apart. Turn your right foot outward so it is parallel with the long edge of the mat. Align your heels so they form a straight line. Bring your arms out to your sides so that your body forms a “t” shape. Fold down and bend to the right, stretching your right arm down to your right foot. Hold the pose as long as is comfortable. Repeat on the other side. [26] X Research source"

Some are also trained in techniques such as dry needling, which can relieve back pain by stimulating trigger points. [28] X Research source [29] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your doctor may prescribe muscle relaxants if your back pain continues or does not improve. These can be addictive, so use them only as prescribed by your doctor. [30] X Research source Injections are used as last resorts and only when pain is radiating through different parts of your body. Your doctor may inject cortisone into your epidural space (around your spinal cord). The relief from this injection usually only lasts a few months. If your back pain is not due to knots but in fact connected to a more serious condition, your doctor may consider surgery."
