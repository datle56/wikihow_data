      "title": "Find an e-cigarette.",
      "content": "Find an e-cigarette. There are many types of e-cigarettes, and beginners do not have to spend a lot to get a quality product. Different types will provide different smoking experiences, but all have a range of options for different budgets and experience levels. Minis, or so-called “cig-a-likes,” look like cigarettes and use pre-filled cartridges. They come in rechargeable and disposable varieties and have limited flavor options and battery life. Advanced Personal Vaporizers (AVPs), or “Vape Pens,” allow you to control the power level, and subsequently can produce more vapor. AVPs can also hold more liquid and have a longer charge. MODs are a higher vapor, lower nicotine system that are designed for the user to customize. They are usually used by experienced vapers, as the user should know how to define factors such as amount of vapor and battery strength. Many users start out with disposable e-cigarettes to make sure they enjoy vaping before moving onto larger setups."

      "title": "Choose the right e-liquid.",
      "content": "Choose the right e-liquid. E-liquid, or e-juice, is what goes into the e-cigarette to create the vapor. Currently, there are 2 common carrier liquids: propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin(VG). [3] X Research source Propylene glycol is a thin, odorless, colorless liquid that is effective at carrying flavors. It is the most common fluid used to suspend flavors and nicotine. Some users claim PG provides a sensation most similar to smoking tobacco. Vegetable glycerin is a derivative of vegetable oil and is vegetarian friendly. It is a thicker liquid that has some natural sweetness and produces a much smoother vapor. Due to its thickness, vaping high VG liquids can clog coils faster and reduce the life of some atomizers. VG and PG can be used on their own or mixed. Experimenting with ratios and finding the right mix for you will provide the most rewarding experience. Try buying different mixes from your local vape store to see what you like best. Flavor and nicotine strength can also be changed using e-liquid. Try a higher PG percentage for a stronger flavor, and higher VG percentage for more vapor."

      "title": "Decide on your nicotine strength.",
      "content": "Decide on your nicotine strength. Vaping allows you greater control over how much nicotine you get, and your choice in e-liquid and smoking device will help determine how much nicotine you want. E-liquid nicotine is measured in mg/ml, and different amounts provide different experiences. Keep in mind, though, that increased nicotine levels may present an increased health risk. [4] X Trustworthy Source PLOS ONE Online peer-reviewed, open access scientific research journal Go to source 0mg/ml means there is no nicotine in the liquid. It can be used to get a fuller flavor, and to satisfy residual habits of those who have quit smoking. It also provides a safer way for people who have never smoked to vape 'for fun'. 3mg/ml to 6mg/ml is a light level generally used by light to moderate smokers, or people who want some nicotine but more flavor from their liquid. 3 mg/ml is generally preferred for systems with rebuildable atomizers. 12mg/ml to 18mg/ml is a level generally comfortable for heavy smokers. It provides more nicotine and is preferred by those using a cartomizer. Levels above 18mg/ml are available, but it is advisable to stay away from those unless you cannot satisfy a nicotine addiction with lower levels. It is always easier to start lower and increase than to start with too strong a liquid."

      "title": "Try improving your throat hit.",
      "content": "Try improving your throat hit. The throat hit (also called lung hit) is the feeling of satisfaction you get from the nicotine against the back of your throat and in your lungs. Changing how you smoke your e-cigarette can greatly improve that sensation, especially for tobacco smokers. Take longer, slower drags than you would with a cigarette. Allow the vapor to build up for 3 to 5 seconds. Once you have a good drag, hold the vapor in longer before you exhale. This allows more of the product to get to the back of the throat and down into the lungs. Pick a flavor that replicates tobacco. If you are looking to replicate the experience of smoking a cigarette, sweet or fruity flavors may diminish the experience. Try a tobacco flavored e-liquid instead."

      "content": "Don't inhale if you want a gentler experience. If you are not a former smoker, or if the throat hit does not appeal to you, try not inhaling the smoke. Nicotine can pass through the tissue in your mouth and nose, meaning you do not have to inhale to get effect of the nicotine. Hold the vapor in your mouth for a few seconds before exhaling to allow the nicotine to pass through the tissue. Enhance the experience by exhaling through the nose, where the nicotine vapor may also be absorbed."

      "title": "Learn about sub-ohm vaping if you want to produce more vapor.",
      "content": "Learn about sub-ohm vaping if you want to produce more vapor. Standard atomizers generally have a coils between 1.0 and 3.0 ohms. Sub-ohm atomizers are those under 1.0 ohm. Sub-ohm vaping allows for larger vapor clouds, if vapor production is your main goal. [5] X Research source Sub-ohm vaping does present some dangers because of the wattage needed to power the device. It is important to use only sub-ohm compatible clearomizers with sub-ohm atomizers, and make sure the device has a high enough wattage to handle sub-ohm vaping. Exact wattage depends upon the ohms of the atomizer. Sub-ohm vaping is not recommended for new vapers."

      "title": "Try “stepping” if you are looking to quit smoking.",
      "content": "Try “stepping” if you are looking to quit smoking . Stepping, or stepping down, is the process of gradually decreasing nicotine amounts to help smokers quit. Stepping allows for a gradual transition from an addictive amount of nicotine to little or no nicotine. [6] X Research source Starting and ending nicotine levels will be very personal. Start with a nicotine level that keeps you satisfied, and gradually decrease from there. Many start from the 12mg/ml to 18mg/ml range, and gradually decrease to 3mg/ml before reaching the 0mg/ml or quitting steps. There is no set protocol for how long you should take at each nicotine level. Many experienced vapers recommend waiting until you adjust to a given nicotine level and stop craving a higher level before you take a step down. Stepping is often cited by former smokers as a method that helped them break their habit, but there is currently a limited amount of scientific research investigating vaping as a long-term means of effectively quitting smoking. Some studies show that most people who try vaping in order to quit smoking end up continuing to use both e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes.

      "content": "Clean your e-cigarette with water and a cotton swab. Keeping your e-cigarette clean is crucial to making sure you have an enjoyable vaping experience. It also helps you get more life from your e-cigarette. If your e-liquid tastes stale or burnt, it is time to clean your e-cigarette. [8] X Research source Never submerge your e-cigarette or get water on the battery while cleaning. Make sure no electrical components are live before you start to clean. Use a cotton swab or paper towel dampened with lukewarm water to wipe around the battery terminal end of the atomizer and drip tip. Blow out any old e-liquid from the tip. Use a dry paper towel or cotton swab to clean inside of the battery terminal. Reassemble your e-cigarette and allow the wick to soak in e-liquid for several seconds before you restart it."

      "content": "Keep your e-cigarette charged. When you clean your e-cigarette, remember to charge the battery as well. A fully charged battery ensures that you get the maximum life from your e-cigarette. Charge the battery simply by using the charger provided with the purchase of your e-cigarette. Try to only charge completely dead batteries, as this helps extend their lifespan. Allow the battery to charge fully before you reassemble your e-cigarette. This gives the most life possible in between disassembling."

      "content": "Replace the parts as necessary. You should not need to replace too many parts of your e-cigarette too often, but any electrical device will experience some wear. Replace parts as necessary to keep your e-cigarette functioning efficiently. Most batteries will last no more than 300 charges. Cartridges should be used no more than 10 times prior to replacement. If liquid drops out the bottom or bubbles up in your mouth, the atomizer coil may have burned out. Check to see if it needs replacement by taking it into a vape shop for a professional opinion."

      "content": "Store your e-cigarette safely. Wear is inevitable, but damaging your e-cigarette will make it happen much faster. Do not throw it around or store it in an area where it might get damaged, such as the bottom of a purse or backpack. Invest in stands and holders for your e-cigarette so that it has a safe place no matter where you take it. This will provide a longer life for your e-cigarette, and a more enjoyable vaping experience."
