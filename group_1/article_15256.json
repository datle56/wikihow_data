Empty the contents of the ink bottle into a spray bottle. [1] X Research source Then, add in the same amount of water to the spray bottle, screw the top on, and shake it up to mix the contents. For an average wig, use 1 1-oz. (29.6-ml) bottle of ink. For a wig that’s especially long and/or thick, use 2 1-oz. (19.6-ml) bottles."

      "content": "Add more water to get a pastel color. A 1:1 ratio will most likely get you an opaque, vibrant color that’s very similar to the ink color you chose. If you’re wanting to go for a more translucent pastel shade, such as mint green, you can buy a more vibrant green, such as kelly green, and simply dilute it by combining the bottle of ink with about 8 cups (1,900 ml) of water.

Remove the cap and pull apart the Sharpie with a pair of pliers. Pull out the ink tube that’s inside and slice it open with an Exacto knife. Then, place the ink tube in your spray bottle, add in your preferred amount of water, and let it sit overnight. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a light-colored synthetic wig. Choose any wig that you want, as long as it’s a light color, such as white, light blonde, silver, or a pastel shade. This way, you’ll be able to start off with a blank canvas, which should allow you to dye your wig the color you want. [4] X Research source You cannot lighten the color of synthetic hair with bleach like you can with human hair."

      "content": "Set up your work space. First, pick a location outside where you’ll dye the wig. The dyeing process may be really messy, so it’s best to choose an area that’s far away from any valuables. Place a table in your chosen location, and cover the table in newspaper or an old tablecloth that you don’t care about. Finally, put your wig on a wig stand and place it on the table. If you can’t dye the wig outside, opt for a garage or basement instead."

Take your spray bottle and spray your dye 3-5 times in 1 area to coat 1 section that’s 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide. Dig your fingers into the root area and wiggle them from side to side as you bring them down through the hair. Run your hands through the section 2-3 times to ensure that it gets completely coated.

After you’ve applied the dye to your first section, create another section next to it that’s 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide, spray the dye on it, and work it in with your hands. Continue working your way around the head and focus on spraying near the roots and the top half of the hair strands. After that, lift up the top sections as you work your way around the head again and dye the hair underneath in sections. [7] X Research source"

If you don’t have a lot of time and/or you don’t want to worry about getting dye everywhere, pour the ink and water into a plastic bag, such as a trash bag. Place your wig in the bag and tie it closed. If you’re going for a more vibrant color, shake the bag for a couple of minutes. If you’re going for a pastel color, simply keep the wig submerged in the dye for about 5 minutes. [9] X Research source Consider double-bagging the dye to help minimize the chances of spilling."

This usually takes about an hour, but may take longer if your wig is especially long or thick.
