      "content": "Investment websites Visit a website tailored specifically to investment networking. Sites like Fundrise , Roofstock , and Crowdstreet exist solely to connect investors. They work a little like social media websites, except everyone is real estate-minded. The best part: many are free. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Social media",
      "content": "Social media Sites like Facebook and LinkedIn connect investors. Real estate Facebook groups have become increasingly common, and while they’re less common on LinkedIn, users there tend to conduct themselves more professionally. Use the search function to look for “real estate investors” or investment networks. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Investment clubs Most large cities have clubs that focus on real estate investment. These are groups formed by and made up of people looking for investment opportunities. This means that they’re ready and willing to drop some cash on promising properties, so brush up your sales pitch. Find a local club by searching the internet for a local Real Estate Investor Alliance, or by using a site like Meetup to find like-minded individuals. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Real estate agents",
      "content": "Real estate agents Real estate agents have plenty of connections. It’s obvious when you think about it: the person selling the property probably has their own network. Ask a local real estate agent if they know anyone looking to invest, or if they have somewhere you might look.

      "content": "Property owners and managers People who own property often have their own investors. There’s a good chance they didn’t acquire that property on their own. Find a property similar to what you’re hoping to acquire, then ask the property manager, owner, or landlord about their experience with real estate investors, or if they invest themselves.

      "content": "Friends and family Your own personal connections might surprise you. Sure, they might not be able to help you with bigger investments, but they can help you start with small, cheaper properties to help build your real estate business. Hit up someone who you know might be looking to invest or play the market, and make a proposal. Also, you never know who’s already dipped their toes into the real estate game.

The local chamber of commerce, a nearby Toastmasters chapter, even a country club or an upscale gym—go where the money is. These demographics are more likely to be interested in or already doing real estate investment, so bring some business cards and don’t hesitate to broach the subject in order to network .

      "content": "Bank loans Banks often offer loans for investment properties. True, you may have to put down a slightly heftier down payment on the property, but on the upside you can use your expected rental income to help you qualify. Talk to a local bank representative about the possibility of an investment property loan. Fix-and-Flip loans are perfect for buyers looking to refurbish houses. If you’re in the business of flipping houses, many banks offer loans just for you. These loans are distinct from typical investment loans, with terms tailored to help buyers with repair costs and prospective value after the flip."

They might charge higher interest rates, but they’re more willing to help buyers who may not qualify for other loans. Search an online directory to find and connect to a lender."
