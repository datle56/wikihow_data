      "content": "Do resistance training 3–4 times a week, targeting 2–3 muscle groups per session. Start with a traditional bodybuilding split so that at the end of the week, you’ve hit every major muscle group (legs, back, core, chest, shoulders, arms, etc.). If you’re working out at home, bodyweight exercises such as push ups, pull ups, air squats, and crunches will do just fine. It may seem counterintuitive, but training your muscles actually burns more calories in the long run than spending hours on the treadmill. Hit all of the important muscle groups during the week rather than just emphasizing showy muscles, like the abs and biceps. Take 2–3 days off per week to rest and give your body a chance to recover. Exercises like squats and lunges , rows , dips , and shoulder presses that call for a high level of coordination are all excellent for building muscle in different parts of the body. The body constantly uses up calories to maintain muscle tissue, even in a resting state. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories you’ll be burning at a given time.

      "content": "Build strength by performing 4–5 sets of 5–10 reps per exercise. Since you’ll be in a reduced calorie state from dieting, too much volume in the gym can actually break down muscle without receiving enough nutrients to repair it. Keeping your volume in check while building and maintaining quality muscle mass is all about shifting your focus from endurance to strength. [2] X Research source Your weight training sessions should be relatively brief (no more than about an hour) and emphasize the major compound lifts (squats, deadlifts , and bench presses ).

      "content": "Hit your core throughout the week for defined abs. Dedicate part of each workout to strengthening and building your core muscles. This could make up the last fifteen minutes of your weight training sessions, or you could add 1 or 2 dedicated core sessions each week. Do ab-focused exercises like weighted sit ups, crunches, leg lifts, planches, and suitcase carries. For most people, a ripped physique is synonymous with rippling obliques and a chiseled, defined 6-pack. The more your train the muscles of the mid and lower abdomen, the more prominent they will be once you begin to lean out. You will also receive some residual core work from the compound lifts you're performing to develop your strength and muscle mass (particularly squats and deadlifts). Localized core training will make the ab muscles more noticeable, but to really start looking ripped, work out your entire body, get a few hours of cardio each week, and stick to a reduced-calorie diet. 80% of achieving a lean physique lies in nutrition."

      "content": "Do no more than a few hours of cardiovascular exercise each week. This can include jogging, swimming, cycling, rowing, kickboxing, or even simply walking. While resistance training creates a lasting calorie burning effect at rest, cardiovascular training gets you into a consistent fat-burning rhythm. Done together, the two will display great results in no time. [4] X Research source Try finishing your weight training workouts with 20 minutes of moderate-to-intense cardio. You will have already used up the glycogen in your muscles while lifting weights, so your body will go straight to its fat stores for energy. Or, experiment with doing cardio in a fasted state (when you’ve had nothing to eat). For example, go on a short jog first thing in the morning before you eat breakfast. Keep the intensity and length of the workout moderate. Again, with no muscle glycogen to draw from for fuel, you’ll burn pure fat while you exert yourself. A rest day from lifting makes for a great cardio-focused day. [5] X Research source Keep your heart rate elevated, but don’t torture yourself. It’s more important to find a pace and intensity that you can keep up for the duration of the workout."

A couple times a week, set aside time for a quick Tabata or HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) session. These workouts don’t take long, but are extremely taxing and can make a big impact on your fat stores. Doing HIIT and other difficult programming methods are known to be metabolically dense, meaning they rev up the mechanisms that burn fat for energy and melt the pounds right off. HIIT programs and similar exercise methods are usually offered at fitness centers in the form of group classes. [6] X Research source Tabata-style workouts are done by performing an exercise for 20 seconds, then taking 10 seconds rest. Repeat this sequence 8 times. The entire workout only takes 4 minutes, but you get a ton of bang for your buck. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Apps like Tabata Timer and Tabata Stopwatch Pro make it easy to keep track of your activity and rest intervals using your smartphone. HIIT training involves exercising with a high pace or intensity for a preselected period of time (an “interval”), then dropping the intensity for a short interval before ramping it back up again.

As long as your net calorie loss through exercise is greater than your intake through eating, you’ll continue to get leaner and more shredded. Record the approximate number of calories you take in with each meal to track your progress. When trying to shed fat, it’s best to reduce your daily calories (without skipping meals!) while receiving all the necessary nutrients and preserving lean muscle. [8] X Research source The number of calories you need will vary person to person and depends largely on your body weight and composition (people with more muscle mass need more calories to maintain it), activity level, and other factors. Generally, cutting 500 calories a day from your usual diet will result in losing ½ to 1 pound (0.23 to 0.45 kg) of fat per week. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Talk to your doctor or a nutritionist if you decide to put yourself on a reduced-calorie diet. An expert will be able to tell you exactly how many calories you'll need to maintain a healthy body composition for your size, age, and activity level. They can also provide you with helpful recommendations for food and supplementation. Use a nutrition app (such as My Fitness Pal , My Diet Coach , or Lose It! ) or an old-fashioned journal to record the number of calories you consume on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to make sure you're on track to meet your goals."

At the same time, drastically cut down on greasy, high-fat foods or eliminate them altogether. High-fat foods are richer with calories, meaning it won’t take much of them to sabotage your nutrition plan. Lean, protein-packed foods, however, contain few calories on average. Their protein content will help you build valuable, calorie-incinerating muscle mass, as well as keep you feeling full longer. [10] X Research source A good starting point is to get about 30% of your calories from protein, 40% from carbs, and 40% from fat. Get your protein from sources like lean meats, eggs, beans, tofu, and nuts. Stay away from fried foods, chips, and other snack foods. A good general guideline is to get at least 1 gram of protein for every 2 pounds (0.9 kg) of your body weight. If you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), for instance, you should aim for around 75g of protein a day.
