      "content": "Open your workbook in Excel. Sometimes, you have a large spreadsheet full of formulas, and you want to copy them exactly . Changing everything to absolute cell references would be tedious, especially if you just want to change them back again afterward. Use this method to quickly move formulas with relative cell references elsewhere without changing the references. [1] X Research source In our example spreadsheet, we want to copy the formulas from column C to column D without changing anything. Example Spreadsheet Column A Column B Column C Column D row 1 944 Frogs = A1 /2 row 2 636 Toads = A2 /2 row 3 712 Newts = A3 /2 row 4 690 Snakes = A4 /2 If you're just trying to copy the formula in a single cell, skip to the last step (\"Try alternate methods\") in this section."

      "content": "Find and replace \"=\" with another character. Type \"=\" into the \"Find what\" field, and then type a different character into the \"Replace with\" box. Click Replace All to turn all formulas (which always begin with an equal's sign) into text strings beginning with some other character. Always use a character that you have not used in your spreadsheet. For example, replace it with # or &, or a longer string of characters, such as ##&. Example Spreadsheet Column A Column B Column C Column D row 1 944 Frogs ##& A1 /2 row 2 636 Toads ##& A2 /2 row 3 712 Newts ##& A3 /2 row 4 690 Snakes ##& A4 /2 Do not use the characters * or ?, since these will make later steps more difficult."

Then, select the cells you want to paste into, and press Ctrl + V (PC) or Cmd + V (Mac) to paste. Since they are no longer interpreted as formulas, they will be copied exactly. Example Spreadsheet Column A Column B Column C Column D row 1 944 Frogs ##& A1 /2 ##& A1 /2 row 2 636 Toads ##& A2 /2 ##& A2 /2 row 3 712 Newts ##& A3 /2 ##& A3 /2 row 4 690 Snakes ##& A4 /2 ##& A4 /2"

In our example, we'll look for the character string \"##&\" and replace it with \"=\" again, so those cells become formulas once again. You can now continue editing your spreadsheet as usual: Example Spreadsheet Column A Column B Column C Column D row 1 944 Frogs = A1 /2 = A1 /2 row 2 636 Toads = A2 /2 = A2 /2 row 3 712 Newts = A3 /2 = A3 /2 row 4 690 Snakes = A4 /2 = A4 /2"

If the method described above doesn't work for some reason, or if you are worried about accidentally changing other cell contents with the \"Replace all\" option, there are a couple other things you can try: To copy a single cell's formula without changing references, select the cell, then copy the formula shown in the formula bar near the top of the window (not in the cell itself). Press Esc to close the formula bar, then paste the formula wherever you need it. Press Ctrl and ` (usually on the same key as ~) to put the spreadsheet in formula view mode. Copy the formulas and paste them into a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. Copy them again, then paste them back into the spreadsheet at the desired location. Then, press Ctrl and ` again to switch back to regular viewing mode. If you want to try a different method entirely, jump ahead to our sections on filling a column or row , pasting a formula into multiple cells , or using relative and absolute cell references ."

Excel will stop filling out the column if it sees an empty cell. If the reference data contains a gap, you will have to repeat this step to fill out the column below the gap. Another way to fill the entire column with the same formula is to select the cells directly below the one containing the formula and then press Ctrl + D ."

In our example, C2 has the formula “=A2”, which is a relative reference to the value two cells to the left.

Relative References Column A Column B Column C row 2 50 7 = A2 *2 row 3 100 row 4 200 = A4 *2 row 5 400 This works for cells outside of the same row and column as well.

Instead of using a relative cell reference, you can make it absolute by adding a $ symbol in front of the column or row that you want to keep the same, no matter where you copy the formula too. [2] X Research source Here are a few example spreadsheets, showing the original formula in larger, bold text, and the result when you copy-paste it to other cells: Relative Column, Absolute Row (B$3): The formula has an absolute reference to row 3, so it always refers to row 3: Column A Column B Column C row 1 50 7 = B$3 row 2 100 = A$3 = B$3 row 3 200 = A$3 = B$3 row 4 400 = A$3 = B$3 Absolute Column, Relative Row ($B1): The formula has an absolute reference to column B, so it always refers to column B.
