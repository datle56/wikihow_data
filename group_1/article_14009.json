If you’re ready to call it quits with Bumble, you’ll need to cancel your subscription separately so you don’t get charged anymore. [1] X Research source If you’ve already deleted your account, don’t worry. You can still cancel your subscription. If you deleted your Bumble account a while ago and never canceled your Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium subscription, you actually still have access to the premium features you’re paying for if you want to use them again. You can create a new Bumble account and ask Bumble customer service to transfer your subscription over to your new account.
