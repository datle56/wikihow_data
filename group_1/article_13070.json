They came back briefly later that year before being discontinued for good. [5] X Research source"

Bubble Beepers went out of style in the mid-1990s, and beepers followed suit not long after. [8] X Research source"

Introduced in the 1920s, the odd name was meant to persuade consumers that the candy was healthy. Chicken Dinner was just chocolate-covered nuts.
