      "content": "Get your hands on a black PVC jumpsuit. A shiny black PVC jumpsuit is the basis of of many a Catwoman costume, and Michelle Pfeiffer's look is no different. Try to get a jumpsuit that zips up the front, with a high neckline and long sleeves. These type of jumpsuits are readily available at most costume or Halloween stores, or can be found online and purchased off eBay. If you don't have the time or money to buy a PVC jumpsuit, you can piece together a similar look using items already in your wardrobe. Tight leather pants, leather or wet look leggings, or even a tight pair of black jeans can be used for the pants. A tight black turtleneck sweater will form the top."

      "content": "Stitch jagged white lines into the material. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman jumpsuit had white stitching detail all over, so that's the look your are trying to recreate. First grab some white chalk and draw the outline of the jagged lines you want to create. Place them at random all over the PVC suit (or top and trousers), using a picture of the Catwoman costume from the movie for reference. Then take a needle and length of white thread and start stitching over the white lines. If you're tight for time, you can simply use the white chalk to create the stitched effect, or paint over the chalk with some white-out."

      "title": "Buy or make a Catwoman headpiece.",
      "content": "Buy or make a Catwoman headpiece. Possibly the most important part of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman costume was her headpiece -- a black PVC half-mask with cat ears. In order to achieve an authentic-looking headpiece, it may be best to buy a replica mask off Amazon or eBay. These sites often sets which include a headpieces, gloves and claws. However, if you are on a budget, you can make your own Catwoman headpiece at home. Here's how: Take an old pair of black cotton sweatpants. Make sure that there is some stretch in the material and that you can fit the leg of the pants over your head. Cut off the bottom of the sweatpants -- the piece you cut off should be long enough to cover half your face, reaching just above the tip of your nose. There should also be several inches of material above the top of your head, to make the ears. Take a piece of white chalk and draw a white semi-circle on the cut side of the material. This is the line you will cut out to form pointy ears on both sides of the mask. Also draw two large eyes on the mask, using a picture from the movie for reference. Take a sharp scissors and cut out the semi-circle along the chalk line. Also cut out the two eye holes. Take a needle and some black thread and sew the top of the mask closed - there should now be pointy ears on top of the head. Try the mask on -- if it feels too loose along the sides, add a couple of stitches to tighten it. [1] X Research source You can wear the mask as it is, or you can add the same white jagged stitching you did on the jumpsuit. Again, use a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer's headpiece from the movie as reference."

      "content": "Make some clawed gloves. To achieve Catwoman-worthy talons, all you need to do is find a pair of elbow-length, black gloves - if you can find them in a shiny material, that's great, otherwise any kind of material will do. Take a sharp scissors and cut slits in the tip of each finger. Find a packet of black fake nails - the longer and pointier the better. Apply them to your own fingernails, then slip on the gloves - the pointy ends of the fake nails should poke right through the slits. Tah-dah! Of course it is also possible to buy Catwoman gloves online with the nails already attached - but this method gives you the option of taking the gloves off and still having cat-like claws!"

      "content": "Get some black PVC pants or leggings. Halle Berry's Catwoman sported a slightly different look to her other incarnations, so no need for a jumpsuit this time. For the pants you will need leather or wet-look pants -- you should be able to find a suitable pair at a Halloween or costume store. Although the pants should be tight at the top, the legs should widen slightly at the bottom -- in the movie, Halle Berry's pants are bootcut rather than skinny. Take some white chalk and draw jagged lightening bolt shapes all over the legs of the pants -- front and back. Then take a sharp scissors and cut along the lines to a achieve a ripped effect. Don't worry about cutting neatly -- you want to look as though you were attacked by a horde of angry cats!"

If possible, find a PVC or leather-look bra or cropped bustier to mimic Halle Berry's hardcore lingerie from the movie. If you can't find anything suitable in those materials, silk is your next best option. And hey, if you have time before you actually need to wear the costume, why not work on achieving a flat stomach -- the best accessory this costume could have! If you are not comfortable revealing that much flesh, or you plan on being outdoors, a good alternative is to wear a black, strappy bodysuit instead. Just make sure you put some rips and tears in it as well, to achieve the claw-ravaged look!"

      "content": "Wrap two black belts around your waist. Halle Berry's wore a complicated, criss-crossed belt contraption that connected her bra straps to her pants. An exact replica of this would be hard to achieve, but you can create a similar effect simply by wrapping two belts around your waist, crossing them over to form an \"X\" shape. Ideally the belts would be made from canvas, in black or dark khaki green, but any kind of belts will do the job."

This is perhaps the simplest version of the Catwoman costumes, but that doesn't diminish its power! The basis of the costume is a black jumpsuit, with long sleeves and a zip up the front. If possible, try to get a jumpsuit in a matte black color, though shiny PVC will work if not. If you can't get your hands on a jumpsuit, some tight black pants or leggings and a black zip-up or turtleneck sweater will do the trick."

      "content": "Buy or make a black mask and cat ears. Anne Hathaway's Catwoman, unlike the others, does not wear a headpiece, but wears a simple black mask and headpiece, with her hair worn loose down her back. In this respect, she is similar to the version of Catwoman portrayed by Julie Newmar in the 1960s series Batman . Any plain black mask (that just covers the eyes) will work for this outfit, along with a headband or clips with cat ears attached. You can make your own mask using black felt (an embossed black works really well for this particular costume). Simply draw the outline of the mask onto the piece of felt, cut it out neatly, and attach a length of black elastic to either side to form a mask. [2] X Research source To make your own cat ears: cut out two triangular-shaped pieces from some black cardstock, glue black PVC or felt fabric to both sides of the cardstock, then attach each ear to a black alligator clip."

If you have some in your wardrobe already - great! If not, you may need to trawl through some shoes stores or websites to find the perfect pair. The heels should be 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) high. Of course, knee-high black boots will do in pinch - it all depends on how true to the movie you want your costume to be."

      "title": "Wear hair straight and voluminous.",
      "content": "Wear hair straight and voluminous. Unlike the other costumes, where hair is tied back or tucked underneath the mask, this look allows hair to be left loose. Anne Hathaway's hair was straight, but had plenty of volume. To achieve a similar effect, apply mousse to wet hair then blow dry hair straight, holding your head upside down. Pull the hair back from the face using the cat-ear headband or clips."

Blend it well, using a stippling brush to create a flawless finish. Set the foundation with a loose translucent powder. Don’t use concealer beneath your eyes -- you want to have slight dark circles."

Next, apply a dark brown eyeshadow around the creases of your eyelids, then apply a dark black eyeshadow to the center of your lids, blending it outwards. Apply the black eyeshadow to your lower lash line with a small, angled brush, bringing it right into the corner of the eye. It should look a little messy. Use a cotton swab to blend the shadow on your lower lash line to give a hazy, smoky effect. Line the inner rim of your bottom lashes using a black eyeliner. Curl your eyelashes, then apply a black mascara generously to upper and lower lashes."
