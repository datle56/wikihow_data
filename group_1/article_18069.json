      "content": "Forced proximity is a trope in novels where two characters are forced to stay in the same location together, often resulting in romance. The two main characters typically either don’t like each other or don’t know each other at the start of the novel. They end up stuck together in the same location over the course of the novel, and they often develop feelings for each other as they grow closer, although not always. The forced proximity trope is often used in romance novels, but it's also sometimes featured in thrillers. Some examples of what forced proximity might look like include: [1] X Research source Two characters stuck in a cabin during a storm, blizzard, or other natural disaster. A bodyguard having to protect someone they aren’t initially fond of. Two characters with different personalities having to do a job together. Two characters staying in the same room, but there’s only one bed. One character is sick and the other character has to nurse them back to health. Two characters have a mutual goal they can’t accomplish without each other’s help. Two characters are stuck together in a small, confined area, like a cell, train car, or carriage."

      "content": "Forced proximity often leads to unexpected alliances, exciting dynamics, and romantic relationships. The forced proximity trope brings two unlikely people together and forces them to be companions (or enemies). This tends to lead to exciting character and narrative dynamics, and in some cases, intense, passionate romantic relationships. It often brings two people of different social circumstances (different social groups, classes, races, etc.) together when they wouldn’t normally interact. This makes for exciting, dynamic stories where characters become more developed and well-rounded over the course of the novel."
