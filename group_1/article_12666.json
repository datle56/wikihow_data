      "content": "Come to a complete halt at a stop sign or red light. At a stop sign, come to complete halt for about 2 seconds or until vehicles that arrived before you clear the intersection. If you’re stopped at a red light, proceed when the light has turned green. If the intersection has a white stripe in your lane, stop before this line. [1] X Research source If you have a stop sign, but the street you’re crossing does not have a stop sign, wait until all traffic has cleared before crossing the intersection. Before you proceed, be sure all vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians have cleared your path, even if it’s your turn to go. Treat a blinking red light as a stop sign. A blinking yellow light means slow down and proceed with caution."

      "content": "Turn right at a red light if it’s permitted and no vehicles are approaching. If you see a sign that says, \"No right turn on red,\" then you must wait for the light to turn green again. Otherwise, you may turn right at a red light after yielding to oncoming traffic. Double check your local traffic laws. In some locations, right turns on red are never permitted. Note that, in the UK, left hand turns at a red light (the equivalent to right turns in the US) are not permitted. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Stop for pedestrians who’ve begun crossing the road. Once a pedestrian has begun crossing the road, they have the right of way. You should also stop for pedestrians waiting to cross at crosswalks that aren’t controlled by a traffic light. [3] X Research source In most areas, a pedestrian shouldn’t cross an intersection controlled by a traffic light until they have a green light or a walk sign. However, you still need to stop for a crossing pedestrian if you have a green light and are subsequently turning onto the adjacent road."

      "content": "Pass through a yield sign only if there are no approaching vehicles. Slow down as you approach a yield sign (or, in the UK, a give way sign). Come to a complete stop if there are any approaching vehicles, and allow them to pass. If there are no approaching vehicles, you can proceed without stopping. [4] X Research source As a rule of thumb, stop at a yield sign if entering the road would cause an approaching motorist to brake."

[6] X Research source While you should treat bicyclists as motor vehicles, use caution when driving around them. Give bicyclists as much room as possible, and slow down when you pass one."

If the light isn't functioning properly and you have a blinking red light, treat it as a stop sign. For a blinking yellow light, proceed slowly and with caution.

When 2 vehicles arrive at a 4 way stop or intersection with no traffic signs at the same time, the driver to the right has priority. If possible, make eye contact with the other driver or flash your lights to signal that you’re letting them pass. [9] X Research source In countries where motorists drive on the right side of the road, the driver on the right has priority at intersections. The driver on the right also has priority at intersections in Australia and Singapore, even though motorists drive on the left side of the road in these countries. [10] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source There is no left or right priority in the UK.
