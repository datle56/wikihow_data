      "content": "Alternatively, make your own all-natural spray with a vinegar and water. Mix up one part white vinegar with three parts water, then put it in an old spray bottle or solvent sprayer. While vinegar isn't the most pleasant smell, it will fight the mildew naturally and it will fade off quickly. Throw in the juice from half a lemon to get a slightly fresher and longer lasting scent.

There are also vents on the dashboard, and usually one on the pointing on the back windshield as well. Keep the doors closed as you do this. You want the cleaning fluid to get in the system."

It is often on the drivers side floor, near the console, or in the trunk. The little button with arrows pointing a circle tells your car to stop taking air from the outside, and instead recycle the air from the inside. Press this button if you have it, then spray down this vent to make sure your cleaning fluid is staying in the system."

With the AC off, keep the fans blasting to make sure a lot of air hits the evaporator and removes any mildew, moisture, or mold spores from taking root.

Remember that the AC, not the fan, creates the moisture that spawns mold. The fan will just heat it up from the hot car motor (hopefully killing it) and then remove it from the AC evaporator."
