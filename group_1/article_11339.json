Use the #562 tile bit for irregular cuts such as circles. Use the #545 diamond wheel blade to make straight cuts.

If you're using the #562 tile bit, plunge it into the tile at a 45-degree angle and gradually push it in until it is at a 90-degree angle. If you're using the #545 blade, plunge it into the tile at a 90-degree angle. [4] X Research source Be sure to put on safety goggles and cover your mouth with a dust mask before you start cutting."

      "content": "Push the tool gently to cut along the line you marked. Carefully push the Dremel tool with both hands along the first line to cut out the part of the tile you want to remove. Apply just enough pressure to move the tool forward, but let the Dremel do most of the work. [5] X Research source You could wear out the bit prematurely if you push too hard. If you accidentally crack a tile, you can repair the crack with a tile repair epoxy kit."

Plunge the tool again and repeat the process if you need to make another cut. [6] X Research source If you are cutting out a circle, you can either try to do the whole cut at once with the #562 bit, or you can cut an “X” in the middle first to cut out smaller sections at a time. When you are done cutting, remove the plastic coverings you put down and wipe up any dust that they didn’t catch."

No matter what type of tile you want to cut, a Dremel tool can do the job."

Stop pushing when you reach the end of the line and carefully lift the Dremel tool up out of the tile. [12] X Research source If you are cutting a whole end off a tile, then simply push through to the end of the line and let the excess piece fall away.
