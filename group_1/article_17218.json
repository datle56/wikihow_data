If you have an odd number of data, do not include the middle number – in Set B, for instance, you would not figure in one of the 10s.

You can use this to understand how widely-spread the data is. For instance, if a test is scored out of 100, and the IQR of the scores is 5, you can assume that most of the people taking it had a similar grasp of the material because the high-low range is not very large. If the IQR of the test scores is 30, however, you might start to wonder why some people scored so high and others scored so low. Even example (Set A): 12 - 7 = 5 Odd example (Set B): 18 - 8 = 10"
