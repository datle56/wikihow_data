During a medical emergency, follow life support guidelines. Once the individual is under the care of an emergency medical team, document the absences of a pulse as a \"0,\" meaning no pulse.

A low pulse is considered a pulse below 60 beats per minute. Keep in mind, this is not always an indicator of a medical problem. Athletes and people who engage in a lot of aerobic activity frequently have a lower than average pulse."

The number you get is the pulse rate, measured in beats per minute. To save time, you can also count someone's pulse for 30 seconds and multiply that number by two."

      "content": "Note if the pulse is steady. Ideally, a pulse should be regular. This means, the pulse should beat at even moments without unusual pauses or extra beats. It also should not speed up or slow down. If the pulse was steady, note this. If it was irregular in any way, make a note that the pulse had an irregular rhythm. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source An unusual pause or \"skipped beat\" is not immediate cause for concern. These can be normal in healthy young and elderly people. However, if someone is dizzy or lightheaded, then unusual pauses can pose a threat.

      "content": "Write down the pulse's strength. Measuring strength is somewhat subjective. However, use your best judgment to take note of the strength of the pulse. The pulse should be described as weak, faint, strong, or bounding. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A weak pulse would be difficult to feel. A faint pulse would be slightly more noticeable, but still lack strength. A strong pulse would be easiest to locate and measure. It should be strong enough you can feel with ease, but it should not be quick or forceful. A bounding pulse may be faster and it will also come with greater strength. You will be able to feel palpitations in the wrist or neck very strongly."
