      "content": "Pinpoint the time at which your computer slowed down. If your computer slowed down noticeably within the last week or so, chances are that an update, a program, or a changed setting is what slowed down your computer. If your computer's been steadily slowing down over a period of time, it's likely that the problem is either due to lack of proper computer care (e.g., regularly shutting down) or age. It could also slow down if you're downloading and saving large files often. We'll cover how to check your hard drive space on Windows and on Mac later in the article."

      "title": "Consider your computer's age.",
      "content": "Consider your computer's age. If your computer is more than a few years old, it will most likely begin to slow down regardless of how well you've cared for it. This doesn't mean that something else isn't slowing down your computer as wellâ€”just know that old computers will eventually lose some of their speed. When using computers that are several years old, updating to new versions of operating systems (e.g., from Windows 7 to Windows 10) may negatively impact the computer's performance."

      "content": "Check your computer's hardware. All computers have intake and output vents; if you look at these vents and notice dust or other buildup, it could be a contributing factor. [1] X Research source You can remove dust from a vent by using compressed air, or by wiping down the vents with a moist paper towel. If there's a large amount of dust clustered around a vent, your computer probably has dust inside of it as well. You should take your computer into a professional tech department to have it cleaned if this is the case."

      "content": "Monitor for noisy fans and exceptionally warm parts. Computer fans will often speed up when a hefty process (e.g., video processing) is occurring, or when your computer is updating. However, if your computer's fans are constantly running at high speeds and the computer's housing is warming up to an uncomfortable level, the computer's circulation system is probably in need of repair. As with internal dust and grit, having your computer's circulation system replaced is a job for professionals."

If your computer's performance improves drastically after closing a certain program, that program is to blame for some of your computer's performance issues. It's also good to close programs that you're not using as a general habit. Not only will this increase your computer's speed now, it may also prevent errors with those programs later. If you suspect your software is affecting your computer's performance, you can skip ahead to the section on using the Task Manager (Windows) or using the Activity Monitor (Mac) ."
