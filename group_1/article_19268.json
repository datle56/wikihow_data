If you have long, thick hair, an afternoon wash can be good or perhaps braid it and let it dry more in the morning. Hair can be styled the night before for those who go to this extent of trouble. For example, braids leave waves in the hair next morning."

[7] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Do your business as needed, as quickly as you can. Wash your face. Use a face washer to clean your face and eyes, remembering that you have already showered the night before. This will clean and freshen. Do basic hygiene and grooming as needed. Add the deodorant, perfume, cologne, etc. Brush your hair. If you style it, that will add time, so consider haircuts and styles that don't chew up your precious time. Do your makeup if you wear it. However, this could be left to do later if you are content to do it while traveling or at work in the office bathroom. It's usually better if you get the routine down to a minute or two, to allow you to add it at home and get going already made up. Make it fast and light. Try some mascara and lip gloss, and a little cover-up. Finish by brushing your teeth. Floss as well."
