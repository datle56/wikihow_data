      "title": "Talk with your child's pediatrician.",
      "content": "Talk with your child's pediatrician. Before you proceed with any natural or homemade remedies, check with your child's pediatrician. The doctor will be able to confirm the diagnosis and give you a professional medical opinion about what treatment will be best for your infant. While many home treatments for thrush appear to be safe, keep in mind that your babyâ€™s digestive and immune systems are still fairly immature, and your pediatrician may want to proceed with caution."

      "title": "Give your child acidophilus.",
      "content": "Give your child acidophilus. Acidophilus is a powdered form of the bacteria typically found in a healthy gastrointestinal tract. Yeast and intestinal bacteria balance each other in the human body, and often taking antibiotics or developing thrush allows a spike in yeast growth. Taking acidophilus may help reduce yeast growth and treat the causes of thrush in infants. [2] X Research source Make a paste by combining acidophilus powder with clean water or breastmilk. [3] X Research source Rub this paste in the baby's mouth once daily until the thrush clears up. [4] X Research source You can also add one teaspoon of acidophilus powder to formula or breastmilk if the child is bottle feeding. Administer acidophilus once daily until the thrush clears up.

      "title": "Try yogurt.",
      "content": "Try yogurt. If your child is able to swallow yogurt, your pediatrician may recommend that you add unsweetened lactobacilli yogurt to your child's diet. This works similarly to acidophilus, by balancing out the yeast population in your child's gastrointestinal tract. [6] X Research source If your child is not old enough to swallow yogurt, try applying it with a clean cotton swab to the affected area. Only use a small amount of yogurt and supervise your child closely to ensure that he does not choke on the yogurt. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use grapefruit seed extract (GSE).",
      "content": "Use grapefruit seed extract (GSE). Grapefruit seed extract, when mixed with distilled water and administered daily, may help treat the symptoms of thrush in some children. Mix 10 drops of GSE in one ounce of distilled water. Some doctors believe that the antibacterial treatment of tap water may reduce the efficacy of GSE. Use a clean cotton swab to apply the GSE mixture to your child's mouth once every hour during all waking hours. Swab the child's mouth prior to nursing. This may help reduce the bitter taste associated with nursing while the child is afflicted with thrush, and can help him return to a normal feeding schedule. If the thrush does not improve significantly by the second day of treatment, you may try increasing the strength of the GSE mixture by dissolving 15 to 20 drops of GSE into one ounce of distilled water, instead of the original 10 drops."

      "title": "Administer miconazole.",
      "content": "Administer miconazole. Miconazole is often the go-to treatment option for pediatricians treating thrush. Miconazole comes in a medicated gel that a parent or caretaker will need to apply to the baby's mouth. Wash your hands with antibacterial soap. You will need to have clean hands before applying any medication to your child. Administer 1/4 of a teaspoon of miconazole to the affected areas of the child's mouth, up to four times daily. Use a clean finger or a clean cotton swab to apply miconazole directly to the affected site. Do not use too much gel, as it may cause a choking hazard. You should also avoid administering the gel in the back of your child's mouth, as it could easily slide down his throat. Continue miconazole treatments until your pediatrician tells you to stop. Miconazole is not recommended for infants under six months of age. The risk of choking is significantly increased in children younger than six months."

      "title": "Try nystatin.",
      "content": "Try nystatin. Nystatin is often prescribed instead of miconazole, especially in the US. It is a liquid medication that is administered to the affected area in a child's mouth using either a dropper, medication syringe, or a clean cotton swab coated in nystatin. Shake the bottle of nystatin before administering each dose. The medicine is suspended in liquid, so it's important to shake the bottle so that the medicine is evenly distributed throughout the bottle. Your pharmacist should give you a dropper, syringe, or spoon to measure and administer nystatin. If your pharmacist has not given you a tool for measuring and administering nystatin, follow the instructions that came with the medicine. If your child is small, your pediatrician may recommend that you administer half a dose to each side of the child's tongue, or she may recommend that you use a clean cotton swab to apply the liquid to the sides of your child's mouth. If your child is old enough to follow your instruction, have the child swish the nystatin around his mouth to thoroughly coat the entire surface of the tongue, cheeks, tongue, and gums. Wait five to ten minutes after administering nystatin before feeding your child, if it is near his meal time. Administer nystatin up to four times daily. Continue administering the medication for up to five days after thrush has cleared up, as thrush commonly recurs shortly after treatment ends. [12] X Research source Nystatin rarely causes side effects like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or stomach discomfort, or may cause allergic reactions in some children. Talk to your pediatrician about the possible side effects of nystatin before administering the medication to your child."
