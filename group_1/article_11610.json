      "title": "Join a server.",
      "content": "Join a server. This sounds simple, but there are two paths you can take here: join a server focused on dating, or join a server about something you're interested in. The good news is that you can try both of these approaches, even at the same time if you like. Join a dating server: If you join a dating server, you're likely to find other people who are also interested in finding a romantic partner. Some dating servers even have blind dates or speed dates that you can be set up on. [1] X Research source However, it might be harder to find someone you truly connect with and have a lot in common with. Join an interest-based server: If you join a server that's based on your interests, you'll find other people who like the same things that you like, but you might have a harder time finding people who are looking to date."

      "content": "Write an intro. If you join a dating server, you might be required to submit some kind of intro or profile so other users can find you. Even some non-dating servers give users a place to put an intro as well, so consider filling one out so other users can learn a little bit more about you."

      "title": "Start chatting.",
      "content": "Start chatting. It's best to start off by chatting in the channels in the server. If you end up hitting it off with someone, you can ask if they want to move to DMs. What you chat about, however, is way different whether you're in a dating Discord or not. If you're in a dating Discord, you might be able to get away with being a little flirty right off the bat. Don't be too forward right from the start, however—this could have the opposite effect and scare the other person away. If you're in an interest-based Discord server, focus first on building a rapport with other users. Most people won't be receptive if you hop into their DMs trying to flirt right off the bat, and you could get a bad reputation in the server. It's also likely that you don't know if the person you're talking to is single, and being too forward will come off as weird—and it could cost you a friendship as well as a potential relationship. Relationship coach Maya Diamond says it's easy to fall into a fantasy of imagining your life with a person you're interested in, but it's important not to do that early on when you barely know the other person. \"You can create a lack of really seeing the person for who they are, which is very dangerous when it comes to dating and relationships,\" Diamond says."

      "title": "Make sure it's appropriate to potentially date the person you're chatting with.",
      "content": "Make sure it's appropriate to potentially date the person you're chatting with. It's very easy to stay anonymous online and to hide or lie about your personal details, and this extends to Discord. Unfortunately, online predators have used Discord to do some terrible things, [2] X Research source and despite Discord's no-tolerance policy for these actions, they can still happen. [3] X Research source Because anonymity is prevalent online, make sure before you continue that it's both legal and ethical to pursue a potential relationship with the person you're chatting with. Ask the other person how old they are. If you are suspicious that the person is lying at all, it's best to cut the relationship off before it progresses. Do voice and video calls. Before you decide to try dating someone, try and ascertain their age through video calls. This is not foolproof, however, as some people look older or younger than they actually are. Ask mutuals. If you and the person you're interested in have mutual friends you trust, ask them for verification. Add them on Facebook. While Facebook doesn't require you to show your birthdate, you might be able to glean some information about their age based on how old their account is and the photos on their account."

      "title": "Ask if the other person is single.",
      "content": "Ask if the other person is single. If you're in a dating Discord, you can likely skip this step—though you may still find it necessary if you're concerned that the person you're talking to is lying about being single or ethically non-monogamous. Ask directly. It's good to be honest with your intentions, but you may end up hurting someone's feelings if you start building a friendship with them, only to dump the friendship if you can't date the other person. Try an indirect approach. Try subtly flirting with the other person to see how they respond. You can also try asking about their weekend plans; if they have a significant other, there's a good chance they will spend time with their SO on the weekend."

      "title": "Confess your feelings and/or ask the other person out.",
      "content": "Confess your feelings and/or ask the other person out. If you're on a dating Discord, this is once again a little more straightforward—the people you're chatting with are likely interested in starting a relationship, so the process of starting to chat with someone and asking them to date could be pretty quick. However, this process might take longer if you're talking to someone you met in a general interest server. Dating coach Collete Gee says that one of the biggest pitfalls she sees in online dating is not following through. If you ask someone out and they say they're interested, make sure to follow through by planning online dating sessions—such as playing a game together, watching a movie, or even setting up your webcams so you can eat a meal together. Once you're both comfortable and if the relationship develops, you might even consider meeting in person. If you get rejected, accept the other person's answer. Getting angry, yelling, or goading the other person for rejecting you will not get them to say yes."

Look for servers that have reviews, if possible. However, make sure the reviews are real (as some people post fake reviews just to give the server a higher rating). Many dating servers rate themselves as NSFW (not safe for work) and may feature sexual content. Sexual content is permitted on Discord as long as it's in line with Discord's Sexual Content Policy . [4] X Research source However, servers that facilitate teenage dating are against Discord's Community Guidelines . [5] X Research source If you're not over the age of 18, you should not join servers meant for dating, especially those with NSFW content, or you, the other users in the server, and/or the server owner may face repercussions from Discord or the law (if laws have been broken)."

Don't continue a friendship with someone who makes you feel weird, creeped out, or unsafe. If necessary, block and report the user. Dating coach Lisa Shield says to avoid people who give you a ton of positive attention right away. \"If they send messages every day and they say 'good morning, beautiful', 'I'm thinking about you', and 'you’re so amazing', they know what they're doing,\" Shield says. \"These guys know what they're doing and it works.\""
