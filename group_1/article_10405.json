      "title": "Fold your bandana diagonally in half.",
      "content": "Fold your bandana diagonally in half. Choose a bandana that’s at least 20 by 20 inches (51 cm × 51 cm) so it’s large enough to wrap around your head. Lay the bandana flat in front of you so one of the corners points toward your body. Fold the top corner over and bring it toward the bottom. Your bandana will look like a triangle with the longest side facing away from you. [2] X Research source Hold your bandana up to a light source and check if you can see any light coming through it. If you notice some light shining through, then the material won’t be effective."

    {
      "title": "Bring the bottom corner up so it touches the top edge.",
      "content": "Bring the bottom corner up so it touches the top edge. Lift the corner that’s pointing toward you and fold it up. Align the corner with the long folded edge at the top of your bandana. Your bandana should look like an upside-down trapezoid. [3] X Research source This ensures that your bandana has 2–3 layers of protection, so particles are less likely to get through the fabric."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the top third of the bandana down to the center.",
      "content": "Fold the top third of the bandana down to the center. Take the top edge of your bandana and fold it down toward the middle, keeping it parallel to the bottom. Make sure the corner you folded in the last step stays tucked in, so your mask doesn’t fall down or feel loose. Crease the fold so it stays in place easier. [4] X Research source Try to keep your bandana as flat as you can, so the folds don’t come undone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the bandana tight around your nose and mouth.",
      "content": "Pull the bandana tight around your nose and mouth. Carefully pick up the ends of the bandana in each hand so it stays folded. Put all the folds against your face, so the flat side faces out. Keep the mask as tight as you can without restricting your breathing or causing any pain. [5] X Research source If the bandana doesn’t cover your nose, mouth, and chin completely, move the edge you just folded up a little higher to make the mask taller."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the ends of the bandana behind your head.",
      "content": "Tie the ends of the bandana behind your head. Pull the ends tightly behind your head, so your mask sits snugly over your nose and mouth. Use an overhand knot to secure the bandana to your head. Check your bandana in a mirror to make sure it doesn’t sag down or expose your nose. [6] X Research source If you have a ponytail, you can choose to tie the bandana above or below it."

    {
      "title": "Fold your bandana in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Fold your bandana in half lengthwise. Pick a bandana that’s 20 by 20 inches (51 cm × 51 cm) or larger so it completely covers your nose, mouth, and chin. Put the bandana flat on a table, so one of the edges faces you. Grab the top 2 corners of the bandana and fold them down so they align with the bottom corners. Your bandana will look like a rectangle with the longest edge facing you. Many bandanas have one side with vibrant colors and another side with duller colors. Keep the vibrant side face down when you start so it’s on the exterior of your mask."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the top and bottom thirds of the bandana to the middle.",
      "content": "Bring the top and bottom thirds of the bandana to the middle. Take the top edge of the bandana and fold it down a third of the way. Then, smooth out the fabric so it lies flat. Bring the bottom third up so it overlaps the top fold you just made. Your bandana should look like a long, narrow rectangle. This ensures that there are multiple layers of fabric covering your face so you’re less at risk to catch or transmit any viruses."

      "title": "Slide hair ties onto the bandana so they’re 6 in (15 cm) apart.",
      "content": "Slide hair ties onto the bandana so they’re 6 in (15 cm) apart. You can use any elastic hair tie for your bandana mask, so choose whichever ones you have lying around. Feed the ends of the bandana through the hair ties and slide them toward the center. Leave at least 6 inches (15 cm) between the hair ties so you can cover your face with the middle of the bandana. If you don’t have hair ties, use rubber bands instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the sides in toward the center.",
      "content": "Fold the sides in toward the center. Hold the hair ties in place so they don’t slide or move around. Fold the left side of the bandana in toward the middle so it traps the hair tie in place. Do the same for the right side. That way, you add more layers to your mask and keep the hair ties on the outer edges. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Loop the hair ties around your ears to wear your mask.",
      "content": "Loop the hair ties around your ears to wear your mask. Press the folded side of your mask against your face so it completely covers your nose, mouth, and chin. Stretch the hair ties over your ears so they hold the mask tightly on your face. Adjust the edges of your bandana until it feels comfortable to wear. [8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Avoid leaving your nose uncovered since it will make your mask ineffective. If your bandana fits so tightly that it causes pain or makes it hard to breathe, take it off and unfold the sides. Slide the hair ties closer to the edges before folding them back in and putting your mask back on. However, your masks will be more effective if it fits snugly than if it was loose."
