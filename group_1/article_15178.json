      "content": "You can’t dye your hair bright colors without using bleach or a developer. However, you can dye your hair a different color that's the same value, like dark brown to light brown or black to dark or medium brown. It’s not possible to go from dark brown to blonde without using a bleaching chemical, whether you use a bleaching kit or a box dye with a developer. [1] X Research source A developer is a kind of hydrogen peroxide that lifts the cuticle layer of the hair and shifts its natural shade to a slightly lighter color. It’s specially formulated for dark hair colors and often included in hair dye kits, but you can also buy it as a separate product . You can also try naturally lightening your hair 1 to 2 shades using lemon juice and sun exposure, apple cider vinegar, or a pot of cooled chamomile tea. [2] X Research source There’s no way to get pastel or brightly colored hair without bleaching your hair."

      "content": "Virgin hair and some hair textures may take dye better than others. Everyone has different hair types with varying levels of texture and porosity, which can affect how well your hair can take dye. If you have non-virgin (recently dyed or chemically treated) hair, a new color will probably not get rid of the old color and may require color correction or even bleach. [3] X Research source If you identify as Asian, your hair might be more difficult to dye because your hair might be darker and your cuticle layer may be stronger. [4] X Research source Textured curly or kinky hair might also be tricky to dye because of how fragile and prone to breakage it is. [5] X Research source"

Professional hair stylist Gina Almona doesn’t recommend trying to bleach (or pre-lighten) your hair at home because “it could break the bond of the hair severely.” [6] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. You may risk creating unnecessary damage or unwanted tones throughout your hair, especially if you’ve never dyed your hair yourself before. [7] X Research source During a consultation, Gina Almona says that a hairstylist will ask you questions like, “Is your hair natural or pre-colored? If it is pre-colored how long has it been since your last color service, or did you use box dye?” [8] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 February 2021."

      "title": "Opt for demi-permanent or permanent hair dye over semi-permanent.",
      "content": "Opt for demi-permanent or permanent hair dye over semi-permanent. Demi-permanent dye can last from anywhere between 12 to 26 washes and contains low amounts of peroxide, so it can lighten your hair slightly. Permanent dye lasts until your colored strands grow out and can lighten your hair more than demi-permanent dye. [9] X Research source Choose a hair dye that only lightens your hair up to 4 levels—any more than that can damage your strands. [10] X Research source Semi-permanent hair dye doesn’t contain peroxide, which means it can only make your hair darker, not lighter. [11] X Research source If you’re looking to dye your hair red, purple, or blue, look for dyes that are specially made for dark, black, or brunette hair, like Splat or Manic Panic hair dye. Hair dye is translucent, so if your hair is brown and you dye it one of these colors, it may end up darker than what's on the box or only appear as highlights in certain lighting. Look for a box dye with a developer formula that has a low peroxide volume, like 20 (6%). [12] X Research source Higher peroxide volumes may damage your hair."

      "content": "Choose a dye in a brighter cooler tone than your natural hair color. If you’re trying to dye your hair a lighter shade of the same color, look for ash hair dyes that are at least 1 to 3 shades lighter than your own. “Ash” dyes have cooler undertones and may prevent your hair from turning brassy or orange after you dye it. [13] X Research source If you have dark hair and you’re trying to lighten it as much as possible, choose an ash-blonde box dye instead of a brown or black shade."

      "content": "Use a toner after dyeing your hair to prevent it from turning brassy. When dark hair is lightened, it can leave behind an orange color. A toner is a gel-like hair coloring product that can soften out the contrast and even out the color while adding shine. If you’re lightening your hair more than a couple of shades, use a gloss or demi-permanent toner. [14] X Research source Follow the instructions exactly as they’re outlined on the box and try to avoid toners that contain ammonia, which can turn your hair even more orange. [15] X Research source If you’re getting your hair professionally dyed, your stylist will probably use a toner or gloss as part of the service, but you can ask your stylist to make sure. [16] X Research source Purple or blue-tinted toning shampoos and conditioners can also help neutralize brassy, orange tones. They’re also key for taking care of your color-treated hair after you’re done. [17] X Research source"
