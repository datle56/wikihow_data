Yes, there are a lot of reasons a person may feel sad: a job loss, the loss of a loved one, poor relationships, a traumatic event, or other stress. At some point in time, everyone will experience a reason to be sad. Feeling sad occasionally is normal. The major difference between sadness and depression is the focus. [1] X Expert Source Lauren Urban, LCSW Licensed Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 3 September 2018. When you are sad, your feelings arise from a specific event or situation. Once that event changes or time passes, the sadness fades. Depression, on the other hand, affects your thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and behaviors. You don't just feel sad about one thing, you feel sad about everything. And, despite your trying to pull yourself out of this mood, the feeling sticks. You can feel depressed and not even have a reason to attribute to it. [2] X Expert Source Lauren Urban, LCSW Licensed Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 3 September 2018. Depression also can manifest as a persistent empty feeling or a lack of enthusiasm for many things."

[3] X Research source Here's what's happening: Neurotransmitters are the chemical messengers that relay messages between brain cells. Abnormal levels of neurotransmitters are thought to play a role in depression. Changes in hormone balance may cause depression. Such changes can include thyroid problems, menopause, or a recent pregnancy. Physical changes have been observed in the brains of individuals who are depressed. The significance is unknown, but such observations may someday pinpoint the cause of depression. Depression often runs in families. This suggests that there are genes specific to depression, researchers are actively working on identifying them.
