      "title": "Find out who’s better at jumping into a pair of sweatpants.",
      "content": "Find out who’s better at jumping into a pair of sweatpants. Grab a pair of extra-roomy sweatpants and head outside to a patch of soft grass. Have your partner and a friend hold the sweatpants open, then jump as high as you can so that your feet fall straight into the pant legs. Swap places with your partner and have them try it too. [1] X Research source Do this over soft grass or a thick rubber crash mat. That way, you’re less likely to get hurt if you fall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze into the same clothes and spend an hour attached.",
      "content": "Squeeze into the same clothes and spend an hour attached. Choose sweatpants and an old coat, sweater, or baggy shirt that you both fit into. Place both of your legs into one pant leg, then have your partner do the same on the other side. Put both your heads through the shirt’s collar, with one person’s arm in the right sleeve and the other’s arm in the left sleeve. Spend an hour together doing everyday tasks, and try not to trip. [2] X Research source Pick old clothes that are not important to you since they might get stretched or torn."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask questions to find out how well you know each other.",
      "content": "Ask questions to find out how well you know each other. Opt for fun or silly questions like “What did I say when we first met?” or “What movie always makes me fall asleep?” Keep a tally of how many each of you gets right. Whoever answers more questions correctly wins. [3] X Research source Some other questions could include: What’s my favorite food? How do you spell my middle name? What instrument did I play in high school? Who is my favorite actor? Make things spicier with more intimate questions like “What’s my favorite thing in bed?” or “What’s my favorite spot to be kissed?” The more specific your questions, the harder the game will be."

    {
      "title": "Blindfold your partner and have them guess the foods you’re feeding them.",
      "content": "Blindfold your partner and have them guess the foods you’re feeding them. Pick a variety of foods like snacks, juices, desserts, bread, and so on. Include 1-2 things they haven’t tried, like a weird candy or ice cream flavor. Give them 3-4 guesses before revealing what it is! [4] X Research source If your partner is open to it, include 1-2 foods they don’t like. Don’t include anything that isn’t food since it might be unsafe. Avoid this challenge if your partner has a food allergy."

    {
      "title": "Lie face-down on the floor and get up without using your hands.",
      "content": "Lie face-down on the floor and get up without using your hands. Lie with the tops of your heads nearly touching and your feet pointed away from each other. Put your hands behind your backs and try to stand up using only your shoulders, legs, and core muscles. Whoever stands up first without using their hands is the winner. [5] X Research source Press the tops of your heads together and tuck your knees in as you get up. This gives both of you a hands-free boost. Try not to bump your heads."

    {
      "title": "Find out who has the best push-up game.",
      "content": "Find out who has the best push-up game. Have one partner lie face-down on the ground, while the other does a “plank” on their partner’s back, facing the opposite direction, with their feet on their partner’s upper back and their hands on their partner’s ankles. The partner on the ground has to do a pushup while the one on top holds on. [6] X Research source If one of you is much stronger, have the stronger partner on the bottom. If you’re both super strong, try it with either person on the bottom first. Then switch roles and try again."

    {
      "title": "Make up a sentence and say it to your partner using only gestures.",
      "content": "Make up a sentence and say it to your partner using only gestures. Have your partner guess your sentence. You can use mime routines , facial expressions, hand puppets, or mouthing the words slowly—but you can’t make a sound. Nod your head if your partner is on the right track, or shake your head and laugh if they’re off-course. Give your sentences themes to make the game a little easier. For instance, you make a sentence about an animal, a specific person, or a place you’ve visited together. Tell your partner the theme out loud before you start miming."

      "title": "Give each other silly tasks, then count down until the floor is off-limits.",
      "content": "Give each other silly tasks, then count down until the floor is off-limits. Give each other 5 seconds to grab objects from another room, do three cartwheels, or attempt other silly tasks. After 5 seconds goes by, the floor is “lava” and you have to jump on a chair, couch, or bed. If you finish the task and get off the floor in time, you win! [7] X Research source Be careful running around confined spaces or jumping on fragile furniture. You don’t want someone tripping over a flowerpot… or jumping into one."

      "title": "Have your partner do your makeup, or do theirs for them.",
      "content": "Have your partner do your makeup , or do theirs for them. Choose a room without a mirror, then have one person do the other’s makeup.

[8] X Research source Once you’re finished, you can swap roles to see who does the others’ makeup better. Film each other’s reactions for extra memories (or laughs)."

      "content": "Take each other shopping and choose clothes for each other. Then come back home and have each other try on what you bought. Choose funny, cute, sexy, or bizarre outfits for extra laughs and great memories. Bonus points if you choose something your partner loves—or if you make them fall over with laughter. If you’re feeling brave, make a video and post it on social media so your friends can laugh too."

      "title": "Write truths and dares",
      "content": "Write truths and dares on Jenga blocks, then play a game together. Read each truth or dare on the blocks you pull, then answer or do whatever is written. Make it spicy with a few sexy truths and dares, or make it silly with dares like “Tell me a story with a sock puppet.” [9] X Research source As a bonus, make a rule that whoever makes the tower fall has to pick three random truths or dares from the pile of blocks. You can purchase a truth-or-dare version of Jenga , or make your own by writing on the blocks. Making your own version lets you customize your truths and dares."

      "content": "Do a yoga routine together every day. Find a beginner routine on YouTube if you’re new to yoga, or something more advanced if you have experience. If possible, join a yoga studio and attend classes together 1-2 times a week. Compliment and encourage each other as you learn new poses, and give each other a hand whenever one of you needs help with a pose. [10] X Research source Don’t worry if certain poses come more naturally to one person. Each person’s body is different. You can each do different poses, especially if one of you finds certain poses too difficult or uncomfortable. Most yoga routines are designed for one person, or groups of people working individually. But you can also try partner yoga, which includes poses that require two people. [11] X Research source"

Start with walking, then incorporate 10-30 second bursts of light jogging. Slowly increase your jogging time over 8 weeks until you can jog or run together for 30-45 minutes continuously. [12] X Research source Try a 5k training program like Couch to 5k , and use fitness apps and smartwatches to track your progress. Once you’re both jogging comfortably, sign up for a local 5k race, or use an app to do a virtual 5k. Virtual 5ks are a great option for long-distance couples, since you can run at the same time in different locations."

Pick new restaurants you haven’t tried together, shows or movies you haven’t seen, or even an activity you can do as a couple. The planner should tell their partner the time, location, and how to prepare, such as by saying “Bring a bathing suit” or “Wear shoes you can dance in.” Alternate roles so that each of you can plan dates for each other. For instance, one partner can a plan date for one weekend, then the other can plan something for the following weekend.

Set time aside during the trip to relax and recharge, especially if it’s an “active” vacation. For example, if you’re going surfing, you’ll want downtime to rest and eat. Getaways are great for long-distance relationships too. You may have to provide your partner with more details in advance (such as the destination, if you’re meeting them there), but you can surprise them with fun activities once you arrive."
