      "content": "Move closer to the wall using your hands. Once your legs are straight and your toes are up against the wall, it's time for your hands to do the walking. Start by moving your right hand back slightly. Bring your left hand back to line up with the right. Repeat this until your stomach is very close to or flat against the wall. You have just done an easy handstand."

      "content": "Return to position safely. In gymnastics, when a coach or guide tells you to \"return to position,\" you should go back to the stance you started at. In this case, return to the crouch from Step 1. To get back down, walk forward with your hands and let your legs slowly slide down the wall."

      "content": "Stand up straight. Make sure your feet are together with your toes pointed forward. Raise your arms straight up into the air above your head. The straight jump is a fairly basic jump that is safe to do at home. It will help you to strengthen your legs, improve your cardiovascular endurance, and learn to keep your balance. While you are unlikely to hurt yourself doing this jump, you could still potentially twist your ankle or fall."

Make sure your arms are as far back as they can go while you reach the lowest part of your squat. Don't go so far down as to lose your balance, but spread your arms to the side if you need to."

To do this, land with your legs apart and knees slightly bent. Hold your arms out for balance. In a perfectly stuck landing, your feet should not move at all. [2] X Research source"

Stop immediately if you feel any sort of pain. Forcing a stretch can cause injury. Feel free to ask a trusted friend or relative for help, too. While you're in the split position, ask them to very gently and lightly press down on your shoulders with their index fingers.

As you build up strength and flexibility, you will be able to stretch your legs further apart and get closer to the ground. This may take you a while, so try your best to be patient."

Make sure you are comfortable in the clothes. If you are a girl, the best thing you can wear for gymnastics is a leotard. Singlets are another specialty sports garment and can be worn by gymnasts of any gender. Like the leotard, you may also choose to wear athletic shorts over top of your singlet. You can also wear a T-shirt or tank top with athletic shorts instead. Make sure that your clothes are free of buttons, zippers, or snaps. Do not wear socks. Exercising barefoot will prevent slips and falls. If your hair is long, tie it back securely. Only wear glasses if they are especially made for sports and won't slip. If not, leave them in a safe place where they won't get damaged."

Do not practice on bare hardwood, tile, or laminate flooring. You can also ask an adult to buy a home athletic mat. Ask an adult to move all furniture against the wall. Make sure that the furniture is free of sharp corners. If necessary, cover sharp edges with a pillow or thick comforter."

Warming up will boost your performance and prevent muscle soreness. Start by stretching your whole body. Tilt your head slowly from side to side, and gently roll your head backwards. Stretch your arms by holding each across your chest for a few seconds and then raising it back over and behind your head. Do a few lunges to stretch your legs and lower back. Lift each leg slightly off the ground and roll each ankle. Flex each of your toes. Roll your wrists and flex your fingers. After stretching, get your heart rate up with a quick aerobic exercise. This can be any kind of simple high-intensity workout you can do on your own in a small space. Examples of these include jumping rope, running in place, or doing jumping jacks. Do this for a few minutes until you can feel your heart beating quickly but not for so long that you start to feel winded."
