    {
      "title": "Contact your city’s waste department to find their regulations.",
      "content": "Contact your city’s waste department to find their regulations. Nearly every city will collect branches, twigs, tree trunks, old lumber, and broken-down wood items. Some cities will pick them up with the normal trash, while others will require a special pickup appointment. Call or email the city’s waste department and ask what kind of wood they’ll take to learn more. [1] X Research source If you have a long piece of wood that would be too long for regular disposal, cut or chop it down to size."

      "title": "Tie the wood into bundles with twine or rope if necessary.",
      "content": "Tie the wood into bundles with twine or rope if necessary. Many cities ask residents to tie bundles of loose wood up to make disposal easier for the waste workers. Stack the wood in small piles to knot together with rope or twine. Make sure each bundle is easy to pick up and move. If the piles are too large per your city’s regulations, the disposal service may refuse to take them. [2] X Research source Avoid tying the wood up with other material, such as tape or nylon twine. They have to be sorted out of the woodpiles, so most collection services don’t want them."

    {
      "title": "Place the wood out with your regular garbage service for collection.",
      "content": "Place the wood out with your regular garbage service for collection. Wait until the night before the pickup date to move the bundles out with your trash. Put the wood next to any garbage bins or bags. Your normal waste crew will pick the wood up. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Schedule a pickup for large bundles if garbage crews won’t take them.",
      "content": "Schedule a pickup for large bundles if garbage crews won’t take them. In some cities, you can only get wood and yard waste removed if you schedule a special pickup with the city’s waste department or you hire a private waste management company to come scoop it up. Call the city’s department and ask what kind of options they have for getting rid of big branches and other yard waste. [4] X Research source If your city doesn’t offer scheduled pickup, you’ll have to call a private waste company."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drop the wood off at a recycling or waste center yourself.",
      "content": "Drop the wood off at a recycling or waste center yourself. Look online to find a wood waste recycling dropoff site near you. Toss the wood in your vehicle and drive it over there yourself during the hours of operation to have it recycled. [5] X Research source Most cities will have a free dropoff site for yard waste and natural materials like that."

    {
      "title": "Mulch wood",
      "content": "Mulch wood to reuse it as a fertilizer in your garden or lawn. Rent a wood chipper. Feed the branches slowly and carefully into the chipper to shred. Then, scatter the wood chips around growing plants to help keep the soil moist and weed-free. If you have lots of large branches to get rid of, mulching can be worth the cost. [6] X Research source Check with local hardware and power equipment rental stores. They’ll typically charge $200 to $400 per rental for a wood chipper."

    {
      "title": "Burn wood",
      "content": "Burn wood in a fireplace to get rid of it. If you have a fireplace, chop the wood into sizable pieces with an axe or a maul. Burn the wood in your fireplace over time until you’ve gotten rid of everything. [7] X Research source Scrap wood can be used as bonfire material! If you have an outdoor firepit, you can burn the wood outside so long as it’s legal where you live. Do not burn treated or painted lumber. Burning that stuff releases toxic chemicals into the air. If you’re unable to dispose of the wood yourself, ask if your neighbors want it. Some people will even pay for scrap wood."

      "title": "Convert the logs to lumber.",
      "content": "Convert the logs to lumber. If the logs are large and straight enough and free of screws/nails, they can be milled into boards, which can be used in construction. Sawyers can be found on online marketplaces such as Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or Kijiji. Depending on the sawyer and the number of logs you have to process, they may bring a portable sawmill to your house, or you can bring the logs to them. Alternatively, some sawyers will buy the logs from you if you don't have any use for the lumber."

      "title": "Sort the untreated lumber from pressure-treated and painted wood.",
      "content": "Sort the untreated lumber from pressure-treated and painted wood. Treated wood often has a green color that fades to gray as it ages, or it will have an identifying ink stamp like \"L PP2.\" Painted wood is easier to spot, and it can't be recycled unless you can scrape the paint off. The chemicals from these types of wood cannot be removed and are harmful to the environment, so they are disposed of separately. [8] X Research source You can throw out construction lumber the same way you’d throw out yard waste if you want, but you might as well reuse it or find it a new home. Products like particleboard and plywood are usually treated. If you hired a contractor to do construction work, they are responsible for sorting and removing wood waste. You only have to do it if you did the work on your own."

      "content": "Reuse scrap wood to repurpose it and save money. There are many projects you can create out of old building materials, from planter boxes to a brand new deck. If you don’t have a use for your old scrap wood, give it to someone else or take it to a recycling or salvage center in your city. [9] X Research source Scrap wood and crates can be repurposed to create end tables, shelves, and bookshelves. Salvaged-wood dealers charge a lower fee than other disposal services, so look into giving them untreated lumber. [10] X Research source"

If you’ve got a good variety and quantity of unused construction lumber and you’re not in a rush to get rid of it, sell it online! Take photos and post your ad on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. Wait for buyers to reach out and negotiate on price before arranging the pickup. [11] X Research source How you price your lumber depends on the quality and quantity, but if it’s truly pristine and construction-ready, consider selling it for 5-10% less than what you bought it for."

      "content": "Pull nails out of the wood if you’re trashing it. Use a claw hammer or nails if you’re going to trash or recycle construction lumber. The nails can destroy recycling equipment and chippers, so remove them in advance. Contact your city to see if they’ll pick it up or drop the wood off at a local recycling plant. [14] X Research source Remove what you’re able to. If you’re unable to get a nail stuck deep inside of the wood, let the disposal service know. As long as the nail isn’t sticking out in a dangerous way, you can usually get rid of the wood."

Most junk removal services tend to start at $75. Another option is to take your items directly to a disposal facility. Call the facility to ask about their policies first.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity, Goodwill, and the Salvation Army will take your used furniture. Most types of wood furniture and household goods are made with treated wood or have been painted. Since they cannot be recycled, the best way to dispose of them is to reuse them. For example, wooden toys and quality furniture like desks are usually made with treated wood or have paint on them. Find someone to take them off your hands."

      "content": "Recycle wood items if you don’t wish to reuse them. Separate the wood from any other components, such as upholstery. That way, you can recycle each part separately. Search online for wood recycling centers in your area or contact a waste management department for more information. You could also incorporate untreated wood into your new craft project . [19] X Research source Keep in mind that treated and painted wood won’t be accepted by a recycling facility. You may be able to repurpose these pieces at home. Patio furniture is an example of recyclable wood. Patio furniture is usually made with untreated hardwood that resists water, so it is safe to take apart and reuse. Wood debris like lumber, pallets, and wood trim from construction sites and demolition can also be recycled."
