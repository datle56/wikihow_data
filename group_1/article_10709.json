You can zoom in and out on the map with the plus and minus buttons in the bottom left or drag the map around by clicking and moving your mouse. With these features, it is much easier to set your route with pinpoint accuracy. You also have the ability to change your route color, a feature that becomes very useful when you create multi-route maps. For now, just pick the color you like the most by clicking one of the colorful bubbles."

[2] X Research source Turning off “Smart Routing” activates “Drawing Mode”, in which AllTrails will connect points you make with a straight line rather than staying on nearby paths or roads. You can also hold the “Shift” key in “Drawing Mode” to enable free-draw, a feature that lets you create a route by following your cursor as you click and drag it along the map. [3] X Research source"

The “Double-back” feature alters your route so you follow it to one end, then turn around and follow it back to your starting point. “Close loop” will make your route a loop provided it is already somewhat circular (otherwise, it will create a double-back). “Reverse” will change the direction of your route, so if you accidentally mapped it the wrong way, simply click “Reverse” to switch the start and end points."
