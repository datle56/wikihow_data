[2] X Research source You can find rosehip oil at a health supply store or pharmacy, or buy it online. Don’t apply rosehip oil or any other essential oil directly to your skin, or it could cause irritation. Dilute it in a carrier oil or moisturizer first.

Some research indicates that it may help, while other studies suggest that it could cause irritation and do more harm than good. [7] X Research source Talk to your doctor about how to use vitamin E ointment properly, and follow the instructions on the packaging carefully. Start by applying a very thin layer of vitamin E ointment to your scar, and increase the amount you use gradually if you don’t have any adverse reactions. Only use as much as recommended on the product label or by your doctor. Stop using the ointment if you experience side effects such as skin irritation, itching, burning, blistering, redness, or a rash. If you decide to try vitamin E oil or ointment, do a patch test first. Put a small amount of the ointment on a discreet area, such as the back of your knee or behind your ear, and wait 24-48 hours to see if you have a reaction.
