      "content": "Understand the concept. Encountering a Shiny Pokémon in the wild is a 1/8192 chance. Although this chance is 1/4096 in the newer games, that's still really, really low. Chaining is the practice of encountering the same Pokémon repeatedly to increase the chances that a Shiny version will appear. Breaking the chain at any time will reset your chances, making it a slightly tedious experience. You cannot chain in Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, White 2, HeartGold, or SoulSilver as there is no PokéRadar available. You can chain for Shinies in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon"

      "content": "Get yourself the PokéRadar. The PokéRadar becomes available after you have defeated the Elite Four. This tool will show you spots in the grass where you can encounter wild Pokémon, and is essential to creating a chain. Register the PokéRadar to one of your buttons (if applicable), and unregister any other items (bike, fishing rod, etc.). Using any other item while chaining, even by accident, will reset your chain."

You should ALWAYS be under the effects of a Super Repel while chaining. It is recommended that you have at least 200 for extended chaining sessions. Make sure you have a good supply of Pokéballs to catch the Shiny Pokémon. [1] X Research source"

Assemble a team of well-rounded Pokémon with lots of PP so that regardless of the type of shiny Pokémon you encounter, you will always have someone in your team to beat it. You can use the PP remaining to count your chain as well. It will really help to have a Pokémon that knows False Swipe, so you can lower the HP of the Shiny Pokémon to 1 without knocking it out. Having a Pokémon with Sleep or Paralyze will also make more difficult Pokémon easier to capture."

This will give you enough room to walk around without breaking your chain, since leaving the patch at any time will break your chain. Some guides recommend finding patches that are 9x9."

      "content": "Look for the next patch that is shaking the same way as the first one. After KOing the first Pokémon, move onto the next shaking patch to continue the chain. There are several very important aspects to keep in mind: The next patch must be at least 4 tiles away from you (the numbers vary from guide to guide, but this number is a safe number that will keep your chain active). The next patch must be shaking the same way that the previous patch was. If the patch you pick is at the edge of the grass area, you will need to reset your PokéRadar after the fight. Do this by walking 50 steps without fighting and then using it again. Be sure to not leave the grassy area!"

You can either make a tally on a piece of paper or use a Pokémon with a high PP attack to act as a counter. Increase your chain until you get to 40. If your chain breaks for any reason, you'll have to start over. Saving your game or quitting will break your chain. Using the Roller Skates will break your chain. Leaving the field will break your chain. Fleeing a battle will break your chain. Encountering any other Pokémon will break your chain."

Reset your PokéRadar every 50 steps to cycle through patches as quickly as possible.

For example, if you live in the US, obtain a Pokémon from Japan or Europe. Make sure to obtain the Pokémon that you want to get a Shiny version of. This breeding method, also known as the Masuda method, is only available in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Black, White, Black 2, White 2, X, and Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon The easiest way to get a Pokémon from another region is to trade with someone. There are several popular trading sites online that can make this a fairly simple process, such as PokéBay and Reddit's Pokémon Trading subreddit. The two Pokémon must be able to breed normally with each other. This means they must be the same species or share an Egg Group, and are opposite genders. If the Pokémon you want to breed is genderless, then you will need to breed it with a Ditto. You can tell what region the Pokémon is from by looking at its PokéDex entry. In the upper-right corner, there will be a three-letter abbreviation for the region the Pokémon is from (JPN, FRE, ITA, etc.). If there is nothing there, then the Pokémon is from your own region."
