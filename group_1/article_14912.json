      "title": "Invest in a phin, or Vietnamese coffee filter press.",
      "content": "Invest in a phin, or Vietnamese coffee filter press. A phin has a base with a perforated filter and a brewing chamber that holds enough water for one cup of coffee. You will need a little bit of patience to learn to use it, but once you have the hang of it, it won't take any longer than brewing a pot of coffee. [1] X Research source You can buy a phin online or in Vietnamese stores."

      "title": "Use a French roast, medium coarse ground coffee.",
      "content": "Use a French roast, medium coarse ground coffee. Don't grind your coffee beans finer than a medium texture. If the grounds are too fine, they will fall through the holes of the coffee press. [2] X Research source You can use any roast you enjoy, but to get a bitter, typically Vietnamese flavor, try 100% Robusta beans or Caf√© du Monde chicory coffee. You can also use a coarse ground coffee."

      "title": "Pour sweetened, condensed milk into the bottom of your cup.",
      "content": "Pour sweetened, condensed milk into the bottom of your cup. Whether you are making your coffee hot or iced, start with condensed milk at the bottom of your cup. To start with, use 2 tablespoons (30 mL), and add more if you want your coffee a little sweeter. [3] X Research source If you plan to drink your coffee hot, use a mug. If you plan to drink your coffee iced, use a mug or a heatproof glass. You will transfer iced coffee to another glass for serving. Sweetened, condensed milk is the key ingredient in Vietnamese coffee and there is no real substitution."

    {
      "title": "Place the filter over the top of your cup.",
      "content": "Place the filter over the top of your cup. Vietnamese coffee drips directly from the filter into the cup. Choose a cup that fits well under the base of the filter. You may need to choose a wide cup for brewing, and then transfer the coffee to a narrower cup for serving, if you prefer. [4] X Research source Make sure to choose a cup that is big enough to fit all of the water from the brewing chamber of the filter."

    {
      "title": "Add 2 tbsp (30 g) of damp coffee grounds into the press.",
      "content": "Add 2 tbsp (30 g) of damp coffee grounds into the press. Pack the base of the press tightly with coffee grounds. Then, add just enough water so that the grounds are damp. [5] X Research source Wetting the grounds causes them to \"bloom\" and gets them ready to brew."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the press with hot water and wait for the coffee to brew.",
      "content": "Fill the press with hot water and wait for the coffee to brew. Pour in enough boiling hot water to fill the press. The coffee should take around 3-5 minutes to brew. [6] X Research source The tighter the press is screwed on, the longer the coffee will take to brew and the stronger it will be. If the coffee is taking too long to brew, loosen the press slightly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the phin and stir your coffee.",
      "content": "Remove the phin and stir your coffee. Once the phin is finished dripping, or the cup is filled enough for you, simply take it off of the cup. Stir the coffee so that the condensed milk is evenly distributed. [7] X Research source Some people like to sip on hot Vietnamese coffee directly from the cup it was brewed it, without stirring. If you choose not to stir, you will end up with very sweet, lightly coffee-flavored condensed milk at the bottom of your cup, like a sweet dessert!"

    {
      "title": "Drink your coffee hot or pour it over ice.",
      "content": "Drink your coffee hot or pour it over ice. Drink your coffee as soon as it is done brewing for a strong, hot pick-me-up. Or, pour it into a fresh glass filled with as much ice as you can fit for a cool, refreshing drink. [8] X Research source Vietnamese iced coffee is typically served in a tall, thin glass with a straw."

    {
      "title": "Add condensed milk to the bottom of a heatproof glass.",
      "content": "Add condensed milk to the bottom of a heatproof glass. Use around 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of sweetened, condensed milk for each serving of coffee. You can use more or less, depending on how sweet you like your coffee. [9] X Research source Coffee with condensed milk is the most traditional way to drink Vietnamese coffee."

      "title": "Place coffee grounds with boiling water in a heatproof container for 4 minutes.",
      "content": "Place coffee grounds with boiling water in a heatproof container for 4 minutes. Add around 2 tbsp (30 g) of coffee grounds to a heatproof container, then fill it up with water. Stir the grounds occasionally to evenly distribute the flavor. [10] X Research source A mason jar or pyrex glass are good options for brewing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow the grounds to steep for around 4 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the grounds to steep for around 4 minutes. Try less time for weaker coffee, or more time for stronger coffee. You may need to try a few different brewing times to find the one you like best. [11] X Research source To keep the water warm, try wrapping your glass in a towel to insulate it."

    {
      "title": "Pour the coffee through a filter into your glass.",
      "content": "Pour the coffee through a filter into your glass. Strain out the coffee grounds by pouring the coffee through a filter. Mix the coffee with the condensed milk and drink it right away if you prefer your coffee hot. To drink it cold, add ice. [12] X Research source Use a rubber band to hold the filter in place."

      "content": "Try yogurt coffee for a little bit caffeine with your breakfast. Add a drizzle of strong, Vietnamese-brewed coffee to your morning yogurt for a caffeinated breakfast. Stir the coffee into the yogurt and drink it. [13] X Research source Yogurt coffee is often topped with fresh fruit, like mango."

      "title": "Go for egg coffee for a sweet, rich dessert.",
      "content": "Go for egg coffee for a sweet, rich dessert. Vietnamese egg coffee is a tiramisu-like dessert. Whisk one egg yolk with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of sweetened, condensed milk until it becomes thick and frothy. Pour your coffee into a cup and top it with the egg mixture. Use a clear, glass cup to watch the egg mixture slowly dissolve into the hot coffee."

      "title": "Make a coffee smoothie for a modern caffeinated concoction.",
      "content": "Make a coffee smoothie for a modern caffeinated concoction. Coffee smoothies are becoming popular in Vietnam, since the sweetness of fruit balances out the bitterness of coffee. Try a mixture of banana, avocado, and coffee for a healthy, slightly sweet mixture, or sapodilla and coffee for a tropical, custardy taste. [14] X Research source Coffee smoothies are available in lots of Vietnamese cafes, if you don't want to make your own."
