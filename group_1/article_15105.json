      "content": "Cut the flower head off the stem. Take your garden scissors or pruning shears and cut the flower head at a 45-degree angle. You won’t need the stem anymore, so you can throw it into your compost pile or on the ground outside. [1] X Research source If you’re already dead-heading your tulips, you can just save the flower heads to press them instead of throwing them away."

      "title": "Spread the flower head flat on its side on a piece of paper.",
      "content": "Spread the flower head flat on its side on a piece of paper. Pick a plain piece of paper without any words or pictures on it. Set your flower head onto the piece of paper and try to push it as flat as possible before you start. [2] X Research source However the flower is situated is how it will dry. If there are any wrinkles or creases in the petals, they’ll be preserved unless you flatten them out. Paper with ink on it can transfer color to your flower head, so it’s best to go with plain paper."

      "title": "Press a second piece of paper on top of the flower head.",
      "content": "Press a second piece of paper on top of the flower head. Grab another plain sheet of paper and put it on top of the flower head. Press down on it lightly to keep the flower in place as you position your final piece. [3] X Research source Make sure you put your setup somewhere where the flower heads won’t be disturbed."

      "content": "Weigh the paper down with a book for 1 to 2 weeks. Get a heavy book (a textbook or a dictionary would be perfect) and set it on top of the piece of paper. Leave it there for a few weeks, then take your flower head out when the petals are dry to the touch.

      "content": "Place the tulip head in a microwave-safe dish. Grab a bowl or a flat dish with a shallow bottom. You’ll be filling up the dish with silica gel, so pick something with walls on the side. [5] X Research source If you aren’t sure your dish is microwave-safe, turn it over to look at the details. Usually, it will say “microwave and dishwasher safe” on the bottom."

      "content": "Cover the tulip with silica sand. Place your flower head into the dish and then pour a large amount of silica sand into your bowl. Make sure it covers up the entire tulip head, and try to pour a little bit into the center of the tulip, too. [6] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source You can find silica gel at most craft stores. It’s a drying agent, and it usually comes in small packets on the inside of shoeboxes or medication. Putting the gel into the center of the flower will help it hold its classic tulip shape."

      "title": "Microwave the tulip on high for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Microwave the tulip on high for 1 minute. The silica gel is drying on its own, but you can speed up the process by using the microwave. You don’t have to microwave the flower for very long, so just put it in for about a minute.

You can pick one tulip at a time or grab a bundle, if you’d like. [9] X Research source Try to pick tulips that are just opening up to bloom. That way, they’ll keep their color and scent for longer.
