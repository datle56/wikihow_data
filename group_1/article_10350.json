These numbers are all formed in the same way: by combining diez (“10”) + y (“and”) + the Spanish word for the second digit in the number (i.e., 6, 7, 8, or 9).

      "content": "Spanish Numbers 30-100 Once you’ve made your way up to 30 in Spanish, it’s easy to count the rest of the way to 100! In order to do that, you have to start by memorizing the base numbers to count in 10s (e.g., 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90). After learning each of these “tens” numbers, you can say any other number between 30-99 by saying the base number, then y (“and”), and the Spanish word for the second digit of the number. 31 in Spanish, for example, is treinta y uno —literally “thirty and one.” [5] X Research source For thirty (30), say treinta ( TRAYN-tah ). For forty (40), say cuarenta ( kwah-RAYN-tah ). For fifty (50), say cincuenta ( seen-koo-AYN-tah ). For sixty (60), say sesenta ( say-SAYN-tah ). For seventy (70), say setenta ( say-TAYN-tah ).

      "content": "Review the Spanish alphabet and basic accentuation rules. Spanish is a phonetic language, meaning the pronunciation is fairly simple as long as you know how each letter of the alphabet is pronounced. Take some time to review the Spanish alphabet and how each letter is pronounced in a word. Make sure to also pay attention to accented letters—if you see an accent mark over a letter, it tells you that you are supposed to stress or emphasize that syllable when you pronounce the word. Some Spanish words are spelled the same way, but mean entirely different things depending on which syllable is stressed. [6] X Research source The essential accentuation rule in Spanish is that if the word ends in a vowel, an n , or an s , you'll put stress on the last syllable. However, if the word has an accent mark, you stress that syllable and ignore the general rule. For example, in your numbers, you may have noticed an accent in the word for sixteen (16), dieciséis . This means that you should stress the syllable with an accent, which is the last syllable."

      "content": "Consume Spanish-language TV, films, and music. Listening to people speak and sing Spanish can help you understand more about how the words fit together and how they're said in the context of normal conversation or dialogue. In TV shows and movies, actors often speak slowly and with a lot of purpose, which may make it easier for you to learn the language. Music can also be an easy route to learning Spanish pronunciation due to the rhythm and repetitiveness of the lyrics. [7] X Research source You may not understand exactly what something means, but the important part when you're just beginning to learn Spanish is to listen to the way the words are pronounced and how the language sounds. Keep in mind that Spanish is spoken in many countries all over the world, giving rise to multiple dialects and variations. Even for a native speaker, someone from another country can be difficult to understand"

Whether you’re looking to order tacos, empanadas, churros, or a steaming cup of coffee, being able to provide the number of items that you want is a pretty good skill to have. Here are some examples of how to use numbers to order food in Spanish : I’ll have six ham croquettes. = Me das seis croquetas de jamón. Three coffees with milk, please. = Tres cafés con leche, por favor. I’d like two cookies and one glass of milk. = Me gustaría dos galletas y un vaso de leche."

While the numbers 1-10 may help you here if you’re still within that age group, you’ll need some more advanced numbers if you’re a bit older! To tell your own age in Spanish, say “Yo tengo ___ años” with your age in the blank. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re 8 years old, you’d say “Yo tengo ocho años. If you’re 60 years old, you’d say “Yo tengo sesenta años. The full phrase is pronounced “yo TAYN-goh ___ AHN-yos.” Be sure to pronounce the tilde mark on the “n” in años , otherwise you’ll be saying a whole different word! If you want to tell someone else’s age, you can say “Él/ella tiene ___ años” (“He/she is ___ years old”), pronounced “ehl/EY-yah tee-AYN-ey ___ AHN-yos.”"

To tell someone what day it is, use this phrase: “Hoy es el (number) de (month) ” . Hoy (pronounced “oy”) means “today,” so this entire phrase means “Today is the ___ of ____.” [9] X Research source For example, if the date is February second, you’d say “Hoy es el dos de febrero ” .

      "title": "Un, uno, and una are alternately used based on gender and grammar.",
      "content": "Un, uno, and una are alternately used based on gender and grammar. Spanish is a grammatically gendered language, meaning that all nouns (i.e., persons, places, and things) have a gender. So, all of the articles we use to describe them (like “a,” “an,” and “the”) must change to match their gender. [10] X Research source When we talk about having one thing in Spanish, we use un or una , which can both mean either “a/an” or “one.” Un is used in front of masculine nouns, while una is feminine—here are some examples: Do you have a banana? = ¿Tienes un plátano? Yes, I have a banana. = Sí, tengo un plátano I have one banana. = Tengo un plátano. Do you have a pineapple? = ¿Tienes una piña? Yes, I have a pineapple. = Sí, tengo una piña. I have one pineapple. = Tengo una piña. So when do you use uno ? Uno means “one” in Spanish, and it’s also masculine. It can be used to count objects, like you would when saying you have one thing. However, it can’t be placed directly in front of a noun—you’d use un in these cases. Here are some examples: Do you have a banana? = ¿Tienes un plátano? Yes, I have one. = Sí, tengo uno . Do you have a pineapple? = ¿Tienes una piña? Yes, I have one. = Sí, tengo una ."

Cardinal numbers are probably what first come to your mind when you think of numbers: e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. These numbers are used for describing an amount of items, telling the time, sharing your age, and more! Ordinal numbers, on the other hand, typically only go up to 10 and are used to discuss sequential items such as rankings in a contest, the floors of a building, or the order of objects in a list. [11] X Research source In English, ordinal numbers include “first,” “second,” “third,” “fourth,” etc.” Here are some examples of cardinal numbers in context: There are two butterflies. = Hay dos mariposas. I’m 10 years old. = Tengo diez años. It’s 5 o’clock. = Son las cinco . Here are some examples of ordinal numbers in context: He placed first. = El quedó primero . It’s on the third floor. = Está en el tercero piso. It’s the tenth restaurant on the list. = Es el décimo restaurante de la lista."
