      "title": "Find or purchase stones.",
      "content": "Find or purchase stones. Stones used in this treatment are typically made of basalt, due to their ability to retain heat. The stones should also be very smooth, so they do not irritate the skin in any way. If you can't find basalt stones, however, smooth river rocks are fine.You can order a hot stone massage kit online from Amazon or eBay. Do not want buy your stones from a rock quarry unless you are able to choose each stone individually. You should have anywhere between 20-30 stones, though some professional massages may have upwards of 45-60. There should be at least two large ovals around 8” long to 6” wide, seven stones you can fit in the palm of your hand, and 8 small stones between the size of an egg or a quarter."

      "title": "Set up your area.",
      "content": "Set up your area. If you do not have a massage table, a bed or the floor will be fine. Once you've chosen where the massage should take place, you should lay out a clean sheet or a thick towel for the person you are massaging to lay down on. This will not only help them be more comfortable but also help absorb any excess oil from the massage. To really create a relaxing environment, try lighting some aromatherapy candles. Soothing scents like lavender, lemongrass, eucalyptus, and vanilla will help immerse your participant in the massage experience. You can also try playing some quiet classical music, or rain sounds to add to the mood."

      "title": "Heat up your stones.",
      "content": "Heat up your stones. Ideally, you should prepare your stones 30-60 minutes before you begin your massage. The water should be no more than 130 °F (54 °C). The stones will cool down as you use them. Anything below 110 °F (43 °C) is considered a warm stone massage, although it is important to know that a 104 °F (40 °C) stone can still burn someone if it is left laying on bare skin for a few minutes. To heat the stones, use a Crock-Pot that can hold at least 6 quarts of water or a large tabletop skillet that has sides close to 3 inches (7.6 cm). Note that Crock-Pots and similar kitchen equipment heat on a cycled basis, which means that the temperature can vary and must be monitored closely. It is better i f you can find something with an actual temperature setting, instead of low-medium-high Use a meat thermometer to monitor the temperature in your Crock-pot. (Never use a glass thermometer as breakage can occur.) You should also keep the Crock-pot setting to warm or low, as you don't want the water to boil. [1] X Research source You should also rub some massage oil on each stone before it's used."

      "content": "Place four small sized stones on the participant's face. Once the participant has settled, take four of the smaller stones, without oil, and place them on the acupressure areas on their face. There should be one stone on their forehead, one under their lips, and one on each of their cheeks. You should avoid putting oil on these stones as it may clog their pores or irritate their skin. A great alternative is to chill the stones for the face instead of heating them as this will help reduce any puffiness."

Depending on the height and width of the participant, the size of the stones you use may vary. However, you should try to place one stone or more on either side of their collarbone, two large ones along the breastbone, and two palm-sized stones in their hands. They do not need to clasp these, but should instead remain fully relaxed and gently cupping the stones."

Rub some oil onto the skin and the stones. Follow the cords of muscles to work out any knots, changing stones as needed as they cool.

      "content": "Use the stones to massage rather than your hands. Do this by moving the stones gently over tense, sore areas. The pressure applied by the stones may be quite strong, but since the participant’s muscles have been sufficiently relaxed by the heating process, the procedure should virtually be painless."
