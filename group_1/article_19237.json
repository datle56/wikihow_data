      "content": "Apply for brand ambassador programs. Many fashion, beauty, beverage, and lifestyle brands have brand ambassador programs you can apply to through their official websites. Ambassadors receive free products, usually in exchange for posting about them or reviewing them. [1] X Research source Besides PR packages, you can also potentially receive exclusive discounts and invitations to brand events if you become a brand ambassador. To find application forms, search for phrases like “apply + brand ambassador,” “apply + influencer partnerships,” and “[brand name] + ambassador + apply.” You can also look for “Contact” or “Work With Us” pages on the bottom of brands’ websites. Some brands with ambassador applications on their websites include Revolve, Windsor, and Sweetgreen. If you’re a current college student, look for campus ambassador programs. Companies like SHEIN, Princess Polly, Red Bull, and poppi have yearly applications exclusively for university students—and many have no minimum follower requirement. Ambassadors typically receive PR packages in exchange for promoting the brand to peers online and on campus. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Additionally, you can reach out to members of their influencer marketing team directly if they post that they’re open to pitches. Always be polite, professional, and patient when contacting brands. Don’t be discouraged to reach out because you have a small following. “Really what [brands are] looking for is somebody who has pull with their audience. So even if you're an account with 800 [followers], but your audience is really engaged, then they’ll be more willing to work with you,” says Gasper. You can also reach out via email to PR agencies that represent brands in your niche. They may be able to connect you directly with brands’ influencer marketing teams—or, add you to mailing lists to receive PR packages from their brands. [4] X Research source"

If you’re looking to get free products and don’t mind providing an honest review or creating content, this is an easy way to get PR packages. Popular platforms include Influenster, Aspire, and Shopify Collabs. [5] X Research source Some platforms require reviews, while others connect influencers with brands to collaborate on paid, sponsored content. While brands on these platforms are usually vetted and legitimate, be wary of scams. You should never have to pay for PR packages, shipping, or brand collaborations—brands send products to build a working relationship with you and potentially reach your audience.

Make it easy for them to contact you by having your DMs open and putting your email address in your bio on all social media platforms. [8] X Research source Check your DMs and email regularly so you don’t miss potential opportunities. Research the accounts and brands that reach out to you to make sure their offers are legitimate. Create a separate email address for public social media profiles to avoid spam and harassment. Put this email address in your bios instead of your personal one. You can even put “PR/Collabs: [your email]” in your bio to make it clear who should contact you."

Make organic content featuring products you already own and enjoy—for example, a review or feature in a Get Ready With Me video—and tag the brand to try to get on their pr lists. [9] X Research source Use brand-relevant hashtags to increase the chance the brand will see your content and understand your unique style and audience.

[11] X Research source Post on a daily or weekly basis to show that you take content creation seriously. Use hashtags specific to your niche to help the right brands find your content. The more specific the hashtags, the better, says Ahmari. “Don't use hashtags that are like #beauty or #fashion, because there are millions of posts there. If you're not big, you're not gonna be discovered there,” he advises. Instead, he recommends replicating the hashtags used by successful profiles and creating your own."

[12] X Research source If you have less than 1,000 followers, it may be difficult to persuade brands to add you to their PR lists because your audience is so small. Having more followers can increase your account’s visibility to brands, especially if your followers are highly engaged via likes, comments, and shares. [13] X Research source Some sources claim brands value engagement more than follower count. [14] X Research source You can have millions of followers, but if your TikToks get a low amount of views and little to no comments or likes, brands may think your PR-related content would not reach or connect with your audience."

A brand’s general talent/influencer relations email is usually located on the “Contact Us” page of a brand’s website or on LinkedIn. [16] X Research source You can also Google “[brand name] + contact” or “[brand name] + influencer partnerships.” Don’t direct message or email the personal email accounts of influencer marketing team members—try to find email addresses that are clearly, publicly listed as a way for influencers to get in touch with them. Avoid email addresses that are for press or customer service only—your email will probably be ignored or go to spam."

Gasper suggests using Chat GPT to help you draft an email, or searching for a template of a PR email on Google. “You also usually want to include a media kit,” she notes. This is a document or slide deck featuring statistics about your accounts’ engagement, examples of past brand collaborations, and a brief bio introducing you and your content. [17] X Research source An example email might look like this: “Hello [brand or PR contact name], My name is [your name] and I’m a content creator who makes videos about [your niche]. I’m reaching out to inquire about PR and collaboration opportunities with [your brand]. [Sentence about what you like about the brand.] I’d love to be considered for your mailing list so I can showcase your products to my [follower count] followers and provide thoughtful reviews. Please let me know what opportunities are possible. Sincerely, [your name].” Attach a media kit or document with your account’s engagement breakdown if applicable.

Follow up after a month if you haven’t heard anything. In the meantime, focus on growing your following and increasing your engagement to be more appealing to brands. Once you start receiving PR packages, consider opening up a P.O. box to maintain privacy. [18] X Research source You don’t want your address to accidentally be leaked online. You can share the P.O. box address with brands in future emails."

Not only will a unique angle help you find your own audience, but it will make you more memorable to brands. [19] X Research source For example, maybe you’re a fashion influencer who creates Get Ready With Me videos. You can make your content unique by trying out different celebrity morning routines instead of just filming your usual getting-ready process."

If you’ve worked with a brand or PR agency before, they may add your address to a mailing list to send PR packages without notifying you first.
