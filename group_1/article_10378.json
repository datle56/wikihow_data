      "content": "Consider cassia obovata to get blonde to strawberry blonde hair. For a blonde shade , use cassia powder with water or citrus juice. For strawberry blonde, add henna. Use pure cassia powder for blonde, or 80% cassia powder and 20% henna powder for strawberry blonde. Use water to transform the powder into a paste, or if you want an extra lightening effect, orange or lemon juice. Add liquid to the powder a little at a time until its consistency is similar to yogurt. Put the mixture in the refrigerator and let it sit for twelve hours. Use cassia obovata for blonde or gray hair. If you have gray hairs but the rest of your hair is darker than blonde, cassia obovata alone will only brighten and condition your darker hair, not lighten it to blonde. Use one box (100 grams) of cassia powder for short hair. Use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of cassia powder for shoulder-length hair. Use four to five boxes (400-500 grams) of cassia powder for long hair."

      "title": "Prepare henna paste for red, brown or black hair.",
      "content": "Prepare henna paste for red, brown or black hair. Mix into henna powder three teaspoons of amla powder, one teaspoon of coffee powder, and a little bit of curd or plain yogurt. Stir the ingredients well. [3] X Research source Slowly add one to two cups of hot water (not boiling) to the henna paste in a bowl until the paste is thick, not runny. Mix the contents. Close the bowl with a lid or tight plastic wrap. Let it sit for twelve hours to twenty-four hours, unrefrigerated before using it on your hair. Amla (Indian gooseberry) is nondrying and adds coolness to the red so that it is not quite so bright. You can omit the amla if you want a very vibrant orange-red. Amla volumizes hair as well as enhances texture and curls. Use 100 grams of henna powder for hair up to medium length, or 200 grams of henna for long hair. Henna can be drying, so you may want to add a conditioner to the paste the next morning, such as two to three tablespoons of olive oil and 1/5 cup moisturizing conditioner."

      "content": "Add indigo powder to the paste for brown hair. Once henna paste has sat for twelve to twenty-four hours, mix in indigo powder well. If the paste is not the consistency of thick yogurt, add warm water little by little until you achieve the right texture. Let the paste sit for fifteen minutes. If you have short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo. If you have shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo. If you have long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo."

Section your hair and apply the paste to damp or dry hair with your gloved hands, a pastry brush, or a coloring brush from a beauty supply store. Make sure that you cover all of your hair to the roots. You may find it handy to clip sections of hair back once you've finished coating them. Henna paste is thick, so don't try to rake it through your hair. Apply the paste to the roots of your hair first, since that is typically where the most hue and processing time is needed.

For red hair, leave the paste on for about four hours. For brown or black hair, leave the paste in your hair for one to six hours. You can check the color by scraping off a little bit of the henna to see the result. When you've reached your desired color, you can rinse off the henna."

Put the paste on in sections, starting at the back of your head and moving forward. Coat the hair thoroughly to the roots. For short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo. For shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo. For long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo. Once your hair is saturated with the paste, use a clip or hair pin to put your hair up. Wrap plastic wrap or a shower cap over your head. Let the paste sit in your hair for one to two hours. After one to two hours of processing time, rinse the paste completely out. You can use conditioner if desired. Dry and style your hair as usual."

      "content": "Decide if natural colorants are right for you. Naturally coloring your hair can be a messy process and take longer to process than chemical dyes. However, if your hair is damaged or easily damaged, natural colorants will be easier on your tresses than conventional hair dyes. It's up to you personally whether the benefits outweigh any inconvenience. [11] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, herbal colorants may be the best choice for you, since chemical hair dyes can cause contact dermatitis. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Natural colorants such as cassia obovata, henna and indigo are mixed into a paste that needs to sit out overnight. They also take longer to develop (from an hour to six hours) once applied to your hair. Keep in mind that the results you get with natural dyes can vary. If you have a specific desired look in mind, they might not be a good option for you."

      "content": "Manage your expectations. While you can plan for a general shade, natural colorants react differently to each individual's type and condition of hair. Your results will be unique and may be lighter, darker, or more varied in hue than you expect. Natural colorants, particularly tinting rinses, may not give you complete coverage of gray hair. How well it works for you depends on the method you use, how long you let it sit, and your hair type. You may need to repeat the process of coloring after 48 hours if your gray hair has not been covered successfully."

      "content": "Do a strand test. Your individual hair type as well as various hair products you've used in the past affect how your hair takes to natural colorants. Save a few trimmings of hair the next time you get your hair cut, or snip a lock of hair near the back of your neck. Apply the colorant you want to use to the strand using the instructions for the method you've chosen. [13] X Research source After applying the colorant, wait the entire process time. Then, rinse the lock completely and allow it to dry in direct sunlight, if you can. Check the final results under bright natural lighting. If necessary, adjust the ingredient or processing time for your own hair â€“ more or less, depending on the shade you desire. Keep in mind that your strand test may not provide an accurate result for all of your hair. Some parts of your hair, such as the top portion, may take the dye differently. This is because typical styling, touching, and environmental exposure can affect your hair."

      "title": "Decide where you will color your hair.",
      "content": "Decide where you will color your hair. Because natural hair colorants are typically messier than conventional hair dye, you will want to think about the best place to color your hair beforehand. Cassia obovata is not staining unless there is something added to it, like rhubarb. Henna and indigo, however, are both difficult to apply and very staining. [14] X Research source If the weather is nice, you may want to bring one to two large mirrors and dye your hair outside. If you're dyeing your hair in the bathroom, you may want to do so inside of a bathtub or shower. When you dye your hair, wear old clothes or a hairdresser's cape. Then, cover all surfaces with plastic sheeting or old towels. You can also get a friend to help you, which can minimize the mess."

      "title": "Use a natural conditioning treatment after coloring gray hair.",
      "content": "Use a natural conditioning treatment after coloring gray hair. When hair turns gray, not only the pigment changes. The cuticles are also thinned, making the strands of hair coarser and more prone to breakage. [15] X Research source You can restore moisture to your hair with a natural product: egg, honey and olive oil, or coconut oil. Cassia obovata, henna, lemon and tea can be drying to your hair, so especially consider doing a natural conditioning treatment afterwards. Mix a whole egg and apply it to clean, damp hair once a month. Leave the mixture in for twenty minutes, then rinse it out with cool water. [16] X Research source Massage 1/2 cup of honey and one to two tablespoons of olive oil into damp, clean hair. Allow the mixture to sit in your hair for twenty minutes, then rinse it out with warm water. [17] X Research source Coconut oil is in a solid state at room temperature, so warm it in your hands or a microwave (if the latter, make sure it is warm and not too hot before applying). Work a couple of teaspoons of it into damp hair and wrap your hair in an old towel (coconut oil can stain fabric). Let it sit for one to two hours, then fully rinse it out and shampoo your hair.
