If your device was provided by your employer or school, their IT department has likely placed some content restrictions on your device to comply with security and/or content policies at your workplace or school. The only way to get around this is to contact the phone's administrator (likely your work or school's IT department), though your manager, teacher, or counselor may also be able to help. Review your workplace or school technology policies to learn why your phone has restrictions in place, and to make yourself aware of what is and isn't allowed."
