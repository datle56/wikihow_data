      "content": "Draw a small square. This square should be equivalent to about two feet tall and wide depending on the scale of the drawing. This square does not need to be exact, but you should be able to fit at least four of the squares into the desired area. The more squares you can fit the better."

      "content": "Fill the wall cavity with a solid dark color. Use a 6B pencil for the best results, but any pencil will work. Ensure the color is even throughout the cavity. Avoid over filling because it can make the fill seem shiny.Walls are poched with a solid black because most often they are above what is called the cut line. The cut line is where the structure is “cut” to see the floorplan. The darker the line, the closer to the cut plane the structure is."

This may take some time to do by hand. The lines do not need to be exactly the same distance apart every time. Remember poche patterns are only a visual representation of the material and not something that needs to be super precise."
