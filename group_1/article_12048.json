[5] X Research source These are valid responses, and they don't make you a bad person. Feelings don’t have to be justified—they aren’t right or wrong.

But that's not likely the case. The pain of leaving is not a reliable indication of true love. Your painful feelings might be based on fear of being alone or memories of the relationship the way it used to be."
