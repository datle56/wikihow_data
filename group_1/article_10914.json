To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps and stickers. Be genuine to make your message more meaningful. For example, instead of saying “You're the GOAT,” you could say, “I have your quote, ‘Talent without working hard is nothing’ posted above my locker. It keeps me motivated during practice.” If you’re requesting an autograph, send your photo in a properly stamped and self addressed envelope. Put International Reply Coupons (IRC) inside your envelope if you don’t live in the United Arab Emirates. [4] X Research source"
