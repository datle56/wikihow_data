      "title": "Fold the sides of the wrap halfway toward the center.",
      "content": "Fold the sides of the wrap halfway toward the center. Position the ingredients you’re using inside your wrap in the middle of the tortilla. Then, bring both the left and the right side of your wrap about 1–3 in (2.5–7.6 cm) towards the middle of the wrap. Leave about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) of space between the sides after you fold them in. [1] X Research source Folding the sides in first prevents your sandwich wrap’s contents from falling out the ends when you fold the tortilla ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the bottom third of the wrap towards the center.",
      "content": "Bring the bottom third of the wrap towards the center. Lift the bottom edge of your wrap and move it towards the center about one-third of the way up. It’s okay if the bottom of your wrap doesn’t cover all of the fillings yet since you’re just getting started. [2] X Research source Keeping the top two-thirds of the tortilla free helps you fold your wrap even tighter since you have extra to work with."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck your filling back into the wrap as you roll it up.",
      "content": "Tuck your filling back into the wrap as you roll it up. If your fillings slide out as you’re making your wrap sandwich , cover them with the bottom edge of the wrap. Press the edge of the wrap down in the center and pull the filling back towards the bottom to keep them tucked in. [3] X Research source Alternatively, use a spoon to scrape the fillings underneath the bottom fold of your wrap. Tucking the fillings in prevents them from squeezing out from the top edge of your tortilla."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue rolling the wrap from the bottom until you reach the end.",
      "content": "Continue rolling the wrap from the bottom until you reach the end. Hold the bottom edge of the tortilla down in the center and slowly roll the wrap toward the top. If the fillings start to squeeze out, gently push them back in. Continue tightly rolling your wrap 1–2 more times until you reach the top edge of the tortilla. [4] X Research source The amount of filling also determines how many folds you’ll make. If your wrap is super stuffed, you may only have to fold it 1 more time. If it’s on the thinner side, you’ll probably need 2 folds to finish your wrap. Be careful not to pull the wrap too tightly since the tortilla could rip or break."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread a condiment or sauce on the top edge of the wrap.",
      "content": "Spread a condiment or sauce on the top edge of the wrap. Smear a quarter-sized dab of hummus, mayo, or any other sauce on the top inside edge of your wrap. Spread the sauce thin and press the tortilla’s edge against your wrap to help it stay in place. [5] X Research source Avoid using too much spread since it may make the edge of your wrap slippery and more likely to fall apart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press down on the wrap after it is folded to keep it in place.",
      "content": "Press down on the wrap after it is folded to keep it in place. Once you fold your wrap and smear some spread on the edge, position the edge on the bottom of the wrap. Gently apply pressure on the smooth side of the wrap to help the wrap maintain its shape without coming apart. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice the sandwich wrap in half diagonally so it is easy to eat.",
      "content": "Slice the sandwich wrap in half diagonally so it is easy to eat. Use a sharp knife to make a clean cut through the middle of your wrap. Angle the knife diagonally across the wrap and press down with consistent pressure to make your slice. Then, serve and enjoy your wrap. [7] X Research source You don’t have to cut your wrap if you’d rather eat it whole."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom edge of the wrap towards the center.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom edge of the wrap towards the center. Bring the bottom 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of the wrap over the top of your filling. Press the edge of the wrap down in the middle of the tortilla and pull the fillings back to tuck them under the fold. [8] X Research source Folding the bottom of the tortilla first lets you wrap it up tightly so nothing falls out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the wrap evenly toward the top of the tortilla.",
      "content": "Roll the wrap evenly toward the top of the tortilla. Hold your first fold in place so it doesn’t come undone. Then, continue gently rolling the bottom of the wrap up to the top edge. Try to keep the tortilla pulled tight to prevent the fillings from falling out the sides. [9] X Research source Avoid pausing or letting go of the wrap in the middle of your roll since it may loosen up and your fillings may fall out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread a condiment or sauce on the top edge of your wrap.",
      "content": "Spread a condiment or sauce on the top edge of your wrap. When you get to the end of your wrap, hold the rolled portion with 1 hand so it doesn’t come undone. Use your other hand to scoop a quarter-sized dollop of sauce or spread along the top edge. Spread the sauce on 3–5 in (7.6–12.7 cm) of the wrap’s edge and press it against the rolled section. [10] X Research source The extra spread holds the edge of your tortilla against the wrap so it’s less likely to come undone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck in the sides of the wrap.",
      "content": "Tuck in the sides of the wrap. Poke the tortilla on the open ends of your wrap in towards the filling. Fold the ends inward about 3–4 times, and pinch the corners so they stay in place. [11] X Research source It’s okay if you want to leave the ends of your wrap open, but be prepared for the filling to slip out if you hold your sandwich wrap vertically."

      "title": "Make a diagonal cut through the middle of your wrap to serve it.",
      "content": "Make a diagonal cut through the middle of your wrap to serve it. Use a sharp bread knife to make a 45-degree angle cut through the center of the wrap. Separate the halves and put them on a plate so they’re ready to eat. [12] X Research source While you don’t need to cut your wrap, it’s an attractive way to present your dish since it shows off the filling."

      "title": "Fold the left and right sides into the middle of the wrap.",
      "content": "Fold the left and right sides into the middle of the wrap. Pick up the edges on the left and right sides of your tortilla, and bring them toward the center. Overlap the sides by about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) so you can tightly fold your wrap. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the wrap on top of itself starting from the bottom.",
      "content": "Fold the wrap on top of itself starting from the bottom. Hold the folded sides in place with 1 hand, and use the other hand to bring the bottom of your wrap up toward the middle of your filling. Pull the fillings back with the edge of the wrap to tuck them under the tortilla. Then, take the bottom section of the wrap and fold it over on top of itself. Keep folding the wrap until you reach the top edge. [14] X Research source It usually takes 2–3 folds to finish your wrap, but it depends on how many fillings you’ve added."

      "title": "Cut the tortilla from the center to one of the edges.",
      "content": "Cut the tortilla from the center to one of the edges. Lay your tortilla flat on a cutting board. Then, poke a sharp knife into the middle of the wrap. Slice from the center to one edge of the wrap. [16] X Research source This fold makes it easier to prepare a wrap without ripping the tortilla ."

      "title": "Split your fillings between the 4 quarters of the tortilla.",
      "content": "Split your fillings between the 4 quarters of the tortilla. Separate the ingredients you’re using and add each one to a separate quarter of the tortilla. Spread the fillings flat on the surface so they lie flat when you eventually fold your wrap. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between each of the fillings so you’re able to easily fold your wrap. [17] X Research source Example: If you want to make a chicken wrap , try loading the quarters of your tortilla with chopped grilled chicken, mozzarella cheese, avocados, and tomatoes."

    {
      "title": "Fold the quarters over each other to form a triangular fold.",
      "content": "Fold the quarters over each other to form a triangular fold. Start with one of the quarters next to the cut you made earlier. Hold the fillings in place with one hand and fold the tortilla up so it covers one of the top quarters. Take the folded section and bring it over to cover the other quarter on top. Finally, fold the top portion onto the bottom quarter so your wrap sandwich looks like a triangle with a rounded bottom. [18] X Research source Work slowly so you don’t spill any of the fillings out of the wrap."

      "title": "Toast the tortilla in a pan if you want to warm the ingredients.",
      "content": "Toast the tortilla in a pan if you want to warm the ingredients. Warm up a pan or griddle over low heat. Brush cooking oil onto the wrap and set it in the pan. Let each side cook for 2–3 minutes, or until your tortilla is golden-brown and crispy. [19] X Research source If you want to eat your wrap cold, then just skip this step and enjoy!"
