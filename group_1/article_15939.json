      "title": "Buy a kneaded eraser.",
      "content": "Buy a kneaded eraser. Kneaded erasers are made from a slightly sticky, putty-like substance that makes them very easy to shape and use. You can find kneaded erasers in most art supply shops. Kneaded erasers are best for when you need to lighten, rather than fully erase, colored pencil. You can approximate the effect of a kneaded eraser using wall putty, which is a very similar material."

    {
      "title": "Create the shape you need.",
      "content": "Create the shape you need. Because kneaded erasers are very malleable, you can and should make the shape that is easiest for you to handle and use. For large areas, you can flatten and stretch a kneaded eraser out over the area you want to erase. For small areas, shape the eraser into a pencil-like point."

      "title": "Test the eraser on a small area.",
      "content": "Test the eraser on a small area. It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing can cause streaking. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture. Rub gently in a small circle to test. If you notice streaking, rub more gently. If you notice streaking, consider trying another method. Try to choose a peripheral spot to test the eraser. If it does smear or streak, you do not want it to ruin the central part of your image."

      "title": "Rub the eraser on the page to pick up pigment.",
      "content": "Rub the eraser on the page to pick up pigment. You can rub the page rather hard with a kneaded eraser, because they are soft and unlikely to tear the page. After your rub some of the pigment off the page, pick up the eraser and fold the eraser over itself. This will help to prevent the pigment from rubbing back off on the page. You may need to repeat this process several times to remove all or most of the colored pencil. Rub, fold, rub, fold. Continue until you are happy with the results. Still, be careful. Although you are unlikely to tear the page, you may crease it. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the kneaded eraser.",
      "content": "Clean the kneaded eraser. Unlike other types of erasers, kneaded erasers need to be cleaned after using them. To clean the eraser stretch it thin and fold it back over. Repeat several times if necessary. [2] X Research source You may need to rub the kneaded eraser on another surface to get pigment out. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase a colored pencil eraser. A colored pencil eraser can be bought at most stores: dollar stores, an arts and crafts store, etc. You should not need to pay more than about five dollars for a colored pencil eraser. A colored pencil eraser should work on all types and brands of colored pencil."

      "content": "Simply use the colored pencil eraser as you would use a standard eraser. Rub gently; colored-in portions of paper are more fragile than paper you've simply written on. Be careful, colored pencil erasers are somewhat more firm than normal erasers. They have a rough, coarse feel to them and can tear paper. Be patient and continue to rub gently, checking your progress every few seconds. It may take some time to fully erase the colored pencil. If you get impatient and try to rub more vigorously to speed up the process, you are likely to rip the paper."

      "content": "Buy a vinyl eraser. Unlike kneaded erasers, which you might be able to fashion out of material you have around, you will likely have to buy a vinyl eraser. You can buy vinyl erasers in many different shapes. Try to find the one that is best for your needs."

It is very easy to accidentally tear through paper when using them. [5] X Research source The edge of a vinyl eraser is the most effective part. Use the edge of the eraser for the best results. If you need to completely remove all of the colored pencil, erase gently until the colored pencil is totally removed."

      "content": "Erase the area with a normal pencil eraser. Be very gentle and do not apply too much pressure because it alters the paper's surface. Erase very lightly. The goal here is to just slightly bring up the pigment from the page, in order to help the tape pull it up more easily. This helps prepare the area for the tape. You do not need to try to fully erase the colored pencil with the normal pencil eraser."

      "content": "Use a pen to write on the tape over the part you want to erase most thoroughly. By using a fine pointed stylus, like a pen, to put pressure on the tape you will encourage the colored pencil to stick to the adhesive.
