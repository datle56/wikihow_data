Mix the two ingredients well so they’re fully combined. [1] X Research source Be sure to use caffeinated coffee grounds. It not only gives you a richer color, but may also help thicken sparse or patchy eyebrows. Cocoa powder helps lighten the dye. If you can want to make the dye lighter, use more cocoa powder. If you want it to be darker, use less cocoa powder."

Stir the ingredients together well to create a liquid mixture. [2] X Research source If you don't have coconut oil, try another oil, such as olive or jojoba."

      "title": "Add some honey.",
      "content": "Add some honey. While the coconut oil helps create a smooth, liquidy pigment to dye your eyebrows, you want it to stick to your brows. Drizzle a little honey into the bowl, and mix it into the coffee mixture to make sure that it will stay on your skin. [3] X Research source When you’re finished mixing the dye, it should have paste-like consistency. There’s no exact amount of honey to add. Start with a small amount, then test it with your finger to see if it’s sticky. If it slips off, add a little more honey."

      "content": "Allow the mixture to sit for several minutes. Once the coffee mixture is fully combined, let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes. That will give the ingredients time to bind together. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash your face. To ensure that there isn’t any makeup, dirt, or other residue on your skin and brow hair that might affect the dye, it’s important to clean your face. Use your usual facial cleanser and water to wash your face, paying special attention to the brow area. Pat your face dry with a clean towel. [5] X Research source If you have very dry, flaky skin, exfoliate your brow area with a facial scrub. Avoid the delicate skin around your eyes. Most facial cleansers will sting, while scrubs will irritate it."

      "title": "Comb your brows into place.",
      "content": "Comb your brows into place. Before you apply the coffee dye, you want to be sure that your brows in the proper shape. Use a clean spoolie or brow brush to carefully comb them into place, following your brows’ natural shape. [6] X Research source If you aren’t happy with your brows’ shape, get them professionally waxed, threaded, or tweezed into shape."

      "content": "Tweeze any stray hairs. After you’ve brushed your brows into place, check to see if you have any stray hairs. Remove them with a pair of clean tweezers, so you don’t accidentally apply the dye in areas that you don't want to. [7] X Research source You should still do this even if you just shaped your eyebrows. Take a quick look in the mirror, and remove any stray hairs."

      "title": "Spread the coffee mixture over your brows.",
      "content": "Spread the coffee mixture over your brows. When your brows are combed into place, dip an angled brow or eyeliner brush into the coffee mixture. Smooth it over your brows in your desired shaped. Apply a second layer to ensure that the entire area is covered. [8] X Research source Don't apply the coffee mixture outside the lines of your brow, otherwise you may stain your skin. If you’re worried about precision, mark the outer edges with a brow pencil first so that you know where to place the dye. Want to mask the brows off entirely? If you want to ensure you don’t stain your skin at all, rub some petroleum jelly around your eyebrows. The mixture won’t end up on your skin at all."

      "title": "Clean up any smudges.",
      "content": "Clean up any smudges. Once the dye is applied, wet a cotton swab with water. Run the cotton swab over any smudges or mistakes that you may have made to remove the coffee mixture from your skin. [9] X Research source Alternatively, fold up a paper towel into a tight square or triangle, then dampen it. This will make precision a little more difficult, but it'll do in a pinch. Don’t scrub too hard! If you really overwork the smudges you could remove some of the tint."

      "title": "Let the mixture sit on your brow.",
      "content": "Let the mixture sit on your brow. When the coffee mixture is spread over your brow, let it sit in place for approximately 20 minutes. The longer that you let the dye sit, the darker your brows will be, so you can adjust the time accordingly. [10] X Research source If you’re dyeing your brows for the first time, err on the side of caution and stick to 20 minutes or less. It's best to dye too light than too dark. Remember, you can always dye your brows again to make them darker, but you can't make them lighter."

      "content": "Remove the coffee mixture. When the dye has sat on your brows for about 20 minutes, wet another cotton swab. Run it over your brows to remove the coffee mixture, making sure to get all of the residue off. [11] X Research source If you prefer, you can wipe the coffee mixture off with a damp washcloth. Be aware that it may stain the cloth, though. If your brows did not turn out dark enough for you, repeat the whole process. You can use a microfiber cloth instead of a cotton swab. Just don’t use cotton balls, since the balls will leave fibers behind on your skin."
