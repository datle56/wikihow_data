      "content": "Evaluate your symptoms to determine what kind of headache you have. Different headaches are treated in different ways. Typically, you can determine the type of headache you have on your own based on your specific symptoms. If you have difficulty, though, you can also ask your doctor. They should be able to identify the type of headache you're having by a description of your symptoms. Common types of headaches include: [2] X Research source Tension: The most common type of headache. Caused by muscle tightness in the back of the neck or scalp. Feels like a tight band around your head. Pain may also be concentrated in your forehead, temples, or the back of your head. Sinus: Caused by inflamed sinuses due to allergies, a cold, or the flu. You may feel pain over your forehead, around your nose and eyes, over your cheeks, or in your upper teeth. Pain may increase when you stoop forward. Migraine: Caused by many different triggers that vary from person to person. Pulsating pain of disabling intensity, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, typically lasts the whole day. Cluster: Relatively rare; unknown cause. Attacks result in up to 8 headaches a day for a 1 to 3 month period. Pain always on one side of the head and very severe. Typically accompanied by a red, watery eye on the headache side. May also be accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light or sound."

      "content": "Use hot or cold therapy to relax tense muscles. Either a warm compress or ice can ease a tension headache by helping to relax the muscles in your head and face. If you're using cold therapy, wrap a bag of ice or frozen vegetables in a towel to protect your skin. Regardless of whether you're using a warm compress or ice, don't leave it on your head for more than 15 to 20 minutes. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Heat improves circulation and increases blood flow, whereas cold restricts blood flow to reduce inflammation. Cold therapy is usually best for sinus headaches and other headaches caused by inflammation, but can also ease tension headaches. However, heat is typically better for tension headaches. If you're using a warm compress, the water should be no more than 120 °F (49 °C) for adults or 105 °F (41 °C) for children. [4] X Research source You can also use a hot water bottle or gel pack."

      "content": "Use a humidifier to ease sinus dryness and irritation. If the air in your home is overly dry, it can cause sinus congestion, which can lead to sinus headaches. A humidifier helps keep the air moist so it's easier for you to breathe. [6] X Research source If you use a humidifier, check the humidity of your home regularly to maintain the right humidity level. Generally, the air in your home should be between 30% and 55%. Make sure you change the water in your humidifier so it's fresh, using bottled water if possible. Clean your humidifier at least once a week. Otherwise, it can grow mold, which can cause significant health problems."

With acupuncture, a practitioner inserts thin needles through your skin at specific points to help relieve headaches and prevent their reoccurrence. While acupuncture doesn't work for everybody, many people saw improvement after trying this therapy. [7] X Research source There are generally no adverse effects to either acupuncture or acupressure, so they're safe therapies to try and see if they work. Make sure any acupuncture practitioner you see is licensed to perform acupuncture treatment. Your primary care physician might be able to recommend someone. You can do acupressure at home to relieve headache pain. Use your right thumb and index finger to find the space between the base of your left thumb and your left index finger. Press your right thumb and index finger together on this spot for 5 minutes. Move your thumb slowly in a small circle while applying constant pressure. [8] X Research source"

Buy fresh ginger root at the grocery store or take it in a powdered or capsule form when you feel a headache coming on. Ginger is a strong herb, so a little goes a long way. If you're taking ginger in capsule form as a supplement, follow the instructions on the package.

Discuss the supplement with your doctor and read the dosage instructions on the bottle carefully. Don't take feverfew if you are allergic to chamomile, ragweed, or yarrow. If you take feverfew regularly, taper off with smaller doses before you stop taking it completely. Otherwise, you could suffer rebound headaches, as well as anxiety, fatigue, muscle stiffness, and joint pain."

      "content": "Practice relaxation techniques to lower your stress levels. Relaxation techniques, including practices such as yoga and tai chi, help ease tension in your life and lower your anxiety levels. Even a few minutes of slow, deep breathing can help you manage stress more productively. To practice deep breathing, move to a quiet spot without distractions and sit or lay down in a comfortable position. Turn your mental focus to your breath. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, expanding your chest. Pause when your lungs are full, then exhale slowly, lowering your chest. Pause when your lungs are empty, then repeat the cycle. Do this for at least a couple of minutes. Expect a little trial and error before you find the technique that works best for you. If you're trying a relaxation technique that you find difficult or that feels like work, it may cause you more stress. If you have high levels of anxiety, you might also consider going to a therapist to talk about what makes you anxious. Your therapist will recommend good coping strategies for you."
