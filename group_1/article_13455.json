It's distracting and difficult to go searching for a ruler or a protractor after you're in the middle of your geometry homework, and it can be difficult to get back into it after going on a hunt that takes a half hour.

Giving homework your undivided attention will actually make it easier, because your mind won't be balancing different tasks at the same time. If you find this hard, try giving your devices to your parents/guardians or try putting it in another room. [1] X Research source It's common that students will try to multi-task, watching TV or listening to the radio or continuing to chat on Facebook or Instagram while also trying to do homework. It'll be so much more fun to do those things after you're already done with your homework, though, and your homework will take half as much time if you're focused on doing nothing but your homework. Check your phone or your social networking sites during your study break, but not before. Use these distractions as a carrot, not as a pacifier."

It's usually better to finish one thing completely, so you can put it out of your mind and move on to other things. Focusing on individual tasks helps to keep you focused. Put all the other assignments out of your mind and focus on the task at hand. Maybe you could even ask a close friend or family to help you. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Try to figure out what works best for you. Some students might like to start their homework immediately after school to get it done as quickly as possible, while it may be better to give yourself an hour to relax before starting in on it and decompress from the long school day. Don't wait for the last minute. While it may seem like a better idea to work straight through and finish, it's possible that the quality of the work you're doing will start to suffer if you don't give your mind a rest. It's difficult to think hard for more than 45 minutes at a time on a particular subject. Give yourself a rest and come back refreshed."

The best way to do homework is in a quiet space without distractions, where you'll be able to spend however much time you need to do your homework comfortably.

You might have video games, computers, guitars, and all sorts of other distractions in your bedroom. It might be a better idea to sit at the kitchen table, or in the living room, where your parents can call you out for procrastinating. You'll get it done more quickly without the temptation of distraction. In public , the library is a great place to study and do homework. At all libraries, it's a rule that you have to be quiet, and you won't have any of the distractions of home. The school library will often stay open after school ends, making it a good option for finishing up homework before heading home, or your school may even have an after-school study spot specifically for the purpose.

At the end of the school day, when you're getting ready to start on your homework, try to figure out what the most important assignments are and put them in the appropriate order to give yourself enough time to complete everything you need to do. This is especially important if you've got multiple assignments, or some assignments that aren't due the next day but will take multiple days to complete. You've got to divide your time appropriately, making prioritizing an important step. Try starting with the most difficult homework . Do you really hate the idea of getting into the algebra homework? Does reading for English take the longest? Start with the most challenging homework to give yourself the most time to complete it, then move on to the easier tasks you can complete more quickly. Try starting with the most pressing homework . If you've got 20 math problems to do for tomorrow, and 20 pages to read in a novel for Friday, it's probably better to start with the math homework to make sure you'll have enough time to complete it.

The less time you spend procrastinating and checking your text messages, the more quickly you'll be done. If you think you can finish everything in a half hour, set a timer and work efficiently to finish in that amount of time. If you don't quite finish, give yourself a few extra minutes. Treat it like a drill. Keep track of how long you usually spend on particular assignments on average. If your math homework typically takes you 45 minutes to finish, save that much time each night. If you start plugging away for an hour, give yourself a break and work on something else to avoid tiring out. Schedule 10 minutes of break time for every 50 minutes of work time.

Just do it. Now. [13] X Research source Do you really need an hour of TV or computer after school to decompress? It might be easier to just dive into your homework and get it done while the skills are still fresh in your mind. Waiting a couple hours means you'll have to review your notes and try to get back to the same place you already were. Do it while it's fresh. If you've got three days to read an assignment, don't wait until the last evening to do it all. Space it out and give yourself more time to finish. Just because you've got a due date that's a long time away doesn't mean it wouldn't be easier to finish now. Stay ahead of the game. Try either waking up earlier or going to bed later.

If you've got to read a bunch of stuff for homework, read on the bus. Pop in some headphones to white noise that'll drown out the shouting of other students and tune into your book. The bus can be distracting, or it can be a great resource. Since it's full of your classmates, try to get other students to work with you and get things done more quickly. Work together on the math problems and try to figure out things together. It's not cheating if everyone's doing the work and no one's just copying.

Imagine knocking out an entire math assignment the day it was assigned and not even having to bring your book home. Don't rely on this time to finish homework just before it's due. Rushing to finish your last few problems in the five minutes before you need to turn it in looks bad in front of the teacher, plus it doesn't give you any time to review your homework after you finish it.

It's okay to stop when you can't figure something out after a serious effort and ask your teacher for help. However, many teachers find this annoying and ask students to at least try. [15] X Research source Asking for help with your homework isn't a sign that you're bad at the subject or that you're \"stupid.\" Every teacher on the planet will respect a student that takes their homework seriously enough to ask for help.
