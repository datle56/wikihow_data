      "content": "Apply a light amount of styling gel to your hair. It's a good idea to apply a light amount of hair gel to your hair before starting the braiding process. This will make it easier to shape your hair into a braid. Add a small amount of something like mousse or another type of gel you prefer to your hair before you start. [1] X Research source If you prefer using less product, only add the gel to the hair on the nape of your neck. This is the hair you will be braiding."

      "title": "Remove a clump of hair from the nape of your neck.",
      "content": "Remove a clump of hair from the nape of your neck. Jedi braids are very small, so only grab a tiny strand of hair from the nape of your neck. The hair strand should easily fit between your index finger and thumb. [3] X Research source Tie the strand of hair in place for now with a hair tie or rubber band. The precise width of the strand will vary depending on factors like the thickness of your hair. Keep in mind that, if you're new to braiding, go for a slightly thicker strand of hair simply because this will be easier for a beginner to braid. As you get more comfortable braiding, you can style your hair with thinner Jedi braids."
