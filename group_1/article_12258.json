Push the needle inside your basketball’s round valve opening.You'll hear a hiss of air. [1] X Research source An inflation needle is a small metal rod with a pointed end. You can find one at any store that sells sporting goods, or you can buy one online."

      "content": "Wait for the air to release before removing the needle. If you just want to remove a little air from an overinflated ball, this only takes 2 or 3 seconds. If you’re completely deflating your ball, apply extra pressure by squeezing it as the air releases. [2] X Research source Then pull the needle out gently, being careful to not yank out the valve."

Drop your ball: if it bounces up to elbow height, it’s properly inflated. If your ball bounces lower, add more air . If it bounces higher than your elbow, release a bit more air.

If the instructions are worn off, rely on the standard of 7.5 - 8.5 PSI (51.71 - 58.60 kPa).
