      "content": "Call your city waste department to see if you can put the box spring on the curb. Many cities have a large or bulky item collection period. Contact your local waste management either over the phone or through their website to check if and when they collect bulk items. [1] X Research source Make sure the box spring is in front of your house on the first day of the scheduled pick-up period. Box springs won't be picked up during regular trash collection."

      "title": "Schedule pick-up with the city online or over the phone if needed.",
      "content": "Schedule pick-up with the city online or over the phone if needed. Box springs larger than 4 ft × 3 ft (1.22 m × 0.91 m) should be called in so they can be correctly transported. Appointments can be scheduled up to 4 weeks in advance. Plan around city holidays or inclement weather since waste disposal services may not run on those days. [2] X Research source Put the box spring out the night before your scheduled pick-up or in the early morning. Some private waste companies will also pick up and get rid of box springs for a fee. If your city has a bulk collection period, you don't need to schedule an appointment during that time."

      "content": "Cover the box spring in a plastic mattress bag. Mattress bags make the box spring easier to transport as well as prevent the spread of bed bugs. Slide your box spring into the bag and fold the opening over to seal it. [3] X Research source Some places, like New York City, will fine anyone who leaves a mattress or box spring outside without covering it. Mattress bags can be purchased at furniture or moving supply stores for around $10 USD."

      "content": "Drop the box spring off at a landfill if you can transport it yourself. Contact your local landfill or waste site to see if you can get rid of your box spring there. Bring the box spring to the location and throw it away if it's allowed. Many landfills will have a fee for disposal, usually around $30 USD. [4] X Research source Some landfills have limits of how many box springs you can throw away per year."

      "content": "Cut the bottom lining off the box spring with a utility knife. Flip your box spring so it's upside-down. Make sure you have enough room to work around the box spring, so you don't have to move it. Run your knife around the edges to remove the lining. This should expose the wood frame.

[10] X Research source Bag the components together in large garbage bags before putting them in your trash can. Throw away the metal springs during a bulk collection period or by taking them to a local landfill."
