      "title": "Soak it in water.",
      "content": "Soak it in water. If your ham is too salty, dilution is a great way to remove some of the salty flavor. Take the ham and place it in a container of fresh, cold water. Cover the container with a lid or aluminum foil. Then place the container in the refrigerator for at least 2-4 hours. This will help reduce the saltiness of the ham. [1] X Research source You can soak a ham for up to 72 hours to remove the saltiness. The longer you soak it, the less salty it will be. If soaking the ham for more than 4 hours, make sure you change the water regularly. Replace the water every 2 hours to reduce bacteria growth."

      "title": "Try boiling the ham.",
      "content": "Try boiling the ham. If soaking the ham does not remove the saltiness, you can try boiling it. Cut the ham into large chunks and place the meat in a pot of boiling water. Boil the ham for about ten minutes. This can help leach out any remaining salt. [2] X Research source Taste the ham after you have boiled it for about ten minutes. If it is still too salty, try boiling it for another one or two minutes. Do not boil the ham for longer than necessary to remove the salt. Doing so can result in tough, dried out, or unappetizing ham."

      "content": "Serve it with dairy products. If your ham turns out to be overly salty, you can diminish some of the saltiness by serving it with dairy products like cheese, sour cream, or cottage cheese. The dairy products will help counteract the salty flavor of the ham. [3] X Research source Try chopping up the ham and cooking adding it to scalloped potatoes. Add salty ham to an omelet with cheddar and vegetables for a quick breakfast or lunch."

      "title": "Add a little lemon juice to cooked ham.",
      "content": "Add a little lemon juice to cooked ham. Acid can help mask the salty flavor of ham. If your ham is too salty, consider drizzling a little lemon on it to help mask the hamâ€™s saltiness. Make sure you only use a tiny amount and no more than a tablespoon for the entire ham. Rub the lemon juice on the outside of the ham and let it sit for about 15 minutes before serving. [4] X Research source You can also try white vinegar to help mask the saltiness. Taste the ham after fifteen minutes. If it is still too salty, allow the vinegar or lemon juice to soak in for another ten to fifteen minutes."

      "title": "Use less ham in the recipe.",
      "content": "Use less ham in the recipe. If you are dealing with leftover ham that is too salty, you can still make use of it by using less. For example, if you are adding the ham to a soup or stew, use two-thirds of the amount called for in the recipe. This can help cut back on the salty flavor while still allowing you to make the most of your leftovers. [5] X Research source"
