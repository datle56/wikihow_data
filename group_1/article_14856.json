      "title": "Gently squeeze a lime slice over the ice in the glass.",
      "content": "Gently squeeze a lime slice over the ice in the glass. Adding lime now ensures that it will be well incorporated into the cocktail. If you don't have a lime, lemon provides that citrus tang just as well, and is often used interchangeably."
    },

      "title": "Pour the Bombay Sapphire into the glass and stir to chill the gin.",
      "content": "Pour the Bombay Sapphire into the glass and stir to chill the gin. If you don't have a good stirring rod and are looking to buy basic accessories for your home bar, consider making it one of your first purchases. If you don't yet have one, not to worry, as even a kitchen spoon can do the job. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the glass with a good tonic.",
      "content": "Fill the glass with a good tonic. If you know how, pouring the tonic down the stirring rod is an excellent technique to retain the bubbly effervescence of the tonic. If you don't have this technique under your felt, tipping the glass so that you pour tonic down the inner surface of the glass has the same effect. Garnish with a lime slice. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pour the Bombay Sapphire into the glass and stir to chill the gin before proceeding.",
      "content": "Pour the Bombay Sapphire into the glass and stir to chill the gin before proceeding. Gin is best icy cold, unlike liquors such as scotch, which are often served at room temperature."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the lime juice and ginger beer.",
      "content": "Add the lime juice and ginger beer. Stir until well mixed. In a pinch, you can substitute lemon juice for the lime juice. Spicier than mere ginger ale, ginger beer is a non-alcoholic beverage found among speciality sodas in upscale grocery stores. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Garnish with a lime (or lemon) slice.",
      "content": "Garnish with a lime (or lemon) slice. While lime wedges are good because they're so squeezable, you can play with other garnish shapes such as half slices or wheels, or whatever suits your fancy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the Bombay Sapphire, vermouth and elderflower liqueur into the pitcher to combine all the alcohols.",
      "content": "Pour the Bombay Sapphire, vermouth and elderflower liqueur into the pitcher to combine all the alcohols. Adding ingredients in the right order can be important when making mixed drinks. Add these first to prevent the alcohol from remaining on the top of your drink."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the pitcher completely with ice.",
      "content": "Fill the pitcher completely with ice. Squeeze 4 lime wedges over the ice. After squeezing, drop the slices onto the ice. Citrus fruit and Bombay Sapphire go perfectly together in this and other drinks, as the sharp citrus taste complements the astringency of the gin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the pitcher with 12 parts of ginger ale.",
      "content": "Fill the pitcher with 12 parts of ginger ale. Stir just enough to combine the ingredients without sacrificing the effervescence of the ginger ale. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pour into individual glasses.",
      "content": "Pour into individual glasses. Garnish each glass with sliced ginger and a mint spring. The Laverstoke sharing cocktail is perfect to celebrate a promotion, engagement, or any occasion in which dear friends come together to recognize something special."
