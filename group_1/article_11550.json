      "content": "You both live close to one another. Long commutes can be a real relationship killer, but that definitely isn’t a problem when you’re dating your neighbor. It’s really easy and convenient to spend time together, and equally easy to get some alone time, since you each have your own place. [2] X Research source Research shows that just 34% of people are willing to go out with someone who lives over an hour away from them."

      "content": "You probably have some common interests. Since you both live in the same town and neighborhood, there’s a good chance that you have some things in common. You both might like the simplicity of suburbs, the convenience of the city, or the tranquility of the countryside. Having something in common is a great starting point for a new relationship.

      "content": "You have plenty of time to figure out your compatibility. Before you officially start dating, you have lots of time to learn more about your neighbor, and to see if you’re a good fit for each other. See what kinds of activities you both like, or invite them over for drinks. As neighbors, you have tons of opportunities to spend time together as friends before committing to anything serious.

      "content": "You don’t get a lot of privacy. It can be hard to get a lot of “me time” when your significant other lives a few doors down. As your neighbor, they’ll also get to see whenever you enter and leave your home, which can really kill your sense of privacy. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "The relationship might move too quickly. Since you live so close to each other, the “let’s move in together” conversation might happen a lot sooner than it usually would. This can lead to some potential problems if the relationship sours further down the line. [7] X Research source All relationships come with ups and downs. If your relationship hits some pitfalls, you and your significant other can put your best foot forward by spending plenty of time together face-to-face, and also being open and honest with one another about your thoughts and feelings.

In a standard relationship, you know that you won’t constantly bump into each other should things come to an end. Unfortunately, you won’t have that same luxury when you date your neighbor.

      "content": "Tell them how you feel. It may feel a little risky, but it’s best to let your neighbor know how you feel. Don’t be too pushy when you confess; instead, bring up your feelings in a gentle, subtle way. Even if they reject your advances, you’ll at least know the truth, and will have no nagging questions about what could’ve been. You might say, “I’m always happy to bump into you. Would you like to continue this conversation over coffee sometime?”"

      "title": "They use positive body language around you.",
      "content": "They use positive body language around you. Pay attention to your neighbor’s body language the next time you both strike up a conversation. Are they leaning toward you, lightly touching your arm, patting you on the shoulder, or making a lot of eye contact? If so, you may be in luck—these are all potential signs that your neighbor is interested. [11] X Research source An interested neighbor might also mirror your body language without realizing it. For example, if you place 1 hand on your hip during a conversation, your neighbor might do the same thing."

      "title": "They recall small details about you.",
      "content": "They recall small details about you. Small talk is inevitable when you bump into your neighbors, but an interested neighbor will commit tidbits of your conversation to memory. The next time you talk, see if they reference something that you mentioned in a past encounter.

Bring over a house-warming gift, or try out a bolder pick-up line. It’s okay if they don’t seem interested; in that case, just apologize and move on.

      "content": "Touch them in a playful, friendly way. Casual touch is a great way to show your interest without making things too awkward. Start your conversation with a friendly handshake or shoulder tap to get the ball rolling. Then, throughout the conversation, segue into a playful touch around the forearm, waist, or shoulder. [16] X Research source Pay attention to how your neighbor reacts. Some people aren’t a fan of being touched."

      "title": "Invite them over to your place.",
      "content": "Invite them over to your place. Ask if they’d like to stop by for drinks or watch some TV. Then, see how they react; if your neighbor seems interested in hanging out, there could be a potential relationship on the horizon. Hanging out doesn’t guarantee that your relationship will reach the next level. However, it’s a great way to get to know your neighbor in a casual, friendly way."

Let them know that you’re flexible, and that you’re happy to go out another time if that would work better. [17] X Research source You might say, “Would like to grab dinner with me this Friday at the new Indian place down the street?” or “I know a great Italian restaurant about 20 minutes from here. Are you free for lunch on Saturday?” Don’t treat your invitation like a sales call, or some kind of deal that has to be “closed.” If your neighbor isn’t interested, at least you’ll be able to move on."

Before you pop the question, ask your neighbor if they can help you with something small, like sharing some extra laundry detergent or giving you directions someplace. [18] X Research source For instance, you might say, “Would you mind giving me a light?” or “Could I use your phone?” before asking your neighbor out on a date."

Would you like to come see it with me?”"

      "content": "It is, but you should also think about what comes next. Unfortunately, hooking up with a neighbor can make things complicated. You might feel like you have no more alone time, or that your personal life is constantly on display. If your fling ends on a bad note, it could also make things really uncomfortable the next time you cross paths—which could be very soon, given where you both live. Always put your own mental and emotional needs first before agreeing to any hookups. [21] X Research source Hookups are tricky territory to navigate, but there’s no right or wrong way to feel after you have one. Research shows that some people segue their hookup into a more serious relationship, while others continue hooking up occasionally. Do what feels best for you and your situation!

      "title": "Share your feelings with a trusted friend or loved one.",
      "content": "Share your feelings with a trusted friend or loved one. Crushes can be difficult to navigate, and it’s easy to feel a bit out of control. Let your friend know how you’re feeling—discussing your feelings makes them a lot easier to process. Plus, your friend can lend a unique, independent perspective. [23] X Research source Don’t rush yourself. Getting over a crush takes time and patience, and it can take a while before you really recover. Give yourself as much time as you need to recover, instead of forcing yourself to feel better in a matter of days. [24] X Research source"
