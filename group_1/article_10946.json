You can use any yarn you like to make your flowers, but if you want to create small delicate flowers, then opt for a light or medium worsted weight yarn. Crochet hook . Make sure that the hook size is appropriate for the yarn you are using. Check the label of your yarn for a recommendation. For example, if you choose a light worsted weight yarn, then a size G/6 (UK 8) hook is best. [1] X Research source Scissors"

It is a simple way to begin a crochet project that needs to be worked in rounds. To make a magic ring, loop your yarn around two fingers twice. Pinch the yarn to secure it in the loop, and then work a slipstitch onto an edge of the loop to secure it. [2] X Research source Another option for starting your flower is to make a chain of four. If you use this option, then the center of your flower will be open. [3] X Research source"

You will need to make six single crochet stitches around the magic circle in total. [4] X Research source To single crochet, insert the hook through the center of the circle, then yarn over and pull through one loop on the hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops on the hook to complete a single crochet stitch.
