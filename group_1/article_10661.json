To start, create a new sketch. The sketch button can be found under file in the top left corner of your screen. After the sketch menu appears, click on the flat surface of your gear, as that is where the extruded hole will be. Using the circle tool, make a circle in the middle of your gear. To use the tool, left-click the circle icon in the toolbar at the top, then left-click in the middle of your gear to start the circle. Either drag the circle to size or type in a specific diameter, then left-click one last time. Take note of the diameter of the circle that was made. Once this is done, left-click \"Finish Sketch\". Now, the sketched circle needs to be extruded to form a cylinder. To do this, right-click on the sketch in the Part Navigator on the left side. A drop-down menu will appear. Left-click the extrude option. Now, the extrusion menu should appear. Using the arrow slider on that part, drag the surface of your cylinder to any length, being sure not to make it too long. Once the length is decided, click OK to confirm the extrusion."

Make a slightly smaller circle centered on top of the original circle using the Circle Tool found in the toolbar at the top. The icon for this looks like a circle. After making the circle, left-click Finish Sketch in the top left corner. Your part should look like the image shown. Next, the sketched circle needs to be subtract extruded backwards through the entire gear to create a hole. Again, right-click the sketch in the Part Navigator and left-click Extrude .

Sketch a small circle in the middle of your extrusion, taking note of the diameter. Once you are done, left-click Finish Sketch . Subtract extrude the tiny circle through the entire length of the gear shaft hole. To do this, move the extrusion drag arrow both ways and have the boolean set to subtract. The gear should now be complete. Feel free to make multiple gears, and note that they can also vary in size and number of teeth. The finished product should look like the image shown."

Then, start a new sketch and make a circle that is 1-2mm smaller than the hole made in the middle of the gear. After that, left-click Finish Sketch . Next, extrude the sketched circle to a decent length, long enough to hold the gears. Two holes, one on each end of the shaft need to be added so the pins can pass through. To do this, sketch two lines of equal length, each starting from the ends of the shaft. Then, sketch two circles, the center points being the endpoint of each line. Doing this will make the pin holes symmetrical. Before finishing the sketch, select the Quick Trim tool and remove the two lines so only the circles remain. After, left-click Finish Sketch . Without doing this, the extrusion will not come out right. Perform another subtract extrusion on the pin circles to create holes. This can be done in the same way as the other subtract extrusions. The gear shafts are now complete, and they should look like the image shown."

Make sure the pin is long enough so part of it can stick out of each side of the shaft."

Either click the name of the part on the list, or click the part itself on the workspace. After selecting the part, left-click Specify Orientation .

Next, move the gears onto the shafts so that the pin hole on the gear aligns with the pin hole on the shaft. Finally, move the gear pins so that they are passing through both the gears and the shaft, anchoring the gears in place. The final assembly should look something like the image shown."

Start a new sketch, and draw a rectangle using the Rectangle Tool . The rectangle needs to be large enough to fit the assembly while allowing room for the shafts to stick out one side. Now, extrude the rectangle to form a rectangular cube. Next, start a new sketch, selecting the face of the rectangular cube. Using the Line tool make small reference lines at two corners that are diagonal from each other. See the image for clarification. Using the Rectangle Tool create a rectangle starting at the endpoint of the inner reference line and ending at the inner endpoint of the reference line diagonal to it. This will create a centered rectangle. See the image for clarification. Make sure to Quick Trim the reference lines after sketching the rectangle before finishing the sketch. Next, subtract extrude the sketch almost to the bottom of the rectangular cube. The resulting part should look like a box. Start another sketch on the side of the box. Using the Circle Tool sketch two evenly spaced circles on the side of the box. You can use reference lines makes this process easier. These circles should be spaced in a way so that the gear shafts will line up when the assembly is placed in the housing unit. Again, make sure to Quick Trim the reference lines before finishing the sketch. Perform a subtract extrusion on the new sketch. Make sure that the extrusion only creates holes on one side of the housing unit. The finished housing unit should look like this image."
