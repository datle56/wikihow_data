      "content": "Identify the age of a closed account. You might have closed an account in the past. This situation is different than if the credit account was never yours to begin with. You can have closed accounts removed after a certain amount of time has passed: An account that was closed but in good standing can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years. If the credit information is positive, you might want to leave it on your report. A delinquent account that was charged off will remain on your report for seven years plus 180 days from the point you became delinquent. An account in collections will remain on your account for seven years plus 180 days from the date it became delinquent. Also, an account in collections may show up twice on your credit report. It may show up once for delinquency and once for collection."

For example, they might agree to take the negative information off your account if you agree to make payment. This is called “pay for delete.” [6] X Research source Be careful. By agreeing to pay, you might re-start the debt. For example, a collections account should fall off your credit report after seven years. If the account is six years old, it should fall off in a year. By agreeing to start making payments, however, the account becomes new—it is now zero years old. If you can’t make all of your payments, the creditor will back out of deleting the account, and it won’t fall off for seven more years.
