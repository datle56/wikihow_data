      "content": "“Die with a Smile” is a bittersweet love song about how time is limited. There’s no greater warmth in this world than finding your person. But even if you get to spend your entire lifetime with your true love, the party does eventually end. So, is that a happy or a sad thing? Was the journey worth it? This is what informs “Die with a Smile.” It’s a ballad about two lovers realizing they’re on the sinking ship of life. The song is divided into two halves, with Bruno Mars singing the first verse and Lady Gaga singing the second verse. [1] X Research source It opens: I, I just woke up from a dream / Where you and I had to say goodbye / And I don't know what it all means / But since I survived… Bruno croons about a dream—a premonition, perhaps—about a future scenario where the narrator and their love must part. Now, it’s just a dream. Later, it may be death. Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow / Nobody's promised tomorrow / So I'm going to love you every night like it's the last night… The hook is the narrator’s takeaway from the dream—all you can do is love the person you love for the little time you have together. If the world was ending / I'd wanna be next to you / …I'd wanna hold you just for a while / And die with a smile… The chorus reinforces the core themes of the song: you can’t do anything about the inevitability of death, so enjoy the ride and hold the person you love close. Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream / I don't even wanna do this anymore… Lady Gaga’s verse starts by taking a turn—her speaker isn’t confident that any of the pain and loss is worth it. Notably, this is the most abstract and impressionistic moment of the song, and it’s classic Gaga to deliver the only dose of weirdness we get! Our love's the only war worth fighting for… Gaga’s verse ends with the affirmation that even if you can’t do anything about the eventuality of death, it’s still worth fighting to hold on to your true love for as long as you can."

      "content": "Lady Gaga described the song as an essential part of her new album. “Die with a Smile” was originally going to be a standalone single. However, Lady Gaga reflected on the project and decided it was the “missing piece” to her newest upcoming album. She has reflected that the song has this perfect “super ‘70s” energy that she really appreciates. “I think ‘Die With a Smile’ is a unique song in a way in 2024. We’re saying some [stuff] that’s maybe not happening on every record.” [2] X Research source Has Bruno Mars said anything about the song? Not really. He thanked people on an Instagram post for making the song a hit, but he hasn’t shared anything substantial."

      "content": "The video is an homage to live music on TV in the 70s. Much like Sia’s “Cheap Thrills” and Outkast’s “Hey Ya” , the music video for “Die with a Smile” is inspired by the live performances TV viewers would see when watching shows like The Ed Sullivan Show , American Bandstand , or Midnight Special . These shows were a primary way for emerging artists to promote their music in the 60s and 70s, and the nostalgic vibes fit perfectly with the old school energy of the song’s music. [3] X Research source Bruno Mars seems to really like these old musical motifs. The video for “Uptown Funk” looks like something straight out of Soul Train and the vintage video effects and costumes in “24k Magic” would be perfectly at home in a 1978 music video compilation. We have a hunch Mars has a soft spot for the old stuff!"

      "content": "The video’s aesthetic matches the central themes of the song. At its core, “Die with a Smile” is about the juxtaposition between eternal love and the limited time we have on the planet. The aesthetic of the video reflects this. The style is “timeless” but at the same time it’s exceptionally dated. It just looks old, the song feels like it could be from any period. The content and the form match! [4] X Research source You can see paradoxes like this all over the song if you look carefully. Note the extremely warm browns and greys contrasting with the colder blue and red tones. Look at the way the stage is arranged so the singers are in “opposition” while they sing together. Their live performances of this ballad have matched the same look, too. They’ve put on two fascinating renditions in Vegas that you should check out here and here (We’re in love with Gaga’s fit in the second clip!)."

      "content": "Lady Gaga liked the video’s humor and dissonance. Gaga cooly smokes a cigarette while Bruno Mars croons in a cowboy hat as the two of them sing about dying. It’s all kind of goofy in a dark way. Lady Gaga said, “I do think that the humor we found in the video must have been something that was bouncing around inside me—this idea of a sad story that has some comedy. Singing about dying is not something you would associate with smiling, but somehow it all makes sense when you think about the sweetness of what we’re trying to say.” [5] X Research source"

      "content": "The ballad marks a return for both Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. The two of them weren’t exactly putting out a ton of music the past few years. Gaga was working on films (notably Joker: Folie à Deux ), while Mars was in residency at the Park MGM in Vegas, so their fans have been anxiously awaiting new tunes for a while. Wasn’t Bruno Mars in debt or something? No, this was a rumor that was circulating for a while—probably because Mars was spending an abnormal amount of time performing in Vegas—but there’s no truth to it. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "The song fits the current pop environment exceptionally well. The punchy, hip-hop inspired pop sound that dominated the 2010s seems to be slowly fading away. Artists like Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, and Sabrina Carpenter have capitalized on the moment by pivoting into a 70s-inspired crooner sound that just seems so “in” right now. This is the same kind of energy Mars and Gaga are bringing to “Die with a Smile,” which seems to have helped it perform so well. [7] X Research source A similar respect for nostalgia has emerged in hip hop, too! Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” sounds like it would be right at home on an early Dr. Dre record, and Jack Harlow’s “Lovin On Me” sing-songy punch sounds like something MC Hammer might have been interested in back in the day. Nostalgia is just in right now!"

Gaga explained, “I really wanted to hear what he was doing, so I went over there really late and he played me the start of this idea … he had a couple different ideas, but I said, ‘This one is a love song—I think people would love to hear us do a love song.” [8] X Research source She continues, “I write music all the time, and sometimes you feel like you’re making something that some people will like. But there’s other times that you work on something and you just know it’s gonna deeply speak to all different kinds of people. I knew it right away” [9] X Research source"

      "content": "“Die with a Smile” was a critical hit—it even won a Grammy! Critics were absolutely in love with the pop duo’s ballad. In 2025, it even won the award for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.” Mars and Gaga were also nominated for “Song of the Year” but didn’t ultimately win (that award went to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” ). [10] X Research source In addition, it won the Musa Awards’ “International Song of the Year” and “International Collaboration of the Year.” There are a few other smaller awards the song won as well. It won a “Top Ten International Gold Songs” plaque from RTHK and “International Collaboration of the Year” with the NRJ."
