      "content": "Consider the cause of your bacterial infection. There is not always a specific cause for BV or a yeast infection other than a bacterial imbalance. Trich is an STI that is caused by a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis . Most women have probably had at least one bacterial infection. The risk of getting BV increases with a new sexual partner (or multiple partners), douching, having sex without a condom, or using an intrauterine device (IUD) as a method of birth control. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source If you are diagnosed with trichomoniasis, you'll need to inform any sexual partners so they can be treated. Yeast infections and BV can be caused by antibiotic use. Antibiotics disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in your vagina which can allow \"bad\" bacteria or yeast to thrive. Other causes may include: wearing tight underwear or non-cotton panties (which can increase the temperature around the vagina and increase the moisture levels), a weakened immune system, using vaginal douches or perfumed feminine hygiene sprays, or vaginal trauma (scratches in the vagina caused by inserting objects like tampons or during rough sex). You should also tell any sexual partner about any vaginal infection, but you aren't required to."

See your doctor if you have any symptoms of a vaginal infection. Your doctor will prescribe a course of treatment, but if you don't notice an improvement after three days, have a fever, if the discharge symptoms worsen, or a new rash appears anywhere on your body contact your doctor. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that recurrent yeast infections can be a sign of a more serious underlying disorder such as diabetes, cancer or HIV-AIDs.

Since different types of vaginal infections are treated differently, it's critical to get the correct diagnosis from a doctor before you start any treatment. Usually, after your first vaginal infection, you'll be able to tell when you have an infection, but it's still important to find out the type of infection. Untreated or incorrectly treated bacterial infections can cause complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pre-term births and low-birth weight babies and can put a woman at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), chlamydia and gonorrhea. Untreated or incorrectly treated trichomoniasis infections can also lead to increased risk of HIV.

There are no known methods to reduce your risk of infection from douching. [12] X Research source Jenny L. Martino and Sten H. Vermund.

[17] X Research source The white underwear avoids irritants that may be in different dyes. Avoid underwear made with nylon, acetate or any synthetic fibers. You should also avoid wearing thong underwear which can irritate the genital area. Once you feel comfortable with the volume of your discharge, consider sleeping without underwear. This can be especially helpful for if you get recurrent BV. Avoid scratching or rubbing your genitals. Avoid wearing pantyhose. These trap heat and moisture which can allow bacteria, yeast and other organisms to thrive. Instead, wear nylons with a cotton panty insert."
