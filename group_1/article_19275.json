Although you can refill your supply of PokeCoins with real money, you can also earn them for free by leaving one of your Pokémon to defend a gym. Every hour they defend the gym earns you a set amount of PokéCoins. If your Pokémon stays in that gym for 8 hours and 30 minutes, you'll get 50 PokéCoins for free. If you have 3 or more Remote Raid Passes in your bag, you won't be able to get more."

Only 5 people can be in a lobby together who are raiding remotely, so if there are already 5 remote raiders there, you'll be added to a new lobby. Raid mechanics are the same for those who joined with a Remote Battle Pass and those who are physically at the Gym. However, attack power is decreased for Pokémon Trainers who join remotely versus the in-person Trainers. [2] X Research source You can only participate in a Remote Raid 5 times per day."
