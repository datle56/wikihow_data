Keep things fresh with your routine, conversations, date nights, and sex life to keep him stimulated. Shake things up by: Getting him a small gift when he’s not expecting one. Initiating sex in a new place or at a random time (the more variety with role playing, toys, and positions, the better!). Trying a new activity together, like a cooking class or a recreational sports team."

[2] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. The more topics you can cover with him, the better. Being able to engage with a wide variety of ideas is really engaging for a Gemini man. [3] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. Constant banter is a must. Gemini men are sharp and love somebody who’s quick on their (verbal) toes. Geminis are dual-minded about things. Asking him questions like “Do you prefer New York style or Chicago style pizza?” would be a very entertaining conversation for him (he’ll find a way to like both).

      "content": "Flirting isn’t just a phase for a Gemini man—he could do it forever. Keep flirting with him to prove you haven’t lost your interest. Innuendos, witty quips, and jokes are very arousing to him. His sign rules the shoulders, arms, and hands, so flirty touches on these parts will keep him absolutely crazy for you. Try recreating your first date or the time you first met. It’s a fun chance to look your best and re-seduce him all over again while making him nostalgic for you."

Spend some time apart and give him time to miss you. He’ll wonder what you’re up to (and will want to hear all about it next time you’re together).

      "content": "A Gemini man has a ton of friends and social circles to manage. He prefers to keep them separate from each other and his love life, so sometimes he’ll want to hang out with the guys without you. Let him go out without acting jealous or possessive—it’ll show you trust him and keep him coming back to you. [6] X Research source This doesn’t mean he’s losing interest in you! He values personal freedom and it’s in his nature to bounce around different social groups at a rapid pace. If a Gemini man feels that you’re acting jealous, he’ll get claustrophobic in the relationship. It’s important to give him some social breathing room. If you’d like to join him on more of his outings, start building up your social stamina now! It takes a lot of energy to sustain this guy’s social life."

      "content": "A Gemini guy doesn’t dwell on his negative feelings for long. When he’s in a funk, just hunker down and give him time to sort himself out. After a few minutes or hours, he’ll be back to his upbeat, refreshing self. Don’t press him to open up when he’s feeling down—he’ll let you in when he feels ready. If he’s distant during a mood swing, resist the urge to call and text him a bunch to check up on him. He’ll be moodier for longer if he feels closed in. There’s not much you can do to change a Gemini man’s sour mood. He’ll lighten up when he wants to (which is thankfully pretty quick)."

      "content": "When emotions run high, a Gemini man says ”bye!” He doesn’t see the use in dramatic arguments and needs the stability of a drama-free partner. Be straightforward, calm, and rational when you talk to him about your feelings. Big confrontations or mind games will destroy the fragile trust he has. This doesn’t mean you can’t express your feelings to him at all. Just tell him what you need in a tranquil, genuine way (think a soft tone, relaxed body language, and strong eye contact). Mind games or attempts at manipulation are useless against a Gemini. He’ll see through them immediately and might even turn them around against you."

That means Gemini men are great talkers and believe good communication is essential for a healthy relationship. If you have a problem with him, bring it up. He probably won’t realize he’s done something to annoy you and he’ll appreciate your direct approach. Make a comment on the spot when he says or does something to bug you, but don’t drag it out. Make your point to him and then let it go. Explain how you feel calmly and logically (he responds better to this than heavy emotional outbursts). A talk with a Gemini man always goes better in person. Try not to discuss important things over text or DM’s."

      "content": "Gemini men are easy-going guys that don’t like to be pushed into things. Enjoy your relationship with him as it is and try not to worry about what’s coming next (too much planning or talk about the future stresses a laidback Gemini out). Let the relationship follow its natural course—if it moves too fast, he’ll feel pressured to pull away. You might hit milestones slower than expected, but keep an open mind! The wait will be worth it when you realize what a secure relationship you’ve built. Too many expectations make him even more afraid to commit and might push him away instead of bringing him closer to you. Gemini men can be unpredictable in terms of what they want in a relationship. Remember that he’ll never do anything to intentionally hurt you."

      "content": "Geminis are the most indecisive and commitment-shy men of the zodiac. They fear feeling tied down and they struggle to stick to a decision long-term. Usually it’s because they don’t want to look too deeply into their own emotions (as air signs, they prefer to stay detached). Give him time to sort out his feelings. It takes a while for him to make a decision, but he’s in it for the long haul once he does. Look for signs he’s in love, even if he hasn’t said so yet. He’ll gush about you to everyone, dissect text messages, relive conversations, and talk about the little things you do like you walk on water.

      "content": "When you date the Twins, you take the good with the bad. On one hand, you get a fun-loving, energetic, charming intellectual, but on the other you get a moody, distant, distracted enigma. Accept his duality—it’s what makes him so dynamic. Attempts to change or chastise him can weaken his attachment to you. Gemini men are generally proud of who they are and respect themselves. Remember that a Gemini’s alternating moods usually aren’t because of you. It’s just a part of his natural cycle. When you make a Gemini man feel truly accepted and understood, you’ll be rewarded with mutual respect, fierce loyalty, and a fun-filled romance."
