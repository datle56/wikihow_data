      "content": "Change into an old t-shirt and put towels down. Just like the black dye will dye your hair, it will also dye your carpet and clothing. To avoid ruining your favorite clothing, put on an old t-shirt before you begin. Then, put old towels over your shoulders, on the counter, on the floor, and anywhere else you could possibly get dye!

      "content": "Mix up your dye. Put on a pair of plastic gloves, which will come in the box of hair dye. In a tub, mix up the developer and the dye with the provided dye brush. Make sure you stir everything together thoroughly so that the dye and developer are thoroughly blended."

      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly to the skin closest to your hairline. The downside about applying black dye to your hair is that it easily stains the skin. Instead of hurting your skin scrubbing the black stains, protect your skin by applying a layer of petroleum jelly around your hairline. This will create a barrier between the dye and your skin, and you can simply wipe away the jelly once you’re finished. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Begin applying the dye to your hair.",
      "content": "Begin applying the dye to your hair. Use the provided brush to put the dye on your hair. Then, use your gloved fingers to massage the dye into your hair. By using your hands, you can make sure that your hair is evenly coated and saturated. Do this for your entire head, from roots to tip. The beauty of black hair dye is that you aren’t in a rush to apply it and you can take your time to do it right. After all, the end result can’t get any darker! [3] X Research source You can use hair clips to section out your hair and work layer by layer, or you can apply the dye to your entire head of hair at once. It’s up to you and it depends on how much hair you have! Just make sure every piece is coated."

      "title": "Let the dye sit on your hair.",
      "content": "Let the dye sit on your hair. After you’ve covered every piece, let it soak into your hair. The box you purchased will have specific instructions. If you’re going to move around, clip it up or put it in a bun. This will help keep you from getting black dye all over everything while you wait! [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wash out the dye.",
      "content": "Wash out the dye. Once your dye is done processing, it’s time to rinse. Use cool water to rinse your hair while massaging it, just like you would with shampoo. Keep rinsing it until the water runs completely clear – this can take awhile! Once you’re sure all the dye is out, give your hair a little TLC and condition it. Shampoo can strip out some of the dye, but conditioner will not."

      "content": "Limit your washes. Every time you wash your hair, you will rinse a bit of the dye out. In order to keep your hair as black as you want it, try not to wash it more than you absolutely need to. Clip up your hair or cover it with a shower cap when you shower, and use combat grease in between washes. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse your hair with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse your hair with cold water. When you do have to wash your hair, use cold water. It might sound unpleasant, but it will help your color last longer. Hot water will cause the cuticle of the hair to open, which is where the black pigment is. In other words, hot water will make your hair actually release the dye. By using cold water, the cuticle of your hair will stay sealed and hold onto the black dye. [6] X Research source"

When you notice this happening, it’s time to repeat the process! Grab another box of black hair dye and give your color a boost. To maintain a dark black, you will need to re-dye your hair every couple of weeks."
