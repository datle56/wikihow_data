      "content": "Start with the combination dial. The face of a combination lock is a circular, rotatable dial. Numbers are written around the circumference, usually beginning with 0 at the top and increasing as you go around the dial clockwise. Aside from physically breaking into the safe (which is very hard to do), correctly inputting a series of numbers into the combination dial is the only way to open a safe."

      "title": "Know how the spindle works.",
      "content": "Know how the spindle works. This is a small, simple cylinder attached to the combination dial. When you rotate the dial, the spindle rotates as well. The spindle and other parts are not visible even with the safe door open."

      "title": "Know how the drive cam is connected to the spindle.",
      "content": "Know how the drive cam is connected to the spindle. Located on the far end of the spindle (opposite the combination dial), this circular object is threaded onto the spindle and rotates with it. [1] X Research source A small drive pin extending from the drive cam serves to catch against the wheels (see below) and set them rotating."

      "title": "Understand a safe's wheels.",
      "content": "Understand a safe's wheels. Also called tumblers [2] X Research source , these circular objects encircle the spindle but are not attached to them. They must be caught by the drive pin in order to rotate. A combination lock has one wheel for each number in its combination (typically 2–6). For instance, a lock with a 3-number combination (e.g. 25-7-14) has three wheels. Knowing how many wheels there are is important for cracking the safe, but there are ways to discover this number without knowing the combination (see later parts). Small tabs on the wheel called the wheel fly catch against the drive pin or next wheel and sets them rotating. This term is not important to remember for this guide; just know that the drive cam makes contact with the wheels to set them spinning."

      "title": "Visualize the fence.",
      "content": "Visualize the fence. The fence is a small rod resting gently atop the wheels. [3] X Research source (It does not prevent them from turning.) The fence is connected to a lever mechanism responsible for keeping the safe shut. As long as the fence remains in place, the safe is locked. Older texts may refer to this as lock drop , drop-pawl , or dog [4] X Research source (an obsolete term for any object that holds or blocks another)."

      "title": "Understand how wheel notches come into play.",
      "content": "Understand how wheel notches come into play. Each wheel has a notch (also called a gate ) at one point along its circumference. When each wheel is rotated so the notch is at the top, the fence falls into those notches. The lever moves, and the door mechanism is unlocked. You can see why there is one wheel for each combination number. When you dial the first number, the first wheel is rotated to a position with its notch directly below the fence. You then reverse the direction of your rotation to disengage with that wheel and turn the next to its correct position. The drive cam also has a notch for different reasons. The intended purpose is not important to know for this guide, but remember that this notch will \"click\" every time it slips past the lever (stationary part attached to the fence). (Extra information for the curious: once the fence falls and releases the locking mechanism, the drive cam notch catches onto the bolt physically blocking the door and pulls it out of the way.)

Placing the stethoscope in both ears and the bell end against the safe wall amplifies the sounds you're listening for. The mechanism you're listening to is located directly behind the dial, but obviously you cannot cover up the dial since you'll need to turn it. Try moving the stethoscope between different spots adjacent to the dial as you spin the combination until you find the most audible location. Metal safes reverberate the sounds and make them easier to hear. These are a good choice for a beginning hobbyist."

      "content": "Rotate the dial counterclockwise and listen carefully for two clicks near each other. Rotate slowly and be ready to note the dial positions. One click will be fainter than the other, since the notch making the sound is sloped toward one side. You're listening for the sound the drive cam notch makes when it slides under the lever arm [6] X Research source (see Learn How a Combination Lock Functions). Each side of the notch \"clicks\" as the lever passes by. The drive cam's contact area is the name of the area on the dial face between these two clicks."

Each of these points corresponds with a correct number in the combination. You should know how many numbers there are in the combination, either because you've used this safe previously or because you followed the instructions for Find the Combination Length. If the quantity of converging points on the graph doesn't match the quantity of numbers in the combination, make a new graph and see which points are consistently narrow."

Remember to attempt to pull open the safe door after each complete combination! You don't want to be absent-minded and move on to the next combination before checking for success. Remember to reset the dial between each attempt by spinning it several times. If your dial has more than 2 or 3 wheels, you'll probably want to write down each combination in advance and cross them out as you go."

      "content": "Try combinations using adjacent numbers if the safe won't open. Most safes allow for a 1 or 2 number margin of error while dialing, which is why you only needed to test every 3rd number. It's possible your safe is more exact, especially if it is more expensive. For example, if the digits you wrote down are 3, 42, and 66, you'll need to try every combination of [2, 3, or 4] + [41, 42, or 43] + [65, 66, or 67]. Don't get confused and start testing combinations like (41, 42, 65); each combination should contain exactly one number from each bracketed trio. This is really only practical for a 3 digit combination or less (requiring a maximum of 162 attempts). For a 4-digit combination, the number balloons to a maximum of 1,944 attempts. This is still much faster than trying every possible combination, but will waste a lot of time if it turns out you made an error in your cracking attempt."
