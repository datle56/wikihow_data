[1] X Research source You can evolve a Magnemite into a Magneton by raising it to level 30, or you can catch Magnetons at various locations in your game. Magneton will need to be level 99 or lower. Level 100 Pokémon cannot evolve, since evolving happens during the level up process and 100 is the max. If you're playing HeartGold or SoulSilver, you can get a Magnezone by trading to Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, evolving it in that game, and then trading it back. See the next section for details."
