      "content": "Don't be too hard on yourself. You may be crushed when you hear that you have to repeat a grade, but it's not the end of the world! Try your best not to feel bad about yourself because of it. If you have a good attitude about it and use it as motivation to do better in school, being held back may actually do you a lot of good. Being held back does not mean that you are stupid or a bad student. It simply means that you need some more time to reach the benchmarks of that specific grade. Remember that your parents and teachers decided to hold you back because they want what's best for you, not because they want to punish you. If you become withdrawn in school because you feel bad about repeating a grade, you're likely to do worse. [1] X Research source This is why it's so important to stay positive and motivated."

      "content": "Decide how you will tell people. Eventually you will have to tell your friends that you are being held back. Think about whether you want to tell them in person or by phone or social media. The right decision for you will depend on the relationship you have with your friends. Your classmates may pick on you for having to repeat a grade, but try not to let it bother you. Decide what you will say to negative people ahead of time so it will be easier to keep your composure. Think about saying something like, \"I just need some extra time to work on math. It's really no big deal.\" It may help to approach the subject casually. The less upset you are about it, the less likely people are to give you a hard time about it."

Make an effort to spend time with close friends outside of school. If you believe your old friends caused you to be held back a grade, it's best to distance yourself from them and spend more time with friends who encourage you to do well in school."
