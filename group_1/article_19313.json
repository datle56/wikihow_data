      "content": "Vacuum beetles up using a hose attachment to handle a swarm. This is probably the best way to get rid of an infestation. If you stumble across a large number of lady beetles, grab your vacuum and use the hose attachment to suck them up. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter if you have one, as this will keep the bugs from crawling back out. Once you’ve sucked the beetles up, release them outside. [1] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source This is also a great way to suck the bugs out if you can’t really reach them. Lady beetles like to hide in hard-to-reach areas like crawl spaces, attics, and behind drywall to stay warm. The beetles aren’t actually bad for the environment, and they don’t damage homes where they set up shop for the winter. If you can, release the bugs outside without killing them."

      "content": "Catch and release individual beetles outside for a nonlethal option. The beetles only bite if they think they’re being attacked, so just slide a piece of paper underneath them and take them out the window. You can even grab a broom and a dustpan and gently sweep them up before releasing them outside. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Asian lady beetles are beneficial insects—they control aphids and other nuisance pests. Letting them live is ideal, even if you don’t want them around your home. [3] X Research source Avoid squishing the beetles! They release a stinky pheromone and leave behind stains."

      "title": "Use a light trap to attract and capture these bugs outside.",
      "content": "Use a light trap to attract and capture these bugs outside. The beetles are attracted to light, so purchase a light trap designed for beetles. These are different from the bug zapper you might be picturing. These are just one-way live traps that emit light that you’ll probably need to buy online. At night, hang the trap in whatever area the bugs are in and empty it out in the morning. [4] X Research source If the bugs are outside swarming against your vinyl siding, hang the light in your garden away from your home. Bug bombs do not work with the Asian lady beetles, so don’t bother fogging your home."

This non-toxic and natural insecticide will dehydrate the bugs and kill them. Pour the earth in and around any gaps where you’ve found the beetles. You can even line your baseboards to keep them from creeping around. [5] X Research source You can also pour diatomaceous earth around the perimeter of your home to keep lady beetles and other pests away. Make sure that you use the insecticide version of diatomaceous earth, not the food-grade version. It will say which kind of diatomaceous earth it is in on the label."

You can use rubbing alcohol or white vinegar instead of dish soap if you prefer. Spritz any bugs that you come across and they may die. [6] X Research source If they don’t die, this may work to keep the bugs from advancing any further."

[9] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Unfortunately, these insecticides are toxic. They can damage your skin and they’re lung irritants. Wear a dust mask and gloves when using them and clean any surface you spray thoroughly after you discard the dead bugs. [10] X Research source It may be tempting to empty an insecticide into a crack in the wall where the bugs are coming out, but it’s unlikely to have a positive impact. The dead beetles may also attract other bugs, so leaving them in your wall may not work out so well.

On top of that, they have access to commercial insecticides and tools that you won’t be able to use. If you really want to get rid of a large number of lady beetles, this is the way to go. [12] X Research source Asian lady beetles hibernate high off of the ground wherever they can find warmth. As such, they’ll often dig their way into crawl spaces, attics, and gaps in walls on the second and third floors of buildings. If possible, try to find an exterminator who has experience working with Asian lady beetles. These bugs haven’t been around the US for very long."

[13] X Research source If you have a garden, the Asian lady beetles are good for your plants!

Follow the directions on the label, put on protective gear, and spray the sides of your home to keep the beetles out. The lady beetles will look for somewhere else to hibernate for the winter. This is a good option if it’s impossible to seal up your home because it’s very old or you have major repairs to make. The lady beetles prefer unshaded walls that get a lot of sun. If your home is especially large, at least cover the western and southern exterior walls."

Making your home look more uniform may keep them from showing up. If your exterior is dark, use dark blinds and get rid of bright fixtures and lawn ornaments. If your exterior is lighter, use lighter shades and avoid any colorful flags or features. [17] X Research source If you want to focus specifically on modifying one part of your home, focus on the southwestern side of the building. This side will get more sun and the beetles are generally attracted to sunny areas."

The lady beetles also often have a white M-shape on top of their head. Finally, the dots on a lady bug are usually uniform, while the lady beetles have all kinds of different spots—some will even have zero dots at all! [18] X Research source If the bug is in your house, it’s probably a lady beetle. Lady bugs don’t want to be inside of your house, while lady beetles will try to seek shelter when it starts to get cold out. Asian lady beetles are also known as Asian lady bugs or multi-colored lady beetles. They’re all the same thing, though."

For one, the bugs only bite if they think they’re being attacked. On top of that, they’ll release a nasty odor when you crush them, and they’ll stain whatever surface you crush them on. As tempting as it may be, do not stomp on the beetles than wander into your home.

If you’re getting close to Asian lady beetles, put on a dust mask and wear long sleeves. The vast majority of the time, these bugs are harmless, but they can bite if they get nervous, and they release an obnoxious pheromone when they’re disturbed. Some folks are allergic to this pheromone, so gear up just to be safe! [20] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Most people will just be annoyed by the smell. Allergic reactions are rare and unlikely to be serious (it’s usually just sinus and skin irritation). Still, better safe than sorry! The bite isn’t dangerous, although it might be alarming. Many people compare it to a small pinprick. You can prevent the bites by wearing long sleeves and gloves. Also, wear clothes that you don’t mind throwing in the wash. These bugs can leave yellow stains behind, and you may need to wash your clothes if they rub against you. [21] X Research source"
