      "content": "Choose your outfit . Your outfit will depend on the type of dance. If it's a themed dance (ex: Halloween), go with the costume theme. If there isn't one, decide on a theme with or without your friends. If it's an informal dance, we don’t recommend you show up in a t shirt and jeans. Although you may be tempted to, stick with a nice top (ex: blouse), a nice pair of pants - other than jeans - or a nice skirt, make sure the skirt isn't too short! Don't go overboard with informal dances, as no one would expect you to come in a dress. If it is a semi-formal dance, it is recommended that you choose a slightly dressier shirt, a nicer pair of pants (ex: dress pants) or a nicer skirt, and an appropriate accessory (ex: hair flower) with comfortable flats. If it is a formal dance, wear a very nice shirt and skirt, or a dress that isn't too fancy with leggings. For formal dances, it is more appropriate to wear a bow and nice dress shoes than it would be for other dances. Generally, most formal gowns will do, but if you are planning to dance a lot, choose a dress that is not strapless and has no train. Cute earrings are recommended for all the dances listed above. Make sure you have shoes appropriate for dancing that are in very good condition. Sneakers that are frayed, dirty, and worn out are not recommended, as they will ruin your appearance and look embarrassing!"

Once you're done, wrap yourself up in a towel. Wait 20 minutes, then take a hot bath and you can use a bath bomb ."

You don't need to be embarrassed about body hair - everyone has it and you're beautiful with or without it! If you are wearing sandals, try to scrub your feet to get all the dead skin off ."

By now, you should be using a cleanser , moisturizer, and sunscreen on your face every day to prevent pimples from breaking out on your face. If you do this loyally every day, the above isn't necessary unless you have a few pimples on your face. Don't forget to rinse very well with lukewarm water."

If your hair is short, just leave it that way or give it a cut. If it's a bit longer then grab some hair gel and bring it to the front, or the side. It would be nice."

      "content": "Do your makeup! Eyeshadow , mascara, blush , concealer, lip gloss , etc. Be careful of over-applying, for no one wants to dance with a clown. They want to dance with the real you (see tips)! Makeup should add a soft glow to your face, not add color. Try to make it look natural; use only a little and gently rub it in to let it blend. Also, balance your make-up. If you use bold lipstick, keep your eyeshadow weak, etc. Be careful of the color shades you use; stick with light shades. Using the wrong colors will make you look like a rainbow thrown upon your face. Avoid using makeup to cover any pimples, as this will only worsen their condition and make them more obvious."

If you have your hair dyed or have streaks, be sure to get your hair done and dyed the night before. Even if you dye your hair, you may still want to go to a hairstylist and get it trimmed and brushed out, and get your hair washed with the fancy and expensive shampoos. Make sure to put gel in it when you're done. Instead of putting your hair up in that messy bun or ponytail, add a little special touch to it for this particular night. You could add a small braid in your hair with that ponytail or bun and even make the messy bun a neat bun for tonight. You could try a new hairstyle that suits your face (it is recommended you try wearing the new hairstyle for a week before the dance so you know whether it fits you or not), but make sure it suits the dance!"

If it's an informal dance, wear a nice graphic tee, nice jeans or pants, and nice sneakers or slips. In general, dressing out a little bit more than the dress code calls for looks good at these dances. If it's a semi-formal dance, wear nice black jeans or dress pants, and a plaid or solid-colored button-up shirt. In this situation, it looks good to under-do the dress code a bit, but don't go too far. If it's a formal dance, wear a button-up shirt with a tie, or even a tux, with nice dress pants and dress shoes. Try a tuxedo with a tie or a bow tie . Get a flower on the side of your tux or on your wrist to give to your date/partner once they arrive."

If you have a nice scent of shower gel, take a hot bath with the gel mixed into the water. Do this after the shower, you don't want to be bathing in dirty water."
