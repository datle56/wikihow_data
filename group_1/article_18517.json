      "title": "Clever.",
      "content": "Clever. Gemini is a total brainiac, and possibly the zodiac’s sharpest sign. They seem to know something about everything. Listening to Gemini is like enjoying an educational podcast, so recline and enjoy the ride. And Gemini’s brain isn’t just powerful—it’s quick. Gemini seems to move at the speed of light. As this air sign moves through their life’s path and encounters new knots and gnarls, they’ll handle every curveball with grace. And if you find yourself doubting your friendly neighborhood Gemini, we’d advise against it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curious.",
      "content": "Curious. Curiosity defines Gemini. People, places, ideas…everything fascinates this air sign. This hunger for knowledge carries Gemini through life, from one interest to the next. This is part of what makes Gemini beautiful and genuine—when they listen to you, they’re really listening. How do you know? Gemini is hanging onto your every word, because they see everything as endlessly interesting. Which in turn, makes them the most interesting people of all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Funny.",
      "content": "Funny. Gemini is playful and quick, which makes them a natural comic. When you hang out with Gemini, you better bring your best stuff. Their personality is a perfect storm for “funny:” Gemini is sharp enough to land one-liners, but they don’t take themselves too seriously. So the banter’s always witty and impressions are on point. Gemini stays surrounded by a gaggle of friends who love to laugh. This air sign keeps you in stitches, 24/7—who wouldn’t love company like that?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Friendly.",
      "content": "Friendly. Gemini is sunshine personified. All by your lonesome in the corner of a party? When Gemini spots you, they’ll come bounding over to say hello. At first meeting, you’ll feel like you could talk to Gemini for hours—and you might even end up spilling a secret or two. This sign is an amazing friend, and they want to be friends with everyone. That’s Gemini’s superpower; they could make conversation with a brick wall. They’re the world’s BFF."
    },
    {
      "title": "Versatile.",
      "content": "Versatile. Gemini is a shapeshifter. Their symbol is the twin, which is fitting because Gemini feels like more than one person. In any city, in any job, with any friend group, Gemini finds a way to fit right in. In fact, Gemini is so adaptable, they actually crave change. Spend too long committed to just one thing, and Gemini will feel a strong urge to bolt. In this way, Gemini’s malleability is their gift…and their curse."
    },
    {
      "title": "Great communicator.",
      "content": "Great communicator. Gemini is a smooth talker and a great listener. They’re ruled by Mercury, which means that they have a special way with words. Gemini has a rep for being super talkative, but it’s more than that—communication is a two-way street. Gemini isn’t just a gifted speaker, but also, they understand how to make others feel heard. In conversation with Gemini, you’ll always manage to get in deep, even if you just met. Gemini knows how to ask all the right questions. They’re masters of connection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flighty, fickle, and afraid of emotion.",
      "content": "Flighty, fickle, and afraid of emotion. But for Gemini, it’s not always a walk in the park. Gemini might have a hard time feeling comfortable in serious relationships. This is, in part, because they constantly crave new scenery (and people), which makes it difficult for them to truly choose one person, and even harder to stick around for the long haul. Plus, Gemini’s biggest fear is actually themselves—if their emotions are too heavy, they hide them away. This can distance them from others even further, so Gemini would do well to try and open up a little."

      "title": "Attracting a Gemini",
      "content": "Attracting a Gemini How can you make this dazzling wordsmith yours for good? We have a few tricks you can try. If you’re looking to make an impression: Banter. Gemini wants to know that you can keep up. They only have time for the most entertaining company, so prove that that’s you. Write them a letter. Words are Gemini’s thing. A love letter is their dream show of affection, so it’s a great bet if you’re working to get their attention. Ask follow-up questions. Gemini’s likely to bring up all kinds of funky subjects in conversation. Gemini respects curiosity, so always ask them to tell you more. Say yes . Should we jump in the ocean? Yes. Should we go to this underground concert? Yes. The more open you are, the more Gemini will love you. Ditch the possessiveness. Gemini wants to do what Gemini wants to do, and if you show your crush that you love that independence, Gemini will be starry-eyed."

      "content": "Signs that a Gemini likes you Gemini isn’t a tough nut to crack, but still, it can be hard to know for sure if this air sign’s crushing on you. Luckily, we’ve pulled together a few telltale signs: They invite you everywhere. Gemini’s always on the go with a crowd of pals, and that’ll never stop. But if they always want you there too, that’s a good sign. They laugh at your jokes. Gemini will laugh at anything—but they’ll only really lose it when someone’s truly hilarious (and they love funny people!). They’re happy hanging 1:1. Gemini loves their circle of friends, so if they’re happy with just your company, that’s telling. Sparks might be flying! They tell you you’re smart. To Gemini, this is the highest compliment. If they think that you’re clever and interesting, that’s a big deal. They open up about deeper feelings. Sound the alarms! This definitely sounds like a crush. Gemini has a really hard time expressing themselves—if they do it for you, that’s meaningful."

      "title": "What it’s like to date a Gemini",
      "content": "What it’s like to date a Gemini Gemini is a non-stop joyride. You’ll laugh harder than you ever have, learn more than you thought you could, and just generally, have a blast. This sign will make you feel supported and understood, and they’ll open up your world to fascinating, new experiences. All in all, dating Gemini is life-changing and lovely. Date night: A friend of a friend's party. A stimulating book reading. A lively improv show. An activity Gemini's been dying to try, like axe-throwing. Downside: Gemini feels restless in love, and because of this, they’ll fight deeper connections. Sharing heavy emotions, making major commitments, and even a simple, romantic date might feel like pulling teeth. Gemini, you know that to fall in love, you actually have to stick it out, right? Take a chance!"

      "title": "Gemini & Gemini.",
      "content": "Gemini & Gemini. This relationship absolutely sparkles. Imagine spending your whole life jumping from one thing to the next, always wanting more: more excitement, more banter, more of a challenge. Then one day, you meet someone who changes everything. They’re as smart as you, as energetic, as curious, and as fun—that’s how it feels when two Geminis connect. Plus, Geminis are trained to make others feel special. Finally, when Gemini falls in love with another Gemini, it’ll be their turn. Emotional communication, though, could be hit or miss. Geminis hate to dive into the emotional deep end, and together, they may constantly choose to put feelings on the back burner. They’ll both need to be proactive (and a little brave!)."

      "title": "Gemini & Aquarius.",
      "content": "Gemini & Aquarius. Gemini and Aquarius are all about freedom, intellect, and growth, which is exactly why they make such a great pair. When Aquarius meets Gemini, they’ll be fascinated—who’s this stunning socialite who actually, gulp, might be as smart as them? And Gemini will love hanging out with the ever-interesting Aquarius, maybe as a friend at first…but over time, an earth-shattering connection’s sure to bloom. These two really get each other deep down. Aquarius and Gemini will have tons of fun and feel intellectually stimulated, but where’s the romance? Between these two, it’ll brew eventually, but someone will have to act outside of their comfort zone."

    {
      "title": "Gemini & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Gemini & Sagittarius. It’s a joyride, a jamboree, a Gemini-Sagittarius romance. The energy and fun is off the charts, with Sagittarius dragging Gemini on outdoor adventures and Gemini bringing Sag to every gallery in the city. These two will be surprised by just how much they love learning from their partner—in this romance, both signs are inspired to grow. For these flighty, freedom-loving signs, it might be short-lived. But one thing’s for sure: Sag and Gemini will be changed for the better. If long-term love is the goal though, these two will face a few hurdles. The compatibility here is stellar, but both partners will need to buck up and face their commitment phobia."

      "title": "Gemini & Libra.",
      "content": "Gemini & Libra. These are the two coolest people you know. They’re interesting, they’re charming, and they seem to know everyone. When Gemini and Libra connect, they’ll run their social circles—and more importantly, they’ll have a ball doing it. Their high compatibility also stems from a strong intellectual bond. They’ll debate everything under the sun, and be all smiles all the while. Libra will admire Gemini’s sociability, and love watching them make a new BFF on every night they spend out together. Gemini, though, has a little more of a spontaneous, untraditional edge than their Libra partner. Gemini wants to feed their unquenchable curiosity, but Libra is motivated a little more by status. When Gemini randomly wants to attend an underground punk show in the city, Libra might think, “Sorry, what?” They’ll have to compromise and communicate."

      "title": "Gemini & Pisces.",
      "content": "Gemini & Pisces. This relationship is filled with magic. The curiosity and openness between these two signs is unbelievable, so this connection will be a soft fantasy in pastel colors. From picnics in the meadow to giggling under a blanket fort, you can trust that this love is one sweet treat. Plus, both of these signs are incredible, supportive friends, so the foundation here will be filled with kindness and genuine care. A Gemini-Pisces relationship gets two thumbs up from us! But go too far into the clouds, and you might risk losing the ground beneath you. Gemini and Pisces will find it easy to forget about the world together, which will be fun—but eventually, this dynamic could become unsustainable. They’ll need to look out for this."

      "title": "Gemini & Aries.",
      "content": "Gemini & Aries. This is the power couple who actually knows how to have fun. When someone’s a big success, you might expect them to be serious or stuffy. But Aries and Gemini know how to command a room with spirit and verve—not a stiff arm. They’re each a cross between camp counselor and motivational speaker, and together, they’ll love learning new skills, rising the ranks at work, and convincing their friends to join them on wacky adventures. The fun and mutual admiration here is off the charts, which can fuel a strong romance. But when the lights fade, what’s left? If Aries and Gemini can’t learn to slow down and communicate, they might focus too much on fun and success, and not enough on truly connecting. Reader Poll: We asked 367 wikiHow readers what kissing style they enjoy from a Gemini Man, and 50% of them said passionate and sensual. [Take Poll] Maybe they were born under the passionate sign of Aries!"

      "title": "Gemini & Leo.",
      "content": "Gemini & Leo. Leo just wants to be adored, and Gemini is up to the task. Gemini wants a brainy BFF with benefits, and Leo fits the bill. This relationship is all about fun: it’ll be dance parties, karaoke nights, and theme parties galore. If these two can learn to truly accept each other, there’s not much that can stop them. Communication is easy, the connection is sparkling, and compatibility is strong. But, it might not be so simple… Leo is a fixed sign, and Gemini, mutable. Gemini is expansive, always looking for ways to grow and change. Leo likes things they can rely on, so Gemini’s transformations might spook them, leaving Leo to feel uncertain. This dynamic will call for both partners to make adjustments."

      "title": "Gemini & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Gemini & Scorpio. These two might look at opposites at first glance, and in a way they are. Scorpio is intense and serious. Gemini is lighthearted and playful. But dig a little deeper, and you’ll find compelling compatibilities—Gemini and Scorpio are both intellects capable of creating mesmerizing conversation. Gemini and Scorpio are both extremely open people, and fascinated by the peripheries of life. There will definitely be an attraction. But whether or not this will be a foundation for something great (or the beginning of something doomed) is up to them. Scorpio will want Gemini to be authentic with them, but Gemini hates to be pressured into anything. Conflict could break out (continuously) if these two aren’t able to find a comfortable middle ground."

      "title": "Gemini & Virgo.",
      "content": "Gemini & Virgo. Virgo is a beautiful grump who expects the worst in everyone. To Gemini, life is sunshine and people deserve the benefit of the doubt. You wouldn’t expect a relationship here, but when it happens, it’s surprisingly special. There’s a balance that Virgo and Gemini will strike, with Gemini warming Virgo’s heart and Virgo, white-knighting Gemini with their whole heart. They have so much to learn from each other, and if they find love, it’ll be lovely. But will they? That’s the question. For them to find this dreamy romance, first they’ll have to give one another a true shot, and most of the time, neither is the other’s natural first choice. But we’re all rooting for them. Come on, Gemini and Virgo—lean in!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Gemini & Cancer.",
      "content": "Gemini & Cancer. There’s definitely a strong attraction here. Gemini will love Cancer’s sweet demeanor and Cancer will admire Gemini’s warmth. The first time they meet, it’s likely to be a long, generous conversation spanning from childhood to that morning’s breakfast. Still, long-term compatibility could be a struggle, because Cancer leads so completely with the heart, and Gemini, with the head. Communication might feel like pulling teeth. Plus, where Gemini wants freedom, Cancer wants commitment. These two should check the rest of their charts (especially Mercury and Venus) to get a clearer picture. If Gemini has a heavy water presence on their chart and if Cancer has Earth or air signs, this could still work well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gemini & Taurus.",
      "content": "Gemini & Taurus. Gemini is always out and about, soaking up new experiences. Taurus prefers a quiet day at home, enjoying life’s comforts. These two are very different, and so finding a healthy groove could be a struggle. Gemini will need to lean in and compromise because Taurus dreams of a sweet romance. Taurus, on the other hand, will have to find a way to give Gemini the freedom they crave—and you can trust that Taurus will have trouble releasing the reigns. Is all hope lost? Of course not. Though these two sun signs aren’t super compatible, in romance, Mercury and Venus are probably more important. Gemini and Taurus should check their charts to get a clearer picture. Then, remember that in any relationship, communication and compromise is key!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Gemini & Capricorn.",
      "content": "Gemini & Capricorn. Uh oh, this one might be a struggle. The average Gemini will find Capricorn boring and predictable. Cap, on the other hand, won’t be impressed by Gemini’s laissez fare attitude. Their values are at odds: Gemini believes in openness, spontaneity, and making life fun. Capricorn believes in tradition, a careful plan, and working towards a brighter future. Ironically, they’d actually have a lot to offer each other—Gemini potentially easing Cap’s anxieties, and Capricorn, inspiring Gemini to stick with things for longer. But these two are unlikely to make it that far, and if they do, there will still be challenges ahead. We’d suggest they check the rest of their chart to get a better idea, because sun signs really aren’t everything. If Cap has more playful placements (like Sagittarius, Pisces, or Aries) and Gemini has some more routine-oriented ones (Capricorn, Virgo, Scorpio), this could be a game changer."
