Look through the hair of any other adults or children in your household for active lice or small, dark eggs (also known as nits). It’s important to treat anyone who may have lice to keep them from spreading and to keep them from coming back.

      "content": "If none of the lice are dead, talk to your doctor. Give your lice treatment plenty of time to work its magic. After about 8 hours, inspect your scalp for dead lice. If the lice are alive but moving more slowly, don’t retreat your hair. The medicine may just need some more time to kill them. If you see lice that appear to be unharmed, then your treatment may not have been effective, which isn’t uncommon. Contact your doctor and they’ll be able to recommend another treatment or prescribe medication to help you get rid of the lice.

Just keep using the treatments and talk to your doctor if you're struggling to get rid of them. However, if you already sport fairly short hair, getting it clipped a little shorter to help get rid of lice faster isn't a bad idea."
