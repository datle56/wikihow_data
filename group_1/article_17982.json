Unfold the paper so it’s flat again and rotate it to the right by 90 degrees. Fold the new top edge of the paper to the bottom to crease it and then flatten it out again. Your paper will have 4 lines intersecting in the middle. [2] X Research source Make sure you’re folding so that the creases all remain on the same side. The raised edges should all be on one side of the paper, while the indents should all remain on the other."
