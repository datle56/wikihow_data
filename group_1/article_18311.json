      "content": "Make the dipping sauce. Traditionally, pot stickers are served with a delicious dipping sauce. The sauce is usually made up of a mixture of 2/3 soy sauce, 1/3 Chinese rice vinegar, fresh grated or chopped bottled or pickled ginger, and sesame oil, often with a garnish of chopped chives. [2] X Research source If you like it spicy, add Chinese chili paste to taste."

      "content": "Pour two tablespoons of oil into the pan or wok. The type of oil you use is up to you. For a more authentic Chinese recipe, use sesame or peanut oil. You can also use vegetable or olive oil if you prefer. For the healthiest option, use olive oil (it has the highest amount of heart-healthy fat--monounsaturated fat--of any oil.) Heat the oil for about a minute (bubbles might begin to form). [3] X Research source You can also use hot vegetable or canola oil."

      "content": "Place the pot stickers in the pan. You must make sure that there is enough space between each pot sticker and that they are not overlapping at all. If they overlap while cooking, it will be nearly impossible to separate them without ripping them (and having all the delicious filling fall out). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Add roughly three tablespoons of water to the pan or wok. Immediately after pouring the water in, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. The steam created by the water will cook the dumplings all the way through. Using a lid that doesnâ€™t let any air out is important--if steam escapes, the pot stickers will take longer to cook or may overcook and become gooey. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Steam the dumplings until all of the water is gone. You'll start to hear crackling sounds, and the pot stickers will again begin to turn a golden-brown color. Traditionally it is advised not to rotate the dumplings, instead only allowing the bottom to brown. [7] X Research source If you like them well browned, gently lift and turn them with a spatula to brown the sides. If you want them to be even crunchier, take the lid off and cook the dumplings on medium-high."
