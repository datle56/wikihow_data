      "title": "Let the cheese come to room temperature on the counter.",
      "content": "Let the cheese come to room temperature on the counter. Camembert cheese tastes the best at room temperature, not straight from the refrigerator. Take it out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you want to eat it so it has time to warm up."

      "title": "Slice the cheese into wedges.",
      "content": "Slice the cheese into wedges. To cut up Camembert, cut it into wedges like you would a pizza. It's easiest to cut from the center using a sharp cheese knife. [1] X Research source A cheese knife has holes in the blade so the cheese doesn't stick. However, any sharp knife will do."

      "title": "Taste the rind to see if you like it.",
      "content": "Taste the rind to see if you like it. The rind on Camembert is safe to eat, but it can have a pretty strong flavor. It's really up to you whether you eat the rind with the cheese or not, so just give it a taste. [2] X Research source Try a slice that includes the rind and one that doesn't. If you don't like the rind, simply slice it off and just eat the inside of the cheese."

      "title": "Enjoy your Camembert with crackers or bread and preserves or honey.",
      "content": "Enjoy your Camembert with crackers or bread and preserves or honey. Cut off slices of the cheese and use a knife to spread it on the cracker or a slice of French bread. Eat it as is, or add a little honey or preserves on top. Try whatever jams or preserves you enjoy, such as raspberry, cherry, fig, or apricot. You could also add a slice of fresh peach, pear, or apple in place of the preserves."

      "title": "Eat the cheese within a couple of days of cutting into the rind.",
      "content": "Eat the cheese within a couple of days of cutting into the rind. While Camembert will still remain safe to eat after this time, it's flavor will start to deteriorate after you cut into the rind. The rind acts as a protective barrier for the cheese, keeping it tasty and fresh. [3] X Research source Before you cut into the rind, Camembert will usually keep for 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator and 6 months or longer in the freezer. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Bake the cheese",
      "content": "Bake the cheese in its wooden box for easy warmed-up cheese. Remove the cheese from the box and take any wrappings off. Set the cheese back in the box bottom, and place it on a baking sheet without the lid on it. Heat the cheese in the oven for 10 minutes at 400 °F (204 °C). After 10 minutes, make sure the cheese has melted before pulling it out of the oven. [5] X Research source Try dipping toasted pieces of bread in the cheese for a delicious snack."

      "content": "Melt Camembert in coals if you are grilling. If you've heated up the grill for dinner, cook Camembert in the coals for an appetizer or dessert. Wrap the Camembert tightly in foil, then set it in the hot coals for about 20-30 minutes. Use tongs to remove it, then set it back in the original wooden wheel it came in. As an accompaniment, you can heat up freshly made garlic bread in foil alongside the cheese."

      "content": "Sear ham-wrapped Camembert in a skillet for a tasty meal. Cover the Camembert with several slices of thin ham, making sure the whole thing is enveloped in several layers of the ham. Heat up a skillet with a little butter or olive oil in it. Place the Camembert in the skillet, and sear both sides of the ham and cheese wedge. Once the cheese has been in the skillet for a few minutes on both sides, it should be nice and melted on the inside. Serve the cheese with bread or crackers."

Cut up a few apple or pear slices, and sprinkle on a small handful of pecans or walnuts. You can even add a few sliced onions for a flavorful finish. For dressing, add a simple vinaigrette or even a honey mustard."

      "content": "Melt Camembert into your favorite carb-heavy recipes. Use Camembert as a substitute for cream or milk. For instance, melt it into pasta dishes, including mac and cheese or a simple mushroom and Camembert pasta. [6] X Research source You can also use it in mashed potatoes; just add room-temperature Camembert before you mash them. For these dishes, it's best to cut the rind off and just use the inside part of the cheese if you want it to become part of the sauce."
