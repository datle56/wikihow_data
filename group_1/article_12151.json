      "content": "Make a balloon arch for an attractive entryway decoration. Purchase a balloon arch kit to easily make your base, or cut a long piece of wire with wire cutters to make your own. Put the base into position wherever you’d like in the room. Tie 2 balloons together at the tails, and attach the pair of balloons with another pair to form a cluster. Tie the cluster of balloons onto your balloon arch using fishing line, and continue to fill the arch with clusters of balloons until it is completely covered. [1] X Research source This creates a festive archway or accent piece. Use balloons in your color scheme so everything matches. For instance, if throwing a party for a young boy, use red, blue, and green."

      "content": "Secure numerous balloons to a piece of string to make an attractive garland . Cut a piece of string or yarn to the size you’d like your garland to be. Thread 1 end of the string through a yarn needle, and pierce the needle through the plastic tail of the balloon. Scoot the balloon down the string, and add several more balloons to fill the garland. Use tape to secure both ends of the garland to a wall, table, or doorway. [2] X Research source Once you hang the garland, you can reposition the balloons as you’d like. For instance, make a 5 ft (1.5 m) balloon garland and hang it around your cake and gift table."

      "content": "Group several balloons into bunches to make a colorful accent. To make round balloon decorations, blow up several balloons using a hand pump and tie them at the end. Then, pierce a zip tie through the tail of 1 balloon. Continue piercing the tails of the remaining balloons until they are all attached to the zip tie. Connect the zip tie ends, and pull it as tight as you can. Hang the cluster of balloons to the walls or from the ceiling using clear string. [3] X Research source Use 1 color of balloons for each cluster, and make 3-5 different balloon clusters for a colorful, festive decoration. Use more or less balloons based on your personal preference."

      "content": "Create giant balloon flowers if hosting a spring-themed birthday party. Use 1 yellow balloon for the center and 5 colored balloons to make the petals. Blow up all of your balloons, and knot them at the end. Then, attach 5 petal balloons by tying 2 pairs together at a time. Then, push the yellow balloon into the center, and twist the tail of the balloon around the other tails to form the flower. Make multiple flowers in several colors if you want a bright, cheery decoration. Once you create your flower, tie it to a stick to make your stem. Tape the flower to the wall to create an all-over display."

      "title": "Tape balloons of various sizes to the wall for a creative choice.",
      "content": "Tape balloons of various sizes to the wall for a creative choice. Blow up some large balloons, medium balloons, and small balloons to make your display. Then, use 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) sized pieces of double-sided tape to attach the balloons to the wall. Arrange the different sized balloons randomly across the wall for an all-over decoration. [4] X Research source This is a great idea if you want to cover a large space. Use balloons of various shades of the same colors to create a monochrome look. For example, pick light blue balloons for your smallest size, royal blue for the medium size, and dark blue for the largest size."

      "content": "Tie decorative ribbon or string to your balloons to embellish them. You can essentially decorate the string of your balloon however you’d like! Use washi tape in your party colors for a quick accent. Rip small 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) pieces and fold them over the string. Add a piece of string every 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) until you reach the end. Or, tie multiple pieces of ribbon 5–8 in (13–20 cm)long to the tail of the balloon for a bit of color. You can tie single balloons filled with helium to the back of each chair, for example. In addition, you can tie glitter garland to the string of your balloon for an instant upgrade."

      "content": "Put a glow stick inside each balloon to create a glowing display. Before you blow up the balloon, bend a glowstick back and forth to make it glow, and place it inside the balloon. Then, blow up your balloon as normal, knot the bottom when it is full, and tie on a string. [6] X Research source This makes your balloons glow in the dark, which can be a fun addition to a birthday celebration. This is a great idea if you are hosting a laser tag party, for instance."

      "content": "Attach a paper cone to the balloon to make an ice cream decoration. Gather 1 piece of brown construction paper for each balloon you inflate. Twist the paper into a cone shape, and use a stapler to secure it into place. Then, slip the string of your balloon through the cone, and reposition it overtop the tail end. Place a few dots of craft glue along the top edge of the “cone” to secure it onto the balloon. [7] X Research source Do this for each of your individual balloons to make a fun, summery decoration. This is a great idea if you are hosting a party at a swim club, for example."

      "content": "Use pieces of paper to turn your balloons into pieces of fruit. First, pick out which fruit you’d like to make. You can make fruit including pineapples, grapes, and bananas. Then, draw a stem or small details onto a piece of construction paper, and cut out the design to decorate the balloons. Secure your balloons with double-sided tape to create the general shape, then tape the leaves and stem details to the balloon where you attach the string. [8] X Research source For example, to make a bunch of grapes, inflate 4-8 purple balloons. Draw a leaf on a green piece of construction paper, and tape it to the top of the bunch. Do this if you want to create a tropical themed party."
