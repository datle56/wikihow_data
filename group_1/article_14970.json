As you come up the on-ramp, use your turn signal, check your blind spot and mirrors, look forward again and merge onto the highway. You must watch for cars on the freeway and adjust your speed to enter the freeway safely. Although many people will change lanes to the left to give merging cars more room, it is not their responsibility to let you onto the freeway. Once you've safely merged onto the freeway, match your speed to the flow of traffic. [5] X Research source If the on-ramp abruptly ends into the shoulder, and you are unable to merge, slow down and wait for a gap in traffic before you merge. If there are no vehicles on the highway, you should select a safe speed. Even if there is no speed limit posted or if there is no state, provincial, prefectural, or federal speed limit, it is always illegal to drive faster than the current road conditions permit. This is referred to as the \"basic speed law\" in many countries."

Remember when driving on freeways that you should always stay in the furthest lane to the right unless you are passing a slower moving vehicle in front of you. You have probably seen signs which read, \"KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS\" or \"SLOWER TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT\". If you see a vehicle coming up behind you and you are able to safely move to the right, you must. Change lanes toward the right to allow traffic to pass. It is not your job to enforce speed limits by obstructing traffic on the freeway. [6] X Research source Driving slower than the average speed of traffic can be more dangerous than driving faster, which is why many highways have minimum speeds."
