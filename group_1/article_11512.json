[1] X Research source The fashion style is feminine with lots of lace, flowy skirts, and bows. Typical coquette fashion also uses pastel colors, but dark coquette instead focuses on a dark color palette, with the main color being black.

      "content": "Dark coquette fashion varies, but there are still some major themes. These themes are: Skirts: While coquette fashion isn't 100% skirts, you'll probably have an easier time winning DTI if you pair your dark coquette outfit with a pretty, flouncy skirt. Bows: Bows are a must-have for coquette fashion. This includes bows on your clothes itself, as well as bows in your hair. A big bow holding back a ponytail is a signature of coquette fashion. Pearls: Jewelry in general is important to the coquette style, but pearls are one of the gems of choice. Corsets: Since coquette fashion is also inspired by romantic historical fashion, corsets are featured prominently in coquette styles. Cute purses: A cute purse that matches your outfit is a great way to fit the coquette style. Mary Janes: Mary Jane shoes aren't the only shoe you can wear in a coquette outfit, but it's a great choice due to how cute and innocent they make the wearer look. Tights: A pair of white tights under your coquette outfit is a great way to tie it all together. You can also opt for thigh-high stockings if you prefer."
