      "title": "Purchase a ticket directly from the NFL while they're available.",
      "content": "Purchase a ticket directly from the NFL while they're available. Each year, the NFL itself distributes about 25% of the total tickets. Some of these tickets are available for direct purchase at face value, but you’ll have to buy the tickets well in advance of the game. [1] X Research source These typically sell very quickly, and are often purchased by ticket brokers who resell them once the AFC and NFC champion teams are decided. Also, keep in mind many of these tickets are sold as part of packages, which may involve lodging, airfare, and entertaining before, during, and after the game.

      "content": "Enter a team lottery if you have season tickets. Each year, 35% of the tickets to the Super Bowl game are given to the teams playing in the championship game—17.5% to each team. These tickets are typically divided among the sponsors and players first, then a certain number will be offered to some of the season ticket holders via a lottery. If you purchased a season ticket package, contact the organization to find out the process for entering their lottery. [2] X Research source If you’re selected in the lottery, you can buy tickets at face value, which started at $950 for Super Bowl LI in 2017. [3] X Research source You may be selected in a lottery even if your team doesn’t go to the Super Bowl. Another 5% of the total tickets go to the host team, and 34.8% of the total tickets are spread among the remaining teams, and a small percentage of those may be handed out through a lottery as well. [4] X Research source For example, in 2019, 5% of Super Bowl tickets went to the Atlanta Falcons, regardless of who played in the championship game."

      "content": "Apply for the Super Bowl ADA Random Drawing if you’re disabled. Every year, the NFL holds a lottery for fans who have a disability and who would like to attend the Super Bowl. If you win, you’ll be given the ability to purchase a wheelchair ticket and a ticket for a companion, both at face value.

The application should include your full name and address, phone number, and email address. It can be a letter or a postcard, but it must be sent through either certified or registered mail.

      "content": "Look on an online ticket resale site closer to the game. Ticket brokers offer tickets for sale through secondary websites, but individuals may also sell their tickets online if, for instance, they’re chosen through a lottery but opt not to attend the game. Typically, if you’re a fan who doesn’t have season tickets or any connections to a sponsor or a team member, this is the best option for finding seats after the championship teams have been decided. [5] X Research source One way to buy resale tickets from individuals is to visit the NFL ticket exchange, which is run by Ticketmaster. Other popular resale sites include Stub Hub, Tick Pick, and Seat Geek."

      "content": "Enter local radio and TV drawings. Sometimes, local radio and TV stations will be given Super Bowl tickets, which they’ll give away for free as part of a drawing. If you hear about one of these giveaways, pay close attention to the rules for entry. The odds of winning aren’t great, but someone is guaranteed to win, so it’s worth a shot! You might even find Super Bowl giveaways on your favorite websites, so don’t forget to check online!"

      "content": "Buy a ticket package to combine your entire experience into one purchase. Unless you live in the city where the Super Bowl is being hosted, you’ll probably need to figure out your flight, lodging, and any entertainment you might want to enjoy before and after the game. For an easy way to take care of all of this, buy a ticket package directly from the NFL or from a third-party vendor. [6] X Research source You can typically choose from multiple levels of packages, with varying levels of personalized service. Keep in mind that packages with better seats will cost a lot more money than packages in the nosebleed section. You can even spend tens of thousands of dollars to get tickets in a suite. [7] X Research source Some of these packages might include tickets to concerts or invitations to exclusive parties, while others might be more basic, just providing for your airfare and hotel room."

      "title": "Watch ticket prices in the month before the game to find a low price.",
      "content": "Watch ticket prices in the month before the game to find a low price. Ticket prices can fluctuate dramatically in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. They tend to peak right after the NFC and AFC championship games, when the Super Bowl teams are decided. It may be best to wait another 1-2 weeks to let the prices fall before you buy your ticket. [8] X Research source The best way to be sure that you’re getting a good deal is to spend a couple of weeks watching the prices. Then, about a week before the game, buy your tickets on a day when they seem reasonable. The lowest price has historically tended to occur on the Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday before the game, although this isn’t a guarantee. [9] X Research source The prices tend to rise again in the last few days before the game, so try not to wait until the very last minute!"

      "title": "Book your accommodations as soon as possible to stay close to the game.",
      "content": "Book your accommodations as soon as possible to stay close to the game. While the ticket prices might fall right before the game, the opposite is usually true for hotel rooms. Unless you know you’re buying a package deal, you should book a hotel as soon as you know you’re going to the Super Bowl. The hotels closest to the stadium fill up very quickly, and as rooms start to get booked, prices typically rise. The longer you wait to book a hotel, the further away from the game you’ll stay, and the more money you’ll have to pay."

      "title": "Budget for a ride if you’re not within walking distance.",
      "content": "Budget for a ride if you’re not within walking distance. If your hotel is too far away from the stadium to walk there, you’ll need to figure out transportation. If you drive, you may have to pay for parking, which will likely cost much more than usual due to the increased traffic around the event. Also, keep in mind that services like Uber and Lyft may increase their prices before and after major events like the Super Bowl. Taxi services typically don’t charge additional fees. However, it’s best to set up your ride ahead of time, since high demand could make it hard to hail a cab on the street."

      "content": "Attend a watch party if you can’t score tickets. If tickets are hard to find, or they’re just too expensive, you can still enjoy the feeling of watching the Super Bowl as part of a crowd! Sometimes, the teams participating in the game will host a watch party at their home stadium, but there are a variety of events all across the country where you can join up with other people to watch the game. Try typing “Super Bowl watch parties near me” into your search bar to try to find events you can attend! If there aren’t any watch parties near you, invite your friends over and make some fun football snacks, like buffalo chicken dip, fried wings, or nachos!"
