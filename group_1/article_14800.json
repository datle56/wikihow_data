      "title": "Put on your regular undergarments.",
      "content": "Put on your regular undergarments. This could include panties, a bra, a camisole, and any other apparel you normally like wearing under your clothing. If your salwar kameez is transparent, you may want to wear a camisole or tank top underneath. If you don’t have a tank top that matches or compliments the color of your kameez, a white one will do."

    {
      "title": "Put on the pants.",
      "content": "Put on the pants. The salwar will generally have either a drawstring or elastic waist. If the pants have a drawstring, it goes to the front. You can also use pockets to determine front from back, as your hands should be able to slide into the pockets easily and naturally when the pants are on the right way. Put the pants on as you would any other pants, with one leg through each pant hole. Position the waistband at your waist (just above your belly button). Pull the drawstring tighter to keep the pants in place, then tie the string into a bow. If the pants are tapered at the bottom, position them so your pant legs aren't twisted."

    {
      "title": "Pull on the tunic.",
      "content": "Pull on the tunic. The second part of the outfit is the shirt, and it’s always easier to put this on after you have the pants on. Depending on the style, you may have to pull the shirt over your head, you may slip it on and button it down the front, or the shirt may come together in the back with loops. When pulling on the shirt, be sure that you don’t catch any beads, hooks, or special designs on your hair or other garments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put on your shoes.",
      "content": "Put on your shoes. Sandals and heels are the most common shoes worn with the salwar kameez, so your shoes may just slip on. However, if you're wearing sandals, be sure to tighten and attach straps properly so that they don’t slip off when your walking."

      "title": "Wear the dupatta for everyday dress.",
      "content": "Wear the dupatta for everyday dress. There are actually many ways to wear the dupatta, or scarf, that’s often worn with the salwar kameez, and the way you wear it may depend on the occasion. For common, everyday wear: Hold the dupatta in front of you horizontally. Gather the material into your hands so that it’s like a long, thin scarf instead of a large rectangle. From the front, drape the dupatta around your neck and shoulders, so that the ends hang down your back evenly. You can also put the dupatta on the opposite way (from back to front), so that the ends are hanging down in front of your chest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape the dupatta over your head for religious occasions.",
      "content": "Drape the dupatta over your head for religious occasions. To wear the dupatta for a religious ceremony or ritual, hold the dupatta like a scarf and drape the material over your hair so the center of the dupatta is on your head and the ends are hanging in front of your chest. Cross one or both of the ends of the dupatta over the opposite shoulder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape it over your front for formal occasions.",
      "content": "Drape it over your front for formal occasions. Hold the dupatta horizontally in front of you and drape it over your chest. Toss the ends over your shoulders so they hang down your back evenly. Adjust the material in front so it’s draping over your bust (but not necessarily your neck) and arms. When you wear the dupatta this way, it’s like wearing a shawl backwards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape the dupatta over one shoulder.",
      "content": "Drape the dupatta over one shoulder. Hold two widthwise corners of the dupatta so it’s hanging vertically in front of you. Fold the dupatta in half to form a long, skinny rectangle. Then, fold it in half again in the same way. Lay the dupatta over your left shoulder and flatten out the material. Adjust the dupatta so it’s hanging evenly in the front and back. If you have sloping shoulders or are worried about the dupatta falling, you can pin it in place with a pin. Be sure to put the pin on the underside of the fabric so it doesn’t show."

      "title": "Know where to purchase.",
      "content": "Know where to purchase. Depending on where you live, you may have to shop online for a salwar kameez. If you don’t live right in India but live in a metropolitan city with a large Indian population, you will likely be able to find a salwar kameez in an Indian dress shop. Otherwise, check online stores that specialize in Indian fashions. There are many things to consider when purchasing a salwar kameez, including the style, color, design, fabric, and the occasion for which it’s being worn."

      "title": "Understand the different styles.",
      "content": "Understand the different styles. There are many different styles of salwar kameez that are designed for different occasions and different fashion preferences. For instance: When it comes to the tops, a kurta is a basic tunic that usually has slits in the sides, whereas an anarkali is a longer, flared, dress-like top with a full skirt. [1] X Research source The kurta is more for everyday wear (but can be formal and dressy) while the anarkali is for fancier occasions. With the pants, there are multiple styles, including churidars (similar to leggings), churidars with shirring (rows of gathers), salwar (loose-fitting pants with a straight cut), patiala (loose pants that balloon around the legs), and Capri-style pants that can come with or without strings.

      "title": "Select the right design for the occasion.",
      "content": "Select the right design for the occasion. A salwar kameez can be a relatively plain and suitable for work, shopping, and everyday life, but it can also be decorated, ornate, and highly patterned, and a salwar kameez like this is much better suited for celebrations, parties, and special occasions. Where you intend to wear your salwar kameez can dictate what type of design you wear. The plainer the salwar kameez, the more suited it is for everyday life. A salwar kameez can be made elaborate and suitable for special events with beadwork, embroidery, panelling, jewels, and intricate designs and patterns. Color is also a factor to consider when choosing a salwar kameez, and the brighter and more colorful the outfit, the better it is for special occasions. Black, blue, and green, however, are better for everyday wear. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick the right fabric.",
      "content": "Pick the right fabric. The salwar kameez comes in many different fabrics, such as cotton, silk, satin, velvet, and chiffon. Just as certain colors and designs are more appropriate for different occasions, so too are some fabrics better suited to different purposes. [4] X Research source A salwar kameez that’s for everyday wear will often be made of cotton or a cotton blend. More expensive materials, such as silk and velvet, are often used for a salwar kameez that’s designed for special occasions, such as weddings, ceremonies, religious events, and festivals."
