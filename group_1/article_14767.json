      "title": "Ensure you have a well-fitting bra.",
      "content": "Ensure you have a well-fitting bra. For busty women, the most important starting point for a stylish outfit is finding the correct bra. It should offer full-breast coverage and give your chest shape without over-accentuating its size. Try a nude-colored bra, which helps to eliminate outlines under sheer T-shirts. Take a look at brands like ThirdLove, Chantelle, or Wacoal, which go up to sizes G and H and offer cute styles. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to find simple lines and silhouettes. Details like ruffles, frills, breast pockets, and ruched fabric will make your breasts seem larger. [2] X Research source Focus on tops with clean lines that won’t call attention to your bust."

    {
      "title": "Pick a flattering fabric for tops or dresses.",
      "content": "Pick a flattering fabric for tops or dresses. The ideal materials will be stretchy while also providing support and structure—stretch cotton or gabardine, for instance. [3] X Research source Fabrics to generally avoid include: [4] X Research source Shiny or metallic materials Ribbed knits Stiff fabrics Slinky jersey"

    {
      "title": "Select the right neckline.",
      "content": "Select the right neckline. V-necks are often the most flattering on busty women because they lengthen the silhouette and direct the eyes downwards. Scoop necklines are also a good look for big breasts. Avoid polo, crew, cowl, and square necklines, which tend to draw attention to the bust. [5] X Research source Watch out for overly deep V-necks—they may show off too much cleavage to be appropriate in certain settings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for sleeves that won’t draw attention to your chest.",
      "content": "Look for sleeves that won’t draw attention to your chest. Focus on tops with long sleeves that flare below the elbow, or natural shoulder sleeves (where the shoulder seam aligns with your actual shoulder). [6] X Research source If you’re looking for a tank top, try finding one with wider straps—spaghetti straps can make your shoulders and chest appear much larger. Consider steering clear of these sleeve styles: Sleeves that finish at the line of the bust Drop shoulders Raglan sleeves Kimono-style sleeves"

    {
      "title": "Size up with button-down tops.",
      "content": "Size up with button-down tops. Oxford shirts can be particularly tricky for big-busted women. The key is to buy a shirt that specifically fits your breasts (which may mean bumping up a size or two). Oxfords can be easy to style in a larger size—try tying it at the bottom, layering under sweaters or dresses, or half-tucking it in to your pants. [7] X Research source Another option is to find a tailor, who can take in the shirt around the neckline, armholes, and lower torso."

    {
      "title": "Find an A-line skirt that balances your bust.",
      "content": "Find an A-line skirt that balances your bust. Look for A-line styles, which flare out and help maintain a proportional silhouette. Pair a tucked-in shirt with a skirt that has a slightly lower waistline, to help lengthen your torso. To accentuate your curves, try wearing a pencil skirt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Combine a solid-color top with a matching bottom.",
      "content": "Combine a solid-color top with a matching bottom. Finding a dress that fits perfectly can sometimes be tricky, since busty women often wear different sizes on top and bottom. By pairing separates of the same color, you can create the cohesive look of a dress without the sizing issues. [8] X Research source Consider mixing textures to add visual interest and draw attention to your bottom half—a black leather skirt with a black cotton V-neck sweater, for instance."

    {
      "title": "Pair boyfriend jeans with a tucked-in shirt.",
      "content": "Pair boyfriend jeans with a tucked-in shirt. A wide-legged look can be great on a big-busted woman, since looser jeans or dress pants help to balance out their top half. Try pairing low-rise boyfriend jeans with a tucked-in, drapey T-shirt in a thick fabric such as terry cloth or densely woven cotton. [9] X Research source Skinny jeans are not always the best option, since they can make your breasts look even larger."

    {
      "title": "Wear a dress that emphasizes your waistline.",
      "content": "Wear a dress that emphasizes your waistline. The best dress styles for big busts include wrap dresses, fit and flare shapes, and neat A-line silhouettes. Short hemlines can be a plus, since they pull the eyes down to the legs and away from the chest area. Try strategic color-blocking to achieve a cinched-waist effect without a belt or tie. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Throw on a blazer or jacket over your outfit.",
      "content": "Throw on a blazer or jacket over your outfit. Watch out for double-breasted styles, which can sometimes add weight to your upper half. Go for narrow lapels—or ditch the lapels all together and choose a lapel-free vest or blazer. Don’t worry about buttoning your blazer up, which can lead to gaping and pulling. It’s stylish and work-appropriate to keep it open. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a medium-length necklace.",
      "content": "Select a medium-length necklace. The best necklace for a big bust hangs around your throat or sternum and calls attention to the delicate line of your collarbone. [12] X Research source Necklaces that are too long will hang off your bust instead of lying flat, while chokers draw the eyes up and make your breasts appear larger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw attention to your legs with high heels.",
      "content": "Draw attention to your legs with high heels. A pair of statement heels can make legs look longer, diverting eyes from your chest. [13] X Research source Shoes that are sparkly or brightly colored will attract even more attention. If you’d prefer not to wear heels, split-front booties offer another way to visually elongate your legs with footwear. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid bulky and oversized scarves.",
      "content": "Avoid bulky and oversized scarves. Blanket scarves or scarves knitted from chunky yarn serve to add extra volume to your bust. Try thinner materials, such as a cashmere pashmina, which will lay flatter."

    {
      "title": "Find a belt that won’t take over your midsection.",
      "content": "Find a belt that won’t take over your midsection. The right belt can help emphasize your waist. Watch out for too-wide styles which can have the opposite effect, erasing your waistline and overemphasizing the bust. Try a skinny belt paired with low-waisted pants, which highlights an hourglass figure. [15] X Research source"
