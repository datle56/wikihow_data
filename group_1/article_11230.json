      "content": "Slice under one small corner of the silver membrane with a knife. The silver skin on your flank steak is a thin membrane that covers one side of the steak. It should always be taken off before you cook the meat. Place the meat on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, slice under one small corner of the membrane. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Grab the membrane and pull upwards to remove it from the flank steak. Use the knife to slice the membrane away from the steak as you pull. Make sure you face the knife away from you to avoid accidentally cutting yourself. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Trim away any large pieces of fat.",
      "content": "Trim away any large pieces of fat. You'll want to leave a little fat on the steak, since this adds moisture and flavor as it cooks, but you should trim off any large pieces or bands of fat from your steak. Use your knife to carefully cut the white pieces of fat from the steak, getting as close to the red meat as possible. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Find the grain of the meat.",
      "content": "Find the grain of the meat. The grain refers to the way the muscle fibers are aligned. In flank steaks, the grain usually runs long-ways down the steak. The grain is usually easy to spot in this cut. It will look like long lines running along the length of the steak, and if you pull at the meat it should separate slightly along those lines.

    {
      "title": "Hold the steak in place with a carving fork.",
      "content": "Hold the steak in place with a carving fork. A carving fork usually has 2-3 large tines and will help keep the steak from sliding around as you slice it. If you're right-handed, hold the carving fork in place with your left hand, and vice-versa if you're left-handed. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice the meat against the grain.",
      "content": "Slice the meat against the grain. Slicing meat against the grain is the easiest way to tenderize a tough piece of meat. This is because it shortens the muscle fibers, so you don't have to do all the hard work when you chew. [6] X Research source You can slice the steak either before or after you cook it."

      "title": "Cut the steak at a 45 degree angle.",
      "content": "Cut the steak at a 45 degree angle. Hold your knife at a 45 degree angle to the steak as you cut instead of slicing straight down. Cutting the steak at an angle will keep it from being chewy, and it will give you slightly wider slices. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut thin slices of flank steak.",
      "content": "Cut thin slices of flank steak. You'll want to cut your slices about 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64–1.27 cm) thick to help keep it tender. This is the perfect size for most popular flank steak recipes, such as carne asada or stir fry. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook your steak on the stovetop for stir fry. After slicing your flank steak, heat up a frying pan to medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oil and let it heat until the oil starts to shimmer. Add your steak to the pan and let it cook for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare steak. Check the internal temperature - it should be about 125–130 °F (52–54 °C). [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Grill the steak for a smoky carne asada. If you like, you can marinate your flank steak before grilling it, or you can season it with salt and pepper if you prefer. Heat one side of a charcoal or gas grill to high heat and have the other side prepared for lower, indirect heat. Place the steak over the direct heat for 1-2 minutes on each side to get it seared. Move it to the cooler side, close the grill, and let it cook for a few more minutes until it's cooked to your desired doneness. You can check the doneness by taking the temperature of the steak with a meat thermometer. [10] X Research source For rare steaks, the temperature should be 130–140 °F (54–60 °C), for medium-rare 145 °F (63 °C), for medium 160 °F (71 °C) and for well-done at least 170 °F (77 °C)."

      "content": "Broil the steak in the oven for to combine grilling and indoor cooking. The broiler on your oven basically acts like a grill, except the heat comes from the top instead of the bottom and you can control the temperature more easily. Place the steak on a broiler pan on a baking sheet with a wire rack. Line the pan with aluminum foil for easy clean-up. Turn the broiler on high and broil the steak for 4-6 minutes on each side.
