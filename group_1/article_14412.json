      "content": "Draw a large circle to make the chibi face. Make the circle any size you like depending on how big you want to make the character. Keep in mind that the character's head should be the same size as the rest of the entire body. [2] X Research source The disproportionately large head will make your chibi character look even cuter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make 2 lines that intersect in the circle.",
      "content": "Make 2 lines that intersect in the circle. Lightly draw a vertical line that runs straight through the circle. Then, make a faint horizontal line that runs through the vertical one. Place the horizontal line in the lower third of the circle. [3] X Research source You'll use these 2 lines as guidelines for placing the facial features. If you want the facial features to be even lower on the face, make the horizontal line in the bottom quarter of the circle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch 2 wide eyes on the horizontal line in the circle.",
      "content": "Sketch 2 wide eyes on the horizontal line in the circle. To make classic chibi eyes, draw 2 tall rectangles with rounded corners. Then, make the upper lid of each eye bold and very curved so the tops of the eyes are round. Draw large pupils and irises so only a sliver of white is visible in each eye. Include at least 1 white circle in the eye to show the reflection of light. Leave a gap the size of 1 eye between the eyes you drew. The line can pass through the center of the eyes or you can position the eyes so the bottom of the eyes rest on the horizontal line. Remember that you're not trying to make the eyes realistic. Chibi eyes can show any expression, but they're usually exaggerated, shiny, and bold."

    {
      "title": "Draw a small mouth near the bottom half of the circle.",
      "content": "Draw a small mouth near the bottom half of the circle. For a very simple mouth, draw a small line that curves up or down depending on your character's emotions. You could draw a circle or triangle if you'd like your character's mouth to be open. If you want to make a detailed mouth, you can include teeth or their tongue. The mouth can be as expressive as the eyes. For example, if your chibi character is in love, you might make their mouth heart-shaped."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a small nose for additional detail.",
      "content": "Include a small nose for additional detail. Sketch a nose that's no bigger than the size of the mouth you just made and place it on the vertical guideline below the eyes. You can draw a small slightly curved line, a tiny circle, or an upside-down triangle and keep the nose as simple as you like. Some chibi characters don't have noses. Feel free to leave it off of your character if you like."

    {
      "title": "Add any style of hair you like to the character's head.",
      "content": "Add any style of hair you like to the character's head. Large hair is another feature of chibi characters so make the hair on your drawing really stand out. Play around with drawing wavy, shaggy, or spiked hair, for instance. Let a few strands cover the sides of the character's face or fall across 1 of their eyes. [4] X Research source You could give your character a ponytail, pigtails, or ribbons to make the character appear more playful."

      "content": "Draw a vertical line that extends below the center of the head. The line should be the same size as the head. This will be the guideline for the torso of your chibi character. [5] X Research source Keep the line light so it's easy to go back and erase the pencil. If you prefer to draw your character turning, bending, or crouched, for instance, you can skip this step."

      "content": "Make a small horizontal line halfway through the line to make the upper body. Decide how wide you want your character's waist to be and sketch a horizontal line halfway on the vertical torso line. The horizontal line will become your character's waistline. Then, draw an angled line coming from each side of waistline that narrows near the head. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Draw 2 legs that extend down from the waistline.",
      "content": "Draw 2 legs that extend down from the waistline. Place your pencil at 1 end of the waistline and make a slanting line goes down and slightly in towards the vertical guideline. Do this for the opposite side and then make an upside-down V shape that's centered on the guideline. [7] X Research source The upside-down V will distinguish the 2 legs."

      "title": "Sketch 2 arms that extend from where the head meets the body.",
      "content": "Sketch 2 arms that extend from where the head meets the body. The arms can be as narrow or thick as you like, but ensure that they extend just below the waistline. Then, make a small rounded circle at the end of each arm to represent the hands. [8] X Research source If you like, you can make the hands more detailed by drawing fingers or jewelry."

    {
      "title": "Add clothes to the body.",
      "content": "Add clothes to the body. If you're drawing a simple character, you could draw a plain top and pants or a dress. For a more detailed character, include a few more features, such as socks, shoes, a tie, a belt, or a scarf. [9] X Research source Feel free to add accessories to your character. For example, if you're drawing a chibi wizard, draw a cloak and staff."
