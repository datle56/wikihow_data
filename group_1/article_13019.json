Most SD cards and some USB flash drives have small levers or switches on the casing that control whether the item is writable or read-only, so look for such a lever or switch and move it if necessary. Especially in the case of SD cards, physical locks often prove to be impossible forms of write protection until they're disabled. If your lock mechanism has been broken, you might be able to fix it ."

Change the drive's format to the \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" format."
