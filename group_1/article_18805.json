      "content": "Exfoliate your skin 1-2 times a week. Exfoliating means gently scrubbing your skin to remove dead skin cells. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You can do this with a dry exfoliating brush, a damp washcloth, or a salt or sugar body scrub. [2] X Research source Since the skin on your face is very delicate, only use exfoliating tools and products specifically designed for use on the face. Body exfoliating products will typically be too harsh. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Keep in mind that exfoliation only helps if your current skin is darker than your normal skin tone because it reveals fresh skin that is untouched by the sun. To make your own facial scrub, try adding a teaspoon of ground almonds or oatmeal to your regular cleanser."

      "content": "Apply a moisturizer to your skin morning and night. Your skin will look lighter, brighter, and healthier if it’s well-nourished. Use a moisturizer that’s formulated for your skin tone, and apply it every morning and evening after you wash your face. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For example, if you have oily skin, you would use a lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly. If your skin is dry, you might need a heavier moisturizer. If you have combination skin, you might prefer using a lightweight moisturizer on most of your face, then a more concentrated formula where your skin is the driest. Use a lightweight body moisturizer on your chest, arms, and legs."

      "content": "Put on sunscreen indoors and outdoors. Most of the normal darkening and discoloration of your skin is caused by exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. To prevent this, along with skin-related conditions caused by UVA and UVB rays, wear sunblock with a minimum of SPF 30 on your face, chest, arms, and hands every day, no matter where you'll be. For the strongest sun protection, reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours, especially if you’ll be outdoors.

In addition, men should drink about 3.7 l (130 fl oz), while women need about 2.7 L (91 fl oz) of water every day in order to stay hydrated. Try to exercise for about 30 minutes a day, as well.

Even with sunscreen, you may still experience some redness or darkening when you’re outside, especially in the summer, when the sun’s rays are strongest. You can help avoid this by keeping yourself shaded as much as you can if you have to be outdoors. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source For example, you might wear lightweight, long-sleeved clothing and a wide-brimmed hat if you’ll be outdoors, and you could sit beneath an umbrella or a large tree for even more protection. You may also want to avoid being outdoors between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., when the sun’s rays are the strongest.

      "content": "Be realistic with your expectations. Skin that is already naturally dark is very hard to lighten more than a shade or two, especially using natural methods. Keeping your skin healthy by protecting it from the sun, exfoliating and using natural lightening methods is your best bet for keeping it on the lighter side in tone. Remember that consistency is the key, so continue do your facial treatments several times a week until you see the results you’re looking for."

Mix turmeric powder with just enough olive oil to make a thick paste. Spread the turmeric paste in a thin layer over your skin. After about15- 20 minutes, rinse it away with warm water. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Turmeric contains curcumin, which acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and may help brighten your complexion. [11] X Research source It’s a good idea to wear old clothes when you make this paste, because the turmeric may stain your clothing. It may also temporarily stain your skin yellow, but this should wash away quickly. You can repeat this treatment once a day as often as you like."

Rub the potato over your skin if you want all-over lightening, or place it on your skin and leave it there if you want to lighten a specific area, like an age spot. Either way, rinse your skin with warm water after about 10 minutes. [12] X Research source The starch and sugar in the potato will help exfoliate your skin, and the vitamin C, potassium, zinc, and other nutrients will help rejuvenate your skin, which can help it look lighter. Potatoes are mild enough that you can use them to lighten your skin every day. If you don’t have a potato on hand, try other fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C, like tomato, cucumber, or blended papaya. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a nighttime lemon juice rinse to exfoliate and lighten your skin. Squeeze about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) into a bowl, then stir in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water. Dip a cotton ball into the mixture and dab it onto the skin you want to lighten. After about 20 minutes, gently rinse it away with warm water, then pat your skin dry with a soft towel and apply a facial moisturizer. [14] X Research source Repeat three times a week for the best results. Lemon juice acts as a natural exfoliant, taking off the surface layer of the skin to expose the lighter skin underneath. The citric acid in lemon juice also creates a light bleaching effect (just like it does when you put it in your hair). Lemon juice can dry out or irritate some people’s skin, and it can sometimes cause sensitivity to sunlight. If you experience redness, stinging, or burning, rinse away the lemon juice right away and do not apply it again."

      "content": "Make a lemon, honey, and oatmeal mask for natural exfoliation. When you mix natural skin lighteners with exfoliants, you can create a mask that lightens the skin by both taking off the dark top layer of cells and lightly bleaching the fresh skin underneath. Try a mask made with lemon juice, honey, and 1 tsp (1 g) of oatmeal. Apply it to your face and anywhere else you want, leave it for 20 minutes, then wash it off. [17] X Research source As you wash off the mask, use the tips of your fingers to make gentle circular motions. The ground oatmeal will scrub the top layer of dead skin from your face, revealing lighter skin underneath. If you have dry skin, use cucumber instead of lemon. Apply a mixture of equal amounts of cucumber juice and honey on the face and full body for 15 minutes, then wash it off. You can also try mixing 2 tsp of oatmeal powder (2 g) with a pinch of turmeric and a few drops of lemon juice."
