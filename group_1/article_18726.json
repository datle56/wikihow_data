Here's how to co-wash: [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Wet your hair in the shower, and massage conditioner into your scalp.

Washing it away too often will result in dry, brittle hair that looks frizzy instead of wavy. Cut back washing your hair to twice or even once a week and notice the results.

However, this is not a long-term solution, since over time this practice is damaging to curly hair. When you get your hair relaxed, chemicals are applied to your hair that cause it to become permanently straight. Then your hair is permanently waved according to your specifications; you can choose tighter waves or looser waves. Make sure you see a stylist who has experience working with very curly hair."
