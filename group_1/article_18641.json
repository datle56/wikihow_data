      "title": "Watch your friends duel against each other.",
      "content": "Watch your friends duel against each other. Comprehend from what building input they are doing. Some common patterns are platform to ramp to wall, or left wall to right wall to ramp. See how fast they are building and then practice. If it is your first time, go slow and try to build as much as you can without messing up. Use a timer and write it down so you will know how quickly you built. Identify mistakes you are making that you can improve upon in the process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start memorizing the building inputs.",
      "content": "Start memorizing the building inputs. These will differ based on what platform you are playing on. For example Ramp is \"L2\", Platform is \"R1\", Pyramid is \"L1\", and Wall is \"R2\" if you use Builder Pro on a controller."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep in mind the MAP technique.",
      "content": "Keep in mind the MAP technique. This stands for Memorize, Accelerate, and Practice. In this case, memorize your building inputs, accelerate your building speeds, and practice for effort. When it comes to building, people will suddenly try to go hard on you. If you die, it's okay. Learn from the best and be the best, and then you will be the better player."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice your aiming.",
      "content": "Practice your aiming. If you're wondering how he just shoot you out of the sky or how he just killed you from 186 meters away, it's the same scenario with building. Try out creative or playground! Go into your island and place some targets around and shoot at them. Look at each weapon's description and read how much damage it does. See how many targets you can shoot down without reloading under 10 seconds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play fun mini-games.",
      "content": "Play fun mini-games. Get one of your buddies to play \"Zone Wars\" or \"Sniper One Shot\" with you and see how accurate your shot rate is. This means how far you can deal damage, how long it takes to hit your shots, and whether you can hit your shots consistently or not."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play hectic special game modes.",
      "content": "Play hectic special game modes. Try out the game mode called \"Team Rumble.\" It is nothing compared to any of the other game modes that are available. You will be on a team of either 20 people or less against another team of the same number or less. The game lasts until you get to either 100 or 150 eliminations. The safe zone will always be at the end or in the middle of the map. If you're trying to get the first elimination, do as you must and drop in towards the safe zone. If you're trying to stay away from the fight, drop somewhere else to loot your goodies and return to get the job done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Diversify your load-out.",
      "content": "Diversify your load-out. Try to carry an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, an SMG, and a shotgun. See which weapon is best for you. Can you shoot with the assault rifle and eliminate a player from 98 meters away, or can you eliminate someone with a quick-scope and hit them with a SMG? Depending on your abilities, choose wisely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim for the head.",
      "content": "Aim for the head. Head-shots, as you likely know, have a damage multiplier that make them the highest-damaging action in the game. If it is possible, try to aim for the head to maximize your damage dealt. However, understand your strengths. See if you're more accurate with the body or the head of your opponents. If you can more reliably hit the body, switch up your play style and run SMG and shotgun builds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take your time while aiming.",
      "content": "Take your time while aiming. This is commonly referred to as hard-scoping, and many people see it as a bad thing when it really makes logical sense. Hard scoping is frowned upon because it means less skill, but as you get better you can scope and shoot faster. Everything takes time. Sometimes you need to hard-scope to get a lot of damage off the opponent and also if they are far away from where you are. Hard-scoping is typically known when people do it with sniper rifles, but it is useful when you use assault rifles and SMGs too."

      "title": "Learn how to edit your buildings to give yourself an advantage.",
      "content": "Learn how to edit your buildings to give yourself an advantage. Try practicing in Creative and Playground. It's not recommended that you play Team Rumble because of how many people will be there. To edit, hold the right button of your controller. If you play on PC, hold down the key that you use to edit, which you can rebind to wherever you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know the basic shapes.",
      "content": "Know the basic shapes. Discover the beneficial structures, like 4 squares on a wall edited is an open door and two squares on the bottom two rows is a door. Sometimes you need these edits for smart decisions. For example, this could come in handy in a case where you were in the final 5 of a solo match. You would have to build a 1-by-1 cube. You would have to edit a window to see if you can snipe or shoot at the other 4 players. A lot of people edit through platforms to land on people with a shotgun or an assault rifle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start with the basics.",
      "content": "Start with the basics. Begin practicing with platforms since there are only 4 squares, just like the pyramid/triangular shaped build. After you master that, try editing the pyramids. Pyramids are used to cover on top of boxes or used to hide inside by editing and crouching. Then learn to edit the walls. Walls are a little harder because you have to be quick with your edits. Otherwise the opponent can pickaxe or shoot down your wall and place his or her own wall. Learn the ramps. Ramps are a little more complicated because of their 3 dimensional editing. Ramps can go into an up or left/right stairway, or they can turn backwards from the opposite direction of the original build."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn specific tricks.",
      "content": "Learn specific tricks. A lot of people put a platform and a pyramid while building a ramp and edit the left or right side out. They continue to do it over and over to run quickly. This is a little more challenging, so start off with the basics. Try to get inside of a solo match and land on a building but don't take the stairway. Go on the side of the building and place a platform and try to edit your way down safely with no fall damage. Or, when your opponent is inside your one-by-one box and you have a ramp protecting you from damage, try to edit the stairway in the opposite direction and pull out your shotgun to get that elimination! Editing is used in 1v1's, build battles, solo, squads, duos, and basically everything in Fortnite Battle Royale. So get out there and build the biggest house or build an apartment with doors and windows!"
