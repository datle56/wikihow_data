      "title": "Decide on the number of characters.",
      "content": "Decide on the number of characters. Before you start scavenging for things around you, figure out how many contestants you need. Choose from 10 to 20 for a normal-sized show. Going below 10 is fine, but it may make your show a bit short. If this is what you want, go for it! You could have something like 25-45 contestants, but it may make your show kinda long. If this is the case, hold more common eliminations. You could have 1 or 2 eliminations at the start of the show before teams are set up, like having the challenge to determine the team captains also automatically eliminate someone, or have whoever gets picked for a team last get eliminated. You could sometimes hold Double Eliminations, elimination ceremonies where two people go instead of one. The cast will dwindle and determine the rankings faster. Be mindful that it may be harder to give everyone something going for them. Either way, avoid going over 45 because it'll still be a lot to handle. Don't make the number too high, as some of your characters won't get any screen time, and you won't be able to manage them all at once."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look around for objects to use for your contestants.",
      "content": "Look around for objects to use for your contestants. Pick what kinds of objects you want to be the contestants of your show, such as a plate, a cushion, a bottle of perfume, etc. Check online if your object has already been taken. If you want to keep that object, however, change its appearance, (if you're able to) personality, and name. Avoid inappropriate objects, such as a dildo or a condom, unless your show is 18 and above. If you can't find any more objects around you, search for some objects on the internet. You can also choose not to have physical objects. For example, if you look at the object show, General Mayhem, there is a female character named Amoeba who is a type of cell or organism. Another example is Yellow Face in BFB, which is simply a yellow face scribble. Flash from Battle For Grandma is the Adobe Flash logo. You could pick a random element from the periodic table or use a sort of idea as a character."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create their looks.",
      "content": "Create their looks. You have picked your objects - now it is time to decide how they should look. Find the right color for each of your objects and design them however you want them to be. If you want to go further in design, add eyelashes, pupils, fingers, etc. Choose whether you want your character(s) to have all limbs (arms and legs), only arms, only legs, or to have no limbs at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make personalities for each contestant.",
      "content": "Make personalities for each contestant. Now it is time to make your characters truly anthropomorphic. Give each object certain personalities depending on what the object is. For example, if your object is a balloon or a party hat, make them jovial and happy, but if your object is a witch hat, you might want his/her personality to be cruel or spiritual."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a backstory for each character if you want to.",
      "content": "Create a backstory for each character if you want to. It is uncommon to find an object show where the objects have backstories, but if you want to, you can do that. To help you, you can ask yourself: Why is your character who he/she is now? Did your character do something that they'd never be able to forget? Did your character experience a tragedy, an emotional outburst, a happy moment, etc., that he/she can't forget? If your character is, for example, disabled, write down how that happened."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the host.",
      "content": "Make the host. A host is someone who controls the game show. Again, you can either use physical or non-physical objects. Most hosts on object shows are objects that are related to technology, such as MePhone4 in Inanimate Insanity or Controlly in Brawl of The Objects. You can make your host something related to technology too. For example, you can use a microphone or a motherboard, or if you don't want to, use any other object like a clock or window."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change the story up a bit.",
      "content": "Change the story up a bit. Most plots in object shows are about several contestants competing against each other, which may be boring to the viewers. To spice things up a bit, add some conflict or romance into your show, or add something adventurous. Don't include any sex scenes and drugs in your object show unless you're making it 18 and above."
    },
    {
      "title": "Come up with a prize.",
      "content": "Come up with a prize. In every game show/object show, when somebody wins, they always get a sweet prize. Make a glorious prize to give to your winner. For example, it could either be an island (BFDI), a million dollars (II), or you could make it a mystery prize that won't be revealed until the end. Sometimes, everyone is battling for nothing, and it's funny the first few times, but you should probably not do that. Avoid ending the object show on a cliffhanger where the prize will never be found out, or it may anger your viewers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a place to put objects in when they are dead.",
      "content": "Make a place to put objects in when they are dead. In object shows, there are some deaths, so the objects that die need a place to recover. Make one up. Some examples are the Hand-Powered Recovery Center (BFDIA) and the Sky of Recovery (BFIS). Other times, the host may have the ability to revive characters, like Four (and X later)'s ability to revive dead characters in BFB, season 4 of BFDI. Your recovery machine/place can be any object or area around you. You could have no recovery center, and have dead contestants automatically get eliminated, like in Obsolete Battle Show, but I wouldn't recommend this as you may put some limitations onto yourself by doing this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make voting areas and elimination areas.",
      "content": "Make voting areas and elimination areas. In object shows, before the contest starts, they always have a place to find out who will be eliminated and a place for eliminated contestants. For example, in BFDI, the elimination ceremony is called Cake at Stake, where those who were up for voting gather around a designated area and find out who got the most (or least) votes and ended up being eliminated, while the already-eliminated contestants go to the Tiny Loser Chamber and the Locker of Losers. You can name your elimination area and your voting area, but it isn't needed. For example, there isn't really a name for the action of the character simply leaving the competition and being able to go home, and everyone may simply gather around on some random bleachers to watch the elimination."

      "title": "Use an animation program.",
      "content": "Use an animation program. You can use either Adobe Flash or Anime Studio. If you can't use programs like those, use something small like Filpaclip. If you can't animate, you can always make a polished animatic. You could flip through some slides on Google Slides and Powerpoint, and it is also possible to film it in real life by recording a comic, throwing around actual objects, or using paper puppets *cough cough Paper Puppets Season 1*"

      "content": "Get ready for any sort of reaction. Some may love your object show. There are critics all around YouTube, however, and they might find your object shown and hate it. Don't let that hate put you down. Ignore the hate and just move on. Avoid making changes that may worsen your show."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep track of the viewers' voting.",
      "content": "Keep track of the viewers' voting. In every object show, the viewers must vote for who they want to be eliminated next. Keep track of their votes in a notepad. If you don't want to waste your time, create a poll to make things easier."
