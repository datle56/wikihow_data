      "title": "Clip off brown or dying leaves, stems, and petals.",
      "content": "Clip off brown or dying leaves, stems, and petals. Aphids occasionally lay eggs in discolored sections of a plant, so snip them off and throw them out to prevent any future generations of aphids from making it to your garden. You may also want to remove any leaves, stems, or petals that have been heavily damaged by the aphids. If a petal or leaf is covered in tiny little holes, trim it off. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray your roses with a spray bottle or hose in the morning.",
      "content": "Spray your roses with a spray bottle or hose in the morning. Spray your roses with a wide-angle hose attachment first thing in the morning. Set the nozzle on your hose to keep the water flowing as firmly as possible without damaging your roses. While they are obnoxious, aphids aren’t particularly nimble or strong. Send the aphids careening into different parts of your garden by hosing them down with water. [2] X Research source Most aphids do not have wings and will be unable to get back on the rose shrubs once the water rinses them off."

      "title": "Water the underside of the rose leaves carefully.",
      "content": "Water the underside of the rose leaves carefully. Aphids tend to hang out underneath the leaves on a rose plant to stay out of the sun. While watering your plant, place your nozzle low to the ground and angle it upwards to hit the bottom of your plant’s leaves and knock off any aphids that are hiding. [3] X Research source Water the plant from every direction to make sure that you get the underside of every leaf and petal."

      "title": "Repeat this process every day to prevent new aphids from settling in.",
      "content": "Repeat this process every day to prevent new aphids from settling in. Water your roses first thing in the morning for 1-2 weeks. After several days of repeated watering, you should notice that the aphids are either entirely gone, or moving on to another plant. If they aren’t, you may want to consider introducing a predator.

      "title": "Purchase some ladybugs and release them into your garden at night.",
      "content": "Purchase some ladybugs and release them into your garden at night. Purchase 250-1,500 ladybugs from a gardening or pest control store. Refrigerate your bugs for 20-45 minutes and release them late at night to lower the chance that they fly away immediately when you release them. [5] X Research source Ladybugs feed on aphids, and a few ladybugs can go along way when it comes to eliminating pests. [6] X Expert Source Steve Masley Home & Garden Specialist Expert Interview. 20 March 2019. Place your bugs around the base of your rose bushes and wait for them to wake up a little before they get to work. Mist the ladybugs with warm water after you drop them off to incentivize them to stay in your garden. Ladybugs prefer humid environments, so a little water will help keep them in your garden."

      "title": "Set up some bird feeders around your garden to attract birds.",
      "content": "Set up some bird feeders around your garden to attract birds . Consider using this option only if you don’t want more bugs in your garden. If you don’t want to add bugs, set up a few bird feeders around your garden. Add some bird baths and bird houses to make your garden an attractive spot for birds. Wrens, chickadees, and other small birds all love to eat aphids, although it may take them some time to get all of them. [7] X Research source Try to plant a range of birdhouses and birdfeeders around your rose bushes so that the entire perimeter is covered."

      "title": "Plant nectar-secreting flowers near your roses to attract predators.",
      "content": "Plant nectar-secreting flowers near your roses to attract predators. Plant some nectar-secreting flowers within 2–6 feet (0.61–1.83 m) of your roses. The nectar will attract predatory insects, which will stick around your garden looking for prey. If your flowers are close enough to your roses, they’ll start feeding on the aphids. Lacewings, hover flies, and wasps are all-natural predators of the aphid. They also happen to be attracted to nectar-secreting flowers, like cosmos or stonecrop. [8] X Research source If you ever use a pesticide in your garden, you will end up killing the beneficial bugs too. Predatory wasps will sting you. Try to coexist peacefully with wasps, but if you end up with a nest nearby, you may need to get rid of it. Catnip, oregano, fennel, and mint will all attract predatory insects."

      "content": "Create a garlic spray to make a safe repellent. Crush a full head of garlic with a mortar and pestle and steep it in 2 cups (470 mL) of hot water for 24 hours. Strain the garlic with a colander and fill a spray bottle with your garlic-infused water. Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap and put the cap on before shaking it. Spray every section of your rose plant 2-3 times until it’s fully misted in the spray. [9] X Research source Your garlic spray won’t kill any bugs. It will simply make the plant unappealing for aphids and other pests. Make sure that you spray the underside of leaves as well."

      "title": "Spray your roses with neem oil to kill aphids and protect your plants.",
      "content": "Spray your roses with neem oil to kill aphids and protect your plants. Get a spray bottle filled with pure neem oil and spray your aphid-infested plants 2-3 times. Neem oil is a natural pesticide that is distilled from plant seeds, and it will coat the aphids and prevent them from feeding or laying larvae. [10] X Research source Neem oil won’t damage your plants, but it will repel any beneficial bugs as well. Avoid using neem oil if you’ve already released ladybugs or attracted other predators to your garden."

      "title": "Try a simple soap and water mixture for mild infestations.",
      "content": "Try a simple soap and water mixture for mild infestations. [11] X Expert Source Steve Masley Home & Garden Specialist Expert Interview. 20 March 2019. Mix 2–3 tablespoons (30–44 mL) in a spray bottle filled with warm water. Shake the bottle to mix it and spray your infected plants from every direction. Use the widest nozzle setting on your bottle to prevent adding a lot of soap to a small surface area. The soap-water mixture will harm the aphids and ward them away from your roses. [12] X Research source Don’t use water and soap if it’s hotter than 90 °F (32 °C) outside. Your plants will absorb the soap before it has time to evaporate."
