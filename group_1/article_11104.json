If your skin does not react to the nickel, there may be a build-up of dirt or sweat under the ring. In this case, you may just need to clean your ring. One way to determine if it might be an allergic reaction is to consider how long you've been wearing the ring. If you've worn the ring for a long time but are just now having a rash, then it is likely not something in the ring. In that case, it is more likely to be an irritant that has gotten trapped under the ring."
