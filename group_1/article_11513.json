      "content": "Dark Cottagecore is like Cottagecore, but with a darker, edgier twist. It encompasses Cottagecore’s focus on nature, country living, and vintage clothing and decor, but it combines these things with the imagery of witchcraft and dark fairytales. It also focuses on the darker side of nature (gloomy or harsh weather, poisonous plants, spooky forests) as opposed to Cottagecore’s brighter aesthetic (blooming gardens, sunshine, farm animals, etc). This aesthetic is sometimes called Goth Cottagecore or Cottagegore, as well."

      "content": "Vibes & style Dark Cottagecore fashion is inspired by rural life and vintage clothing, but it also has a gothic and witchy flair. For example, if your outfit gives off the vibe that you’re a several-hundred-year-old witch who lives in a cozy cottage in the woods and spends your days tending to your garden of poisonous plants, you’ve achieved the look. Here are some examples of these types of ensembles to inspire you: Dark-colored overalls (with either pants or a skirt at the bottom), layered over a vintage-looking black blouse with lace or embroidered details, witchy gemstone jewelry, ruffled socks, and clogs or boots A jewel-toned velvet dress with a collared neckline, dark-colored lace socks or tights, and pearl or gemstone jewelry A chunky knit sweater paired with a long, flowing skirt (in a dark color or plaid pattern), and worn-looking brown or black boots Brown or plaid loose-fitting trousers, a dark-colored eyelet blouse, and a flowy cape or oversized cardigan"

The greens, reds, oranges, and muted yellows of the leaves, the browns of the tree trunks and mud, and the gray of the rain and fog come together to make the perfect Dark Cottagecore palette."

      "content": "Dark Cottagecore home decor has a witchy and autumnal vibe. Think of a blend of spooky, cozy, and rustic, and you’ve got Dark Cottagecore. The decor features the same color palette as the fashion does (deep browns, greens, purples, burgundies, and black). Vintage furniture and decorative objects are also common, as are natural elements, like fresh or dried plants. Here’s a more detailed breakdown to inspire you: [4] X Research source Wallpaper: Wallpaper in rich, deep colors with dark nature imagery (mushrooms, greenery, poisonous flowers, bugs, animal bones, moon phases) are common. [5] X Research source If you can’t put up wallpaper in your living space, wall art with these motifs also works perfectly! Furniture: Vintage looking furniture is ideal for this aesthetic. Think dark bookshelves , velvet couches , and gothic-looking mirrors . Bedding: Dark-colored bedding with plant patterns works super well with this aesthetic. Solid bedding in the same earthy tones looks amazing, too. Plants: A mix of living green plants and dried bouquets of flowers (either hanging or in a vase) creates the perfect blend of natural and spooky imagery. Decorative objects: Witchy and gothic accents like crystal altars , taxidermy bugs, and tarot cards make great decorative objects for tabletops and nightstands. Candles can also help you create the right dim, atmospheric lighting to go along with your decor."
