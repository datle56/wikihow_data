While the pxCode plugin (and any Figma-to-HTML plugins) can display and export the code from your Figma project, you'll need more than just the code to transform your project into a functional website. Exporting code from Figma can be helpful to developers who are building sites from Figma prototypes, but if you're not a developer, you'll still need the help of one to transform that code into a usable, responsive website."
