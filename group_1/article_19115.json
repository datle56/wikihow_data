There will be 1 to 3 sets of common loot in each Ominous Vault. In the case that no rare loot is given, you will get an extra set of common loot (which means you could get up to 4 sets of common loot). There's an 80% chance for an Ominous Vault to have a set of rare loot. There is a 75% chance for an Ominous Vault to have a set of unique loot. Common loot includes the following: Emerald, Wind Charge, Arrow of Slowness IV, Diamond, Ominous Bottle III - V Rare loot includes the following: Block of Emerald, Enchanted Crossbow, Block of Iron, Golden Apple, Enchanted Diamond Axe, Enchanted Diamond Chestplate, Enchanted Book, Block of Diamond Unique loot includes the following: Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template, Enchanted Golden Apple, Flow Banner Pattern, Music Disc (Creator), Heavy Core"
