Sushi roll cutters come in different sizes, depending on how many sushi rolls you want to cut at once. Sushi roll cutters are tabletop devices that can be set up on your kitchen counter. These use a power source to take an entire roll of sushi and slice it precisely into sections. Sushi roll cutters can be small and gadget sized, which are ideal if you make small quantities of sushi. These devices are also available in larger catering sizes, which can slice multiple rolls at one time. Make sure that you place the sushi roll cutter close to a power source so that the cord can reach. Also, ensure that it is away from any water that may splash as this is dangerous for electrical appliances."

[19] X Research source Using a variety of rice that isn’t sushi rice will also mean that it won’t taste as good. Trying to cut through a sushi roll that isn’t made with the correct rice means that it will be easier for the roll to unwrap, and for the ingredients will fall out as you try to slice through it."
