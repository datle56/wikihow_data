Wash your head and ears once, then wash your feet three times (starting with the right foot). [1] X Research source You can then point your right index finger to the sky and recite a prayer of witness: \"Ash-hadu al laa ilaaha illALLAHu wahdahuu laa shariikalahu, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhuu wa rasuuluh.\" The English translation is, \"I bear witness that there is no deity other than Allah alone; He is One; He has no partner and I bear witness that Muhammad (Peace be upon Him) is His (chosen) servant and (true) Messenger.\" In some cases, you may need to perform Ghusl instead, such as when semen is emitted, or after intercourse."

Raise your hands to your ears while standing and say, “Allah Akbar,” which translates to “Allah is the Greatest,” to open your prayers. Then recite the Istiftah Dua, or opening prayer, followed by the Ta’awwuz and Tasmiah. The Isteftah Dua is: “Subhana Kal-lah hum-ma wabi hamdika wata-baara kasmuka wata'ala jad-duka wala ilaha ghyruk.” This translates to, “Glory be to you, O Allah, and all praises are due unto you, and blessed is your name and high is your majesty and none is worthy of worship but you.” The transliteration of the Ta’awwuz is, “A'udhu bil-lahi minash Shayta-nir-rajeem,” which translates in English to, “I seek Allah's protection from Satan who is accursed.” You only need to recite Ta’awwuz once. The transliteration of the Tasmiah is, “Bismillah hir-Rahma nir-Raheem,” which translates to, “In the name of Allah, the most Kind and the most Merciful.” You should recite Tasmiah before each Surah, or chapter of the Quran, that you recite."
