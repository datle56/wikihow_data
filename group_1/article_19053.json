      "content": "Determine your skin type. People will either have normal, oily, dry, combination, or sensitive skin. While model skin can be achieved regardless of the skin type that you have, your skin care routine should vary based on your type. Tailoring your skin care routine to your skin will ensure that your skin looks as good as possible. Once you determine your skin type , you can choose the products that are best for your skin. Normal skin is neither particularly oily nor particularly dry. It is characterized by small pores, few imperfections, and no severe sensitivity. [1] X Research source People with normal skin can use a wide range of skincare products. Oily skin is characterized by shiny skin and overly dilated pores. [2] X Research source This skin type is more prone to acne. If you have oily skin, you will want to use water-based or oil-free cosmetics, and you may want to consult a dermatologist about creams that can limit the production of oil. [3] X Research source Dry skin is characterized by lack of moisture and often exhibits red patches, dull and/or rough complexion, less elasticity, and more visible lines. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source If you have dry skin, you will need to use mild and gentle cleansers, apply a rich moisturizer, and avoid washing you face with very hot water. [6] X Research source Combination skin is skin that is dry in some areas, but oily in others. A common place to be oily is in the “T-zone”, which consists of the nose, forehead, and chin. In contrast, skin is often dry on the cheeks. Combination skin exhibits large pores, blackheads, and shiny skin. [7] X Research source If you have combination skin, you will want to look at treating the dry and oily regions separately. [8] X Research source Sensitive skin is skin that reacts to ingredients commonly included in commercial skincare products. This hyper-reactive skin often appears red. It is not necessarily considered a skin type, but instead is a common symptom. [9] X Research source People with sensitive skin should use fragrance-free and hypo-allergenic skincare products."

      "content": "Wash skin with a gentle cleanser. For the best results, use a mild, non-detergent cleanser. Many models choose to wash their faces with products that include gentle, plant-derived surfactants, including coconut and fruit sugars, as these have been shown to produce good results. For the best chance of getting model skin, wash your skin thoroughly in the morning when you wake up as well as at night before you go to sleep. Look for cleansers with natural, earth-based ingredients. These will be kinder to your skin than many products with strong chemicals. If you have acne-prone skin, chose a cleanser that is specially designed to reduce the occurrence and appearance of acne. In particular, look for products that contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide; these ingredients can help clear acne."

      "title": "Apply a moisturizer.",
      "content": "Apply a moisturizer. Moisturizing is an important part of getting model skin. You should use a moisturizer on a daily basis. Choose one that has plant-based moisturizers: these include natural oils, butters, and essential fatty acids. Also, make sure that there is a nonirritating sunscreen in your moisturizer (most commonly zinc oxide or titanium dioxide). By using moisturizer daily, you are trapping moisture in your skin which can help your skin look brighter and younger by reducing the appearance of fine lines. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, make sure your moisturizer is oil-free. Any oil-based ingredients can make skin look overly shiny, block pores, and worsen acne. Moisturizing is especially essential if you have dry skin! Because your skin lacks normal levels of moisture, you must be sure to apply a moisturizer at least once a day to maintain healthy skin."

[10] X Expert Source Joanna Kula Licensed Esthetician Expert Interview. 9 July 2019. Not only does exposure to ultraviolet rays increase your risk of skin cancers, but it can also result in smaller issues, including broken blood vessels and brown spots. [11] X Research source In order to get model skin, wear sunscreen religiously, even if you’re not planning on spending time in the sun. As much as 80% of the sun’s rays can pass through clouds. This means that it is essential to wear sunscreen even if it is cloudy. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 every day.

      "title": "Try a facemask.",
      "content": "Try a facemask. For model skin, try using a facemask that will infuse essential nutrients into your skin while also cleansing and clarifying your pores. The best part of using facemasks for model skin is that they are easy to make at home with the right ingredients. Examine your skin for any issues you may be having and make the appropriate facemask. For example, if you have particularly dry or particularly acne-prone skin, you will want to use different ingredients in your mask to make sure that your skin comes out as beautiful as possible. Realize what facemasks will do for each skin condition. A hydrating facemask will restore moisture balance to your skin, a clarifying facemask will have anti-acne effects, a revitalizing or whitening facemask will have a lightening effect, and an exfoliating facemask will clear away oil and impurities."

A trusted doctor, dermatologist, or skincare professional can provide advice regarding which filler may be best for you."

      "title": "Choose the right foundation.",
      "content": "Choose the right foundation. A good foundation is one that contains silicone, which will help “fill in” your skin. Avoid any foundations that are identified as luminous or matte- these have been known to make skin look unnatural. Instead, choose foundations identified by words such as “lightweight” or “sheer.” Lightweight foundations will make your skin appear smooth and glowing without feeling like you’re wearing a mask. Know your skin tone. A foundation that is too light or too dark will make you look like you are wearing makeup (and the secret to model skin is to look like you are makeup free). To determine the optimal foundation skin for your skin, test various foundation shades on the inside of your wrist or on your neck- this will help you to figure out the tone of your complexion. If you have a red tint to your skin, get rid of it with a yellow-based foundation."

For optimal results, place two dots on your forehead, one on the tip of your nose, one on each side of your nose, and one on your chin. Make sure you blend in this foundation thoroughly with your fingers for a natural look."

Choose a bronzer that works with your skin tone and is no more than two shades darker than your skin color. [19] X Research source Apply the bronzer to areas of your face (such as your nose, forehead, and cheeks) that would tan in the sunlight, and make sure it is blended in evenly to the surrounding skin."

[25] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Having model skin requires you to take care of your whole body to keep your skin looking its best. In order to consume more vitamin C, include foods such as citrus fruits, strawberries, papaya, pineapple, Brussel sprouts, red or green bell peppers, kale, and broccoli in your diet. Alternatively, consider taking a daily multi-vitamin that contains your daily requirement of vitamin C. To lessen your consumption of processed or refined carbohydrates, substitute whole grains into your diet instead. Whole grains, including brown rice, millet, quinoa, and whole wheat, contain glycosaminoglycans, substances that help your skin to build collagen and elastin fibers essential for keeping firm and taut skin."
