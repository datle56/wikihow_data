      "content": "Fill out a Petition for Emancipation. In most jurisdictions, either you or your parents can file a petition for your emancipation, with or without the assistance of a lawyer. Contact the Circuit Court in your jurisdiction and ask for a petition, then fill it out along with any other forms you are required to provide. This could include: [1] X Research source Writing an affidavit to the petition, which is a description of your reasons for filing it. Writing a financial statement describing your personal financial situation. Getting a verification of employment from your job, to ensure you can pay your bills. Getting an affidavit, or description, from either your parents or an adult who knows you personally and believes emancipation to be in your best interest. This could include your physician, social worker, psychologist, teacher, school counselor, school administrator, or minister."

Filing fees vary from state to state, but are generally between $150 and $200. Filing fees are required whether or not a judge grants your emancipation. If you cannot pay the filing fee, ask for a fee waiver form from court staff when you turn in your paperwork. [2] X Research source"

Your parents or guardian will be given notice that they may also attend if they want to. [3] X Research source If you have enough money, hire a lawyer to speed and help improve your chances of getting emancipated. Search for a family lawyer who has experience in emancipation so they can guide you through the process. The court will make sure that you have a job to support yourself financially. Your parents or guardian will have the chance to object to your petition if they wish, and explain their reasons for doing so. In some cases, an investigation will be conducted. If your parents or guardian are found to be providing an acceptable home, and do not wish for you to be emancipated, your petition may be rejected. If the evidence presented is found to be true, your case will move forward, and a court hearing will be scheduled."

At the court hearing, you as the minor are responsible for proving that your parents either approve of emancipation or aren't supporting you, that you have the ability to manage your financial and social affairs, and that you understand your rights and responsibilities. To do this, explain your situation clearly, and offer up copies of the paperwork you gathered for your petition earlier. If you are able to provide proof that is acceptable to the Court, emancipation will be granted, and will be kept on file with the Court until you are 25. If you or your parents object to the decision, either to grant you emancipation or not, you may file an appeal with the Court of Appeals."

Once you have gained emancipation, you are responsible for living entirely without the help of other adults — this includes dealing with your new financial obligations (like rent). You are no longer legally required to rely on your parents for assistance, so it's important to do well at your job and keep up with your bills to create a stable life on your own.

If you are already financially independent and have been managing your own money as well as living apart from your parents, a judge is very likely to emancipate you. You must prove to the court that you have a stable income and are managing your money wisely without any help from your parents or guardians. [7] X Research source There are many reasons why you might be living apart from your parents or guardians, including: your parents or guardians have told you that you cannot live with them, your parents or guardians are physically or sexually abusive, the situation at your parents' or guardian's home is morally repugnant to you, or your parents or guardians have stolen your money."

      "content": "Look into the alternatives to emancipation. It’s not easy to take on the legal rights and responsibilities of an adult at an early age. Many teenagers don't have the resources to pay for rent, clothes, and groceries without assistance, and a judge won't grant emancipation unless you show you can take care of yourself. In addition, gaining emancipation can cause a permanent rift in a family, and should only be pursued when no good alternatives exist. [11] X Research source Consider talking to your school counselor or a trusted adult friend about your options. They may be able to mediate an agreement between you and your parents that would help you feel comfortable living under their guardianship until you reach age 18. If you don't want to live with your parents anymore, and your reason is that you don't get along with them or you disagree with their rules, you're probably better off staying with a relative or friend for a while instead of pursuing legal emancipation. If you are in an abusive situation, emancipation still might not be the best choice, since emancipated individuals can no longer be aided by Child Protective Services. Contacting your state's Child Protective Services might be the option that better meets your needs."

Look in the classified section of your local newspaper for jobs that don't require a high school diploma if you don’t have one yet. Save as much of your money as you can.
