      "title": "Use a stencil",
      "content": "Use a stencil and paint to create designs on the umbrella. You can find lots of different stencils at a craft store, allowing you to stencil in things such as animals, lettering, shapes, or designs onto the umbrella. Place the stencil over the opened umbrella and use a foam brush to gently dab fabric paint over the stencil to create the design. [1] X Research source Use a stencil with flowers to create a floral design on the umbrella, or opt for a chevron stencil to paint a design around the edge of the umbrella. Buy stencils in different fonts to create unique wording. Pour the paint onto a paper plate and dab at it with a foam brush for easy application."

      "content": "Paint stripes around the edge of the umbrella for a simple fix. Place painter’s tape around the umbrella so that it's parallel to the edge, cutting the tape into strips so that it's easier to work with. Once you’ve created stripes around the entire umbrella using the tape, use a paint brush or foam brush to apply fabric paint to the umbrella where the stripes should go. [2] X Research source Press down on the painter’s tape firmly after you apply it to make sure the paint doesn’t go up under the edges of the tape by accident as you’re painting. For example, if you want one stripe near the outermost edge, apply 2 rings of painter's tape around the entire umbrella roughly 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) apart from each other. Apply the paint in between each strip of tape to form the stripe. For example, paint one white stripe around a black umbrella, or 3-5 multi-colored stripes."

      "content": "Scatter the umbrella with polka dots for a cute look. Use a stencil or round foam brush to make circles, or choose to paint the polka dots freehand onto the umbrella. Place the polka dots on the umbrella so that they’re evenly distributed, either in one solid color or in lots of different colors. [3] X Research source Paint gold polka dots all over the umbrella, or create a rainbow polka dot umbrella using red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple."

      "title": "Create designs using a brush and fabric paint for a unique umbrella.",
      "content": "Create designs using a brush and fabric paint for a unique umbrella. Purchase fabric paint in a variety of colors and squeeze the paint onto a paper plate. Use a paint brush or foam brush to apply the paint to the open umbrella however you’d like, creating patterns, symbols, or pictures. [4] X Research source For example, decorate the umbrella to look like a slice of fruit or paint white fluffy clouds all over the umbrella. If you’re painting multiple layers of fabric paint on the umbrella, wait about an hour for each layer to dry completely before adding the next one. Write on the umbrella with puffy fabric paint that comes in a squeezable bottle to create unique wording."

      "title": "Write on the umbrella using permanent markers to personalize it.",
      "content": "Write on the umbrella using permanent markers to personalize it. This works especially well if the umbrella is a light color, such as clear plastic, white, or a pastel. Find permanent markers in a variety of colors and start drawing your designs, going slowly and carefully so that you don’t make a mistake. [5] X Research source Plan out your marker design on a scrap piece of paper beforehand, if desired. Draw a mandala on the umbrella using a black permanent marker. Use different colored markers to draw a scene, such as the beach or mountains. Design wording using the permanent markers."

      "content": "Glue foam letters or shapes onto the umbrella for a kid’s craft. Purchase foam letters from a craft or big box store, as well as waterproof glue. Squirt glue onto the back of the foam letter, distributing it evenly so that the edges of the foam letter won’t curl up. Once the letters have glue on them, place them carefully on the open umbrella. It’s a good idea to lay out your wording before you go to glue the foam letters onto the umbrella to plan the spacing. Press the letters onto the umbrella firmly so that they adhere well. Create an umbrella that has the ABC's on it or form wording on your umbrella, such as \"Rain, Rain, Go Away.\""

      "content": "Add lace to the umbrella for a sophisticated look. Glue lace onto the umbrella using waterproof or hot glue, or choose to sew the lace to the umbrella using a needle and thread. You can find a variety of different laces at a craft store or online in different colors, thicknesses, and textures. [6] X Research source Place a strand of lace around the entire edge of the umbrella before covering the metal ribs with lace as well. Pick out 3 or 4 different kinds of lace and sew them around the umbrella in rings."

      "content": "Attach embroidery embellishments to the umbrella to add flair. Things such as pom poms, fabric snippets, and embroidery patches look lovely when applied to an umbrella. Sew the fabric or embroidery patches so that they won't come loose, or use hot glue to attach the pom poms. [7] X Research source Purchase ribbon that has pom poms hanging off of it to make attaching the pom poms to the umbrella super easy. Create a patchwork umbrella by sewing or gluing different types of fabric all over the umbrella."

      "title": "Use sequins or glitter to add sparkles to the umbrella.",
      "content": "Use sequins or glitter to add sparkles to the umbrella. If you’re attaching large sequins that are larger than your fingernails, it’s best to put hot glue or waterproof glue directly on the back of the sequin before sticking it to the umbrella. If you’re using fine glitter, apply the waterproof wet glue to the umbrella in a design and then sprinkle the glitter on top of the glue. [8] X Research source You may need to hold larger sequins in place for a minute or two to ensure they don’t move around while drying. Once you’ve sprinkled glitter over the wet design, shake off the excess glitter to reveal your final product. Use a paint brush to cover the entire umbrella in glue before sprinkling gold glitter over the umbrella, or use a glue gun to attach rainbow sequins to the umbrella in a pattern such as stripes or polka dots."

      "content": "Glue fake flowers onto the umbrella to imitate nature. Pick out flowers that you like from a craft store, cutting them off of the stem and using hot glue to attach them to the surface of the umbrella. You can cover the entire umbrella in flowers, put them around the edge of the umbrella, or create a pattern using different colors. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that you won't be able to close the umbrella once flowers are attached to it. Glue red roses around the outer edge of the umbrella, or pick out fake daisies in several different colors and attach them to the umbrella in a polka dot-fashion. This is a great decoration for weddings or bridal showers."
