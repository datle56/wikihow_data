      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. For this type of smoke bubble you’ll need a few more supplies, but you won’t jeopardize your lungs with this one. You will need the following: Dry ice Hammer Dish soap or bubble liquid Graduated cylinder or a similar container Heavy rubber gloves"
    },
    {
      "title": "Prep your container.",
      "content": "Prep your container. Fill whatever container you decide to use with warm water. Add enough water to reach just below the halfway mark on your container. A good alternative to a graduated cylinder is a clear flower vase. The water shouldn’t be boiling, but it shouldn’t be at room temperature. Somewhere in between the two will work.

    {
      "title": "Prepare the dry ice.",
      "content": "Prepare the dry ice. Place the heavy gloves on your hands before handling dry ice. Use a hammer to break up a larger piece of dry ice so that it will fit into your container. Handle this on a clean surface and be sure small scraps don’t land on your family dog."

      "title": "Add the ice to the water.",
      "content": "Add the ice to the water. As you break up the dry ice, add it to the container filled with warm water. Don’t add all your dry ice on the first test. [2] X Research source Once you add dry ice, it will react to the warm water and produce smoke . The smoke will rise up and appear to overflow out of the container."

      "title": "Add soap to the mix.",
      "content": "Add soap to the mix. Now to create smoke bubbles, add a generous portion (about a quarter of a cup) of either dish detergent or bubble liquid. Now your bubbling concoction has real bubbles floating out. Continue to add dry ice as it melts and watch your smoke bubbles flourish. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Create the bubble liquid.",
      "content": "Create the bubble liquid. You’ll need to either buy bubble liquid or create your own using dish detergent. Fill a glass or small jar with a 1:1 solution of water and dish detergent. Mix the solution and be sure it is ready before lighting up. It’s also helpful if you have a bubble wand handy. These typically come with bubble liquid."

      "title": "Light a cigarette.",
      "content": "Light a cigarette. Light your cigarette with a match or lighter. Fill your mouth with smoke, but don't swallow or inhale it. You may need to puff the cigarette a few times to ensure it is fully lit."

      "title": "Dunk your straw or wand.",
      "content": "Dunk your straw or wand. Place a straw into the liquid bubble solution. Again, the bubble wand creates bubbles easier than a straw. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Blow into the bubble. Hold the straw between your lips and slowly blow. Do not release the smoke as one might normally because the smoke will come out too fast and ruin the bubble. A curved bubble should form. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Light the hookah. Fill your hookah with fresh water. This can be a long process so you might as well start this first. Gather your wet tobacco blend into the hookah's holder and cover with tinfoil. Create a few holes in the center of the tinfoil. Set a coal on top of the holes and light with a lighter. [6] X Research source You may need to inhale a few times to initiate the lighting process."

      "content": "Gather hookah smoke. Puff your hookah a few times to ensure that the smoke is coming out to the fullest. When the smoke is bold, meaning it is thick, you’re ready to blow your bubbles. Take a large mouthful of hookah smoke and don’t inhale or exhale, but hold it in your mouth."

      "content": "Form your bubble. Take one end of the straw and dunk it into the bubble solution. Be sure that liquid is formed on the edge of the straw. Exhale into the dry end of the straw slowly. If you’re successful, a bubble should slowly form, filled with smoke. [7] X Research source"
