      "content": "He spends more time away from home. When your partner gets a new job or picks up a new hobby, spending more weekends away from you might be normal.

      "content": "He pays more attention to his appearance. If your spouse starts exercising and eating healthier out of nowhere, or if he’s never been obsessive about his appearance but now wears fashionable clothes and regularly checks himself out in the mirror, it might be a sign he’s trying to appear more attractive for someone else.

      "content": "He lies to you about a variety of things. Marriage is all about building trust. [15] X Research source If you constantly catch your husband in lies, it might be because he’s hiding something bigger. Likewise, if he flips the script and tries to gaslight you into thinking you’re forgetful or delusional to cover up his lies, he might be cheating. [16] X Research source Watch for these signs of gaslighting: [17] X Research source Your husband makes you feel forgetful when you haven’t forgotten anything. You feel like you’re always questioning your sanity. You’re afraid to confront him about his behavior. Your partner gets nervous when you ask him where he was or who he was with.

      "content": "He accuses you of cheating on him. When someone feels guilty about something they’ve done, they sometimes project those feelings onto their partner and accuse them of doing the same thing.

[18] X Research source Keep an eye out for the following signs of cheating: [19] X Research source You’re irrationally accused by your husband of cheating. When you talk about his behavior, he questions you or turns the conversation into an argument. He’s suspicious of your behavior and says you’re the one acting strange."

      "content": "You have significantly more, less, or different sex. Both decreased and increased sex drive can be a sign of infidelity. Your partner might initiate sex less if he’s focused on someone else, or might show more interest in sex if he’s trying to cover up his affair. These changes might also be a sign that he’s seeing someone else: [20] X Research source There’s less emotional connection in the bedroom. He’s introducing new techniques or activities that were never there before. You have almost no sex life together. You have a sexually transmitted infection and you have not slept with anyone new.

      "content": "You find unexplained expenses or fight more often about money. Cheating costs money, and any gifts, dinners, or hotel rooms can add up quickly. If you’re noticing unexplained credit card charges or there’s suddenly less money in your accounts, then it could be a sign of infidelity. [22] X Research source Look for these other signs of cheating: You see large cash withdrawals in your shared bank account statements. You find evidence of purchases from places you don’t shop from.

      "content": "His technology use has changed. Licensed professional counselor Tara Vossenkemper says one of the telltale signs of cheating is if “all of a sudden, they take their phone with them all the time. They hide it. They change the password.” This might be because what’s on their phone may reveal their infidelity, like text messages or phone calls. These other changes might also be a sign of cheating: [27] X Research source He panics when he can’t find his phone. He’s unreachable at certain times of the day when he was reachable before. He stays up late on the computer after you go to bed. He hides his phone or computer from you or refuses to let you use them. He’s always texting or stepping out to make phone calls. He stops using any devices you share and turns off cloud sharing. He takes his phone everywhere with him, including in the bathroom when he showers.

      "content": "Something in your gut tells you he’s cheating on you. If you even suspect that your partner might be cheating, psychotherapist Kelli Miller says to listen to that feeling. “I'm a huge fan on intuition and trusting your gut,” She says. “So typically, if there is a question, that says… that something is missing, some sort of trust is missing.” If your husband’s behavior suddenly strikes you as suspicious, it might be time to have a talk with him. [28] X Research source Matchmaker and dating coach Michelle Jacoby says “Usually our bodies know when things aren't right and sometimes, we listen to our brains more than we listen to our gut instinct and sometimes the gut is very revealing.”"

      "title": "Try to avoid looking for evidence unless you have to.",
      "content": "Try to avoid looking for evidence unless you have to. Although it can be tempting to look through your husband’s phone or follow him around, licensed social worker Raffi Bilek says that’s probably not the best way to confront him. “The antidote to secrecy and lying is transparency and honesty,” He says. “Trying to catch someone [in the act]… does not usually end well for relationships.” Trust is sacred. If you snoop through his things without his permission, it may be harder to repair that trust if you decide to stay together. [29] X Research source If you do discover evidence of infidelity, try to avoid making any rash decisions or taking revenge. Take a deep breath and consider the potential consequences before doing anything irreversible. [30] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask your husband directly if he’s cheating on you.",
      "content": "Ask your husband directly if he’s cheating on you. There’s no for-sure way to confirm that your husband is cheating without asking. Miller says to “sit down with your partner and just say, ‘Hey, I'm having some fears that you're going outside the relationship, can we talk about this in an open and honest way?’” Then, see where the conversation goes from there. Try “to go in with neutral intent because we don't know the other side of the story,” Miller suggests. “[It] could be a really big misunderstanding.” Miller also says “If you did, in fact, find out that your partner did cheat, then I highly suggest coming into couples counseling so that you have a really safe space to explore all that is going on.”"

      "content": "Focus on self-care and seek support from family and friends. If your husband has cheated, it can trigger powerful emotions that can make it hard to make long-term decisions. While you’re dealing with the affair, take care of yourself and consider sharing what happened with trusted loved ones who can support and encourage you during this time. [31] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Get plenty of sleep, drink lots of water, and exercise regularly .

      "content": "Give each other space and figure out a plan to move forward. Try not to go into the intimate details of the affair with your husband right away—instead, give yourselves space to think about what happened, understand the cause of the affair, and heal. If you decide to work through the affair and rebuild trust, seek help from a licensed marriage counselor. [34] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you decide to separate from or divorce your husband, lean on your family and friends. Consider meeting with a therapist who can help you work through the breakup. If you decide to stay, make a plan to restore trust in your relationship. That might mean he has to end the affair and be completely transparent about what he does or where he goes. [35] X Research source Whatever you choose to do, make sure to keep taking care of yourself and your mental health. [36] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 199 wikiHow readers and 70% said that for them, a partner cheating would be a dealbreaker .
