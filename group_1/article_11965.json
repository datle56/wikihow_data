      "content": "Boredom - Your pup likes hanging out with you and doing things, but they’ll make their own fun if you don’t interact with them. Licking is stimulating, so your dog may start licking if they’ve got nothing to do. Alternatively, your dog may lick you to get your attention and play. [1] X Research source If they stop when you engage with them, they’re just bored.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Spend a few minutes playing with your dog until they get tuckered out. Take your dog on a walk or go into a training session to give your pup something to do. If this is a consistent issue, your dog may simply need more daily interaction."

      "content": "Anxiety - Dogs get a little endorphin kick when they lick something, so if your pup licks things when loud noises go off or you have visitors over, they’re probably just anxious. This is an extremely common self-soothing technique. [3] X Research source If your dog is frequently anxious, help keep them calm by giving them somewhere to calm down and letting them relax."

      "title": "Allergies -",
      "content": "Allergies - If you just changed foods, it’s allergy season, or you’ve adopted a new dog and your dog is licking their paws like there’s no tomorrow, the cause is probably allergies. Allergies in dogs typically result in a skin irritation, rather than sneezing or a runny nose. Since a dog’s paws are the most sensitive part of their body, dogs will usually lick their paws when they’re having an allergic reaction. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source The other sensitive area when dogs have allergies are the ears. If your dog is also pawing at their ears or they keep getting ear infections, it’s very likely to be allergies. Treating your dog for allergies may require antibiotics, steroids, anti-itch products, dietary changes, or trigger avoidance."

      "title": "Nausea -",
      "content": "Nausea - If your dog licks at the air or they keep licking their lips over and over again, it’s likely that your pup is trying to get rid of excess saliva. That’s a big sign their tummy isn’t feeling well. This may or may not be a big deal depending on the cause, but your pup is probably fine if they feel better after vomiting or napping. [5] X Research source Causes of gastrointestinal discomfort and nausea include: allergies, minor bugs, excessive play, liver disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, inflamed bowels, and intestinal problems. Dogs will also lick their lips when they’re hungry. If you haven’t fed your senior dog recently, see if the licking stops once they finish eating. Your vet may order tests to diagnose this, including x-rays, abdominal ultrasounds, blood tests, skin allergy testing, or even endoscopy, if necessary."

      "title": "Neurological conditions -",
      "content": "Neurological conditions - Excessive licking, primarily among senior dogs, may be a sign of neurological issues, like a brain tumor, epilepsy, or hydrocephalus. Signs that an old dog’s licking is neurological include circling in place, head pressing against walls, seizures, and motor issues, like stumbling. [6] X Research source It is likely neurological if it’s extremely difficult to interrupt the compulsive licking. If your dog is just behaving erratically and something seems “off,” take them to the vet as soon as you reasonably can to get a diagnosis."

      "title": "Dementia -",
      "content": "Dementia - Old dogs can experience cognitive decline the same way people do. Dementia is a common cause of excessive licking behaviors in senior dogs. Other indicators of cognitive dysfunction may include disorientation, irritability, decreased desire to play, inability to learn new tasks, decreased self-grooming, incontinence, and loss of appetite. [7] X Research source Diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction should be made by a vet. They will go through the dog's history and current symptoms with you to see if this may be the cause of your dog's licking. While there is no cure for cognitive dysfunction, therapy, medication, and support can help your dog maintain a normal life and may help reduce some symptoms."

It could be nothing (and it probably is nothing), but there’s always a chance it’s something that requires treatment. Schedule a vet appointment and take your pup in for a checkup.

      "content": "Remove any triggers that lead to excessive licking. If your pup tends to lick certain items (for whatever reason—dementia, boredom, etc.), simply remove those objects so your dog can’t lick them. If it’s a noise or food that triggers the licking, minimize their exposure. Not allowing your pup to lick things repeatedly should put a dent in their behavior. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source For example, does your dog lick while you are out of the house? Perhaps this is a result of separation anxiety. Try leaving the TV on or hiring a dog walker to stop by! Maybe they stop and lick themselves when you say “come” because they are unsure if they will be scolded or praised. Try switching to just calling their name. Try and determine the pattern associated with the compulsive behavior and treat accordingly."

      "content": "Create a comforting environment for your old dog. The happier your dog is in their home, the less likely they’ll be to lick when they’re bored, anxious, or unsure. Try to create a comforting environment—especially when you leave. There are a number of things you can do to reduce your dog’s stress and anxiety while they are left alone. [10] X Research source Try these tips: Give them a treat occasionally to occupy their attention and reward good behavior. Provide music and lighting to stimulate them while they are alone. Leave them with plenty of comfortable blankets and dog beds . Give your pup plenty of toys and interaction."

Take them on at least 3 walks a day, move around with them in the yard, or play to keep them moving.
