      "content": "Apply baking soda or toothpaste containing baking soda. Baking soda is great at breaking down the dye's active ingredients and is only mildly abrasive. It will act like an all natural scrub for your hands and your hairline. [2] X Research source However, if you have sensitive skin, only apply a little baking soda mixed with water to your skin and rub lightly. If your skin turns red or feels irritated, try a different method. You can add lemon juice to the baking soda and water for a more powerful all natural stain remover."

      "content": "Use olive oil, baby oil, or an oil-based moisturizer. Most commercial dyes will break down when you apply oil-based products on them and lift off of your skin. Olive oil, baby oil, or an oil-based moisturizer all work well to help remove dye. They are also good options if you have sensitive skin. [3] X Research source Dip a cotton ball into the oil and rub it on the dyed area on your skin for several minutes. Rinse it off with warm water. Check if the dye is still on your skin. If so, apply the oil-based product again and let it soak for a longer period of time before rubbing and washing off the oil. You can also leave the baby oil or olive oil on your dyed skin overnight to allow the oil to break down the dye. Place a towel over your pillow so you do not get dye on your pillow case. Rinse the oil and the dye off in the morning with warm water. [4] X Research source"

Use unscented dish soap for the skin on your face if you do not have sensitive skin. [5] X Research source Place a small amount of detergent on a damp wash cloth and rub it on your dyed skin. If you think detergent will be too harsh for your skin, use a small amount of dish soap on a damp wash cloth to try to rub off the dye on your skin. If you notice any redness or skin irritation, stop using the mixture. Soap can dry out your skin. Make sure you apply a moisturizer right after you're finished.

Apply the product with your fingers around your hairline, behind your ears, and on the back of your neck so its more difficult for dye to get on your skin in these areas. Petroleum jelly is a great moisturizer, so you won't have to worry about it drying out your skin.
