      "content": "Take your key to a hardware store if there's one close to you. Many hardware stores or big box stores offer a key-cutting service that only takes a few minutes to complete. Pick a blank replacement key in the design you want and ask the workers to make a copy. Make sure the key design you choose matches the thickness of the original key, or else it will not fit in the lock."

      "content": "Stop by a key-cutting kiosk for a quick experience. KeyMe is a service that places kiosks in various locations that can make a copy of a key. Common keys can be cut right at the kiosk while car keys or other specialty keys will be sent to you by mail. Find a KeyMe location near you to quickly get a copy made. KeyMe will give you a code that can be used to create new keys in the future. Use the code cut of your key for a replacement. The keys produced from codes will be factory cuts on the new key, not a duplicate. Scan the key into the phone app for ordering a spare key at home."

      "content": "Go to a dealership to get a copy of a car key . Many car keys have transponder chips in them so duplicates cannot be cut normally. Find a dealership with your model of car and ask about their replacement key services. Older vehicles may just need a copy of the key without a chip. Ask the dealership what is required for your specific make and model."

      "content": "Hold the teeth on one side of the key over an open flame until they are charred. Use a lighter or a lit candle. Move the teeth of the key back and forth over the flame for 1 to 2 minutes. Once the key is charred on one side, set it down until it is cool to the touch. [1] X Research source Use a pair of pliers to hold the key so you don’t burn your fingers."

      "title": "Stick a piece of clear tape on the blackened side of the key.",
      "content": "Stick a piece of clear tape on the blackened side of the key. Cut a piece of standard sized clear tape the same length as the key. Carefully lay it on top of the key so it doesn’t crease. Press the tape firmly onto the blackened side of the key so the char transfers. [2] X Research source The outline of the key will transfer to the sticky side of the tape, leaving a perfect impression. Leave a fingertip-sized bit of tape at the end of the key so it’s easier to remove."

      "title": "Remove the tape slowly after 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Remove the tape slowly after 10 seconds. Peel the tape back, being sure that it doesn’t fold or crease. The char will leave residue on the sticky side of the tape in the same shape as the key. [3] X Research source Use rubbing alcohol to remove any residual char from the key. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the tape on an expired credit card or plastic gift card.",
      "content": "Place the tape on an expired credit card or plastic gift card. A standard thickness card will work best. Stick the tape so the entire imprint of the key is on the card. Make sure the tape lays flat so the shape of the teeth is not distorted. [5] X Research source Place the tape away from any raised letters or numbers on the card. Otherwise, it will be too thick to fit in the lock. Use a light-colored card so you can easily see the imprint of the key. For a slightly more durable method, use a bottle cap. Use pliers to un-crease the edges and make the cap flat."

      "content": "Cut out the shape of the key with a pair of scissors. Carefully maneuver around the outline of the key. Be mindful around the teeth, being sure to cut directly on the outline. If the teeth are not close to the correct size, they will not be able to turn the lock. [6] X Research source It doesn’t matter how the large end of the key is shaped. As long as the teeth are cut correctly, the key should work. Hold the original key up to the one you’re cutting out to compare the teeth. If you’re using a bottle cap, use a metal file to cut out the imprint of the key."

      "content": "Turn the makeshift key slowly in the lock. Insert the key delicately into the lock so it doesn’t bend or deform. Once it’s fully inserted, hold the key as close to the lock as you can and turn it to unlock the door. [7] X Research source Don’t force the key to turn, or else it may bend or break. A key made from a credit card or other materials like this is fine in a pinch, but shouldn’t be used forever. Use the method below to make an actual spare key that you can keep long-term."
