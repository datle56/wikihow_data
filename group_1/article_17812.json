      "title": "Grip the tip of the pen between your thumb and index finger.",
      "content": "Grip the tip of the pen between your thumb and index finger. To start the trick, pinch the tip of the pen so the barrel faces toward your other fingers. Hold the pen gently with your index finger and thumb. [1] X Research source Use your dominant hand so you have more control over the pen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rest the pen on your middle finger.",
      "content": "Rest the pen on your middle finger. Position the pen across your middle finger so your ring finger touches the pen slightly from below. [2] X Research source Your pinky placement does not affect the trick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move your middle finger lightly to push the pen.",
      "content": "Move your middle finger lightly to push the pen. Just a small amount of force is all you need to get the pen to move. When you do this, the pen starts to flip over your finger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust your thumb and index finger as you move the pen.",
      "content": "Adjust your thumb and index finger as you move the pen. While moving your middle finger, slide your thumb completely off of the pen and move your index finger out of the way. This way, the pen can easily flip over your middle finger."

    {
      "title": "Bring the pen back around with your index finger.",
      "content": "Bring the pen back around with your index finger. Once your pen flips over your middle finger, catch the pen with your index finger. Then, bring it back into its original position. Do this quickly in 1 consecutive motion. [3] X Research source Your index finger acts as a guide for the pen when doing this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Catch the pen in between your index finger and thumb.",
      "content": "Catch the pen in between your index finger and thumb. To nail the trick, let the pen slide in between your thumb and index finger after it flips over your middle finger. Since the pen already has momentum, it should easily fall into place. [4] X Research source At this point, the tip of the pen should be in between your thumb and index finger, and the rest of the pen should face toward your other fingers."

    {
      "title": "Hold the pen between your index finger and thumb as if you’re writing.",
      "content": "Hold the pen between your index finger and thumb as if you’re writing. This is similar to the position used when flipping the pen over your middle finger, but the pen is facing the opposite direction with this trick. Use any pen that feels right to you."

      "title": "Slide your pointer finger along the pen.",
      "content": "Slide your pointer finger along the pen. In order to flip the pen over your finger, move it out of the way to get it into position. Move your finger about 1 in (2.5 cm) or so."

      "title": "Push the pen slightly with your index finger to flip it over your thumb.",
      "content": "Push the pen slightly with your index finger to flip it over your thumb. After you slide your finger down the pen, tap the pen gently in order to make it move. With just a little force, the pen should flip over your thumb. All you need is a light tap. If you use too much force, the pen may go flying."

    {
      "title": "Catch the pen in between your middle finger and thumb.",
      "content": "Catch the pen in between your middle finger and thumb. After the pen flips around your thumb, bring your thumb down to stop it on your middle finger. Keep your index finger out of the way as you do this. This trick is known as the \"Thumbaround.\" This way, the pen does not keep flipping off your hand."

    {
      "title": "Hold the pen at the center in between your middle and index finger.",
      "content": "Hold the pen at the center in between your middle and index finger. When doing this trick, you want the pen to be balanced on both sides to start. Keep the tip of the pen facing outwards and the end of the pen facing towards you. [5] X Research source This way, the pen can easily slide in between all of your fingers."

      "title": "Bend your ring finger and pinky so they are out of the way.",
      "content": "Bend your ring finger and pinky so they are out of the way. If you don’t bend your other fingers, they will intercept the pen when you flip it. Simply bring them toward your palm so you can easily flip the pen. [6] X Research source"

Bring the tip of the pen upwards, and rotate it around toward you. As you do this, secure it between your middle and ring finger.

      "content": "Move your index and middle finger outward so they don’t block the flip. To do your next pass, bend your middle and index finger toward the palm of the hand. This way, your middle finger is in position to grab your pen during the next flip. [8] X Research source If you don’t bend your fingers, you won’t be able to grip the pen during the next pass."
