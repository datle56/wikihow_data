We can use this to count the first two numbers just as you would expect: 0 = zero 1 = one For higher numbers, you can ignore the earlier digits of the number. 101 0 + 1 = 101 1 ."

Add a \"1\" to the front of the number, and \"reset\" all the other digits to 0. [3] X Research source 0 = zero 1 = one 10 = two This is the same rule we use in decimal when we run out of symbols (9 + 1 = 10). It just happens a lot more often in binary because we run out of symbols sooner."

[9] X Research source Here's an example: What is the binary number 10011 in decimal? The rightmost digit is 1. This is in the ones place, so multiply by one: 1 x 1 = 1. The next digit is also 1. Multiply this by two: 1 x 2 = 2. The next digit is 0. Multiply this by four: 0 x 4 = 0. The next digit is also 0. Multiply this by eight: 0 x 8 = 0. The leftmost digit is 1.
