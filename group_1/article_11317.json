      "content": "Cut your hair horizontally 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) longer than desired. Your first cut doesn’t have to be perfect, as you are simply removing the extra hair off the bottom. Make your cuts about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) longer than you want your hair to be in the end so that you can make finishing touches to clean up your ends. Do this for the back section of your hair first, and use a mirror to help you make straight cuts or ask a trustworthy friend or family member to help you with the back section. [3] X Research source If you are taking off more than 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of hair to create your bob, consider chopping off the bulk of your hair first. To do this, make a horizontal cut across all of your hair to get rid of the extra weight. Keep in mind that you can always cut more hair off, but you can’t put it back once you cut it, so it is best to cut a very small amount and then cut a little more if you want it shorter."

Follow the line of the back section and make a horizontal cut across the ends of both sides. Then, make small, vertical snips to clean up any uneven spots. If you have thin or fine hair, you can cut it all at once. If your hair is thick, you should divide it into several sections before you cut it. Use the back section of your hair as a guide as to how much to take off of the sides. If you prefer, use a hair cutting razor to trim the length off the sides. This is a good idea if you want the pieces in the front to be longer than the back. Wiggle your razor back and forth slightly to shave off the ends of your hair."
