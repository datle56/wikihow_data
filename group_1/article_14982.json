Some common reasons for dropping out are: [1] X Research source [2] X Research source A lack of intellectual stimulation. If you find high school to be too easy and you are bored, you may be tempted to drop out and start college or vocational training early. Feeling unprepared and behind. If you feel as though high school is too difficult and you are struggling academically, or you have missed too much content to ever catch up, or no one will support you, you may be tempted to leave high school and give up on your education. Having other responsibilities. If you are unexpectedly becoming a parent, have an ailing family member, or have to work to support your family, you may feel that dropping out of high school is your only option so that you have time to work."

      "title": "Ask about other options first.",
      "content": "Ask about other options first. See your guidance counselor or a teacher that you trust and tell them your situation. There may be a solution to your complaint that does not involve dropping out: If you are experiencing a lack of intellectual stimulation, you may be able to take more challenging classes. [3] X Research source Some schools that do not offer advanced-level courses on-site may have relationships with colleges or with online-based institutions. You may even be able to dual-enroll and complete an Associate's Degree and your high school diploma at the same time. If you are feeling unprepared and behind, you might have to work really hard to catch up if you are behind. The good news is that there are likely educators at your school that will work with you and help you, particularly if they know that you are considering dropping out. Ask about credit recovery, offer classroom labor (like cleaning or organizing) in exchange for tutoring, and find out what work can be made up. If you have other responsibilities, talk to your guidance counselor about them. You may be able to do a work program that earns both money and school credit. Your counselor may also know of financial resources that could help you financially while keeping you in school. Remember that a high school graduate's lifetime income is 50%-100% higher than someone who drops out, [4] X Research source so dropping out may not be the best long-term solution for your family."

      "title": "Form a reasonable argument.",
      "content": "Form a reasonable argument. You will have to explain your decision many times, to many different people. Before you have those conversations, be sure that you can make a reasoned, clear argument for taking the path that you are taking. For example, “I am not being served by this educational system. I am not challenged, interested, or inspired by the curriculum or the educators. I am choosing to drop out of high school so that I can pursue higher education on my own and find an educational institution that fits my academic goals.” For example, “I am choosing to drop out because I feel like I have no other choice. To make up the work and education I missed by being absent for so many days, I would have to attend school for another year. My grades are so low that I may not be eligible for a diploma even if I do all of the work I am supposed to do. I will be much better off if I can just leave, get my GED, and start working.” For example, “I am choosing to leave school so that I can work full-time. While this decision may not make sense to you, I know the needs of myself and my family, and having the money to feed my family and myself is more important than learning about academic things that may never affect my life.”"

The students who attend alternative high schools can be more mature and often work. If much of your complaint about high school is the environment and the students, an alternative high school may be a better fit for you. Alternative high schools will sometimes allow you to accelerate your courses and finish early."

You most likely will try to get a GED or high school equivalency. It is important to do this as soon as possible, while you are still in “school mode.” If you plan to leave high school to start college or a vocational program, be sure you can enter the program you wish to enter with a high school equivalency. If you are planning to go to work full time, be sure you have a job lined up first. Find out how many hours you will be able to work and ask about benefits like health and dental insurance."

The best way to be ready to answer the questions and handle the “are you sure?” responses that you will likely get from the adults in your life is to anticipate their questions before they ask them. Try to preview the conversations before they happen and come up with responses to arguments and questions that will likely be asked."

Even if you are 18 and can legally make your own decision, it is considerate to tell the people who have been responsible for you up to this point what decision you are making (preferably before you make it official). Tell them your reasons, but don't expect them to necessarily agree right away. It may take some time for the idea to sink in, and they may never think it is a good idea. But if you are clear and firm, they will likely respect your decision. Have a back-up plan in place. The worst-case scenario is that your guardians may kick you out of the house if you drop out. If you think this may happen, have somewhere to go (at least temporarily)."
