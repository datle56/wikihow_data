[1] X Research source Consider using the F.O.R.D. technique, by focusing the conversation on the following topics: Family, Occupation, Recreation, and Dreams (Hopes). See a conversation as two sided. Be interested in what others say, and be interesting by relating to others. Share stories, but allow others an opportunity to speak. Be friendly and personable.

      "content": "Take an interest in exploring new things with someone. Getting out of your ordinary routine can often help you to be closer with someone. If the new person is interested in things that you normally would be less likely to try, consider trying it. New experiences can help you find new friends, and can possibly help you to be more open and interesting to others. Consider going out of your comfort zone in these ways: Go to a local food festival rather than a restaurant. Take a day trip to a local state or national park. Go to a museum that's not so traditional, like a radio and television museum or a sports hall of fame. Consider going to a local comedy show or a play rather than the movies. Go to a sporting event that might be outside the usual. Take a class together — art, fitness, cooking, or something else that seems different."

They may see your lack of attention or focus as a sign that you are not interested in getting to know them. Consider these ways to show you’re interested in them: [4] X Research source Actively listen. Give your undivided attention to the new person. Be present. Keep eye contact and give non-verbal cues of understanding, such as saying \"uh-huh\" or nodding your head. Paraphrase what they are saying, and give empathetic responses.

When someone asks you, \"How's your family?\" instead of saying, \"They're fine,\" be open about what is bothering you. You don't need to turn the conversation into a venting session, but it can help someone to see what you're going through. You could say instead, \"They're pretty well.
