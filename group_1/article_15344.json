Think ahead and borrow a book or two about chocolate from the library so that you can read about the history of chocolate together; mark all the romantic bits in advance. And if you'd like to set up a romantic evening consisting of a little wine and a lot of chocolate tasting, [1] X Research source read How to pair wine and chocolate, just so that you can do it all properly."

      "content": "Select quality chocolate. The most romantic chocolate is the best quality chocolate available. Failing that, choose the chocolate that pleases both you and your partner, regardless of its provenance. [2] X Research source Consider taking your partner to the best chocolate store in town. Spend at least quarter of an hour making your selection. This is a special event! Choose chocolate bars, single handcrafted truffles, and other types of chocolate on display. Chocolates with cream centers have a sensuality all of their own; perhaps get a mixture for a varied experience. Don't forget chocolate coated cacao beans and coffee beans. These can bring a sensual pleasure all of their very own, and have a very interesting crunchy texture."

Weave your beloved a tale of chocolate seduction; perhaps that you just cannot wait to taste the chocolate, to feel the plumpness of its texture against your teeth, and to run your tongue across its smooth lines. For the more daring, unwrap the chocolate bar using your teeth alone."

[3] X Research source Can you determine any special flavors through this initial sniff ? If it's a cream or liqueur filled chocolate, can you tell the filling by smell alone?"

      "content": "Place your tongue on the chocolate first. Rather than going straight for the bite, use your tongue to gently lick the chocolate and to detect an initial taste. Invite your partner to do the same. Does the taste match the smell?"

      "title": "Gently bite off a small portion of chocolate using just your front teeth.",
      "content": "Gently bite off a small portion of chocolate using just your front teeth. This is no occasion for stuffing it all in and chewing! Instead, hold the piece of chocolate on your tongue for a time. Then gently roll it over and over in your mouth to savor the flavor. Hold it to the roof of your mouth. Let it drop back onto your tongue. Continue enjoying the full taste without biting it again; eventually it will melt away completely; it's the melting process that creates a long-lasting sensuous buzz. [4] X Research source If you're enjoying a cream or liqueur centered chocolate, you'll need to vary the eating method. One way might be to suck the center out gradually and use your tongue to lick out the rest through the hole you've made. Decide on the rules with your partner before eating it!"

Here's where it gets really interesting â€“ did you know that chocolate produces a longer brain and body buzz than kissing, lasting four times longer than the most passionate kiss? [5] X Research source Fortunately, chocolate doesn't care whether you're male or female; it's very generous in sharing its buzz. So, for this step, have you and your partner devise new ways to enjoy the pieces of chocolate together, including sharing it and finding ways to maximize that buzz: Gently push a sucked piece of chocolate out of your mouth to rest on your lips and have your partner gently kiss it away from you. Be more daring and have your partner French kiss the chocolate back and forth. Lick pieces of chocolate off your fingers. Let some chocolate melt on your lower lip as you eat it, then suck it off seductively."

Emit joyous noises to back up your enjoyment of the chocolate . A few \"mmm's\" and \"ah's\" can add to the appreciation. It's an entire experience; go with the flow and say whatever comes to mind. Preferably something that could apply favorably to your partner as well as the chocolate, not something like \"om nom nom nom\". [6] X Research source"
