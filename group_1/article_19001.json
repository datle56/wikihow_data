      "content": "Buy Jheri curl supplies. You can find kits in most drugstores or beauty stores. Your kit should contain a softener to loosen your hair, a solution to set the curls, and perm rods (which may be sold separately). In addition to these materials, you'll need activator (aka Jheri juice, which keeps the curls looking moist and tight) and a shower cap. [1] X Research source Making Jheri curls the classic way requires using chemicals that can cause permanent damage to your hair. If you apply the chemicals incorrectly, use too much, or overdo it in any way, your hair could become dry and brittle, and it might even break. This extreme hair damage is one reason why people stopped making Jheri curls the classic way in the mid-nineties. If you want the Jheri curl look without the harsh chemicals, skip down to the next section. You might want to consider having your Jheri curls put in at a salon instead of doing them yourself. You're essentially giving yourself a perm, which requires some skill and knowledge of hair. Whether you have your hair done at a salon or do it yourself at home, you'll need regular touch ups."
