      "content": "Choose a domain name. Think of a domain name as your street address and hosting as the land where you built your house. The domain is the name of the website, and web hosting is where you place your website's files on the internet. You need to have both to create a website. There are various tools you can use to pick a name if that gets difficult for you. Check out Nameboy.com, makewords.com, and eBay also has some. You can determine if the domain name is available by using sites like http://www.instantdomainsearch.com/ which can also help you find out if a similar site name has not been registered. Make sure that it is easy to remember: If you are going to purchase a domain, then it should be relatively simple. Be creative. Sometimes you might not be able to find the exact domain name that you are looking for. In that case, you could add something before or after the brand name or tweak the spelling. Explain your brand with the domain name. The domain name which you are going to purchase should explain your area of services or products. Use commonly known domain extensions. Try to purchase a domain with an extension of .com as this is the most popular domain extension and is most easily remembered by people."
