      "content": "The D.O.T.S Projector casts a matrix of green dots to reveal ghosts. As a popular survival game, Phasmophobia gives players plenty of tools that can help determine which entity is haunting the grounds. Once the light is set up, you'll just need to watch closely for a white silhouette to pass through the dots. If you see movement, this can be used as evidence towards your final guess. The D.O.T.S. Projector will work on the following entities: Banshee, Deogen, Oni, Phantom, Raiju, Thaye, Wraith, Yokai, and Yurei. [1] X Research source The Projector will also work on a Goryo, but you must be looking at the dots through a video camera to find movement."

      "content": "Place down a video camera. While you can stand in the room and watch the dots, it's safer to do so from the van, especially if you're playing with someone who scares easily. Additionally, some entities—such as the Goryo—will only be revealed with dots through a video camera."

      "title": "Look for movement.",
      "content": "Look for movement. When an entity passes through the D.O.T.S. Projector, you should see their white silhouette pass through quickly. The entity will either be running or crawling. It will be fast, but it will be very clear. If you see anything while in the room, stay calm . The entity is simply interacting with the D.O.T.S Projector; it shouldn't be actively hunting. If some time passes and you don't see any movement, you could have an entity that can't be traced with a D.O.T.S. Projector. In this case, you'll need to try a different method."
