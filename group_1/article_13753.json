[20] X Research source This style can last more than a day, but it's best if you twist it up again each night. If you'd like to, use a wide-tooth comb or hair pick to fluff up the roots a little. Lift your hair, and insert the comb underneath. Pull it out just a little way through the hair to tease it, then take the comb out without running it through the rest of your hair. Do the same thing on the roots all over your head."
