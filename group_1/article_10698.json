      "content": "Identify simple words that you can use to form basic sentences. Assign sounds to pronouns like \"I,” “my,” \"he,” \"his,” “she,” “her,” “they,” “it” and “we”. Then, decide how you’ll say verbs like \"to be\", \"to have\", \"to like\", \"to go\", and \"to make.” You can also include simple words like “a,” “and,” “the,” “but,” and “or.” [1] X Research source You can also make up the words for numbers up to 10, and then decide how you would like your language to count up to 100. For example, in the fictional Sindarian language, “Him” is translated to “Hon.” In Dothraki, “She” is translated to “Anna.” In Valyrian, “to go” is translated to “naejot jikagon.”"

      "content": "Come up with words for common things that you encounter in daily life. As your vocabulary grows, start naming everything you can think of. As you come across something, think of a word for that item or concept, and write down how it sounds when you say the word out loud. This will help you to start thinking in your new language. [2] X Research source Look at lists of commonly used words to get an idea of which words you should add first. Think of the words for items around your house, animals, days of the week, time, body parts, food, people, jobs, locations, clothing and more. If you're stumped, remember you can borrow words from other languages. You can even alter the word. For example, the French word for man is homme. The Portuguese word— homem —is almost the same, with only a few letters/the pronunciation changed."

      "content": "Create your own dictionary by translating from your native language. Open the dictionary and begin translating any random words from your native language into your made up language. Not only will this be helpful if you forget how to say something, but it will ensure you don't miss a word. You can also use translation dictionaries, like English to French or German to English dictionaries to get an idea of how words are pronounced in different languages. [3] X Research source Try to make the words easily pronounceable and readable to avoid tongue twisters that make learning the language difficult. In general, simple, common words should be shorter. For example, a long word like \"kesolainotokos\" would mean \"volcanic ash,” while a short word like “giob” would mean “you” and a medium word like \"umevo\" could mean \"movie.\""

      "title": "Combine simple words to make compound words.",
      "content": "Combine simple words to make compound words. Compound words are a great way to grow your language quickly without having to come up with entirely new words, and this method works great for nouns. Simply take the first noun that describes the function of something, and then add it to another noun that describes what the noun is. Modern languages like German and English use this technique to make new words every day. [4] X Research source For example, if the word 'Khinsa' means ‘China,’ and the word ‘Bever’ means ‘Drink,’ you can make the word 'Khinsabever,’ which means ‘tea.’ This works because the beverage tea originated from ancient China, so it can be considered a Chinese drink."

      "content": "Name your language using your new sounds and vocabulary. Use your new language to come up with a name for the language. Try to come up with a short, unique word that encompasses the origin of the language or identifies the race of the people who speak the language. The name of your language doesn’t have to be related to a race or country, but it can be if you want it to be. For example, in the show Star Trek, the Klingons speak Klingon, and in the movie Avatar, the Na’vi people speak Na’vi. In the show Game of Thrones, the Dothraki people, who live by the Dothraki Sea, speak Dothraki."

Then, organize them in a pattern to create the alphabet. You can even sing it out loud to practice making the sounds. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that this can be a long process, and each letter or syllable should make at least 1 sound in your language."

      "title": "Borrow letters from an existing alphabet for an easier route.",
      "content": "Borrow letters from an existing alphabet for an easier route. Consult the Latin , Cyrillic, Greek , Georgian, and Coptic alphabets, which are still used in the world today by native speakers. If one of these alphabets contains all of the sounds that you need, you won’t need to create a new one. You can assign new pronunciations to letters if you need to do so. This will also make it easier for people who already use those alphabets to learn your language. [6] X Research source You can combine alphabets by using letters from Latin, Cyrillic or Greek words, for example. In that case, you could use \"Я\" for the /j/ (\"y\") sound, and Latin letters for other sounds. You may also want to use romanizations, which are translations of other words that use different alphabets. For example, the Russian word знаю is romanized into English as \"znayu\". This can be very useful if your language does not use the Latin alphabet."

Then, come up with a pronunciation for each symbol based on the different parts of the drawing. Make sure each symbol or marking has its own unique sound. [7] X Research source Many languages, like Chinese and Japanese , use pictographs or symbols to represent their spoken language. In English and other languages, the numbers are considered pictographs or symbols, since they aren’t part of the alphabet."

      "content": "Add accents to existing letters to create new letters or sounds. To keep your alphabet short, include accents, which are little markings above and below some of the letters to change the pronunciation. Generally, accents can go on vowels, such as a, e, i, o, u, and y, and some consonants, like c, l, n, r, s, t, and z. [8] X Research source For instance, E can be pronounced /ɛ/, like the \"e\" in \"dress\", while É is pronounced /ə/, like the \"o\" in \"of.”"

Decide if you want the subject to come first followed by the verb when you’re making a sentence, like you would make a sentence in English. Then, decide what order people should place the words to ask a question. You can use your native language to decide on sentence structure, or you can create your own rules. [9] X Research source For instance, in English, the word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In Japanese, the word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). An example would be, in the order SVO \"I (subject) was walking (verb) home (object).\" So the SOV version would be \"I(subject) home(object) was walking(verb).\" Once you decide this order, you can make general rules about where to put adjectives, possessors, adverbs, and more in your sentences."

      "content": "Decide whether you want to have plural nouns in your new language. Choose a prefix or suffix for nouns if you want to show a distinction between one and more than one. Some constructed languages use “double” words, which just mean the word is repeated 2 times to indicate that there is more than one. Keep in mind that you can construct a language without plurals nouns, but it can become confusing to learners and speakers. [10] X Research source Pluralization can be as simple as adding the “a-” sound before a word, or even putting the “-s” sound at the end of the world, like you would in English."

      "title": "Figure out how to use verbs to build sentences.",
      "content": "Figure out how to use verbs to build sentences. In most languages, verbs change depending on the subject and tense of the sentence. Decide if you want to alter the verbs in your language by adding sounds to them, like prefixes or suffixes, to indicate who is speaking and when the action of the sentence took place. [11] X Research source For instance, if you wanted to say that a person or thing likes something in the present tense in English, you would say \"I like,” “you like,” \"He/she likes,\" “It likes,” “We like,” or “They like.” In this example, you can see that the verb “to like” is altered by adding an ‘s’ on the end for pronouns that are third person singular, such as he, she, and it. You may also want to add a word to distinguish between between words like \"swim\" and \"swimming.” However, some languages, like French, don’t do this. In French, \"Je nage\" can mean \"I swim\" or \"I am swimming.” You might also choose to change the word entirely to match the subject and action of the sentence. These are normally referred to as “irregular” verbs."
