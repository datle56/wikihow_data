But pay attention if he uses pronouns like “we” and “us” when talking about his past weekend or upcoming plans as there may be another girl in the picture. He may also talk a lot about a certain girl without ever explaining that they’re exclusively together. Listen for other clues that there’s a girl in his life. He might mention that he spent time in a beauty store for some reason, or that he needs to go home and cook dinner for 2, for example."

[1] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. Lay on some casual moves! Flirt by giving him a compliment, or teasing him a little bit. Say, “I love your eyes,” or, “You have such good taste in clothing.” If he matches your energy, that’s a good sign he’s single. If he keeps the conversation stiff or changes the subject, he’s not into flirting, which either means he doesn’t feel the chemistry, or he already has a special someone. Some guys are notoriously flirty or charming to everyone they meet, even if they have a girlfriend. Don’t get swept up in the fun of flirting until you know a guy is single. A guy can still be nice and courteous to you even if they have a girlfriend. Don’t mistake niceness and politeness for flirting."

You can also simply check his profile descriptions to see is he mentions being in a relationship. Check his friends’ pages as well. Sometimes a guy won’t post photos of a relationship, but you can check his mutual friends and followers’ pages to see if they posted pictures of him with another girl. Be careful not to “like” or accidentally comment on any old pictures or posts of his. He’ll get a notification that you’re checking on him. Although it's increasingly unusual, it is possible that your guy may not have a social media page, in which case it may be more beneficial to check his friend's pages to see if they posted any information about the guy."

Get your hands on his phone by saying that your phone's battery died and you have to make a call if you're trying to avoid being suspicious.
