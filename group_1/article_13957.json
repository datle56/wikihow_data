    {
      "title": "Pronounce each syllable separately.",
      "content": "Pronounce each syllable separately. The Māori language, spoken by indigenous people of New Zealand, has vowels with long and short sounds (such as ay and ah for the letter A). Each phrase, such as “ka ma - te,” is pronounced separately. There is a very short stop between each syllable, with a few exceptions. The resulting sounds in a Haka will be staccato and fierce."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend two vowels together.",
      "content": "Blend two vowels together. Vowel combinations, such as “ao” or “ua,” are pronounced by gliding them together (such as “ay-o” and “oo-ah”). There isn't a brief stop or breath between these vowel sets, also known as diphthongs. Instead, they are a smooth combination sound."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pronounce the letter T correctly.",
      "content": "Pronounce the letter T correctly. The letter T is pronounced like an English T when it is followed by the vowels A, E or O. It carries a slight “s” sound when the T is followed by an I or U. The Haka has both of these instances: For example, in “Tenei te tangata,” the T will sound like an English T. For example, in the line, “Nana nei I tiki mai,” the T letters followed by I will have a slight “s” sound accompanying the T."

    {
      "title": "Pronounce “wh” as a “f” sound.",
      "content": "Pronounce “wh” as a “f” sound. The last line of the Haka starts with “whiti te ra.” Pronounce the “whi” as a “fi.”"

    {
      "title": "Finish off the song properly.",
      "content": "Finish off the song properly. The last syllable of the song is “Hi!” This is pronounced as “he” with a quick breath, rather than a drawn out “high.” [1] X Research source Push the breath out of your lungs by tightening your stomach muscles."

      "title": "Choose a leader.",
      "content": "Choose a leader. This person will not stand in formation with the others in the group. Instead, the leader will shout out some of the lines, giving direction to the group. The leader reminds the group how to conduct themselves during the Haka. A Haka leader should have a strong, fierce voice and speak clearly and forcefully. [2] X Research source This leader may be the leader of your sports team or group."

    {
      "title": "Stand with a group of people.",
      "content": "Stand with a group of people. Often, sports teams perform the Haka together before beginning a match. There is not a particular number of people you need to perform the Haka, but if the group is larger, then the effect of the Haka is more intimidating and impressive."

    {
      "title": "Give notice that you're doing a Haka.",
      "content": "Give notice that you're doing a Haka. If you want to perform a Haka with your sports team before a match, make sure you have alerted the game's officials and the other team. If your opponent is the one performing the Haka, watch respectfully with your team."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread out into formation.",
      "content": "Spread out into formation. The Haka will look fiercer if your group stands in a formation of some sort, as though you are going to set off into organized battle. Walk from a bunched group into a few lines of people. Give yourself lots of arm room, since you'll be swinging your arms around."

      "content": "Learn the warm-up chant. The words of the warm-up chant are typically shouted by the leader. They are intended to inspire the group and to warn the opponent that the dance is starting. This part of the chant also gets the group in proper body position. The haka leader will often begin this chant with the phrase \"Kia rite!\" (get ready). The five lines of the chant are (with their English translation, which is not spoken): [3] X Research source Review the earlier section for pronunciation tips. Ringa pakia! (Slap the hands against the thighs) Uma tiraha! (Puff out the chest) Turi whatia! (Bend the knees) Hope whai ake! (Let the hip follow) Waewae takahia kia kino! (Stamp the feet as hard as you can)"
