      "content": "Remember that absolute value is a number's distance from zero. An absolute value is the distance from the number to zero along a number line. Simply put, | − 4 | {\\displaystyle |-4|} is just asking you how far away -4 is from zero. Since distance is always a positive number (you can't travel \"negative\" steps, just steps in a different direction), the result of absolute value is always positive."

You cannot find the absolute value of imaginary numbers the same way you found it for rational numbers. That said, you can easily find the absolute value of a complex equation by plugging it into the distance formula. Take the expression | 3 − 4 i | {\\displaystyle |3-4i|} , for example. Problem: | 3 − 4 i | {\\displaystyle |3-4i|} Note: If you see the expression − 1 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {-1}}} , you can replace it with \"i.\" The square root of -1 is an imaginary number, known as i. | i | = 1 {\\displaystyle |i|=1}"
