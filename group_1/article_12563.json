      "content": "Pick a gable roof if you want a classic design. Gable roofs are some of the most common styles because they are compatible with most porch designs. This style is simple and triangular, and it is usually wider than it is tall. Gable roofs cover a wide space and create a broad, welcoming atmosphere.

      "content": "Try a shed-style roof for simplicity. Shed-style roofs have a soft, sloping top directly attached to house's front wall. They are ideal for longer, more narrow porches because they hold small porches together best. Because shed-style roofs are fastened to a small section of the house wall, they are the simplest roof design. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Design your porch with a flat-front roof if it matches your house. Flat-front houses look best with similarly-designed roofs. Design a straight and flat roof to keep your front porch from overpowering your house's design. [5] X Research source Flat porch roofs are not ideal for climates with lots of snow. The lack of slope can cause the snow to pack on and weigh down the roof. Look at your roof pitch and use existing elements from your homes like your garage or an extension of cover."

      "content": "Add a hip porch roof to your design for a gentler slope. Hip porch roofs are the most complex roof design, with soft and equally-angled slopes. Hip porch roofs extend past the house of the wall to create a more pyramid-shaped design. This roof style is more difficult to create because it is largely unsupported by the house.

      "content": "Measure the intended area of your porch to make a scalable drawing. Measure the approximate length, width, and height of your future porch's area. Record each number in a notebook. When you've finished measuring, create a system for scaling your drawing and use graphing paper to make the drawing accurate. [7] X Research source You might decide, for example, that one inch or centimeter is equal to one square on your graphing paper."

Your architect can create a blueprint and help you turn it into a finished project. Ask local architects for references so you can decide which one's style best fits your vision."
