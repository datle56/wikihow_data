      "title": "Hold your breath.",
      "content": "Hold your breath. When you hold your breath, you stop your diaphragm from moving normally. Since hiccups seem to be associated with a reflex movement of the diaphragm, halting it can help to end them. After holding your breath for a few seconds, swallow large breaths of air a few times. Repeat this process a few times to see if it can stop your hiccups."

      "content": "Change your body position. Sit while pulling your knees up to your chest or bending over will compress your diaphragm. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Hiccups are related to diaphragm spasms, and compressing the diaphragm may reduce the spasms. Be careful getting up and down--remember that your coordination and sense of balance might be impaired when you are drinking."

      "content": "Drink a glass of water quickly. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you drink quickly and without stopping, your abdominal muscles are put to work and your hiccups might end in the process. You can use a straw or two to help you drink the water more quickly. Make sure that is only water that you are drinking and not alcohol, which can cause hiccups."

    {
      "title": "Try coughing.",
      "content": "Try coughing. Coughing forcefully uses a lot of abdominal muscle power, and the action might halt the hiccup reflex. Even if you don't actually have to cough, just make yourself do it."

      "content": "Put pressure on the bridge of your nose. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Place your finger on the bridge of your nose and press as hard as you can.

[6] X Trustworthy Source American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology National professional organization of allergists, asthma specialists and immunologists that focuses on supporting and publishing research Go to source Sneezing puts abdominal muscles to work, which can break up the hiccupping action and hopefully end it. To make yourself sneeze, try sniffing a little pepper, breathing in a dusty area, or walking out into bright sunshine."

[7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Gargling requires you to concentrate, and the action can disrupt the way you are breathing and using your abdominal muscles. All of this together can help end a bout of hiccups."

      "content": "Drink a shot of vinegar. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Strong substances like vinegar or pickle juice can “shock” your body into a bout of hiccups. However, if you already have them, they may also “shock” your body into ending them. If this method does not work the first time, it is probably best not to try it again, since drinking too much vinegar can irritate your stomach and esophagus. If it doesn't work, just try a different method."

      "content": "Ice the problem. [9] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Take a small bag of ice and place it on the skin of your upper stomach, which is near your diaphragm. The cold can cause changes in your circulation and muscle activity in the area, which might stop the hiccups. If your hiccups do not go away within twenty minutes, remove the ice and try a different method. Leaving the ice on too long can cause soreness."

Sip water (or some other non-alcoholic, non-carbonated beverage) slowly, letting it hit the roof of your mouth."

      "content": "Try counting or other rote activities. If you have your brain concentrate on a moderately difficult activity, it might stop causing the hiccups. If you have been drinking, you might have to concentrate a little harder, but in this case that might actually help. Try one of these tasks: Count backwards from 100. Say or sing the alphabet backwards Do multiplication problems (4 x 2 = 8; 4 x 5 = 20; 4 x 6 = 24; etc.) Say each letter of the alphabet and a word that begins with that letter"
