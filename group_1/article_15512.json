      "content": "Avoid purine-rich foods. Since uric acid is produced from the metabolism of purine in the body, it is best to avoid foods that contain purine. Urate crystals accumulate in the joints if uric acid is elevated and this can aggravate joint pain in gout. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Also, uric acid elevation can increase insulin resistance which is a condition wherein the body do not respond to the function of insulin. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This can further elevate the blood sugar levels of a person, leading to diabetic symptoms. Purine-rich foods are mackerel, anchovies, organ meats, dried beans, peas, canned goods, instant noodles, wine and beer."

      "title": "Avoid foods rich in fructose.",
      "content": "Avoid foods rich in fructose. Foods rich in fructose consume a lot of adenosine triphosphate (or ATP) when metabolized. This ATP is an energy-supplying molecule that the cells in the body use. Over-consumption of ATP leads to its depletion and results in the generation of substances such as lactic acid and uric acid, thereby increasing the levels of uric acid in the blood. Also, fructose is considered a sugar. Consuming foods rich in fructose can elevate the blood sugar of a person and lead to occurrence of symptoms. Foods to avoid are apples, bananas, pears, agave, melons, asparagus, beans, broccoli, cabbage, onion, tomato, peanuts, raisins, figs, carbonated drinks, fruit drinks, ketchup, canned goods, chocolate, pastries and breakfast cereals."

      "title": "Avoid alcohol.",
      "content": "Avoid alcohol. Alcohol interferes with the removal of uric acid from the body. When alcohol is converted to lactic acid, it reduces the amount of uric acid that is eliminated from the body through the kidneys. This is because the lactic acid competes with the uric acid in terms of being removed by the kidneys through urine. Increased levels of ethanol (alcohol) in the body increase the body's production of uric acid by increasing the amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) that is converted to AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) - a precursor of uric acid. [3] X Research source Also, alcohol can affect the body’s sensitivity to insulin."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source [8] X Research source Joslin Diabetes Center, n.d. High levels of cholesterol in the body can increase the blood pressure and can lead to the occurrence of diabetic symptoms.

[8] X Research source Also, anthocyanins encourage hypoglycemic activity that may help to lower blood sugar. [12] X Research source Grace, M., Ribnicky, D., 2009, May Foods rich in anthocyanins are eggplant, blueberries, cranberries, plums, black currant, grapes, pomegranates, red fleshed peaches and cherries.

General dietary guidelines for diabetic persons include: Carbohydrates should provide 45 - 65% of total daily calories. Fats should provide 25 - 35% of daily calories. Protein should provide 12 - 20% of daily calories"

      "title": "Calculate how much food from each food group you can eat.",
      "content": "Calculate how much food from each food group you can eat. Basically, carbohydrates and protein each provide 4 calories per gram, while fat provides 9 calories in each gram. For example, if you have eaten 100 grams of fat in a meal, then the number of calories consumed is 900 (9 multiplied by 100). If you have eaten 100 grams of protein, then you have consumed 400 calories (4 multiplied by 100). If you have eaten 200 grams of carbohydrates, then you have consumed 800 calories (4 multiplied by 200). Once you know the number of calories from fat, carbohydrates and protein, add them up to get the total calories for that day. So 900 + 400 + 800 = 2100 calories. After this you can now determine the percentage of calories you have consumed. To do this, divide the number of calories from each nutrient by the total number of calories for that day and multiply it by 100. So, for fat: (900/2100) x 100 = 42.8 percent. For protein: (400/2100) x 100 = 19 percent. For carbohydrates: (800/2100) x 100 = 38 percent. Once you are aware of the general dietary guidelines for diabetic persons using this basic computation, you can easily tell if your diet falls in the normal range."

To compute for the daily recommended intake in grams: if the diabetic patient has a diet of 1500 calories per day for example, then multiply 1500 by 0.25 and .35 to get a range of 375 to 525, then divide each by 9.

      "content": "Understand what causes gout. Gout - a form of arthritis - is a condition caused by the buildup of excess uric acid. Uric acid is a chemical produced during purine metabolism in the body. Purines are nitrogen-containing compounds that are produced inside the body or can be found in certain foods and drinks. [16] X Research source Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in the joints, causing intense pain and inflammation. Urate crystals can form when a person has high levels of uric acid in the blood. Gout causes sudden, extreme attacks of pain, redness and swelling. Gouty arthritis most often affects the big toe, but it also can occur in the ankles, feet, knees, wrists and hands."

      "content": "Know what causes diabetes. Diabetes is a disease that affects the body’s utilization of glucose – blood sugar that is the body’s source of energy. In order to use glucose, our body needs insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps transport blood sugar or glucose into the cells as a source of energy. [17] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Health information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Without sufficient insulin, the blood sugar cannot be absorbed by the body's cells and remains in the bloodstream. In people with diabetes, there is the inability of the body to produce insulin or the insulin does not work like it should. Diabetes has two types: Type 1 diabetes. The body’s immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, which is responsible for the production of insulin. Type 2 diabetes. The pancreas can still produce insulin but the body does not respond well to it, so the insulin doesn't work. In both types of diabetes, the glucose cannot normally enter the cells and remains in the bloodstream, resulting in high levels of blood sugar."

These include: [18] X Research source Non-modifiable Factors: Age: As the body ages, its functions deteriorate. It may be unable to excrete uric acid any more which can lead to gout, or it may be unable to utilize insulin anymore, which can lead to diabetes. Family history: Both gout and diabetes can be inherited. If one of your family members has gout or diabetes, then there is a chance that you may inherit the disease as well. Gender: . Both gout and diabetes more often occur in men than women. This is because men have higher uric acid levels and are less sensitive to insulin. [23] X Research source NHS Choices, 2011, October 5 Modifiable Factors: Obesity: More adipose tissues from fats can produce and secrete more uric acid which can cause gout. [24] X Research source Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2013, September 20 Also, insulin does not easily bind to fats, which can increase a person’s risk of diabetes. Diet and lifestyle: Excessive intake of alcohol can affect the body’s normal process of excreting uric acid, which can lead to gout. Also, alcohol can affect the body’s sensitivity to insulin [25] X Research source Zilkens, R., Burke, V., n.d. which can lead to diabetes."

Confusion which may lead to delirium: Due to insufficient glucose, the vital organs such as the brain are not working properly. Extreme hunger leading to excessive eating: The body compensates for its lack of energy by releasing Ghrelin (hunger hormone) which gives the person the urge to eat. [28] X Research source Dopart, S., 2010, October 25 Extreme thirst leading to excessive drinking: When the body loses fluids because of frequent urination in diabetes, the body secretes vasopressin (also known as anti-diuretic hormone) which activates the thirst mechanism and stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb water. [29] X Research source Knott, L., 2013, January 11 The person responds by drinking a lot of water in order to replace lost fluids. Rapid or fast heartbeat: Because the body has no source of energy such as glucose, the heart compensates by speeding up the pumping of blood to the body's vital organs. Weakness or fatigue: Because the body does not have enough glucose, the sufferer may experience weakness and fatigue."
