Other states, like Hawaii and Utah, have full prohibitions on any kind of online gambling. Look online to see what states allow online gambling where you live. [1] X Research source Many states have specific rules on which kinds of gambling are allowed. A state may outlaw online betting for horse races and online poker, for example, but allow fantasy sports and casino games."

[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Unfortunately, because there are so many different rules from state to state, online gambling casinos and sportsbooks usually require users to be 21 years of age just so they don’t have to keep track of the different state requirements.

On these sites, you can bet on the outcome of games (moneyline bets), how many points will be scored by the teams (over/under bets), or how hard one team will beat another (spread bets). Many of the larger sportsbooks also offer parlays, which are multiple bets that are tied together into one larger bet. Caesars Sportsbook & Casino, Fanduel, and Points Bet are the most popular sportsbooks."

Online horse racing sites are a popular way to see if lady luck is on your side and place bets on which jockey will win a given race.

      "content": "Go with a bigger, well-known name in the field. The bigger sportsbooks will have the liquidity to pay you out when their books are thin, and they’ll have a reputation to uphold so their customer service is usually going to be better. If you search for a sportsbook or casino online and you can’t find any information on them outside of their own website, it’s potentially a scam. Look at reviews online to see if people are happy with their experience on each platform you consider."

      "content": "Make sure the casino or sportsbook is licensed. Search the casino’s or sportsbook’s website to see if they’re licensed by your state. The licensing body will differ from state to state, but they’re often regulated via your state’s gaming control board (or GCB). Scan through their website and then confirm with your state’s GCB that they’re in good standing with your state. If a sportsbook or casino isn’t in good standing with your state and you give them money to gamble, you may not be able to get it back."

      "content": "Consider the sign-up bonus last, since it’s the least important. Almost every sportsbook and casino offers bonuses. These range from free games, matching deposits up to $200, or a bundle of free bets. This may seem like a big deal, but it’s not. These offers are designed to entice people into spending more than they normally would, so don’t put a giant emphasis on the bonus when you’re picking the sportsbook or casino. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. An unrealistic or absurd sign-up bonus is a major sign that the casino or sportsbook isn’t safe to use."

Follow the prompts to complete the sign-up process. You will likely have to upload a copy of your driver’s license or state ID to provide proof that the details you’ve entered are accurate.
