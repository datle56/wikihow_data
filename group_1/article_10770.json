      "content": "Cut a piece of sturdy cardboard for the base. From a separate sturdy cardboard box, cut out a square or rectangle to act as your false bottom for your secret box. Measure the length and width of the cardboard you are using for your secret box. Refer to these measurements when cutting out your false bottom. Do not cut the exact measurements, because then the bottom will not be able to fit into the box. Also, don’t cut too much smaller than the original measurements because then the bottom will not be snug. Make sure to cut two half circles on either side of the bottom, this is how you will lift the false bottom out of place with your fingers. [1] X Research source"

Referring to the measurements of the cardboard you will be using for your box, cut out four thin strips of cardboard to act as the foundation to the false bottom and also the walls to the secret compartment.

To make a glue mixture, mix together regular glue and water. Try to make the mixture 80% glue and 20% water. Too much water in the mixture will warp the pages. [5] X Research source"

Go to your nearest hardware store and ask if you can have some of their scraps. You can use particleboard, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or plywood. Just make sure you have enough wood to make a decent size box. You will be making an open wooden container for small objects, with a hidden compartment toward the bottom of the box."

Use a ruler to measure out two strips of one width and two strips of another width. This will guarantee that when you put the four strips together, you will have a square opening. Measure two strips 2 ¾” wide and two separate strips 2 ¼” wide. Measure the inside square opening. It should read 2 ¼” for width and length.

This will be the top of the secret compartment. One square could be thin, ex. ⅛” thick. This will be the false bottom."

Next, drill 4 holes, one in each corner, for screws. To find the center point on the thicker square, connect the corners using a ruler and a pencil. Drill an ⅛” hole all the way through the center. Before drilling the corner ⅛” holes, check to make sure the hole is inset enough from the corners so that the head of each screw will not hang over the edge of the square. Do not drill the corner holes all the way through to the other side of the square. You want the screws to be sticking out of this thicker piece to create space for the secret compartment. Screw in 1” wood screws into the four corner holes, but only enough for them to be sturdily in place."

It will look like a holder to everyone else. To open the secret compartment, you need a long, thin object that is able to fit through the center hole you drilled in the thicker square. Unscrew a pen, and take out the thin ink tube. Dump everything from the top space of your box.
