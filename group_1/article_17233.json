This tends to be the most visible number pertaining to a given element and usually sits above the element symbol, either in the middle of the box or in the upper left corner. (On the chart we're using, in fact, no other numbers are listed.) The atomic number is the number of protons in a single atom of that element. [3] X Research source Os is number 76, meaning one atom of osmium has 76 protons. The proton number never changes in an element; it's basically what makes that element that element.

Since the vast majority of an atom’s mass is made up of its protons and neutrons, subtracting the number of protons (i.e. the atomic number) from the atomic mass will give you the calculated number of neutrons in the atom. The numbers after the decimal point represent the usually very small mass of the electrons in the atom. In our example, this is: 190 (atomic weight) – 76 (number of protons) = 114 (number of neutrons). [8] X Research source"
