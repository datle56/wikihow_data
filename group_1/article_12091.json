      "content": "Boil chlorinated water for 20 minutes, then refrigerate it in a clean jug. Boiling creates heat and aeration (via bubbles), the combination of which is sufficient to remove volatile chlorine after 20 minutes. After boiling, let your water cool to room temperature, pour the cooled water into a clean container, and store it in the fridge. For small batches of water, boiling is probably the quickest and most effective way to get rid of chlorine. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you’re trying to dechlorinate large batches of water, however, this method is probably not the most practical. Boiling for at least 20 minutes will also remove chloramine, which is used instead of chlorine in some towns."

      "title": "Let the water sit for at least 6-7 hours so that the chlorine evaporates.",
      "content": "Let the water sit for at least 6-7 hours so that the chlorine evaporates. Fill a pitcher, bucket, or tub with the water you want to dechlorinate. Leave the container uncovered and place it in an area with limited airborne particles and debris to prevent contamination. If your container is small enough, you can place it in the fridge, although this may slow the dechlorination process. “Let [the water] sit in the open and let the chlorine and chlorine gas” dissipate naturally, instructs Blake. Check the water regularly using a chlorine test kit to determine how much chlorine remains in the water. [2] X Research source . The precise length of time needed to dechlorinate water depends on a number of factors. Firstly, the amount of volume you’re trying to remove—a pitcher of water will likely take 6-7 hours to dechlorinate, while a large tub may take up to 24 hours or more. For larger amounts of water, a wider and shallower container will hurry the process along (versus a deep, cylindrical receptacle). Also, placing the container in direct sunlight will speed up the dechlorination process. While you may choose not to do this because you’re worried about dirt and debris, placing the water in sunlight will help to dechlorinate it faster. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Evaporation won’t remove chloramine, which is used instead of chlorine in some water supplies. It’s also not recommended for drinking water since contamination can easily occur. If you’re not sure whether your water company uses chloramine, ask them for a copy of the Consumer Confidence or Annual Water Quality Report."

      "title": "Use sunlight or an artificial ultraviolet light to dechlorinate water.",
      "content": "Use sunlight or an artificial ultraviolet light to dechlorinate water. Place the water you wish to dechlorinate as close as possible to a UV light source (your light source could be the sun or an actual UV heat lamp ). Leave your water under the UV light for at least 24 hours, but make sure it’s not exposed to other contaminants or debris. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The precise amount of time it will take to dechlorinate your water depends on how much water you’re trying to dechlorinate, the strength of the light you’re using, and the presence of organic chemicals in the water. Use a chlorine testing strip to regularly check whether your water has fully dechlorinated or not. UV light will remove chloramine as well as chlorine. UV exposure is also a suitable dechlorination process for drinking water."

      "content": "Add 1 tsp of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Powdered ascorbic acid (also known as vitamin C) neutralizes chlorine. Just sprinkle 1 teaspoon of ascorbic acid over 1 gallon (3.8 L) water and mix. This method works best for dechlorinating water meant for plants or hydroponics systems, but it’s also suitable for dechlorinating drinking water. [5] X Research source Ascorbic acid is affordable and can be obtained from most pet or grocery stores. Ascorbic acid removes both chlorine and chloramine. Another option for chemical neutralization is potassium metabisulphite , which often comes in the form of a Campden tablet . To use this method, drop a 1 ⁄ 2 ounce (14 g) Campden tablet into 20 gallons (76 L) of water and let it sit for 1-2 minutes. For different quantities of water, check the package instructions. [6] X Research source While potassium metabisulfite is an easy option that’s effective for large quantities of water, many people dislike the idea of adding chemicals to their water, so they avoid this option."

      "title": "Install a water filter in your home or use a filtering pitcher.",
      "content": "Install a water filter in your home or use a filtering pitcher. Water filters effectively remove chlorine from your tap water as it comes out (so you don’t have to dechlorinate every batch of water that you use). You can find water filters that attach to pitchers and faucets or are installed under your sinks. More advanced filters can be permanently fixed, so they’ll filter chlorine out of your entire water system. There are a few different types of water filters you could use to remove chlorine, including: [7] X Research source A reverse osmosis filter : Reverse osmosis refers to the process in which ions and particles are removed from the water. Reverse osmosis systems can be installed directly beneath your kitchen sink or where your water supply enters your home, and are therefore very convenient relative to other dechlorination methods. But they’re also very expensive, often reaching several thousand U.S. dollars. An activated carbon filter : Activated carbon is a special filter media that removes chlorine, chloramines, and organic compounds from water. Some activated carbon filters can be connected to your home’s water supply, or you can buy a filtered pitcher that uses an activated carbon filter. Activated carbon filters remove both chlorine and chloramine. [8] X Research source Whatever filter you choose, it’ll need to be changed at certain intervals. Check your manufacturer's directions to find out how often you need to change your water filter."

      "title": "Add a dechlorination agent to remove chlorine and chloramine.",
      "content": "Add a dechlorination agent to remove chlorine and chloramine. You can buy dechlorination agents (also known as water conditioners ) at any pet store—look for a conditioner that specifies that it works on chlorine and chloramine. “The easiest way to use a dechlorinator,” advises Blake, “is to use it as directed and stir it up in the bucket. If you’re adding it directly to the tank, you want to add the amount that fits the tank volume, not the amount of new water you’re adding because you need that liquid to distribute throughout the entire volume of the tank.” The water will be ready for immediate use. [9] X Research source StVil recommends dechlorination agents as the best “way to properly get chlorine out of an aquarium…some of the best anti-chlorinators and water conditioners are things like Stress Coat .” If you’re using the water in a fish tank with a biological filter, choose a dechlorination agent that doesn’t have an ammonia remover, which could cause problems in your filter. You can also remove chlorine from water before adding it to your fish tank by using the same methods you would use to remove chlorine from drinking water. For instance, you can purchase UV-purified bottled water , use a water filter , expose the water to a UV light , or mix vitamin C into the water."

      "content": "Aerate fish tank water using an air pump. You should always dechlorinate aquarium water before adding it to a fish tank, but aerating the water will also aid in removing chlorine continuously. Fish tanks typically require an air pump to circulate the water, so you’ll get an aerating and chlorine-removing agent as a bonus. [10] X Research source Buy the appropriate pump for your tank’s size and type, as well as the pets you’ll be keeping in the tank."

      "content": "Install an aerating sprayer for your fish pond. If you’re trying to dechlorinate pond water, use a spraying device (like a spraying nozzle connected to a hose) to add air into the water as it enters the pond. Chlorine is volatile and will naturally dissipate in open ponds, but aeration will speed up the process considerably. [11] X Research source Aeration does not work for chloramine, however, which is a less volatile additive used by some municipal water authorities. You’ll need to add a dechlorination agent as well."

      "content": "Chlorine is added to tap water by local water treatment plants. If you’re tasting or smelling chlorine in your water, it’s probably a residual amount of chlorine that’s put into drinking water by your city or township’s water treatment plant. These plants put chlorine into the water in order to protect you from potential bacteria, viruses, and parasites that might otherwise live in your tap water. [12] X Research source If the chlorine taste in your water is particularly strong, you might live relatively near the water treatment plant. The chlorine dissipates the further the water flows through the distribution system. The EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) monitors how high the chlorine levels can be in tap water. These regulated levels are not harmful to drink or smell, so it’s completely fine to leave the chlorine in your drinking water. However, you may choose to dechlorinate your water if you dislike the taste or smell of chlorine. [13] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you’ve taken steps to remove chlorine from your water and you can still smell or taste it, there may be other contaminants or issues at play. Contact your local public water company for assistance, and consider having your water tested by a certified lab."

      "content": "Chlorine has a distinct taste, and prolonged exposure may impact health. Most likely, you want to remove chlorine from your water because you dislike its distinct bleach-like taste—fair enough! Behind pure taste preferences, however, some research does indicate that prolonged exposure to chlorine can lead to health risks. [14] X Research source According to some studies, chlorine and chloramine may sometimes react with naturally occurring matter in water to form disinfection byproducts like trihalomethanes (chloroform) and haloacetic acids. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source While there’s still research to be done on this topic, it may be worth it to dechlorinate your water if you live somewhere with a high percentage of chlorine in the water.

      "content": "Is chlorine bad for fish? Yes, both chlorine and chloramine are extremely “harmful to fish and can disrupt their slime coating,” says StVil. These chemicals can also cause chemical burns around a fish’s gills or be absorbed into their bloodstream, causing further damage. If your fish tank has chlorine or chloramine in it, your fish won’t be able to swim or function properly, and the stress that this situation is causing them may exacerbate other health issues. [19] X Research source If you observe your fish gasping for air or randomly darting around the tank, you may have chlorine or chloramine in your aquarium water."

      "content": "Do I need to dechlorinate salt water? Yes, you must dechlorinate salt water before adding it to a fish tank. The reason you must dechlorinate saltwater is that many aquarists add reef salt to freshwater to create their own saltwater. Since that freshwater may have had chlorine in it, use reverse osmosis or another dechlorination method to provide the most neutral water possible for your fish. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "How do I keep my water dechlorinated? To maintain your dechlorinated water, it’s best to install a water filtration system in your home. Water filters are practically the only way to keep dechlorinated water running through your home (without having to boil the water every time!). If you’re using a filter, replace the filter according to manufacturer recommendations. [21] X Research source Regularly clean and switch out your water storage containers to avoid any contamination or bacterial growth. Use a water testing kit to regularly check the levels in your water and ensure that it’s still dechlorinated."

      "content": "What’s the difference between chlorine and chloramine? Chloramine is a disinfectant chemical made of a combination of chlorine and ammonia. It's often used by water suppliers as an alternative to chlorine, largely because chloramine can last longer in the water supply than chlorine. For this same reason, chloramine can also be more difficult to remove from water with a filter (although not impossible!).
