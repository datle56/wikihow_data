      "title": "Match the dog joke to the audience.",
      "content": "Match the dog joke to the audience. Having the ability to read the room is a big part of telling jokes and being funny . The best way to do this is by paying attention to the mood and listening to what the people around you are talking about. Muñoz recommends being very careful about using humor in serious situations and always paying attention to your audience’s reactions to your jokes. For example, you might get a laugh with a dog joke at a party, but it falls flat at a wedding. If you’re reading the room, you’ll only make that mistake once. If you’re at a gathering and you’re hearing a lot of laughter, listen to what people are laughing at. Then, choose a joke that matches. Stick to jokes that are funny, appropriate, and easy to understand for all ages if you’re in a group with adults and children."

      "content": "Make the joke funnier with a “pregnant pause” before the punchline. Timing is one of the most important elements of telling a joke . Timing involves adjusting how fast you talk and using “pregnant pauses” to make your jokes funnier. A “pregnant pause” is when you pause after the joke’s setup to build tension for the punchline. [7] X Research source For example, there’s a classic joke by legendary comedian Henny Youngman that uses a little misdirection and a “pregnant pause” to make it funnier. He starts with “Take my wife,” like he’s telling a story. Then, he pauses and says, “Please,” which changes the setup to a plea to take her away. Don’t let the pause go on too long. Even the funniest joke can fall flat if people have too much time to think about it."

Payne advises you to “just have fun, do your best, but know that you’ll probably fail the first few times.” He adds that you’ll get better at telling jokes the more you do it. You just have to be confident in your sense of humor and believe in yourself when you’re telling a joke. Payne says that sometimes your joke will bomb, but that’s okay. It’s just part of telling jokes. The best thing to do in those situations is shrug it off and move on."
