      "content": "There are a few reasons why your Discord account is disabled: Sharing Inappropriate Content - Servers usually have a list of rules for you to follow; they can ban you from the server if you post content that breaks these rules. Do this on enough servers and get banned , and the Discord team will start to notice. Violating Discord's Terms of Service - You agreed to follow a set of rules when you signed up for an account on Discord; if you break any of these rules, Discord will disable your account and you cannot recover it. Misuse of feedback systems - You can submit feedback to Discord to improve their app on your computer, phone, and tablet, but if you abuse this system or submit false reports, your account may be temporarily disabled. Under Age - Every Discord user must be over 13 to use the platform. If you're under 13, Discord will disable your account. For chargeback - If you pay for something through Discord (like a Nitro subscription ) with PayPal and it's immediately refunded, your account may be flagged and disabled, but you can quickly and easily appeal that action and get your account back. For spam - In the event that you leave more than one server or if a bot on your account makes it seem like you're leaving multiple servers at once, Discord may disable your account. However, you can quickly and easily appeal the disable and get your account back. More often than not, you'll also receive an email that details why your account was disabled and what next steps you should take."

The email associated with your Discord account will receive a message from Discord about why your account was disabled. If you don't see an email in your Inbox, check your Spam/Junk folders. About 5 years ago, there was a bot mishap on Discord's behalf that resulted in a lot of accounts being disabled for spam, but without getting emails. If you're concerned that this might be happening again, check online for any updates from Discord or contact their customer support. Don't open multiple tickets. Instead, you can reply to your own ticket to refresh it in the queue. But be patient since you most likely aren't the only one experiencing issues with Discord. [1] X Research source"
