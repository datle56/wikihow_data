      "content": "Call emergency services if the situation is dire. Describe the situation calmly and clearly, going into as much detail as you can. Police or emergency responders will pick up the individual and put them in emergency custody where they can be assessed by a mental health professional. [1] X Research source Try to be an advocate for the person, if you can. Let the operator know that the individual suffers from mental illness, so the emergency responders can provide appropriate assistance. If you know the person well, you might be able to accompany them to the hospital and provide helpful information to medical professionals while you’re there.

      "content": "File a petition to get someone committed if it's not an emergency. Visit the courthouse in the district where the person you’re concerned about lives. Once you’re there, ask the clerk for the proper petition forms, and write down all the requested information about the individual you’re worried about. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk to a psychiatrist or lawyer to get help with the process. Deciding to get someone committed to a mental hospital is never an easy choice—but it’s not one that you have to make alone. Speak with someone like a psychiatrist, lawyer (preferably one with experience in mental health legislation), or law enforcement officer to get a better idea about what your options are. These experts will know all the ins and outs of your state’s laws and can let you know if involuntary commitment is a good idea for the person you’re concerned about (including minors)."

      "title": "They’re likely to physically harm themselves or someone else.",
      "content": "They’re likely to physically harm themselves or someone else. Has the person in question recently threatened to hurt themselves or someone else? If they’ve displayed a pattern of violent ideologies and behaviors, they might qualify for involuntary commitment in your state. [3] X Research source Example 1: A friend is threatening to take their own life and has made attempts in the past. Example 2: A relative has violently threatened their housemate and made them fear for their life."

      "title": "They’re gravely disabled.",
      "content": "They’re gravely disabled. Someone is considered “gravely disabled” when their mental illness prevents them from being able to eat properly, clothe themselves, and/or maintain a safe living situation. If a person doesn’t seem capable of caring for their basic needs, involuntary commitment might be necessary. [4] X Research source Example 1: A mentally ill relative doesn’t eat consistently and is malnourished as a result. Example 2: A mentally ill neighbor doesn’t remember to wear clothes and walks nude around the neighborhood."

      "title": "The process to commit someone to a mental hospital is state-specific.",
      "content": "The process to commit someone to a mental hospital is state-specific. In the United States, the state and local government systems are in charge of handling cases related to mental health (as opposed to the federal government). All 50 states (as well as Washington D.C.) have specific requirements that an individual must meet (related to their mental illness and/or addiction) before the commitment process can begin. [5] X Research source Minors can also be involuntarily committed, but the exact procedures are state-specific. Finding your state’s specific requirements can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack—but we’re here to help. You can also click here for specific information and resources about mental health legislation in your state. Individuals suffering from substance abuse can also be involuntarily committed, but it depends on the state. Currently, 38 states and territories (including Washington D.C.) allow this. The only states that don’t allow involuntary commitment for substance abuse cases are New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Alabama, Illinois, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon do not."

      "title": "There are three different elements of involuntary treatment in the United States.",
      "content": "There are three different elements of involuntary treatment in the United States. Treatment Advocacy Center provides information about three key aspects of the involuntary treatment process: emergency psychiatric evaluation, inpatient commitment, and Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT). [6] X Research source Emergency psychiatric evaluation: A person going through a mental health crisis is taken into emergency custody temporarily. The total detainment time is state-specific, but many states cap emergency custody at 3 days/72 hours. An emergency psychiatric evaluation sometimes segues into inpatient commitment. Inpatient commitment: Depending on specific state laws and procedures, an individual may be held at a mental health facility for up to a set amount of time for treatment. This process may include an official court hearing. AOT: This type of outpatient treatment differs by state. Typically, AOT compels community-based, court-ordered mental health treatment."

      "title": "The individual is taken into emergency custody and evaluated.",
      "content": "The individual is taken into emergency custody and evaluated. In some states, relatives and spouses can request an emergency hold for an individual; in other places, only psychiatrists, doctors, and law enforcement officers can make the request. Depending on the state, the individual is held temporarily. [7] X Research source Many states allow emergency holds to last at least 72 hours, while a small handful of states allow for shorter detainment periods."

      "title": "A petition is filed for the individual to receive inpatient treatment.",
      "content": "A petition is filed for the individual to receive inpatient treatment. Some states allow family members to file this petition, while other places only let mental health professionals get the process started. During this time, a court will decide if the individual meets the state’s criteria for involuntary commitment (like being gravely disabled or a danger to themselves or others). [8] X Research source In some cases, the court might recommend supervised outpatient treatment for a person rather than inpatient care. This is known as “step-up AOT.” You might be asked to testify in this court hearing if you’ve personally observed the person’s dangerous behavior. [9] X Research source"

[11] X Research source Most states require a court order for this process to go forward, while a few states (like Pennsylvania, Maryland, Tennessee, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Wyoming) do not. The length of this extended inpatient treatment also depends on the state—some places, like Delaware and Arizona, cap the extra treatment at 90 days, while other places, like Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Nebraska, Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Connecticut, don’t have a maximum time limit.
