      "content": "GTG originated in the 1990s to give status updates via IRC technology. In the early days of IRC (Internet Relay Chat, or instant messaging), not only were there finite screen sizes and character limits, but there were no straightforward ways to update your status and say you were logging off. Thus, GTG become an easy way of updating your status. GTG’s popularity kept taking off in the 2000s when instant messaging and SMS texting became common. The acronym continues to be widely used on current messaging apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and so on."
