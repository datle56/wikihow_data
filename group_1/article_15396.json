It’s still important to avoid too many empty calories, but you should feel totally empowered to fix yourself all of your other favorites at mealtime. Try to avoid favorites that are high in sugar and fat. It's okay to throw in a piece of cake every now and again, but most of your meals should remain nutrient rich. Focus on enjoying nutritious favorites. Try a sweet yogurt parfait, some spicy guac, or a grilled cheese on whole-wheat bread.
