      "content": "Clean and disinfect your sand for play or pet use (optional). If you’re concerned your sand is contaminated (for example, if a backyard animal uses your sandbox as a bathroom), disinfect it before drying it. First, rake or comb through the sand to remove large or visible debris. Transfer the sand to a container and spray it with a 50/50 mix of bleach and water or distilled white vinegar and water until the top layer is saturated (vinegar is a natural disinfectant option, although it’s not quite as potent as bleach). Mix and spray the sand repeatedly until all of the sand is damp with your cleaning solution. Allow the surface to dry for an hour before mixing again. If you’re not worried about disinfecting your sand, skip this step."

      "content": "Place the sand in the sun in its container. This is the easiest way to dry the sand, whether you have a sandbox or a bucket of sand for a terrarium. Pick a hot, sunny day and set the container in direct sunlight. Make sure to leave the lid off the container. [1] X Research source If you need it to dry quicker, pour the sand out on a large blanket or tarp and spread the sand out evenly in a thin layer. Set that in the sun. Weigh the edges down with rocks so it doesn't blow away. As a bonus, the sun’s UV rays can kill some bacteria and viruses that may be lurking in the sand, making it safer for pets and kids to play in.

      "content": "Stir the sand every 30 minutes or so. The sand on the bottom will take a lot longer to dry than the sand on the top. If you stir it up every so often, the drying will go much faster. Use your hands, a shovel, a rake, or even a stick to stir and mix the sand around. The sand will take up to several hours to dry, depending on how hot the day is and how wet the sand is."

      "content": "Leave the sand out in the sun until it dries completely. Continue checking on the sand to see how dry it is. [3] X Research source Also, watch the weather, as you don't want it to get rained on! When it's fully dry, you can put the sand back into your sandbox, pet enclosure, or craft supplies area. If you cleaned your sand beforehand, it may take up to 48 hours to fully dry since you dampened it all the way through. To keep crafting sand dry, store it in an airtight container or bag in a dry area like a closet or cabinet (and away from potentially damp areas like basements or sheds). Use a waterproof cover or tarp to keep your sandbox covered when not in use. That will help keep the sand from getting wet (and deter backyard animals from using it as a litter box).

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 200–250 °F (93–121 °C). Turn the oven on to get it heating for your sand. [5] X Research source You don't want to go too hot, as you want to steam off the water slowly. Drying sand in the oven is ideal for smaller quantities of sand you’d use for crafts or to fill a pet terrarium. Aquatic and terrarium installation specialist Joe Perez says you can set your oven as low as 170 °F (77 °C) to dry sand. However, a lower temperature may take longer."

      "content": "Sift debris out of the sand and spread it out on a baking tray. Use a sand sifter to remove debris from the sand before drying. Then, choose a disposable baking dish or cover a large baking tray with foil to protect it. Perez recommends spreading the sand out in a thin layer on the tray (using more than one tray if you need to). A disposable tray is best as you don't want to reuse the dish for cooking after using it for sand. You could also make a dedicated tray for cleaning and heating sand. To dry large quantities of sand this way, you may need to bake the sand in multiple batches."

      "content": "Put the tray in the oven for 30-45 minutes. Set the tray in the oven for 30 minutes, stirring the sand halfway through. Check the sand after 30 minutes to see if it's dry. [6] X Research source If it's not, Perez advises to stir it and put it back in the oven for 15-minute intervals until it's dry. Alternatively, place the sand outside in the sun on a hot day. You'll still need to stir it every so often."

      "content": "Place the sand into a cement mixer. Pour the sand into the mixer with a wheelbarrow or bucket underneath to catch any sand that falls out. You can also tip the opening up so it doesn't fall out. [7] X Research source Purchasing a cement mixer can cost several hundred dollars. To save money, consider renting one. Depending on the size of the mixer and how long you need it for, renting may only cost $50 to $60 per day. This works for projects that need large quantities of sand like building projects, making putting greens, or sandblasting ."

      "title": "Set up a propane torch",
      "content": "Set up a propane torch or other heat source in front of the cement mixer opening. A propane torch works best if you aim the cement mixer so sand pours out, and the torch heats it as it falls. Aim the torch along the bottom edge of the mixer with part of the flame going inside. For other heat sources, you can aim them directly into the mixer and let them heat the sand as it tumbles. Make sure to leave about 1 ft (30 cm) or so of space between the 2 to allow room to vent. [8] X Research source For instance, you can use an industrial propane heater for this purpose. You can buy propane heaters and torches at hardware stores."

      "content": "Turn the mixer on to tumble and heat the sand until dry. The mixer will help stir up the sand to increase airflow and dry out more quickly. Let the mixer go until the sand is completely dry, which will depend on how much you have and how wet it is. This will likely go faster with a torch, as it heats the sand as it pours out. With a heater, it may take 30 minutes or more. You can turn the heater off after about 20 minutes to let the mixer continue to steam the water off. [9] X Research source"
