Secure the stems with kitchen twine or a rubber band, ensuring that they stay together securely without crushing them. Trim off the excess bottom and top portions of any stems that stick out if you want the bundles to look even. If you are cutting the chives from a garden, trim them early in the morning after the dew has dried when they are the healthiest and full of flavor."
