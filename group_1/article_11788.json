      "title": "Ask your teacher why they seem to dislike you.",
      "content": "Ask your teacher why they seem to dislike you. If you are unsure why your teacher doesn't like you, ask them to have a private conversation with you. Don't actually ask \"Why do you hate me?\" Instead, you should express to your teacher that you'd like to do well in their class, and ask them what you can do to improve as a student. [2] X Research source Prove to your teacher that you're a serious student and that you respect them. This may lead to your teacher respecting you back. A few phrases you can say are: \"Passing this class is important to me, and I'd like to know what changes I need to make in order to make that happen.\" \"I'd really like to improve my relationship with you because I feel like I can learn a lot from you and this class. Please let me know what I can do to make that happen.\""

      "title": "Apologize for your wrongdoings.",
      "content": "Apologize for your wrongdoings. A genuine apology will go a long way with your teacher. When you apologize, you need to do two things.

You must be genuine with your apology, and make a conscious effort to not make the same mistakes going forward. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk to your parents or to the principal. If you're feeling bullied, scared, or hurt by your teacher, it is important that you talk to the principal or to your parents. It is never okay for a teacher to bully a student, so you should seek help if you can't fix your relationship with your teacher on your own.

      "title": "Don't cause disruptions during class.",
      "content": "Don't cause disruptions during class. Be aware of your behavior because good students never cause disruptions or distractions during class.

      "title": "Put effort into your schoolwork.",
      "content": "Put effort into your schoolwork. If your teacher can tell that you are not putting any effort into your homework or class assignments, they won't be very impressed with you. [5] X Research source Teachers like students who study for tests, turn in their homework assignments and participate in group projects. If you're having trouble with your schoolwork, approach your teacher and ask them for help. If your teacher sees that you're trying, they'll usually appreciate your effort."

      "title": "Go above and beyond to participate in class.",
      "content": "Go above and beyond to participate in class. Teachers appreciate students who genuinely enjoy learning and helping in the classroom. Always volunteer during class, offer to arrive early or stay late to help prepare a lesson or clean up the classroom, and ask your teacher if there are any extracurricular activities for you to get involved in. If you improve as a student, your relationship with your teacher should improve as well."

      "content": "Get to know your teacher. You might see your teacher as only being a teacher, but keep in mind that they have a life of their own. Your teacher may be going through problems in their personal life, be stressed out from bad students, or be tired from working so much. Don't be too hard on your teacher and remember that they are a person too. Ask your teacher about their weekend, or what their favorite movies are. They'll appreciate you making an effort to learn more about them. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't give your teacher a reason not to like you. You and your teacher don't have to be best friends, but you should be able to work together in a stress-free environment. Don't be a nuisance or give your teacher a hard time, and they'll most likely stop giving you a hard time. If you focus on your schoolwork and treat your teacher with respect, they should have no reason to dislike you."

      "title": "Speak to your teacher respectfully.",
      "content": "Speak to your teacher respectfully. If your teacher seems to dislike you, it may be difficult for you to treat them with respect.
