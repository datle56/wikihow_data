      "content": "Write your character’s personal and biographical details at the top. This includes their name, age, birth place, where they live, and their basic personal details, such as their species and sex or gender if they have one. List as many details that you can think of right now. It’s okay if you don’t know everything yet. You could write, “Alice, 25, born at home, lives in a small rural town called Wisty, human witch, female, has magic.” If you’re not sure about a detail, leave a blank space for it so that you can come back later. Sometimes it takes time to really understand a character."

Hay Professional Writer Expert Interview. 16 July 2019. Consider what your OC is going to contribute to the story, then assign them a basic role. It’s okay if you go back and change this later, but it’s good to have an idea. For instance, your character might be the hero, the villain, the femme fatale, the wise elder, the romancer, or the helper. As an example, a female character who uses her looks to hide the fact that she’s a dangerous thief might be a femme fatale. It’s okay if your character has more than 1 role. For instance, a male character who falls in love while rescuing a city might be both a hero and a romancer."

[4] X Research source For instance, “Alice has always lived in a small town and feels like she’s the most talented witch in her family. Her parents home schooled her and taught her the old ways of her family, so she’s not familiar with modern society. She’s always tried really hard to learn new spells, to the point that she annoyed her family members. Her parents have always supported her and built up her self-esteem, but it’s made her have too much confidence in her abilities. Now, her parents have disappeared and she needs to find them, but her overconfidence is causing her to make mistakes.”"

For instance, Alice might clean her house and cook her breakfast using a spell. Then, you might have her struggle to purchase items at a store because she can’t use her magic there. This shows that she overly relies on her magic. As another example, you might show Alice trying to check out a magic book from the library.

Her and Lilly love each other, but can't agree on certain things, causing them to argue. Lilly doesn't have a lot of faith for the relationship. However, Alice is set on making the relationship work. This might convey that Alice is determined to make things work with people she cares for. As another example, let’s say Alice has a best friend named Trixy. You might have a scene where Alice and Trixy come across an injured witch in the woods. Alice might stop and help the witch, offering him her last bit of water and food. Trixy might roll her eyes and tell Alice that she’s wasting her time by helping. Then, Trixy might go to get help but return really late because she took a break to do something fun. This shows that Alice is kind and helpful, while Trixy might be unreliable."
