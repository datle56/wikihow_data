      "content": "Secure the glass onto your work surface. Lay a piece of scrap plywood or foam board on your work surface so you don’t accidentally drill into it. Set the glass flat on the wood or styrofoam, and secure plastic clamps around the edges to hold it in place. [1] X Research source If you’re drilling a hole in a bottle or jar, lay it horizontally in a small container so it can’t move around. Avoid drilling into tempered glass because it’s made to shatter into small pieces when damaged. Tempered glass usually has smooth edges, waves or ripples on the surface, or a stamp certifying that it has gone through the tempering process. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Place tape on the glass and mark where you want the hole. “Wherever you're going to drill, put a piece of [masking] tape over it,” says handyman Jason Philip. “Then, mark the exact spot that you want to drill with a marker. The tape will hold the drill bit in place…so it doesn't move at all.”"

      "content": "Install a drill bit made for cutting glass on your drill. A variable-speed drill works best for drilling glass because you can control your drilling speed a lot more easily. Loosen the chuck on your drill to change the bit . Install a glass-cutting drill bit on your drill, and tighten the chuck again. [3] X Research source If you want to know what will work best for your project, check our guide on the best drill bits to use below. If you need to cut a large hole in a piece of glass, start off with a smaller bit to make a pilot hole. This can help relieve pressure so the glass doesn’t shatter or break. Avoid using drill bits made for wood because they could get damaged or cause the glass to chip more easily. If you’re drilling through a thin piece of glass, you can also use a Dremel tool with a diamond-tipped attachment . Wear safety glasses , a dust mask , and work gloves whenever you drill glass to protect yourself from shards or glass dust."

      "title": "Wet the surface with water or glass cutting oil.",
      "content": "Wet the surface with water or glass cutting oil . Lubricating the glass prevents the drill bit from getting stuck and also prevents glass dust from getting into the air. Spray the water or cutting oil around the area before you start and while you’re drilling into the glass. [4] X Research source If you don’t use any lubricant, the glass could get hot and crack. If you don’t want to worry about reapplying water or lubricant, shape construction putty into small walls around the spot you’re drilling. Then, pour a little water or oil inside the putty walls so it pools up."

      "title": "Drill through the glass with a low speed setting.",
      "content": "Drill through the glass with a low speed setting. Set your drill to its lowest speed setting and hold it so the bit is perpendicular to the glass. Apply very little pressure and slowly drill into the surface. As you drill, continue applying water or oil to keep the drill bit lubricated. When you’ve nearly drilled through the entire piece of glass, reduce the pressure on the drill so the glass doesn’t chip. [5] X Research source You can remove the tape once there’s a divot in the glass because the drill bit won’t slip around anymore. If you notice any dust or smoke coming from the hole, apply more water or cutting oil to help cool the glass down. Avoid using higher speeds on your drill because you’re more likely to damage the glass or drill bit."

      "content": "Smooth the edges of the hole with sandpaper or a diamond file . Wet a piece of 80-grit sandpaper or use your file, and rub it back and forth across the cut edges of the hole. Once the edges look smooth, use 150-grit sandpaper to smooth out the edges even more. [6] X Research source Depending on how polished or tapered you want the edges of the hole, you can also use 320-grit sandpaper followed by 2,000-grit sandpaper . Make sure you’re wearing your gloves when you smooth out the glass because the edges may be sharp."

Then, apply glass cleaner and wipe it up to remove other fingerprints and streaks. [7] X Research source Check the glass for any cracks or chips around the edges of the hole. If you still see some, use your sandpaper or diamond file again."
