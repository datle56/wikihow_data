This can take anywhere from 10 days up to a few months. Opt for low-impact exercises such as swimming or cycling instead."

      "content": "Take ibuprofen to reduce pain. Over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen can help minimize swelling and temporarily reduce pain. The recommended dosage for the average adult is 200 to 400 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed. If you have any ongoing medical conditions or take other medications regularly, be sure to talk to your doctor prior to taking any new medications. [3] X Research source Other over-the-counter pain medications including naxopren and aspirin can also help manage metatarsalgia pain. Avoid long-term use of ibuprofen unless you're under the supervision of a doctor. If you are on other daily medications, including ACE inhibitors, talk to your doctor about potential drug interactions before taking any over-the-counter pain medication."

      "content": "Eat a balanced diet to maintain a healthy weight. Eating a healthy diet can help you achieve or maintain a healthy weight. This, in turn, takes pressure off your foot, helping to alleviate pain. Try to eat a balanced diet that is comprised of around 10-35% protein, 20-35% healthy fats, and 45-65% carbohydrates. [5] X Research source Try to focus your carb intake on complex carbs like fruits, beans, whole grains, and vegetables. Most of your diet should consist of anti-inflammatory foods.

      "content": "Exercise regularly using low-impact training methods. Low-impact exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and restore a full range of mobility to your foot. While you recover, try exercises like walking, using an elliptical, swimming, cycling, rowing, yoga, and tai chi. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist to see how long you should maintain a low-impact exercise routine. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Some people need to stick to low-impact exercise for a few weeks to a few months after initially treating metatarsalgia. Others will need to switch to a low-impact routine for a matter of months, years, or even permanently."

      "title": "Switch your footwear to exercise shoes with cushioned soles.",
      "content": "Switch your footwear to exercise shoes with cushioned soles. Wearing wider shoes with cushioned soles can help prevent future metatarsalgia-related pain. Switch your shoes to comfortable, cushioned styles and replace old shoes as soon as they wear down. Your doctor or podiatrist may be able to help you choose a brand of shoe that will work for your metatarsalgia. A shoe store that specializes in selling orthopedic and other specialty shoes may also be able to help you pick a comfortable pair. Try to avoid high heels as much as possible. Shoes with no arch support, such as flip-flops, can be used for short activities such as going outside to check the mail, but they should not be worn for longer periods of activity."

      "content": "Make a doctor’s appointment for any ongoing or worsening pain. Minor metatarsalgia can sometimes be treated at home with pain management and lifestyle changes. Pain lasting more than 2-3 weeks or worsening pain or swelling may necessitate a doctor’s visit. Your doctor or sports injury specialist can use x-rays, ultrasounds, or MRIs to look for complications and additional damage. [8] X Research source As metatarsalgia can often be treated at home, minor pains do not always require a doctor's visit or diagnosis. Ongoing or worsening pain, though, should be checked as soon as possible to make sure other conditions aren't responsible for or contributing to the problem. Problems like arthritis and bone degeneration can make metatarsalgia difficult to heal."

      "content": "Ask your doctor if surgery is necessary. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to treat metatarsalgia pain that cannot be relieved. If treatment is not working and your doctor has ruled out other potential causes for pain, talk to them about your surgical options. They will be able to review the surgical process and connect you with a specialist. [10] X Research source Depending on the cause and severity of your condition, potential surgeries may include hammertoe repositioning, bone repositioning, and bunion surgery. Recovery from these procedures could take 3-6 months."
