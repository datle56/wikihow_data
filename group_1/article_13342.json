The blade of your foot is the outside edge, which you will use to strike your target. When you lift your knee you should be pointing your heel at the target. [1] X Research source Although you would normally turn your body sideways during the side kick, for now you should start sideways to practice the motion of the kicking foot only. This is a straight kick so you must have your heel pointing at the target before straightening your leg."

You should try to get as much of your sole facing the ground as possible so think of your big toe lifting up and your little toes pointing down. [2] X Research source You will always strike with the blade of your foot for this strike so make sure you remember this. Aim to the body of your opponent. Make sure that your heel is higher than your toes when striking."

      "title": "Rotate your foot to open up your hips and generate power.",
      "content": "Rotate your foot to open up your hips and generate power. Rotating your foot all the way around will open up your hips so that your foot can strike the target at the correct position. This rotation also provides the power of the side kick. You can push off your foot as it turns so that you can use your strong hip, bum and core muscles to drive your kicking foot out at your target. This rotation means you turn power from the ground into the power going forward in the kick, making the kick stronger and harder. As a beginner you can rotate your foot before straightening your knee to strike your target. As you progress make sure you are rotating your foot at the very end of your strike (when your knee is almost straightened) so that you rotate your hip into the kick. This generates more power and strength."

Your knee should be in the same position from when you first bring it up, through making contact with your foot and while bringing your foot back to your body. For example, if you bring your knee to waist height at first it should stay at waist height when you make contact with the target and while you bring your foot back to your body. Dropping your knee will cause a loss of power and will prevent your kick from going horizontally through the target."

Bring your back foot around and bend your knee as you rotate your body. Your knee should now be at your chest and there should be a straight line between your hip, heel and the target. For example, if your kicking foot (back foot) is your left foot then you will continue rotating counterclockwise while bringing your left knee to your chest. There should then be a straight line between your left hip, left heel and the target. This is the “spin” of the spinning (or reverse) side kick.

This means you will have to be turning your body and hips simultaneously. Think of the kick as a stomping motion to give you extra power and strength.
