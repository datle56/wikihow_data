A cache is a group of temporary files that allow websites and applications to work faster, but sometimes these files can become corrupt, which leads to errors.

Restart your computer and check to see if you still get error 0. Mac: Open Finder, go to Go > Go to Folderâ€¦ , then type ~/Library/Caches/ . Click the Go button and open the Roblox folder. Delete everything inside the folder, then restart your Mac to see if you still get error 0.

Scroll until you find Roblox, tap on it, and select Clear Cache . iPhone & iPad: On iOS, the best way to clear the cache is to uninstall the Roblox app and then reinstall it so only the essential files will be installed."
