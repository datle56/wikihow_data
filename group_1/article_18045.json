In order to plan your routine effectively, first take time to write down all of the different things that should be included in your after-school routine. Don’t worry yet about timing, order, or other practical factors. Instead, just make a checklist of the various things that may be included in your kids’ after-school schedule. Here’s an example of the main items that we suggest including in your afternoon routine: [1] X Research source ロ After-school organized activities ロ Snack ロ Homework ロ Additional learning ロ Chores ロ Outdoor play or exercise ロ Screen time ロ Shower or bath ロ Dinner ロ Packing school bag for the next day ロ Get ready for bed"

Once you’ve identified the main components of your after-school routine, it’s time to organize them into a realistic daily schedule. Start by figuring out exactly how many hours you have to plan for between school and bedtime—if your child leaves school at 3 pm and has to be in bed at 9 pm, for instance, they have 6 hours to complete their routine. Break up these hours into small chunks (i.e., 30-minute periods) and write them onto a handwritten or digital timetable , then follow the recommended steps below to complete your schedule: [2] X Research source Write in the more inflexible items , like your regular dinner time, bathtime, and weekly after-school commitments (i.e., soccer practice or music lessons). If your kids have different organized activities on different days of the week, make a separate schedule for each day. Create an “as soon as you get in the door” routine, or what you want your child to do within the first 5-10 minutes of getting home. This time often includes putting backpacks and school materials in a designated spot and having a healthy after-school snack . Include some sort of physical activity if your child hasn’t already attended a sports practice or other type of exercise. Physical activity could be anything from going for a walk, kicking a ball around, or even just having extended playtime in the house. [3] X Research source Add some time for chores or tidying. Whatever your kids’ daily chores are, make sure you give them sufficient time to do them after school. If they need to clean up their room, do their laundry, or organize their backpack, these are all activities that fall into this category. Schedule a regular time for homework , which is often best done straight after dinner. By this time, kids will have had a nice break between school and homework, but they’ll also have time to relax again before bed. [4] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Give your child time to play, relax, or have some screen time. Before bed, make sure your kid has a chance to really relax after their playtime, chores, and homework. They may spend this time reading, chatting with the family, or watching a movie."

Now that you have an impeccably written schedule for your after-school routine, it’s just as important to follow it to the best of your ability. One way to make the routine easier for you is to prepare ahead of time for your child’s arrival from school—at least as much as possible. Make sure that they have a designated space for their school papers and backpacks, have their snack ready to go in the fridge, and bring anything they need along in the car for school pick-up. [5] X Research source For instance, you might decide that your routine works best if your kids eat their snacks or do their homework on the car ride home—especially if you live a long way from their school. In this case, come prepared with snacks, clipboards, pencils, and whatever else you might need to make your PM routine go smoothly."

      "content": "Be flexible and manage your expectations as you cement the routine. One of the keys to having a successful routine is not trying to fit too much into it. A good routine structures your family’s time in order to help take pressure off and give everyone some needed structure, not one that demands a lot and actually increases the pressure. Be realistic when you are drawing up and following your routine. [6] X Research source As you continue to work on your routine, be flexible and willing to make changes—especially when it comes to the needs of your kids. Make adjustments as needed, while still finding a way to be consistent. Even once you’ve found a daily schedule that works for you and your family, things will come up to interfere with it—like birthday dinners, after-school playdates, medical appointments, new extracurricular activities, etc. Be open to tweaking your daily routine for these events as long as it remains consistent over time and continues to fulfill your child’s needs."

Just like with an after-school routine, it’s crucial to create a checklist and schedule of all the important things that need to get done before school . Mornings tend to be a little more harried, however, so it’s recommended to make a written or visual morning checklist that your kids have access to so that they can mentally check off the list as they proceed through their routine. Here’s an example checklist for a standard morning routine , which you can accompany with images if you have younger kids: [11] X Research source ロ Get dressed ロ Eat breakfast ロ Brush teeth ロ Wash face ロ Comb hair ロ Put on shoes and coat ロ Study time (best for older kids) ロ Chores (e.g., loading dishwasher, making bed—best for older kids) ロ Get backpack and lunch box ロ Get in the car/Start heading to school"

That being said, being up before the kiddos can make a huge difference in your before-school routine. Start by setting your alarm for 15-30 minutes before your kids typically get up, then make adjustments from there based on how much you’re able to get done in that extra time. If you’re already showered, dressed, and packed for the day by the time any children wake up, you’ll not only have more time to help out the kids, but you also may be able to squeeze in some you-time by listening to podcast, journaling, doing a 15-minute stretching routine, or even just sitting silently with a cup of coffee."

It also helps kids to get some necessary playtime into their schedule. [16] X Research source However, it’s still important to consider your kid’s overall schedule before planning a playdate.
