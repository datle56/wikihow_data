      "content": "Put new filters in your HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system. The air in your home can become overly dusty if the filters in your furnace and air conditioning systems are old and dirty. Change out the filters every 2 to 3 months and put a new filter in when you turn on a system for the first time each year. How often you need to change out your filters does depend on your specific heating and cooling system, what kind of filters you use, and what the conditions in your home are. For example, if you have several cats or dogs, you should be changing out your filter every 3 weeks. [2] X Research source If you are unsure, talk to the person that services your HVAC system about how often you should be changing your filters out. By putting a new filter in you will be filtering your air every time you turn on your heating or cooling system."

      "content": "Purchase a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) air purifier. HEPA air purifiers are the best for getting rid of dust because they filter out even fine matter in the air. These air purifiers are widely available at big box stores and from online retailers. Typically HEPA air purifiers are stand-alone units that plug into a wall outlet. Put your new air purifier in the room that feels the dustiest. Often this will be your bedroom, as the linens and the amount to time you spend in there creates a lot of dust."

      "content": "Clean or replace the filters in your air purifier often. As a filter gets dirty, it's less able to filter out dust in the air. Follow the directions that came on your air filter for how often to clean it. However, don't be afraid to clean it more often than recommended. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Many air purifiers come with a pre-filter and a filter. The pre-filter will often be washable but the larger main filter needs to be replaced when it gets dirty. Whether a filter is cleaned or replaced depends on your specific air purifier. In general, it costs more for cleanable filters but you will save money over time by not having to replace your filter."

      "content": "Don't buy houseplants thinking they will remove dust in the air. Many people believe that houseplants improve air quality in a home but they don't make the air less dusty. In fact, the soil that plants live in can add to dust to the air and some plants will even add pollen and other particles to the air.

They just aren't a magical solution for dust problems."

      "content": "Vacuum your house twice a week. Vacuuming regularly is one of the best things you can do to eliminate dust in the air. Surfaces that you should be vacuuming include rugs, carpets, sofas, under beds, window sills, and baseboards. [5] X Research source When you vacuum it removes all of the debris and dirt that gets kicked up into the air when you walk around or when there is air movement. Make sure you are using a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter in your vacuum. This will help ensure that the dust that your vacuum sucks up isn't pushed through the filter and back out into the air."

      "content": "Mop hard floor surfaces twice a week. Dirt and debris that builds up on your hard floor surfaces also gets kicked up into the air. To prevent this, use a damp mop to clean floor areas that can't be vacuumed. You can also use a dry dust mop on your hard surfaces. However, they do not remove as much dust as a wet mop does."

      "content": "Use a microfiber cloth or duster to dust hard surfaces. Microfiber products are great at trapping the dust that they collect from surfaces. You can either get your cloth slightly damp or use it dry, depending on whether the surface you are cleaning can get damp. [6] X Research source Traditional old feather dusters do not do a good job at trapping the dust they have collected. Instead, they tend to throw a lot of dust into the air and onto other surfaces."

      "content": "Wash your sheets weekly. Since we all spend a lot of time in your sheets, they tend to collect a lot of dust and grime that comes off of our bodies. However, if we wash our sheets every week, the dust and grime doesn't have a chance to get into our air. Washing your sheets weekly also reduces the number of dust mites, bacteria, and other allergens in your bed that can impact your breathing negatively. [7] X Research source"

Controlling the amount of dirt and grime that comes into your home can greatly reduce the amount of dust and allergens that end up in your air. When you wear your shoes inside, the dirt and allergens from outside get transferred to your floors and end up in your air. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your doors and windows closed as much as possible. A lot of dust and dirt can come into your home through open windows and doors. Although it may be tempting to get a fresh breeze blowing through your home, remember that that breeze includes dust and allergens that will settle on your home surfaces and get kicked up when you walk around. How much dust will come into your home through an open window or door depends a lot on where you live, what time of year it is, and what the air conditions are currently. Some areas normally have more dust and debris in the air than others, so take your specific location into consideration."

      "content": "Close your chimney flue. If you have a fireplace, it's important to keep the flue closed when it's not in use. Closing it will help seal out the outside and keep dust in the air at a minimum. This is especially important if it is windy outside, as the wind can go down your chimney and push dust and debris from the chimney into your home."

Then clean up needed items by putting them away in closets and cupboards. Get rid of items that you don't need and you will have open spaces that can be dusted or vacuumed quickly and regularly.
