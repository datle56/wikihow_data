      "title": "Place the squirrel pieces in a large saucepan and cover with water.",
      "content": "Place the squirrel pieces in a large saucepan and cover with water. Place the saucepan on the stove and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Allow the squirrel meat to simmer until tender, about an hour and a half. Be sure to simmer, not boil the meat; it should not be falling off the bone when you remove it from heat. If you have an older squirrel, it may take longer for the meat to become tender."

      "title": "Pour oil into a frying pan.",
      "content": "Pour oil into a frying pan. Heat the oil over medium high heat. The oil should cover the bottom of the pan and come 1/4 way up the sides. To deep fry the squirrel pieces, heat an inch of oil into a Dutch oven or large saucepan. To test whether the oil is hot enough to fry, dip the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil. When the oil bubbles rapidly around the spoon, it's ready to fry."

You may skip this step if you want to grill a squirrel over a fire in the woods and don't have time to soak it first."

    {
      "title": "Light the grill.",
      "content": "Light the grill. Set up a charcoal grill with low, steady heat. If you're camping in the woods, build a fire and allow it to burn down until you have hot, slow-burning embers to cook over."
