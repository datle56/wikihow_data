      "content": "“Game is game” stems from African American Vernacular English (AAVE). While the exact origin of “game is game” is unknown, it became popular in rap music during the 1990s. One of the earliest uses of the phrase was in the song “Stories From the Black Book” by K-Rino. In the third verse of the song, K-Rino says, “Game is game yet death is reality,” meaning a person can do everything in their power to get ahead in life but death is inevitable. [3] X Research source The phrase gained mainstream popularity in 2023, due to TikTok and Instagram user @lifeandscarz . He would say “game is game” at the end of his “dating advice” videos, which often featured manipulative tactics to attract women. People started reacting to @lifeandscarz’s videos and creating their own memes featuring the phrase. “Game is game 🗣️” also became a popular spam comment, usually under male dating advice videos, which helped the phrase reach a broader audience."

      "content": "Yes, “game is game” is problematic because it encourages manipulation. Lying to someone to date or hook up with them is deemed morally wrong because it takes away their ability to make a decision based on accurate information. True consent in a relationship requires full transparency, and when you lie to someone, it’s a form of manipulation. [4] X Research source This type of behavior can cause long-term trauma and distrust for the other person, especially if they’ve been honest and vulnerable the entire time. Overall, “game is game” undermines the key dating principles of honesty, trust, and respect, and it shifts relationships from meaningful and genuine to transactional and one-sided."
