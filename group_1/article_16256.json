If someone is making a total fool of themselves, acting super cocky, or sharing a deeply unpopular (or straight up rude) opinion, leave one of these to humble them with humor. The more vicious the joke, though, the higher the chance that your comment gets reported for bullying or harassment—remember that the goal of a fairy comment is to be creatively and humorously offensive, and not to cause real harm or distress.

      "content": "A fairy comment is a one-liner that begins innocently but takes a mean twist. The comments are usually left on video posts on TikTok and Instagram to jokingly troll other creators (AKA, deliberately annoy them) and make them feel insecure, as well as to get engagement from other users in the comments section. The comments also an opportunity for people to get creative and make jokes that skirt around a platform’s community guidelines without directly violating them. [2] X Research source Most fairy comments are left on videos where the creator has a “bad take” (ranging from unpopular but innocent opinions to truly offensive or derogatory speech) or where the creator earnestly thinks they’ve really done something special or unique, but others think it’s poorly done or not very impressive. For example, if a creator is showing off their lackluster “outfit of the day,” a commenter might say “You’re showing off the goods 👑🌸 and it burns our eyes 🧚‍♂️🌿.”"

      "title": "Most fairy comments follow the same structure.",
      "content": "Most fairy comments follow the same structure. The first part of the comment (the setup) is a supportive or complimentary phrase (for example, “You go girl!”) to misdirect the reader into thinking the comment is positive. The second part is a surprise punchline that catches the reader off guard and is usually mean and witty (for example, “No really, go away!”). A short sequence of cute and innocent emojis goes in the middle of the comment to break up the setup and punchline. This gives the comment lots of visual appeal (great for getting attention in a crowded comments section) and naturally makes the reader pause for a split second before reading the punchline. [3] X Research source Most fairy comments also end with a short string of emojis after the punchline to keep up the faux positivity. All together, you get something like “You go girl 💅🧚💞 no really, go away 👋☀️🌸” Fairy comments are considered a unique part of Gen Z humor because of how closely related they are to social media platforms like Instagram or TikTok. Fairy comments wouldn’t exist without those apps!"

      "content": "To gently make fun of their friends Fairy comments are meant to get laughs from other commenters, but sometimes, the creator gets a chuckle too! Fairy commenting on a friend’s post is the safest way to get creative with comedic insults without the fear of getting reported or hurting the creator’s feelings. Example: If someone is showing off their outfit of the day and their friend wants to playfully make a joke at them, they might comment “You’re serving ✨💕🔮💞😙 🧜🏼‍♀️guess we’re starving 🧚🏼‍♂️💋🌈💫”"

      "content": "When someone posts a bad take or opinion that others dislike When someone shares a polarizing opinion or makes a truly offensive remark (along the lines of the -isms and -phobias that plague our society), people might share a fairy comment to make a lighthearted dig at them. The comment alone may not get to them, but fairy comments tend to get a lot of attention from other people who see the post—this can change the mood of the entire comments section! Example: If someone posts a video where they say pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza when you believe it does, someone could comment “You’re bold for having confidence🧚❣️💞 next time don’t✨🌼”"

      "title": "When someone thinks they did something well, but really didn’t",
      "content": "When someone thinks they did something well, but really didn’t This scenario is a lot more lighthearted than when someone’s posting offensive opinions. When someone is really confident in their abilities or choices but the end result is questionable (for example, learning some music video choreo but performing it horribly), someone might leave a fairy comment to jokingly rib the person. It’ll seem like a friendly joke if they know the person, but has the potential to hurt feelings if they and the creator are strangers. Example: If someone posts about how delicious their home cooked dinner is but the video makes the meal look gray and horrible, someone might say “love your hidden talent ✨🌸👑 maybe keep it hidden 🥰🧚‍♀️🤩”"

      "content": "When the comments section is going off Fairy comments are great for engagement, but they won’t get much traction if the post has few views and a bare comments section. People usually choose posts with lots of comments already for the best shot at getting some likes and replies. In super popular videos, the original creator might not even see the comment anyhow—in a way, fairy comments are just as much for other commenters as they are for the creator!"

Pick a generic compliment (like “Your confidence is inspiring”), some words of wisdom (like “People say you can do anything if you try”), or an observation from the post (like “This comments section is mean”). A lot of fairy comments start with recognizable phrases or expressions to further mislead the reader."

Think about where your setup wants to go (how would you normally expect this comment to end?) and swap in something completely unexpected and a little bit rude. The surprise of the punchline is what makes fairy comments so stinging and funny! For example: “Your confidence is inspiring…me to leave.” “People say you can do anything if you try…but they weren’t talking about you.” “This comments section is mean…and I can see why.”"

      "content": "Stuff bright and cute emojis between the setup and after the punchline. The last element of a fairy comment is the emojis! There doesn’t have to be a rhyme or reason to the emojis you choose–-you can pick anything bright, colorful, cute, innocent, or “fairy”-looking. “Your confidence is inspiring ✨💖 me to leave 🌳💐🧚” “People say you can do anything if you try 💗🌟 but they weren’t talking about you 💅☀️” “This comments section is mean 👍😀 and I can see why 🌻🧚🫶” Struggling to come up with an original fairy comment?

      "content": "Fairy comments gained popularity in 2020 on Instagram. It’s not totally known why, but it may be because many people were forced to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and looking for new ways to communicate and express themselves online. [4] X Research source TikTok had come out just a few years earlier in 2016, and Instagram introduced reels (a video feature similar to how TikTok) in 2020. [5] X Research source The combination of new social media video platforms and less in-person interaction set the stage for fairy comments to be born. The term “fairy comments” may come from the aesthetically cute and whimsical emojis (like the fairy 🧚 emoji itself) that define what a fairy comment looks like. It might also allude to how the original versions of many classic fairy tales begin innocently and take a dark twist at the end."
