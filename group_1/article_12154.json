Let the Mod Podge dry before you use your board. You can also glue your fabric down using spray adhesive. Cover the frame with painter's tape first, then spray both the fabric and the cork part with glue. Press the fabric down onto the board and smooth out any wrinkles. Remove the tape. You can also use printed paper or washi tape for this. [1] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 28 April 2021.

Paint your board with a paint primer first, then apply two to three coats of chalkboard paint. Once the paint dries, cover the entire board with chalk, then wipe the chalk off. This is known as \"priming.\""

Place washi tape or any other patterned tape over the frame. Glue ribbon over the frame using fabric glue. Tape the sides first and then the top and bottom. Get a ruler and smooth over the tape. On the inner edge of the board and tape, use the edge of the ruler to push the edges of the tape down evenly. Use hot glue, super glue, or tacky glue to attach rhinestones or buttons to the frame. Cover the frame with some Mod Podge, then shake glitter onto it. Cover the frame again using glossy Mod Podge to seal the glitter in."

You can be more creative and use wrapping paper or colorful fabric instead. Wrapping paper is great because it adds a lot of texture and pattern. You might want to use a solid-colored background and letters, as well as large, simple shapes, when decorating it. This will keep the designs from clashing. Fabric is great because pins and staples won't leave holes in it. It also won't fade, rip, or tear. If it wrinkles, all you have to do is iron it out. [7] X Research source"

Most borders will be either solid-colored or patterned (and usually based off of a holiday, such as hearts for Valentine's day and shamrocks for St. Patrick's day). However, you can use almost anything you want for the border. Here are some ideas: Consider layering the border. Lay two to three pieces on top of each other. [8] X Research source Each bottom piece should be sticking out from beneath the upper one by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Use paper cutouts, such as hearts, snowflakes, leaves, or clover, to make your border. They should be smaller than your hand. Try to use different shades to add variety. For example, if you are using hearts, use red and pink paper. Use other items for borders, such as pompoms, playing cards, fake flowers, or even crumpled tissue paper."

You can make your board look more interesting by using different colors, sizes, and fonts for the letters. Here are some ideas to get you started: Use a different font for each word. Make one word bold and the other cursive or italic. Use a different color or pattern for each word. Make the words you want to emphasize larger. Make your own unique letters by tracing letters onto patterned scrapbook paper, and then cutting the letters out. Get a pennant banner (it looks like paper squares or rectangles attached to a long string) and write each letter on each pennant."

Here are some ideas to get you started: If the class is learning about ancient Egypt, write the message on the board using hieroglyphics. You can use colored butcher paper to create a desert scene, including sand, palm trees, and pyramids. For an English classroom, you could make the bulletin board book or grammar related. If your students are studying a particular book, then base the bulletin board off of that book. Include the name of the book, as well as a phrase. You can even include a symbol or some characters from the book as well."

Consider decorating the board with a Valentine's day craft project that the kids did. Leave the decorations up for all of February. For Halloween, use orange for the background, and black for the boards and letters. Decorate the board with black cats and bats. You can even add a cobweb and a spider to the corner.

This does not mean that they have to miss out on all that the seasons have to offer. You can decorate your board according to the season. Here are some ideas to get you started: Use lots of earth tones for fall. For example, use tan for the background and red or orange for the borders and letters. Staple paper pumpkins and red, orange, and yellow fall leaves to the board. Use lots of blue and white for winter. For example, use light blue for the background and white for the borders and letters. Create a snow scene using white butcher paper and lots of paper snowflakes. You can also use green butcher paper to create pine trees. Use bright colors for spring. For example, use light blue for the background and a cheerful yellow for the border and letters. Decorate the board using bright green paper for the grass, and pink, purple, and white paper for the flowers. Use tropical colors for summer. Use a light blue for the background and yellow for the border and letters. You can decorate the board with colorful hibiscus flowers, seashells, palm trees, and a sun."

It will also save you the trouble of having to buy supplies to decorate it with. Try not to staple the student's artwork to the board, as this can create holes and ruin it. Instead, try to use some poster putty instead. It comes off of paper easily. Most people use it to stick posters to walls. If you must staple the artwork, try staple only the top of the artwork. Do not get too close to the edge, however; the art piece by rip off, creating a tear in the student's artwork. This could end in lots of tears."
