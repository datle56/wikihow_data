You can wash and condition it as usual. Afterwards, towel-dry your hair until it’s no longer dripping. Don’t dry it all the way--just get it damp! Damp hair is much easier to work with than either wet or dry hair. [1] X Research source Keep a spray bottle filled with warm water nearby so that you can keep your hair damp as you are cutting."
