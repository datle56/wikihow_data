      "content": "Divide the players into 2 teams. The team that has the frisbee splits so players are on opposite sides of the field and pass the frisbee back and forth to each other. The other team stays in the middle and tries to intercept the frisbee. Players: At least 3, but it's better with at least 4 so that you don't have 2 people ganging up on 1 person. Teams don't have to be even. Equipment: Frisbee Space: A backyard or a traffic-free road or cul de sac—anywhere you have enough room to throw a frisbee over and around people Scoring: Make it up! You might decide an intercept is worth 1 point, or that a completed pass is worth 2 points and an intercept is -1 point. You might also have teams switch after every interception.

      "content": "Divide the players into 2 teams. One team has the frisbee and throws it in an attempt to hit a player on the other team. Players who don't have the frisbee try to dodge it or catch it. If a player catches the frisbee, they become a thrower. If a player gets hit, they're out. Keep playing until everyone is out or the last player standing catches the frisbee to win the game. Players: At least 3—keep in mind the more players you have, the longer your game could potentially go on. Equipment: A soft frisbee so players don't get hurt if they get hit with it Space: A park or large backyard with grass in case people dive to dodge a frisbee Scoring: The last player standing is the winner. Like dodgeball , if a frisbee hits a player, they're automatically out. If a player in the middle catches the frisbee, the player who threw it is out. Skill level: Beginner"

Players pass the frisbee until the music stops and the person holding the frisbee (or the person who just dropped it) is out. Then the next round begins. Keep playing until all but 1 player has been eliminated. Players: At least 4 (the game lasts longer the more players you have) Equipment: Frisbee Space: Depends on the number of people you have playing, as well as their size and skill level, but at least a large backyard or a cul-de-sac Scoring: The last player standing is the winner, and the game is elimination-based Skill level: Beginner"

Players scatter all over your playing space, with \"not-it\" players on the outside and \"it\" players on the inside. When play starts, \"not-it\" players pass the frisbee back and forth to each other—over, under, around, and through the \"it\" players, similar to keep away. The \"it\" players try to steal the frisbee by catching it or knocking it out of the ground and picking it up. Players: At least 4, the more the merrier Equipment: Frisbee Space: A large backyard or park, or a spacious indoor area, such as a gym Scoring: This game can be scored like dodgeball or on a points system, with 2 points for catching the frisbee and 1 point for picking it up off the ground. If you're using a point system, don't also eliminate players! Play to 11, 15, or 21 depending on the number of players and how long you want to play. Skill level: Beginner"

Players: At least 4 (the more players you have, the longer the game could go on) Equipment: Frisbee, chairs (if you don't have enough chairs to eliminate 1 player at a time, you can eliminate 2 or more players in the early rounds) Space: A big open space, indoor or outdoor (the more people playing, the more space you'll need) Skill level: Beginner"

The other players then have to complete the challenge. But watch out—if the challenger can't complete their own challenge, they lose their position as challenger. Players can also get fancy with body positions and movements because the other players have to imitate the challenger exactly. [1] X Research source Players: At least 2 Equipment: Frisbee, obstacles (you can create out of whatever's around) Space: No specific space requirements. In fact, this is a great game when you have outdoor space that's not level, since most frisbee games require a level surface. Scoring: Each player to successfully complete a challenge gets a letter; first player to spell out \"horse\" wins Skill level: All skill levels (better if players are relatively evenly matched)"

The thrower throws the frisbee toward the group of people standing on the other side of the space and announces how many points it's worth and whether it must be caught alive (in the air), dead (on the ground), or either. The players scramble to be the one to catch the frisbee and get the points. Special throws, such as the jackpot throw (when the catcher automatically becomes the next thrower) or the bomb (the catcher loses all of their points) make this game exciting and unpredictable. Players: At least 4 Equipment: Frisbee Space: Depends on the number of people playing as well as their size and skill level, but generally you'll want at least a good-sized yard or paved area Scoring: Play to 500 (another name for the game) with each player keeping track of their own points. Point values are chosen at whim by the thrower, as well as any special throws. Choose special throws to use at the beginning of each game. Skill level: All skill levels"

Each player gets 2 turns to knock the pins over, just like if you were bowling with a regular bowling ball in a lane. Since the frisbee is flying through the air rather than rolling on the ground, you don't have to worry about uneven ground and you can play on any surface as long as the pins can stand. Players: 2+ Equipment: Frisbee, a lawn bowling pin set or something you can use for pins (such as empty soda bottles) Space: Varies depending on the age and skill of the players and how far away you want them to be from the pins when they throw (as well as how much control they have over their throw—especially if you're playing indoors) Scoring: Use the same scoring system as bowling, or keep it simple and score 1 point per pin.

Stick poles in the yard a distance apart and balance bottles on top of them. The distance depends on the age and skill level of the players. Split into 2 teams with each team standing next to their pole. From your pole, throw the frisbee and try to knock the bottle off the other team's pole. Their goal is to catch the frisbee before it hits the ground. Once you've thrown once, play switches to the other team. Players: 2 or 4 (1-on-1 or 2 groups of 2) Equipment: Frisbee, bottles, poles—or a Bottle Bash game set Space: Depends on how far you need or want to set the poles apart. You might also factor in possible collateral damage if a frisbee ricochets off of any nearby fences or structures. Scoring: You can only score while you're throwing. You get 1 point if the other team drops the frisbee, 2 points if the bottle falls and hits the ground, 3 points if both the bottle falls 'and' the other team doesn't catch the frisbee. Play to 11, 15, or 21 (depending on the players' skill level and how long you want the game to last) Skill level: All levels—throwing distances can be adjusted to accommodate varying skill levels"

When defending, you can only use one hand (the other one is supposed to have a drink in it, but you can just hold your arm behind your back as well). [2] X Research source Players: 2 or 4 (1-on-1, or 2 teams of 2) Equipment: Frisbee, 2 large barrels or containers—or a Kam Jam game set Space: At least enough space to set the 2 cans at the desired length apart Scoring: Teams only score when they're throwing. If an opposing player deflects the frisbee into the barrel, you get 1 point. If you throw the frisbee and hit the barrel, you get 2 points. If you land it in the top, that's good for 3 points. If you're sharp enough to slip that frisbee through the slot in the side of the barrel, you automatically win! Otherwise, play until one team reaches 21 points. Skill level: Intermediate"

[3] X Research source Players: 10 or more Equipment: Frisbee, something to mark bases and home plate Space: If not an actual baseball field, enough space for 3 bases and home plate Scoring: A player who gets around all 3 bases and back to home plate scores a run for their team.

Players: 2+ Equipment: Frisbee, basketball hoop Space: Enough to run around in front of the basketball hoop Scoring: Alternate scoring gives you 1 point for hitting the rim or the backboard, and 2 points for getting the frisbee in the hoop.
