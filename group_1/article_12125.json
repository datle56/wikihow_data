      "title": "Spinal decompression can relieve pressure on your spinal nerves.",
      "content": "Spinal decompression can relieve pressure on your spinal nerves. Your spine is a pathway for a number of vital nerves that run from your head all along your body. Over time (or after an injury), the ligaments in your spine may degenerate, compressing those nerves. Regular spinal decompression exercises may help to decompress your spine, relieving pressure on those nerves, and relieving back pain in the process.

      "content": "Decompressing your spine may alleviate disk problems. Along with regular wear and tear, the disks that make up your spine may shift, or the cushions between them may bulge, causing pinched nerves or even nerve damage. Performing exercises to decompress your spine can help to realign those disks, alleviating numbness, tingling, or pain that accompanies altered spinal disks. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source That said, shifting or degenerating disks and cushions may pose serious problems, and it’s best to speak with a doctor or physical therapist if you believe you have one of these more serious issues."

      "content": "Spinal decompression can improve your posture. Poor posture can lead to pain, dysfunction, or general discomfort in your spine, which can make daily life unpleasant. Many exercises targeted toward spinal decompression have the added benefit of encouraging proper posture. Good posture helps to keep your bones and joints properly aligned, which in turn reduces stress on the ligaments that hold them together, which reduces overall pain and discomfort. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make your spinal decompression more effective by improving your posture , as well. Throughout the day, set reminders on your phone to sit straight in your chair with your shoulders back. Also, make a point to stand up and walk around for about 5 minutes every 30 minutes to an hour to stretch your back out naturally."
