You cannot have a copyright to a tune in your head, or that you perform in public, unless you write it down or record it in some fashion. You do not have to take any action to have this copyright.

The word “copyright” is actually a single term that applies to several different rights that attach to a piece of music. If you are the original writer, singer, recording artist, and record producer, you may own all the copyrights to the song. But if you wrote a song and Taylor Swift recorded her own performance of it, you would have the copyright to the written song, and she would have the copyright to her recorded version of it. [3] X Research source There are many other technicalities involved in who owns the copyright of “works made for hire” and things created as joint works. Your exclusive rights are also subject to various statutory limitations, such as “fair use” and certain “educational uses” that are not infringements of your rights."

You can keep part of the copyright to yourself and license away another part, for example. Some of the different rights, broken into their separate parts, and some of the related licenses are: [4] X Research source Public performing right. If you are the owner of a song, you have the right to control its performance or transmission in public. Public performing license. A license is a permission that can be granted to someone for a specific purpose. A public performing license is a permission that can be granted to someone else to perform your song. If you register your music through a publishing company like BMI, the company will manage public performing licenses for you. Reproduction right. As the owner of the copyright of a song, you control who may reproduce your song in a record, cassette, CD, online, or any other format. Mechanical license. A mechanical license is a permission to someone to reproduce and distribute a specific composition at an agreed price. Signing a recording contract will involve a mechanical license. Synchronization license. A synchronization license is permission granted for the use of a song or recording to accompany a visual performance, such as background music for a movie, television show, or video. Derivative works. You have the exclusive right to have your work modified in any way to create a new work or to put it into a different form, including translations of lyrics or change of tempo. You may license such rights to others, whether for a fee or as a courtesy."

If you have written a song (lyrics, music, or both), you may register that song, completely for free, with any of several commercial licensing agencies. Registering with these agencies is designed to help you sell licensed use of your song, but it does not provide legal protection for your copyright. Some of the most popular licensing agencies are ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers), BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.), or HFA (The Harry Fox Agency, Inc.). [5] X Research source [6] X Research source They deal with licensing different aspects of your rights. The US Copyright Office also handles issuance of a “compulsory license” for non-dramatic music after you have published your own recordings. People can apply for that when they want to publish copies of their own recordings of their “cover” performance of your work, under 17 USC § 115. You, as the copyright owner, may then receive royalties from the US Copyright Office, or may choose to negotiate a different license with the producers of those recordings. Even if you never register your work with an agency or in the US Copyright Office, you still have the right to negotiate private licenses that allow others to use your works based upon mutually agreed terms."

This gimmick involves mailing yourself a copy of your song, keeping the sealed envelope, and then supposedly using the postmark as proof of copyright of the contents. You are free to do this if you wish, but realize that this is no legal protection of your copyright. [7] X Research source https//www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html [8] X Research source Some of this confusion may arise from the use of this and similar methods in other countries where registration is not required, or (in most countries) not even possible.

However, to reserve the right to protect that copyright in court means you may need to incur a small fee. You can register your song(s) with the U.S. Copyright Office for $35. This registration is stronger protection of your copyright because any other writer or performer who comes along later cannot claim a song that is already registered. Also, anyone who wants a license can find your song title and your ownership listed in the US Copyright Office database once it's registered. Formal registration will be well worth the money if there is ever a dispute later on. Knowing that registration is a condition for enforcement of US copyrights, you might want to check the online copyright database from time to time in case someone else has decided to register your works as their own, perhaps by mistake. You can search the database by title and author, among other things, free of charge, or hire someone to do it for you. When it comes to unauthorized distribution of your works by online downloads or streams, even your non-registered copyright may be enforced Under the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), you may (as the copyright owner) file a formal complaint with any web hosting service that allows your works to be distributed without your permission. Under DMCA laws (in the USA and similar in other places), they are then required to “promptly remove” the violating publication of your works. Of course, if they refuse and you want to pursue it, you may need to register your copyright and sue them and their member who uploaded it to their servers. The process to enforce your copyright in a US court can be very expensive and is generally reserved for serious violations that cannot be resolved in any other way. You will nearly always need to have consulted with an attorney before you consider that sort of enforcement. However, in some circumstances, you can also claim restitution of your attorneys’ fees, in addition to damages and injunction, when you win your case. [9] X Research source 17 USC § 505"

Do not forget that enforceability of your exclusive rights may also be limited by statute, so do not be quick to attempt legal actions without first understanding the relevant laws."
