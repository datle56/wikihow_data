      "content": "Wash your feet once a day. The bacteria on your feet build up over time. Try to hop in the shower or the tub and give your feet a wash with antibacterial soap every day. Use a washcloth or a loofah to scrub all over, and don’t forget to get in between your toes! Rinse your feet well with warm water, then dry them off completely with a clean towel. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Make sure you wash your washcloth or loofah often to avoid a bacteria buildup. Drying your feet off well is super important. Moisture breeds bacteria which can lead to more of an odor.

      "title": "Change your socks daily.",
      "content": "Change your socks daily. Socks absorb a lot of sweat (and therefore smell). Try not to rewear your socks, especially for multiple days in a row. If your feet get super sweaty throughout the day, you could even carry an extra pair of socks and change them halfway through. Always wear socks with close-toed shoes."

      "title": "File off dry skin.",
      "content": "File off dry skin. Dead, dry skin collects moisture that can harvest bacteria. If you notice any hard areas of dead skin on your feet, use a foot file to gently file them down until they’re gone. Go gently at first and use caution on the other parts of your feet, as foot files can cause irritation. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can buy a foot file from your local drugstore or home goods store. If you have trouble filing down your feet, try doing it right after you get out of the shower. The skin will be a little softer, so it should be easier to remove."

      "title": "Try a vinegar soak.",
      "content": "Try a vinegar soak. Vinegar kills the fungus that could cause foot odor. In a large tub or bucket, combine 2 parts water with 1 part white vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Stir it together and soak your feet in the mixture for 20 minutes, then rise your feet off. You can do this once a week to get rid of foot odor over time. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have any sores or open wounds on your feet, don’t do a vinegar soak. Vinegar is very irritating, and it could cause you pain."

      "title": "Wear sandals or open-toed shoes often.",
      "content": "Wear sandals or open-toed shoes often. They’ll let air flow around your feet and keep them cool. If you do end up sweating in an open-toed shoe, the sweat will evaporate quickly and your feet won’t get quite as smelly. In the colder months, try wearing leather or canvas shoes to let your feet “breathe.” Steer clear of rubber and plastic shoes, as they can make your feet sweat more."

    {
      "title": "Wear moisture-wicking socks.",
      "content": "Wear moisture-wicking socks. These socks will help wick away sweat and odor. Go for cotton or wool socks to make sure they let your feet breathe, even when you’re sweating. Try to stay away from synthetic socks or tights, as they can make your feet sweat more. [4] X Research source Try looking for special socks made for athletes that are designed to wick away large amounts of sweat."

      "title": "Alternate your shoes.",
      "content": "Alternate your shoes. Let your shoes air out for 24 hours before wearing them again. If you can, try to alternate the days that you wear certain shoes. Your shoes will be less stinky, and you’ll get some variety in your wardrobe, too. [5] X Research source It might be helpful to have a couple of pairs of the same style shoes. For instance, you could buy 2 pairs of running shoes just in case you go to the gym 2 days in a row."

      "title": "Add baking soda to your shoes.",
      "content": "Add baking soda to your shoes. A little bit of baking soda can absorb odor and sweat. When you take your shoes off for the day, sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda on the inside of them and leave it there overnight. Before you put your shoes on again, simply dump the baking soda out into the garbage for fresher smelling shoes. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If your feet start to feel dry or irritated, go a few days without using baking soda. You may need to take periodic breaks from it."

      "content": "Disinfect your shoes. Kill the bacteria that’s been building up in your footwear. Take the insole out of your shoes and grab a general-purpose disinfectant spray that contains ethanol. Then, spray the insoles liberally and let them air out for 24 hours. When you put them back in your shoes, they’ll smell a whole lot better. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure the insole is completely dry before you put it back in your shoe."
