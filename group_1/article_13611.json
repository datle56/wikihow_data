      "content": "Focus on basic moves. These moves are more beneficial for beginners. As Bruce Lee said, \"I do not fear the man who has practiced 1000 moves once, but I fear the man who has practiced one move 1000 times.\" So practice!"

      "title": "Do research.",
      "content": "Do research. Watch Bruce Lee's \"Fist of Fury,\" paying close attention to the scene in the karate dojo. Go on YouTube and search for \"nunchaku\" and/or \"nunchuck tricks\". Even if the techniques are too advanced for you, seeing them in action will help you get a feel for how nunchucks are used."

      "title": "Try the complex stuff.",
      "content": "Try the complex stuff. Try to replicate a few of the moves you've seen on the Internet. Naturally, take it slow for your first time around. Work your way up the ladder, as many of these complex tricks are simply basic techniques used in an unusual way. More often than not, advanced moves are just basic steps executed with brilliant speed and impeccable timing. It can be difficult to remember to start off, but persevere and you will learn quickly."
