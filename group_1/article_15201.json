To avoid this, slip on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves or disposable latex gloves to keep the dye from soaking into your skin.

      "content": "Select your desired color of Kool-Aid. Choose your favorite color, or mix 2 together to create a custom color. You can use Kool-aid liquid pouches or Powder packs. Grape can create a lovely violet purple . Tropical punch creates a brighter red while cherry produces a deeper red . In the cooler spectrum, blue raspberry results in blue and lime creates a bright green . Mixed berry can result in a light blue. [2] X Research source Note that the colors can appear differently on different hair types and base colors. For instance, grape Kool-Aid will leave a light pinkish violet on light blonde hair when left on for just 30 minutes. [3] X Research source However, grape Kool-Aid will show up as a deep reddish purple on dark brown hair after 1 hour. If you have brown hair, vibrant reds usually show up the best. You can also try deep purple and dark blue! You won’t be able to get a lighter color than your natural shade without first bleaching your hair, though. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Empty 1 or more sugar-free Kool-Aid packet(s) into a small bowl. If you have very long hair, or if you want a heavily saturated hue, use 2 or more packets. The unsweetened version will be much less sticky than the artificially sweetened kind, enabling you to apply the dye more evenly and smoothly. [5] X Research source If you’re not sure how your hair will take to the dye, start with just 1 packet. You can always follow up with another dye session using a few more packets to build up the color. If you’re mixing colors , stir together 2 packets. For instance, try black cherry mixed with strawberry for a vibrant red, or strawberry and grape for red-violet. You could also try blue raspberry and lemon-lime to create turquoise.

Mix together the water and powder, stirring constantly with a spoon until the powder dissolves. [7] X Research source A good rule of thumb is to use 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water per packet of Kool-Aid.

Start with 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of conditioner and adjust the measurements until a creamy paste forms. [8] X Research source The creamy consistency of your dye paste will make the dye easier to handle and apply to your hair. Plus the conditioner will help the dye spread through your hair.

For even coverage, divide your hair into multiple smaller sections which you’ll apply the dye. [11] X Research source Try dividing your hair vertically into left and right segments, and then dividing each of these into 3 horizontal sections (top, middle, and bottom). Alternatively, divide your hair into left, right, and center sections and work your way from side to side. Or, start by exposing the hair at the nape of your neck and piling the rest of your hair up at your crown. Pull out small sections as you work your way from your nape up to your crown."

Start with 1 section and massage or paint the dye into your roots. Then spread the dye down the strands, all the way to the tips, until the first section is completely coated. [12] X Research source Tie back each dyed section and proceed until all sections are evenly coated. All of your hair must be saturated with dye otherwise the powder will just wash out, without coloring your hair. If you’re dyeing your own hair, you might want to enlist the help of a friend.

The plastic will help trap in the moisture and prevent the dye from spreading and staining. [13] X Research source Secure the plastic wrap with tape for extra hold. This step is especially useful if you plan to leave the dye on your hair for a few hours."

It may take between 10 and 20 minutes to get the water to run clear. Warm or hot water may more quickly wash out some of the pigment from your newly-dyed strands. Don’t use shampoo when you rinse out the dye. This could wash out and fade some of the color. [15] X Research source"

To make your temporary color last as long as possible, wash your hair in cold water instead of hot water. [16] X Research source It’s ok to use warm water and heat styling tools, but keep in mind that the heat will cause the dye to fade faster. You may need to experiment with the dye process a few times to get the balance right for your hair color. Just remember that if you have darker hair , the effects will be more subtle."

[22] X Research source Keep this in place for up to 2 hours, or until your strands start to get dry. If you want to leave the dye on for up to 5 hours, the method of painting on a dye paste containing conditioner would be a better choice.
