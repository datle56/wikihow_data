A list of past residences can help you determine which states you need to contact. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source It may be difficult to remember the exact street address where you lived in a state long ago. Typically, however, you won't need the exact street address – you just need to know the city and state. Even if you've lived in several parts of the same state, make a list of the counties where you lived. Typically you'll only need one state criminal record, but you may need to identify specific jurisdictions."

To find the correct agency, you can do an internet search for \"criminal record request\" with the name of your state.

Often you can download this form online, but you may have to go to a law enforcement office to pick one up. [5] X Research source You also can get your state's law enforcement or criminal records agency to mail you a paper copy. However, keep in mind this will mean you'll have to wait a few days, if not longer, to start the process of getting a copy of your criminal record. The form typically requires basic identification information, including your full legal name and birth date. You also must provide a complete mailing address. Make sure this information is correct, since this is the address the state will use to send you a copy of your criminal record. You may have to explain the reason you need a copy of your criminal record. Keep in mind that regardless of your answer, you always have the right to see your criminal record."

Your fingerprints help to verify your identity to the state law enforcement agency that processes your request. [6] X Research source Typically you can get fingerprinted at your local police precinct. The form you fill out to request a copy of your criminal record will provide details on where and how to get your fingerprints. Some states contract with private companies to get fingerprints made for these purposes, meaning you can't just go down to the local police station to get them done. Keep in mind that you'll have to pay a fee to get your fingerprints taken, typically between $30 and $50."

The fee to get a copy of your criminal record typically is between $10 and $20, depending on the state.

[8] X Research source [9] X Research source This is the form you'll fill out if you are submitting your request directly to the FBI. However, in some circumstances you'll need to go through a state agency to get your federal criminal record, rather than contacting the FBI directly. If you're just seeking a copy to conduct a personal review and find out if you have a felony, you can submit the applicant information form directly to the FBI. The FBI does not respond to requests that are related to the purposes of licensing and employment. For those reasons, you'll need to go through a state agency. You can request the applicant information form from the FBI website, or by contacting an FBI field office near you."

This is the address to which your identity history summary will be mailed. If you have a phone number and email address, you also should include these on your form. This may decrease delay if the FBI agent who reviews your request has to contact you or ask additional questions about your request. You have the option of either typing the form or filling it out by hand. If you're hand-writing your answers, use blue or black ink."

If you got your fingerprints taken because you requested your state criminal record, you'll have to get them done again. Contact a law enforcement agency near you to find out where you can get your fingerprints taken. Keep in mind you'll probably have to pay a fee of between $20 and $50 for this service. Make sure the fingerprints you get are both \"rolled impressions\" and \"flat impressions.\" This means you technically need two sets. Rolled impressions involve rolling each finger individually. Flat impressions capture all ten fingers at once. The fingerprint technician who takes your fingerprints will understand what you need, but make sure you get both."

If you see something on your criminal record that you believe is an error, the state will require proof that the information in your criminal record is incorrect. Your personal testimony typically is not enough. The type of evidence you'll need depends on the error on your report. For example, if your identity has been mixed up with someone else, and entries from their criminal history are showing up on your criminal record, personal identity documentation may be all you need. However, if you were convicted of a misdemeanor that has been reported on your criminal record as a felony, you typically need a certified copy of the original court order. To get a certified copy, you must make a trip to the clerk's office of the court that entered the order convicting you. In some circumstances, the problem with your criminal record may be a mere clerical error. You still must provide some kind of documentation or evidence of what the record actually should be."

They usually give free initial consultations, so you won't really lose anything to schedule a consultation and ask your questions. Particularly if you've found an error on your federal criminal record, an attorney may be necessary to help you navigate the procedures. Since the FBI gets its information from state authorities, the error may exist in more than one place. If all you need is help getting the error on your criminal record corrected, an attorney typically will help you with that for a relatively low flat fee."

Any court documents you submit typically must be certified copies, which will cost you probably $10 or $20 to get. Most states charge a processing fee for error correction requests – usually less than $20. If you aren't able to pay the fee, you may be able to have it waived in some states. Ask at the office where you got your error correction form. Make a copy of everything you send for your own records before you send them, and make note of the date you mailed the documents.

However, you may want to order another copy of your criminal record to confirm that the changes have been made and no other errors have been introduced. Talk to someone in the office that handled your request to find out if there's any way you can get another copy of your criminal record free of charge so you can verify that the change was made. Once an error is changed in one place, you may have to take additional steps to get it changed elsewhere. Unfortunately, until you check those other criminal records there's no way to know for sure. However, an agent in the office that handled your request may be able to tell you whether the change will be reflected on other criminal records."
