      "content": "Select the correct end of the cigar to cut. This is the end of the cigar that goes in your mouth and is called the head of a cigar. The opposite end of the cigar is known as the foot. The head is distinguishable by the fact that it has a cap on it, a round piece of tobacco that is stuck onto the head in order to keep the wrapper of the cigar together. [1] X Research source The head is also usually easily distinguishable because it's the end closest to the logo sticker wrapped around the cigar."

      "content": "Place the cigar into the cutter and close one eye in order to line up the cigar correctly. Line it up so that you're cutting right above the shoulder of the cigar. Remember that it's better to cut too little than too much. You can always go back and cut more cigar off, but it's impossible to go back and put already-cut cigar back on. Better to be safe than sorry."

      "content": "Cut the cigar quickly in one fluid motion, with as much force as you can. Keep a tight grip on the cigar with your other hand and try not to let it move until it is cut all the way through. [4] X Research source Quickness is key here. You want the guillotine to slice through the cigar quickly, not tear through it slowly. Make sure to grab a sharp cutter. Like a kitchen knife, the sharper your guillotine the better. Unless disaster strikes (it won't), you'll never regret having a sharper implement."

      "title": "Get a cigar punch.",
      "content": "Get a cigar punch. A cigar punch just punches a hole through the head of the cigar. [5] X Research source There are, however, three different kinds of cigar punches available: Bullet punch: Fits on a keychain, it twists to expose a circular blade that cuts into the head of the cigar. Havana punch: Safer than a bullet punch, it has a recessed tip that can be fitted into the cigar head, and which draws out the tobacco plug after a cut is made. Multi-punch: Offers more sizes for punching different sizes of cigars."

      "content": "Use a v-cutter for more draw on a cigar. A v-cutter will give the cigar smoker a bigger draw by cutting deeper into the head of the cigar. One drawback of the v-cutter is that it sometimes produces too big of a draw, making the cigar smoke too hot. [2] X Research source A very good v-cutter will sit on a table, but is too big to carry with you. A small one is the same size as any other small cutter and can cost as little as $4.00. A v-cutter will not remove too much from the head of the cigar, which can result in the unwrapping of the cigar."
