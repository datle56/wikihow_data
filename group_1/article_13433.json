The \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button, which is just below the search field, takes you directly to the Gravity version of the Google search page. At first, the search page will look normal! But once you move your mouse, the buttons, menus, images, and other elements on the page will fall to the bottom, mimicking gravity. If you donâ€™t see the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button, you can just press Enter and then click the top search result (the Mr. Doob site)."
