      "content": "Think of your school colors. Spirit Day is the day to go all out, decked out in your school colors. Put together outfits in your head that exemplify those colors, by making everything you wear fall inline with the colors, from your regular clothes down to your socks and shoes. [1] X Research source If you want to show intense school spirit, treat your selections like a diehard sports fan would at a football game. Paint your face or your hair. Don't just match your main clothes to the proper colors; wear socks and shoes that match your school colors, too. If you want to go for a more minimal approach, consider just adding touches of your school colors to your outfit, like a t-shirt or a pair of pants that match your school's colors."

      "content": "Incorporate your school colors into your hair. Your hair is a great place to show off your school spirit, as it really takes your outfit over the top. For instance, if your school allows it, wear a hat that matches your school colors to show off your spirit. Another option is to add temporary hair dye. You can put in a streak for each of your school's colors. Make sure you school allows you to dye your hair in non-natural colors first. You can buy spray-in hair dye at your local drug store. A cheap alternative method to temporary spray dyes is using Kool-Aid to color your hair, using a packet that matches one of your school colors. Make sure you use unsweetened powders to avoid sticky hair. Mix it into a paste, and apply it to a section of your hair. Wait for a 5 to 10 minutes, then wash out the Kool-Aid. You can also add colorful ribbons to your hair. Wear your hair down. Tie the ribbon onto a bobby pin, and place the bobby pin in your hair. You can also use ribbons to tie pigtails in your hair. Another option is to buy barrettes or headbands in your school's colors. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Paint your face.",
      "content": "Paint your face. Use face paint to paint your face into halves with your school colors. You can also just add a line or two of face paint in your school's colors or paint hearts. Place temporary tattoo stickers or faux eye black (reflective paint) underneath your eyes to give a nod to football players. You may also want to use face paint to paint sayings like, \"Go (team name)!\" or “Go, Fight, Win!\" If paint is too messy, consider using markers designed to be used on skin. Use the markers to draw designs on your arms and legs. Test them on an inconspicuous part of your face first, such as under your chin, to make sure they don't irritate your skin."

      "title": "Personalize a shirt by decorating it.",
      "content": "Personalize a shirt by decorating it. Get a plain shirt from a craft store, and customize it with your school's colors. You can either start with a shirt in one of your school's colors and add details or start with a plain, white shirt and dye it to match your school's colors. [3] X Research source Most craft stores sell tie-dye kits, which you can use to dye your shirt. Kits include things like dye, dye bottles, rubber bands, and gloves. To tie-dye, wash your shirt first, but don't dry it. You want it to be damp. Twist your shirt up however you want it, such as wrapping it in a circle from the center until you get it in a tight bundle. Next, you hold it together with rubber bands, which will also leave white spaces between colors. If you've made a disc from your shirt, consider putting the rubber bands across the disc, like you're making pie slices. Make sure you protect the surface you're working on with plastic. Now, add the powdered dyes to the bottles with water. Once you've shaken them up, squirt the dyes on the shirt, alternating your school colors on different sections. Once you're happy with the results, wrap the shirt up in plastic and let it sit for about 8 hours. When the time is up, rinse it out in the sink until the water runs clear. Wash the shirt in the laundry by itself, and you're done. You can now add lettering with fabric paint if you want. You can also just add lettering to a solid color shirt. You can either create free hand letters with fabric paint bottles or use sponge letters to add things like \"Go team!\" or \"Let's go panthers!\""

      "content": "Complete your Spirit Day look. For your bottom half, you can wear jeans, a jean skirt, jean shorts, or soccer shorts that are the school colors. However, if you have nothing in the school colors, regular blue jeans will do just fine. If you want to add more spirit to your bottom half and you don't mind ruining your jeans, you can draw designs on them in school colors. You can also have people sign your jeans."

      "title": "Pay attention to the details on your socks and shoes, too.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the details on your socks and shoes, too. If you have a pair of sneakers in your school colors, wear them. You can wear soccer socks in school colors or you can find brightly colored patterned socks at department stores. You could also change out your laces for ones in your team's colors, or you could have your shoes be one of your school's colors and the shoelaces be the other. Some people will also use paint markers or permanent markers to dress up a plain pair of shoes. However, you don't want to do that on shoes that are very expensive. For example, you could get a cheap pair of canvas shoes, and then use painter's tape to outline places you want to paint a different color. That way, you can color in just what you want with paint. Make sure to use a durable fabric paint, though you can even use nail polish. Also, for more durability, consider spraying it with a clear shoe protector after you let the paint dry."

      "content": "Find a twin. Choose your best friend at school or a classmate to be twins with you for Twin Day. Keep in mind, that as “twins,” similarities will come from what you wear and how you’re styled, so don’t worry if you don't look alike in the face or in the way you're built. [4] X Research source Decide on a look to wear. Think of your personalities and individual interests. Pick a theme that correlates with those things to decide what kind of “twins” you and your twin want to be. You don't have to just pair off with just one person. You could also be triplets, quadruplets, or really any number of people as long as you're matching. Plus, if you see someone being left out of the fun, it's nice to ask them to join in with you."

      "content": "Go full-out costume. Choose costumes that coordinate or that match identically. For example, you could both be witches. Another option is you could be peanut butter and jelly. One of you could be a piece of bread with the peanut butter and the other could be the piece of bread with the jelly. [5] X Research source If it's near Halloween, you can simply buy your costume from a store. You could also visit a dress-up shop in the area if it's not Halloween time. Another option is to simply make matching costumes. With a good idea, you can easily buy everything you need to make a costume at craft store."

To truly be twins, you should dress as the same character. However, you could also just pick characters from the same book or movie to be \"matching.\" For instance, one option is to dress as Thing 1 and Thing 2 from Dr. Seuss's book The Cat in the Hat. Another option is to both dress up as the character \"Elsa\" from Frozen. Alternatively, one of you could be \"Elsa\" from Frozen and the other could be \"Anna.\" You could also pick another Disney movie. You could also both dress as Waldo, or you could be Mario and Luigi from the Mario games. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear matching outfits. Another option, probably the easiest option, is to just copy each other's regular clothes. [7] X Research source To keep it really simple, you could just choose similar clothes you already own, such as a purple shirt and jean shorts. Check out each other's closets to see what you have that matches. If you don't have much that matches, consider just purchasing a shirt that matches. You can also make matching shirts if you buy craft store shirts and fabric paint. Then, just match what you wear on the bottom, such as both wearing a basic pair of jeans."

      "content": "Copy each other’s hair and overall look. To take being a twin to the next level, have your hair styled the same way, or don the same hat or accessory. For a whole other level of matching, you could even match your backpack, bag, or purse, so you look exactly the same. For instance, you could both wear your hair in pigtails with matching purple ribbons. For guys, you could spike your hair the same way, such as in a small fake mohawk, and then add spray-in color. You could also wear matching headbands, so your hair is pulled back the same way."

      "content": "Brainstorm an idea. First, start thinking about movies and books you love. Don't think too hard, just start writing down ideas. Next, write out some characters from those books or movies that you might like to dress up as. Just go with things you love or that inspire you. [8] X Research source Next, start narrowing down your ideas. Obviously, some costumes are going to take more time than others. You can buy some costumes if you have the money, but if you don't, you're going to need to get creative. Think about how much time you have and what you'll need to make each costume. You may need to start as much as a month or two in advance to get a costume together. Make a list of what you'll need. For instance, if you're going to be Mary Poppins, you'll need a hat, a red scarf, a long-sleeve white blouse, a black skirt, a bag, and an umbrella."

You may have to spend some time going to a few stores to find all the parts you need. If you can't find the parts you need, you may end up making those or buying them at a more expensive store. You could also use pieces from your closet that you already have. [9] X Research source For instance, for the Mary Poppins costume, you probably already have a white blouse or button-up shirt. If you don't have one, see if you can borrow one from a family member. You'll probably be able to find a plain, black skirt at a thrift store, for example, but you may need to make the hat, as well as make additions to a plain umbrella. You may also be able to find the Mary Poppins-style bag at a thrift store."

[10] X Research source To make something like a hat, you can either start with a plain hat and dress it up, or make it completely from scratch. One option for a hat like Mary Poppins' hat is to use cardboard or foam core to make it, and then add paint and decorations."

For instance, with Mary Poppins, make sure you have the bright red scarf, the bright red lipstick, and try to create a head for your umbrella. [11] X Research source You can use printouts for things like the umbrella head to make it easier. Just be sure to back it with cardboard to make it sturdier. For Mary Poppins' scarf, you can just use red ribbon to make it easier. For example, if you went as Darla from Finding Nemo , don't forget to carry a goldfish so people know who you are. Alternatively, if you go as a character from Toy Story , use tape to write Andy's name on the bottom of your shoe. The details make all the difference. [12] X Research source"

Borrow mannerisms from the characters you’re dressed like by watching the movie they are in again or by reading through the book again. Memorize their key phrases and mannerisms, and employ them throughout the day. If you’re dressed like Batman for the day, lower your voice to a deep growl and say everything with a Christian Bale grunt. If you’re dressed like Cher, twirl your hair, acting super girly, and end sentences with “as if.\""

You can also borrow one of your parent's hats or a neighbor's hat. Look around to see what you have. It doesn't even have to be a traditional \"hat.\" For instance, you could wear a mascot head. You could also just tie a pretty scarf around your head to create a \"hat\" or gather a handful of fake flowers into a simple floral hat or headband."

These hats are very dramatic and often involve lace, ribbon, feathers, beads, and/or flowers. They're often very tall or wide, though some of them are small and dainty. You may be able to find a suitable derby-style hat at a thrift store for cheap, though you'll need to get lucky. Another option is to start with another style of hat and turn it into a derby-style hat. For instance, you can find lady's straw hats at the craft store. Cover one in fabric. Flip up one edge by sewing it into the top of the hat, then add any decorations you'd like."

One option is to find an old hat around the house or at a thrift store that you can dress up with crazy things, though ask your parents before using a hat you find at home. You could use things you find around the house or pick up a few things to make a crazy hat. For example, you could cover an old hat in comic book paper or playing cards. Another option is to spray paint a baseball cap in crazy colors, then glue pipe extending off it like an alien head."

You may need to run to the craft store, but you also may be able to make it from stuff you have lying around the house. [13] X Research source For instance, turn a tiny Christmas tree into a hat by adding your own headband. You can even add a small strand of battery-powered lights and tiny ornaments. Try to secure them to the tree by gluing them in or wiring them in more securely, so they don't fall off throughout the day. Create a hat from cardboard or foam core, and then add all sorts of crazy decorations. You could even just go around your house and see what crazy things you could glue to it, with your parents' permission, of course. For instance, you could make a \"chef\" hat by gluing various kitchen utensils to it, such as whisks and spatulas. (Skip the knives, though!)"
