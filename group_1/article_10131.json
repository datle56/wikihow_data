      "content": "Know you are not alone. You’re not the only person out there who’s attracted to a fictional character. Chances are, you aren’t even the only person attracted to that particular character. It’s a perfectly normal thing to experience. If you're wondering why you might have fallen in love or how it's possible, there are several explanations: Some people fall in love with fictional characters because they know this person will always be there for them, they don’t have to deal with the possible messiness of a real relationship, and the character might seem super realistic. [1] X Research source Fictional characters are also written specifically to appeal to consumers. The author or creator purposefully put together a person’s best qualities and put them into their hero or protagonist. So it makes sense that you’d fall in love with them. [2] X Research source Even without falling in love, many people can take emotional and verbal cues from characters they see portrayed in fiction. Romantic feelings are just one way fictional characters can affect your real life. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk about it with your friends. Chances are you aren’t the only one in your circle of friends to follow a certain type of fiction.

      "title": "Allow yourself to fantasize about your fictional love.",
      "content": "Allow yourself to fantasize about your fictional love . Fantasy—creating a fictitious world around your romance—is a normal reaction to love that has its limits. In this case, the limit is that the object of your affection does not exist. Your fantasy can take any kind of form. You may picture a physical relationship, or maybe imagine getting married and living your life together. [4] X Research source A more active imagination might even consider how the relationship would end, including divorce, arguments, or even death. All things are possible with your imagination."

      "title": "Write fan fiction",
      "content": "Write fan fiction . One way to express your love for a fictional character is to explore your feelings in writing. Let your imagination run wild. If you’re in love with this character, think about what it is they do that attracts you and depict them doing more of it. Or include yourself and create a world where the two of you can be together. [5] X Research source If you’re more of a visual person, try sketching or drawing some fan art of your fictional character instead. Visual work can be just as imaginative as writing."

      "title": "Share your work with others.",
      "content": "Share your work with others. Post your story to a website that publishes fan fiction. You can find sites that cater to general audiences, or that serve fans of a particular book or show. This also gives you an opportunity to provide feedback about other people’s stories. [6] X Research source Just remember to avoid posting personal details like your real name or address if you’re a character in your stories."

      "content": "Figure out if this love is hurting your life. Daydreaming or fantasizing is fine, but your fantasy should not take over your life. If you find yourself wanting to get out of social situations or avoiding real relationships because of this fictional character, then it’s possible that this connection is turning into something a bit more unhealthy. [7] X Research source If you have an identity crush where you primarily admire this character because they embody something you really want to be, meditate on what the character actually does that you want to recreate. This is a great way to improve yourself and break the spell at the same time!"

      "content": "Remember that the character isn’t real. As lovable and realistic as they might feel, remind yourself that you fell for a character who doesn’t exist. Make sure that is clear in your mind. If you need to, remind yourself of this fact multiple times throughout the day. [8] X Research source Look for your character’s flaws or negative aspects. If they don’t have any, that itself is a flaw. No one is perfect, and you wouldn’t be okay with a real relationship where nothing was wrong with your partner. [9] X Research source Sometimes it helps to have other people say these things to you to make them more real. Discuss your desire to cut yourself off from this fictional world with your friends and have them remind you from time to time."

      "content": "Vent your feelings. If your favorite character has been killed off or written out of the fictional world, you might feel a bit angry. Let others know about it and let those feelings out through a nice, long rant. Just be careful about spoilers when dealing with popular books, movies, or TV shows. If you’re posting on a public forum, keep your comments vague, saying “I can’t believe that happened” rather than “Why did they kill my favorite character.” [13] X Research source"
