      "content": "Purchase high-quality quail feed from a feed store or from online. Unlike other fowl, quail cannot eat low-quality feed without sacrificing health. This is especially important when it comes to quail being raised for breeding and laying eggs. If you can't find high-quality quail feed, try another type of game bird feed. You can also try turkey feed, which is usually higher in protein than chicken feed, making it more suitable for quail. Chicken feed can make a decent substitute for meat quail. If you choose to go with turkey feed, make sure that it is non-medicated. [1] X Research source Always refer to a qualified nutritionist before you make any substitutions. About 80% of a quail's diet will consist of grains. Most quail or game bird feeds will consist of: cracked corn, grains (barley, oats, rye, and wheat), millet, milo, oat grouts, popcorn, safflower seed, sunflower kernels, and sunflower seeds."

      "content": "Give the quail enough food, and make sure that the texture is right. Quail are easy to feed in that you do not have to worry about over-feeding them. They will stop eating once they feel full. However, quail are picky when it comes to the size of their food. If the grains or pellets are too small or too big, they won't eat it. It has to be just right. They are also messy eaters, so make sure that you put the food in a dish, feeder of trough deep enough that nothing spills. If the feed comes in pellet form, try breaking it up into (quail) bite-sized pieces. Make sure that the pieces are consistent, or the quail will just pick out the pieces they like best and leave the rest. This can result in an in-balanced diet. Avoid mashed feed, if you can. If you must use mash feed, make sure that it is not too powdery. The powder can easily get in between the quail's toes and cause infections. Adult quail will eat about 20 to 25 grams of food a day.

      "content": "Keep the feed troughs clean, dry, and easily accessible. Make sure that you place the troughs in a dry place, away from rain, snow, sunlight, and wind. You might want to place the food further away from the water troughs as well. If the feed gets wet, it can grow mold, which can kill quail. [3] X Research source Also, you should empty the feed troughs often. Only wash the troughs when they become dirty from waste, or if the feed itself gets wet. Make sure that the food trough is level with the quail's crop area. Try to use linear troughs, with enough space for the quail to eat comfortably without competing for food. Depending on how many quail you have, you may need to empty the troughs as little as two to three times a week, to as often as once a day. Quail can be messy eaters. Consider keeping the feed in a hopper with \"anti-spill fingers.\" [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Offer plenty of water, and make sure that the quail have easy access to it. As a general rule, the water trough should be no higher than the bird's back. [5] X Research source Many quail breeders also recommend keeping marbles in the bottom of the trough. This not only makes the water more attractive to the quail, but it also gives quail chicks an escape route in case they fall in. [6] X Research source Quail are guzzlers. Consider making your own guzzler by digging a shallow hole in the ground, lining it with plastic, and then adding a ramp into the hole. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep the water troughs clean and replace the water daily to minimize bacteria growth. Clean the trough three times a week with a commercial, nontoxic disinfectant. Don't pour the old water out inside the pen. The pen must be kept as dry as possible. [8] X Research source Pay special attention to the water during the winter time. Don't let it freeze. Add a little bit of apple cider vinegar to the water from time to time. This kills parasites and makes the feathers look nicer."

      "content": "Store the food in a clean, dry place, and use it before it expires. If you don't store the food properly, it can get moldy, which is deadly for quail. It can also become food for other critters, such as insects and rats. Use the feed before it expiresâ€”usually 3 weeks after the manufacturing date. You may need to use it even sooner if you live some place hot and humid. Throw away stale or foul-smelling feed. This indicates that the feed has either expired or gone moldy. Rats can not only eat all of the quail's feed, but also contaminate it. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Offer some fruit and vegetables.",
      "content": "Offer some fruit and vegetables. About 20% of a quail's diet will consist of vegetables, fruits, leaves and other roughage compose. Don't be afraid to offer some other type of food. Try to consider the quail's natural, habitat, however. For example, if you have quail that are naturally found in the desert, offer some cactus fruit. [10] X Research source Consider planting some berry shrubs, such as: blackberry, currant, huckleberry, manzanita, Oregon grapes, salad, serviceberry, and snowberry. [11] X Research source Offer vegetables, such as: broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cucumber, peas, lettuce, and turnip greens. Be careful with tomatoes. Quail can eat ripe tomatoes, but they cannot eat any other part of the plant, including the leaves and the stems."

However, it you can include other types of food as a treat, such as: cake, pasta, rice, and sweet corn. [12] X Research source Quail love nuts and seeds. Consider having some nut or seed bearing trees around, such as: ash, cascara, hazelnut, and oak. The quail will eat the nuts and seeds that the trees drop. Quail also love insects, especially chicks. Insects are full of protein, which chicks and egg-laying hens need."

This includes avocado, caffeine, chocolate, grape seeds, meat, parsley, rhubarb, the stems and leaves of tomato plants, salty foods and treats, uncooked potatoes, and most citrus fruits. Quail will avoid anything toxic to them unless they are starving. This indicates that you should feed your quail more. There are many plants that are poisonous to quail, but you most likely will not come across them anyway. It is still important to be aware of this, though. Avoid giving quail anything from your garden. The quail will figure out quickly where their food comes from, and may try to feed themselves. This may not be good for your garden."

      "content": "Feed chicks a starter soon after hatching until they are 6-8 weeks old. Chicks need plenty of protein, which is found in the starter feeds. The starter feeds also offer other nutrients and vitamins that enable the chicks to grow into healthy, fully-grown quail. Use long, straight troughs for brooding chicks. Transition to circular feeders after the chicks are 2 weeks old. Use a smaller bowl for water. Chicks can eat fine crumble until they are 6 to 8 weeks old. A coarser texture, or pellets, are better for older quail. When raising chicks, teach them how to drink by dipping their beaks into the bowl/dish. If they have their mother hen with them, this is not much of a worry as she will show them how to drink."

If you are planning on using the quail for their meat, you do not need to give them a developer feed. Give them a finisher feed instead.
