Then, begin to curve your line downward and round the line. Curve the line under itself to create a small inward curl. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw a small semicircle off the curl of your first line. Draw an open semi-circle (or “C” shape) with one end of it touching near the end of your curled line. Angle the semi-circle or “C” shape so that the open section faces toward the upper-right corner of your paper. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw a jagged, sloped line on the wave's left side and a curled one on the other. Now, we’ll start adding in smaller waves to frame the larger wave that you’ve just drawn. On the left, draw another upward sloping line, then sharply round it off and curve the line downward to connect with the large center wave. On the right side, draw a smaller version of your first line that connects with the large wave—draw a line that slopes slightly upward to the right, then curl the line in on itself.

      "title": "Add random, squiggly lines to either side of your wave cluster.",
      "content": "Add random, squiggly lines to either side of your wave cluster. Add a combination of straighter and more curved lines to your central waves to extend them out to the sides. Draw horizontal, squiggly lines that have less of a crest (or vertical height) than your central waves. Make sure one end of each line connects to a line in your central wave cluster. This is the part that you can really make your own, and work with your own art style and what looks best next to your original waves. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Add more squiggly lines below your waves to add depth. To create more depth and detail in your wave drawing, draw small curved and squiggly lines underneath your waves. Keep them unconnected to any of the other lines in your drawing. These lines will give your waves more volume and make them look more like they’re part of a larger ocean. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Optionally, add details, like surfers, animals, or a background landscape. If you want to draw more than a wave, then you can add more context and action to your wave scene. Consider drawing a person surfing on a surfboard on top of your wave. Or, you can draw sea creatures like a dolphin , whale, shark , or mermaid coming up out of the waves. You might also want to draw a simple background with clouds , birds , the sun, an airplane , or anything else your mind can dream up! [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Color in your waves in shades of blue, green, or grey. The most iconic (and cartoonish) color of a wave is a bright blue shade. However, depending on the weather, you could also opt for a greyish, light blue, or green-tinted wave. Choose whichever beautiful color you like best, then color in your waves with your preferred art medium—e.g., watercolor paints , colored pencils, markers, crayons, etc. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw a sideways cylindrical shape that’s bisected by the horizontal line.",
      "content": "Draw a sideways cylindrical shape that’s bisected by the horizontal line. Start by drawing one large circle over the horizontal line so that the horizontal line splits it in half. Move your pencil about 2–3 inches (51–76 mm) to the right. Then, draw a curved line that matches the height and curve angle of your circle. To create the cylinder, draw two horizontal lines to connect the top and bottom of the circle to the top and bottom of the curved line. [9] X Research source If you want to lengthen your wave, simply draw another circle to the left of your original one. Then, extend the horizontal lines so that the new circle is connected to the cylinder."

      "content": "Draw squiggly lines on the horizon line to represent the wave's whitewater. Freehand a few sections of squiggly, scraggly lines along the horizontal line. Vary up the shape and placement, and make sure the lines aren’t purely horizontal—remember that you want them to look like free-flowing water. These lines will represent the tip of your wave, or the whitewater that appears when the wave has crested and is breaking over itself. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw curved lines to connect the scraggly lines to the cylinder.",
      "content": "Draw curved lines to connect the scraggly lines to the cylinder. As you move into this next step, note that the horizontal line is being used to determine the curve of the wave—this line marks where the wave begins to “break,” “curve,” or overlap itself. The cylinder should also help you to determine where the wave is curving—visualize the cylinder as an empty toilet roll, and the lines you’re drawing as water flowing up against and wrapping around that roll. [11] X Research source With that in mind, draw curved lines that extend from the scraggly lines at the horizon, backwards in a C shape, and down to the bottom of the page—-following the curve of the cylinder. A lot of these next steps are freehand drawing. Follow the curve of your wave, adding simple lines to create the illusion that there is water cresting around the hollow cylinder."

      "content": "Sketch squiggly lines on a diagonal and horizontal line to extend the wave. Following the cylindrical shape, draw long, scratch-like lines along the horizontal plane to extend the bottom of the wave to the sides. Then, draw lines at the bottom of the wave on a diagonal to represent the ocean water drawing up into the wave. These lines should help to create the visual of the wave extending out into the greater ocean. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Add more linework to refine the look of the wave. Make scribble-like strokes that start from the inside of the wave and extend outward as they “flow” along the bottom of your drawing page. Refine the “crashing” part of your wave, or the outer edge of the wave’s curl, by making sure that it’s taken on a cloud-like shape with a squiggly outline. Maintain a contrast between the curving and crashing water by adding more zig-zagging lines to the curving water and a lighter, squiggly pattern to the crashing water. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Shade the wave so that the curving water is darker than the crashing water.",
      "content": "Shade the wave so that the curving water is darker than the crashing water. Add darker shading to all of the water that’s curving around the bottom of the cylinder—aka, the water that’s in the nearby ocean and is being pulled up, but that hasn’t crested over into a curve yet. For the curling, crashing water, this water is usually quite bubbly and appears white in real life. For that reason, this part of the wave should appear lighter, so you don’t have to shade it too much. Instead, shade the curving water and add line work that flows with the curve of the wave, slightly extending the shading around the crash of the wave in a cylindrical shape. [14] X Research source Add some loose zig-zagging lines to the edges of your foaming water to create more depth and shadow. Otherwise, leave them white. Use artistic license in this step and follow your intuition to shade the wave in the most realistic manner, keeping in mind the instructions above. Once you’re satisfied with your shading, your wave is complete!"

Then, swoop a new line in a curve that moves from right to left and follows the shape and curve of your first line. Have this new line meet the other end of the first line.

Starting at the rightmost end of your crest or “tadpole” shape, draw a series of small, irregular, U-shaped droplets. Continue working your way along the top of the wave to mimic the look of crashing whitewater in an ocean wave. As you reach the leftmost end of your wave, make your squiggly shapes smaller and less defined until they blend in with the beginning of the crest. [19] X Research source"

It’s key to choose colors that are similar to each other if you want them to blend—e.g., three similar shades of blue, three similar shades of green, three similar shades of purple, etc. [22] X Research source If you want to shade your waves with markers, it’s important to use markers that you’ll be able to blend together. Specifically, you’ll need to use alcohol-based markers (e..g, Bic , Sharpie , Copic , etc.). You will also need to work quickly while each marker color is still wet. If the marker dries down, it won’t mix and blend with the other colors."
