When Topps released GPK Series 1 in 1985, the Cabbage Patch Kids – those wholesome dolls with wide eyes and chubby bodies – were already hugely popular. The GPK characters are modeled after the standard Cabbage Patch Kid design, and indeed, the series was conceived as a parody of the beloved doll brand.
