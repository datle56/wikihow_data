      "content": "Understand what special education and an IEP really are. Before special education, most students with mental disabilities were not allowed to go to public school forcing them to home school or go to a private school or see a tutor which is very expensive. Special Education helped put a stop to schools from excluding students with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires public schools to offer support for students with special needs to help them graduate with their peers without disabilities. To put it short, special education is meant to help you do well in school. It is not meant to punish you at all. Your first step is to learn about your IEP. This stands for Individualized Education Program. Your IEP is a written plan made after you were tested for special education. It lists your educational needs and outlines a plan for meeting those needs. Throughout your time at school, there will likely be several meetings of people involved with your IEP. One or both of your parents will attend these meetings, as well as a general education teacher and a special education teacher. Many times you may see the principal, counselor, school psychologist, or other related people attend the meeting. In some cases, you (the student) will also attend the IEP meeting. This would be a good place for you to ask questions about moving out of special education."

      "content": "Learn why special education exists. If you are trying to change your school plan, you should know about the basic laws that regulate special education. When you talk to your parents or teachers about getting out of special education, they might mention laws, or terms like FAPE. By learning about these laws beforehand, you will be ready for these conversations. FAPE stands for \"Free Appropriate Public Education\". It is a right that applies to every kid in every state in the United States, as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). [1] X Research source FAPE says that you should get an education that will meet your needs. That means if you have been diagnosed with a learning disability (LD), the school needs to find a way to teach you effectively. Sometimes that means getting lessons outside of the regular classroom."

      "title": "Figure out what is required by the school district.",
      "content": "Figure out what is required by the school district. Under federal and state laws, your school is required to provide you with what is called a \"least restrictive environment\" (LRE). This means that the school must figure out which services you need and how to provide you with those services. [2] X Research source Special education is not necessarily a place , but rather a set of services. That means that you might spend parts of your day in different classrooms in the school, or just meeting with a different teacher. It's not about going to one special classroom, but about getting help to learn in a way that helps you to do well. The school needs to figure out the best way to meet your needs while you are alongside students without additional needs. If that can't be done, you may be \"pulled out\" of the classroom to meet with a special education teacher. Your IEP team is in charge of determining your LRE. They will decide where you need extra help outside of the regular classroom, or if you can just get help in your normal classes."

      "content": "Know your legal rights. Whether or not you are in charge of your education depends on your age. If you are under the age of 18, your parents will almost certainly have legal power over your education. If you are legally a minor, you will need your parents' permission to get out of special education. [3] X Research source Each state has different laws about at what age you are considered a legal adult. In most states, you are legally an adult when you turn 18. You can check the website Sex, Etc. to find out the rules about the age of majority in your state. [4] X Research source If you are 18 or older, you can legally be in charge of decisions regarding your education. You will still need to talk to your IEP team about making changes."

      "title": "Understand your parents' options.",
      "content": "Understand your parents' options. As your legal guardians, your parents have the final say in whether or not you are in special education. If you do not live with your parents, your legal guardian might be a relative or foster parent. If that's the case, the legal guardian is the person who can request to remove you from special education. The school district cannot test you or place you in special education without your parent's permission. Your parents have more legal authority over your education than your school's administration. In most school districts, your parents must set a meeting to speak with your school's administration to begin the process of removing you from special education services. Your school may advise against this, but they do not have the legal authority to override your parent's request. Each school district follows its own rules and policies. Ask your IEP team if there is a special form that your parents must fill out in order to stop giving permission."

It is normal to feel that way, especially if most of your friends are in a different classroom. However, it is a good idea to think about the positive parts of being in special education. [5] X Research source When you are thinking about trying to get out of special education, think about the ways that it is useful to be there. Try making a list. Write down the good things. For example, you might say, \"It is great to be in a smaller classroom. There is always a teacher available to answer my questions.\" You might also think about how your needs are being met. For example, you might say, \"I know I sometimes have trouble concentrating. It's nice to have a teacher who understands how to help me focus.\" Remember that being tested and placed in special education is a lengthy process. If you decide to leave the program, you might not be able to easily get back in."

However, if you don't feel like it's the right place for you, think about your motivations for getting out. If you are under 18, you will need your parents or legal guardian to help you with the process. In order to get permission, you will have to convince your parents that getting out of special education is right for you. Before you talk to your parents, think carefully about your reasons for wanting to leave special education. Try making a list of your reasons. Think about what you like and dislike about school. Use these preferences and feelings to help explain why you don't want to be in special education. Write down your feelings. For example, you could write, \"I feel like I am doing better work in the general classroom.\" Maybe you are thinking about your future. For example, you could write, \"I want to prepare myself for college. I think I can do that better outside of special education.\""

Write down your main points. You can use your list of feelings and ideas from before.

You can say, \"Dad, I feel like I will learn a lot more in the general classroom. It's something I would like you to consider letting me try.\" Avoid yelling or getting upset if you don't get the answer you want.

      "content": "Ask to enroll in a Co-Taught or Mainstream setting classroom if you want to remain in the IEP program. Just because you have IEP does not mean you cannot learn in a general education setting. The IEP program actually allows you to enroll in a general education setting through co-teaching or mainstreaming: Co-Teaching is when two teachers, one general education and one special education work as partners where the general education teacher is the main teacher while the special education teacher will serve as an assistant to the general education instructor. You will learn in a general education classroom and in the general education curriculum where the class capacity is much larger. Your classmates consist of mostly peers without learning disabilities, and a few peers also in the IEP program with you. In Co-Teaching, only your general education and special education teachers will know you have an IEP. They are strictly prohibited by both the law and the school district from telling your classmates you have an IEP as that is considered personal. Mainstreaming is when you will learn in a General education classroom and curriculum with only one teacher, who is, of course, a general education instructor. Like Co-Teaching, the classroom capacity will be bigger but the only difference is you'll be the only student with an IEP. The rest of your peers will not have learning disabilities. However, it is possible to have some classmates who also have IEPs learn in the same classroom with you, but the number of students with disabilities is very little. Your general education teacher will not disclose your IEP to any peers as it is not allowed by law or your school district. The benefit of enrolling in either program is you will still have testing accommodations in either setting. This means when you'll take a test, you will have extended time to finish, and your teacher can read you a question upon asking. You may also choose to take the test in a different classroom where there is no distraction."

Even if you have good reasons for wanting to be in general education classes, you probably won't be allowed to be in them unless your grades are stable and your teachers can say that you aren't having any problems. Show up to school on time every day and be prepared to learn. Keep your grades high . Aim to get As and Bs in your class or classes. If your grades are Cs or lower, the school may not want to put you in regular education because they're worried that you'll fail. Participate in class activities. Don't sit grumpily at your desk if you're doing a subject you don't want to do. Participate in the activity - raise your hand, ask questions, and work with your classmates when allowed. This will show your teacher that you're able to work well in the classes that you have already. Don't goof around! If you spend more time passing notes or making silly faces at your classmates than working, you're more likely to be viewed as a distraction to your classmates than as a student who should be in general education."

There are several things you can do to show that you are a successful student. Making a study plan is one way. [8] X Research source You want to let them know that you are serious about improving your education. Show your parents and teachers that you can take responsibility for your learning.

For example, if you are learning about the Civil War in school, ask your librarian to help you find a novel about that time period. It's possible that learning might be hard for you.

      "content": "Work on coping skills to avoid outbursts. Some students may have trouble managing what they're feeling and get placed in special education for that reason. This doesn't mean you should hide your feelings and pretend that nothing's wrong when you're upset, but it's important to find ways to stop an outburst before it happens. For example, if you're autistic, notice what things will overstimulate you. Do crowded rooms cause you to have a meltdown because of all the people around you? Does the sound of the school bell upset you and make you start crying? Learn what will trigger a meltdown or shutdown for you and find ways to avoid it or cope with it - for example, don't go to large school assemblies, or bring earplugs and your stim toy to school with you for when the bell rings. If you have emotional problems, try to figure out what triggers them. When someone yells, for example, do you start yelling back? Watch for warning signs that you're getting angry or upset, and use coping strategies (such as focusing on something else, deep breathing, or meditating) to calm yourself down."

      "content": "Work well with your classmates. A big part of doing well in any classroom is learning how to get along with other people. If you fight a lot with other students, or even just ignore them, you're not showing your teacher and parents that you're ready to be in a general classroom. When you're given a group project or activity, try to work with everyone else and do your part. Talk to your fellow group mates and try to get everyone working together. This can be tough for some people, though, so don't worry if you have trouble with working with people; Consider trying to help other students. Listen closely to your teachers' directions so you can follow them, and try to get your classmates to follow them, too. Be supportive and helpful to others. One of the best ways to show you know something is to teach it to someone else. However, be careful with how you do this. If someone asks a question, don't spring out of your chair and start blurting out the answer - that won't make your teacher happy with you! Socialize outside of the classroom if you can. Talk to people at lunch and outside of your lessons. This is a great way to show you're a team player, but the benefits of making friends go beyond the classroom. Making friends will help you build a support system, too. Don't react strongly to bullying . Unfortunately, there are mean people in school, both in and out of special education classes. Special education students are more likely to be picked on by bullies, [10] X Trustworthy Source StopBullying.gov Website run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services providing information related to identifying and preventing bullying Go to source but how you react to someone bullying you may be thought about by the IEP team. If somebody calls you a name or takes away your things, hitting them is a bad way of dealing with bullying. Instead, walk away, even if you're upset, and tell the teacher that someone is bothering you. Don't worry about being a \"tattletale\" - it doesn't matter who you are, bullying is never okay, and telling someone about bullying isn't \"tattling\"."
