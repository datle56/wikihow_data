      "title": "Cut open your pumpkin",
      "content": "Cut open your pumpkin to access its seeds. Place the pumpkin upright onto a flat surface. Insert the tip of a large kitchen knife into the top of the pumpkin. Push the knife in slowly while applying downward pressure and wiggling the knife side to side to widen the cut. Continue working down the side of the pumpkin. Once you cross half of the pumpkin, repeat this process from the other side. [1] X Research source After making a cut around the entire pumpkin, make one final cut through the whole pumpkin. Afterward, rip it open with your hands. Hold the pumpkin steady with your non-dominant hand. However, be very careful to never put it in front of the knife."

      "title": "Scoop the seeds out of your pumpkin with a large serving spoon.",
      "content": "Scoop the seeds out of your pumpkin with a large serving spoon. Most of the seeds will come out easily with a quick scoop. For the tougher seeds, drag the spoon along the sides of the pumpkin to detach them. If you don't mind getting messy, use your hands for the seeds that your scoop can't get to. [2] X Research source If you have one, use an ice cream scoop and drag it along the sides of the pumpkin."

      "title": "Remove the flesh from the seeds.",
      "content": "Remove the flesh from the seeds. The easiest way to remove the flesh is by tearing it off with your hands. If you're drying your seeds to roast and want some additional flavor, don't worry too much about removing all of the flesh. But if you're going to plant your seeds, be sure to remove all of it. [3] X Research source Dip the tough seeds in a bowl of water to wet the flesh and make it easier to tear off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the seeds in a colander with cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the seeds in a colander with cool water. Place a colander into a sink and dump all your seeds into it. Run cool water over the colander and move it around in a circle so that it covers all of the seeds. Afterward, place the colander down and mix the seeds around with your hands as the tap runs to expose their entire surface to water. [4] X Research source Remove any excess pumpkin flesh that you find stuck to the seeds. Don't worry if the seeds feel slimy—this doesn't mean they aren't clean!"

      "title": "Blot your seeds dry for about 5 to 10 minutes using paper towel.",
      "content": "Blot your seeds dry for about 5 to 10 minutes using paper towel. Place 2 to 3 pieces of paper towel onto a flat surface. Now, blot them dry by pressing them with a paper towel. After 5 to 10 minutes, dump the seeds into a clean bowl, taking care not to squeeze the paper towel. [5] X Research source Be sure to remove any flesh or debris from the pumpkin that was left behind."

      "title": "Spread your pumpkin seeds on a cookie or baking sheet.",
      "content": "Spread your pumpkin seeds on a cookie or baking sheet. Dump the clean seeds onto the sheet and spread them apart evenly in a single layer. Make sure no seeds are touching or resting on each other. [6] X Research source If you can't fit all of the seeds onto a single sheet, spread them across multiple."

    {
      "title": "Air-dry your seeds in a cool, dry place for at least 1 month.",
      "content": "Air-dry your seeds in a cool, dry place for at least 1 month. Find a location where there is no danger of dampness. An indoor location like a shed or hayloft or shaded outdoor region works. Avoid areas with little airflow, such as garages, and never dry them in a basement. [7] X Research source Check your drying pumpkin seeds daily and turn them so they dry evenly on both sides. Do not leave your seeds in clumps. They will not dry thoroughly and this might cause mold to develop. Air-drying is the most effective and safest method of drying, but also the most time-consuming."

      "content": "Store your dried seeds in a paper bag or envelope until roasting or planting. Pour all of your seeds in an envelope or paper bag and store them somewhere cool and dry. If you can't find a suitable location, place in them in the refrigerator. [8] X Research source Discard any seeds with mold and mildew."

      "title": "Place your seeds onto a drying rack in a single layer.",
      "content": "Place your seeds onto a drying rack in a single layer. Make sure that no seeds overlap each other. If your dehydrator rack has holes in it, cut some pieces of parchment paper small enough to fit it and line the rack to prevent your seeds from falling. [9] X Research source Limit your seeds to one dehydrator rack per batch to avoid uneven dehydration."

      "title": "Dehydrate",
      "content": "Dehydrate your seeds at 115 to 120 °F (46 to 49 °C) for 1 to 2 hours. Turn on your dehydrator at 115 to 120 °F (46 to 49 °C) and wait. Stir the seeds every 20 minutes to ensure even hydration. [10] X Research source A dehydrator poses more risk of damaging your seeds than air-drying but is safer than baking."

      "content": "Store your seeds in an envelope or paper bag in a cool, dry place. Avoid areas with moisture to avoid rehydration. If you can't find a suitable area, put them in the refrigerator. Use them when you're ready to roast them or during planting season. [11] X Research source Discard seeds with mildew or mold before storing your batches."

      "title": "Preheat your oven to the lowest possible temperature.",
      "content": "Preheat your oven to the lowest possible temperature. For most ovens, this is 200 °F (93 °C). If you're using an electric oven, you will probably need to wait 10 to 15 minutes for preheating. For gas ovens, it will take about 5 to 10 minutes. Position the oven rack into the lowest position. [12] X Research source For increased accuracy, use an oven thermometer to track temperature."

      "content": "Bake your seeds in your oven for 3 to 4 hours. Spread your pumpkin seeds over a cookie or baking sheet. Make sure that they're arranged in a single layer with no overlap. Place the oven rack at the lowest position and place your baking sheet on top. Set your oven to the lowest temperature—this is typically 200 °F (93 °C)–and wait for 3 to 4 hours. [13] X Research source Stir your seeds every 20 to 30 minutes with a spoon to avoid scorching them. If you plan to plant your seeds, be careful not to scorch or burn them, as they will not grow if damaged by the heat. Baking your seeds is the most risky method of drying your seeds as it is more likely to damage them."

      "content": "Place your dried seeds in an envelope or paper bag until planting or roasting. Take all of your dry seeds and place them in an envelope. From here, you can wait to plant them next year or roast them when you feel like it! [14] X Research source If you notice any seeds with mildew or mold, discard them before storing them. Always store dried pumpkin seeds in a cool, dry place. If you like, you can keep them in the refrigerator or freezer until planting season arrives."
