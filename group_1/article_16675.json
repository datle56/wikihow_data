Then, click the \"Move to Inbox\" icon (the square with an arrow pointing down) to move it. On a phone or tablet, open the message, tap the three dots at the top-right, then select Move to Inbox .

Because it doesn't, old archived emails are taking up space in your Gmail account. Deleting archived emails is a great way to free up that space. Here's how to remove those messages permanently: On a computer, check the box(es) next to the message(s) you want to delete, then click the trash icon. On a phone or tablet, tap and hold the message you want to delete, tap to select any additional others you want to delete, and then tap the trash icon to delete them.
