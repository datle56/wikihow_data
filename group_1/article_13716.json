It doesn’t matter which side you pin first--you will be placing four pins in the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right sections of your bun. Insert the hairpin as if you were going to stab your scalp with the ends, making sure it catches the hair at the edge of the bun. Just before the pin hits your scalp, however, turn the pin so it goes toward the center of the bun, and push it all the way in. This will keep your bun secured because it catches bun hair, then scalp hair, then bun hair. You will want to use a hairpin rather than a bobby pin for this hairstyle. Hairpins are stronger and will keep your bun in place even if you find yourself in the middle of a major dance party. You can buy these at hair supply stores or dance stores (as they are favored by ballerinas who definitely have to keep their hair in place.)"
