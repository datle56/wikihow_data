      "content": "Feel the music and dance with the beat. Start off by tapping your foot with the beat of the song, then start moving the rest of your body. Listen to the beats of the music and move your legs, feet, and arms with the music. [1] X Research source If you don’t feel the music while you dance, you’ll probably dance off tempo. There are so many different styles of dance that no one style is the best."

      "content": "Stay in your own space unless someone wants to dance with you. It can be annoying and even offensive to take up someone else’s dancing space.

      "content": "Have fun and relax. Going to a rave to dance is all about having fun and releasing stress or negative emotions.

Have as much fun as you can. [7] X Research source Realize that other people are there to have fun and probably aren’t even paying attention to you if you’re new at dancing."
