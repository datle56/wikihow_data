Visit the DMV in your state and apply for a new title for the vehicle, or visit your DMV's website to see if you can apply online. Your DMV should have an application you can complete for requesting a duplicate title. The application or form might be available online. You might not have the title because you haven’t paid off your car loan. In that situation, you need to work with your lender to pay off your loan before you will receive the title. Once paid, you can submit a lien clearance letter or other release form to the DMV to get the lien removed. [2] X Research source If the car has a lien, then the duplicate will probably be sent to the lienholder, so it is best to take care of the lien before making the sale."

      "content": "Confirm the vehicle does not have liens . A lien is a legal interest in a piece of property. Typically, you grant a lien to another party to secure a debt. However, sometimes people can get a court to grant them a lien in a car. [8] X Research source Most liens are held by the bank that gave the seller their car loan. The car is used as collateral for the loan. In that situation, the bank probably has held onto the title and the only way the seller can get the title is to pay off the lien. However, a seller could have other liens on the car. Accordingly, don’t assume that there are no liens on the car simply because the seller has title. For example, a child support lien might have been placed on the car. Alternately, a mechanic could get a lien on the car for unpaid repairs. If you buy the vehicle with the lien on it, you now become responsible for the lien. [9] X Research source If you have the VIN, you can check for liens by visiting your local DMV or checking their website to see if it has a title check feature. If your DMV's website does have a title check feature, you can enter the VIN to see the title and lien information for the car. This is a critical step, so don’t neglect it."

Ideally, you should go with the seller to the DMV office and fill out the transfer form together there. Even if not required by the state, going together can protect you because you can check for liens while you are there.
