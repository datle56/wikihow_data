      "title": "Wear a suit if you’re working in a conservative or traditional industry.",
      "content": "Wear a suit if you’re working in a conservative or traditional industry. A suit jacket or blazer and dress pants, button down shirt, tie, belt, and dress shoes are the norm. When in doubt, it is better to dress up by wearing a suit and leave it out once you are more familiar with the company culture. [1] X Research source Employees at law firms and finance companies are typically required to wear suits. Many client facing sales positions may also be expected to dress up for the role. Some management positions, regardless of industry, might also warrant a suit and tie."

    {
      "title": "Stick to dark, solid conservative colors for your suit.",
      "content": "Stick to dark, solid conservative colors for your suit. Colors like navy blue, black, and charcoal gray are elegant and versatile. A good suit will fit you just right. You want the shoulder seams of the jacket to end at the end of your shoulders, without creating any divots or wrinkles. The suit jacket should reach down to your mid to lower crotch. The jacket sleeves should cut off just before the base of your hand. [2] X Research source You may need to get your suit tailored if it is noticeably a size too big or small. Keep your suit buttoned when standing up and unbuttoned when you sit down."

    {
      "title": "Keep a clean look with a solid color tie.",
      "content": "Keep a clean look with a solid color tie. Your best bet for a job interview is a more conservative or classic color tie with a solid pattern. Classic colors include burgundy, navy blue, black or green. Remember that a tie must complement your entire outfit. While a tie can be the focal point of your suit, keep it subtle so it doesn’t pull the focus away from you. If you consider yourself experienced in tie selection and have a good taste for tie colors, you can try different colors or ties with patterns, such as diagonal stripes. If you choose to wear a patterned tie, wear a solid color shirt, and vice versa."

    {
      "title": "Trade in the suit for a more relaxed look.",
      "content": "Trade in the suit for a more relaxed look. In a business casual environment, a suit is not necessary. Dress slacks or chinos are acceptable along with a button down or polo shirt, belt, and dress shoes. Keep in mind this is not a casual look, but a more flexible and relaxed version of business formal attire. [3] X Research source Startups and creative agencies typically have a more lax environment and dress code. Tech companies and government jobs usually abide by business casual dress code."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick to dress pants or chinos.",
      "content": "Stick to dress pants or chinos. Dress pants will give you a more professional look while chinos give off a more relaxed vibe. Dark colors such as navy and gray stain less easily although lighter colors are preferable for the warmer months of the year. Pants such as denim jeans and cargo pants should never be worn. Pants should fit perfectly around the waist with no need for a belt to hold them up. They should sit around the high hipbone area, or even slightly higher."

    {
      "title": "Layer a sweater with a button down shirt.",
      "content": "Layer a sweater with a button down shirt. This outfit makes for an easy and dependable business casual look, and takes the place of a jacket. Neutral sweater colors like brown, black, and navy are a good choice because they match well most shirt colors, including white. Turn your look a little more professional by wearing darker dress pants or gray chinos. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a nice finish to your outfit with a tie.",
      "content": "Add a nice finish to your outfit with a tie. Ties are typically not part of the business casual look but can add a little more style while giving off a dressier business casual appearance. [5] X Research source If you do decide to wear a tie, have a little fun with it. Once again, it is better to overdress than be underprepared. You can always remove your tie prior to your interview if you feel that you are overdressed."

    {
      "title": "Ditch the tie for a blazer or jacket.",
      "content": "Ditch the tie for a blazer or jacket. Alternatively, you can skip wearing a tie and dress up your look by wearing a blazer or jacket. This is a nice professional look that allows for flexibility and comfort. Navy blue jackets match numerous shirt colors and work with gray slacks, chinos, and lighter color dress pants."

    {
      "title": "Dress to impress, even in a casual environment.",
      "content": "Dress to impress, even in a casual environment. Look professional by wearing a long sleeve dress shirt, khaki pants, a belt, and dress shoes. The first face-to-face interaction you have with the hiring manager is the time to present yourself as a polished professional. Always err on the side of being slightly overdressed than underdressed. Also layer your clothing so you can easily dress up or dress down your look based on the interview environment. Online companies and innovative startups may have more of a casual culture. Ask the recruiter or hiring manager in advance about acceptable dress code before wearing casual attire at an interview."

    {
      "title": "Wear a dress shirt that is comfortable but presentable.",
      "content": "Wear a dress shirt that is comfortable but presentable. Opt for a long sleeve shirt rather than a short sleeve. Your long sleeve shirt can have a checkered or striped pattern, but avoid overly flashy or loud designs. Don’t wear t-shirts or collarless shirts as they can come across as too casual."

    {
      "title": "Look sharp but easy-going with chinos, khakis, and corduroys.",
      "content": "Look sharp but easy-going with chinos, khakis, and corduroys. Be sure your pants are clean, pressed and fit correctly. [6] X Research source Wear a belt with your pants. Don’t allow your pants to sag or for hems to trail the ground. Blue jeans or denim are never an appropriate wardrobe choice for a job interview, even in a casual environment."

    {
      "title": "Research the company in advance.",
      "content": "Research the company in advance. You will get a better sense of the typical dress code by knowing more about the company culture. Reach out to your friend groups and professional networks by asking if anyone works (or knows someone that works) for the company. Browse through the company website. Many times companies also have a career page that lends itself to more information about the culture of the company. [7] X Research source Look for photos of employees on the company website and pay attention to what they are wearing. Search Facebook and all other social media channels for photos of employees and get a feel for their dress attire. If you have time or live near the company, drive around the building during the day to see what other employees are wearing."

    {
      "title": "Ask the company for more information about their dress code.",
      "content": "Ask the company for more information about their dress code. One of the best resources to get a better sense of what to wear is by speaking with someone who works for the company. Call or e-mail the hiring manager or a human resources representative and ask them to provide you with guidance on proper attire. You can send an e-mail to confirm your interview appointment while also requesting feedback. For example: \"I am looking forward to our interview on Friday at 2 pm. Can you please advise me on what the appropriate dress code is for an interview at the company?\""

      "content": "Be professional but add a unique twist to your outfit. Don’t be afraid to stand out, but make sure your outfit makes you feel comfortable. Most companies are not looking for a corporate clone and want employees to be unique. You can do this by keeping your outfit simple but adding a touch of personal style, giving you some edge and making the interview more memorable. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stick to a basic color scheme when choosing your dress shirt.",
      "content": "Stick to a basic color scheme when choosing your dress shirt. Button down shirts should be white or a slightly more vibrant color. Do not wear bright colors. Stick to solid colors or subtle patterns like gingham or pinstripes. Avoid shirts that are too bold or trendy in design. Remember that you want to err on the conservative side."

    {
      "title": "Sharpen up your shoes so they shine.",
      "content": "Sharpen up your shoes so they shine. Clean up your shoes by wiping them down and polishing them. Pick a shoe color that complements your outfit. A pair round-toed shoes known as Oxfords are a great selection. Black shoes go best with dark gray and black color schemes. Brown shoes work well with lighter gray and blue color schemes."

      "content": "Be bold but not flashy with jewelry and accessories. Accessories can add a bit of style to your outfit. However, steer away from wearing loud patterns or wacky prints as they may divert the attention of the interviewer. Keep jewelry to a minimum and avoid wearing oversized rings and watches. Limit your jewelry to a wedding band, class ring, and a nice watch. Remove all other earrings or piercings. Your belt should be simple, and either solid black or brown, and match to the color of your shoes. [9] X Research source Socks should be solid or can have small patterns but need to match to the color of your pants."

      "title": "Iron your clothing.",
      "content": "Iron your clothing. Wrinkles and creases on your clothing can stand out like an eyesore and counteract all the effort you put into your appearance.

      "content": "Avoid using too much aftershave or cologne. Wearing cologne is most likely part of your daily grooming routine. However, too much cologne can be overpowering and become a distraction during the interview. [10] X Research source You want to be remembered for your skills, not your smell."
