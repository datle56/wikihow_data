      "content": "Heat the sausages in the microwave for 1-2 minutes for a quick option. This is super fast and simple. Pop open the can and pour the sausages and broth into a microwave-safe bowl. Put them in the microwave and set the timer for 1-2 minutes.

      "content": "Warm the sausages on the stove for a few minutes, if you prefer. If you don’t like to use the microwave, no worries. This method is also really fast and easy. Place a small saucepan on the stove and turn the burner to medium-high heat. Open the can and pour in the sausages and broth. Allow them to cook until the broth is gently bubbling.

      "title": "Fry the sausages in a pan if you like them a little crispy.",
      "content": "Fry the sausages in a pan if you like them a little crispy. Vienna sausages don’t have casings that will get super crispy, but you can still fry them up to add a little texture. Place a small skillet on the stovetop and heat it over medium-high heat. Open the can and use a fork to pull the sausages out of the broth. Place the sausages in the pan and let them cook for 3-4 minutes. [3] X Research source If you like, you can add a pat of butter to the pan right before putting the sausages in. This can add flavor and even help them get a little crispy. You can flip the sausages using a spatula a couple of times during heating so that they cook evenly on all sides. Since Vienna sausages are fully cooked, you don’t have to worry about whether you've cooked them long enough. Just heat them until they are as warm as you want, which will probably just take a few minutes."

      "content": "Make Vienna sausage pigs in a blanket for an easy appetizer. These simple snacks will be a big hit with your family or guests. Pop open a can of crescent roll dough and remove the dough from the tube. Working lengthwise across the tube of dough, cut it into pieces that are about 1 inch wide. Lay each piece of dough on a flat surface, unroll it, and then lay a sausage on each piece. Wrap the dough around the Vienna sausage and place them on a baking sheet. Transfer the baking sheet to a 350 °F (177 °C) oven and bake for 15 minutes. When the dough turns a light, golden brown the pigs in a blanket are ready. [4] X Research source You can brush an egg wash on the pigs in a blanket before cooking. Just use a fork to beat an egg in a small bowl and then spoon the mixture onto the dough. This isn't necessary but it will make the pigs in a blanket look extra golden and crisp. Take them out of the oven and let them cool for a couple of minutes before serving. These are great to serve at a party for kids or adults. Try setting out some of your favorite condiments with them, like BBQ sauce, ketchup, or mustard. 1 package of crescent rolls will make 24 pigs in a blanket. You'll need about 3 cans of sausages to make that many (the number of sausages in a can sometimes vary)."
