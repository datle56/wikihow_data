But since all squares have equal length sides, you can just multiply the distance by itself. If the length of a side of a square is 3 centimeter (1.2 in), then you just have to square 3 centimeter (1.2 in) to find the area of a square. 3 centimeter (1.2 in) x 3 centimeter (1.2 in) = 9 cm 2 .

Since there are four sides to a square and each side is of equal length, you can find the length of a square just by dividing the perimeter by 4. Let's say the perimeter of the square you're working with is 20 centimeter (7.9 in). Just multiply 20 centimeter (7.9 in) by 1/4: 20 centimeter (7.9 in) x 1/4 = 5 centimeter (2.0 in).
