      "content": "Pack your bucket or cooler about half full of ice. Your bucket or cooler should be large enough to hold both bottles of water without them touching each other. It should also be tall enough for the salt and ice water mixture to cover the water in your bottles. [2] X Research source Check if your bucket is large enough by putting both water bottles in it while it’s still empty. You’ll be adding the water bottles after you create the salt and ice water mixture."

      "content": "Pour in enough water to allow the ice cubes to move. Slowly add tap water from a sink or faucet. You should add enough so that the ice cubes can move more easily, but they should not float to the surface of the water. You should have more ice than water in your bucket or cooler.

      "content": "Place the water bottles carefully in the ice water. Once your mixture is ready, add the water bottles. Make sure they don’t touch each other, which could make them freeze early. You can use all kinds of water: purified, distilled, spring, or deionized. Don’t use glass bottles, which can burst. [5] X Research source Don't use tap water. Ice crystals can form around impurities in tap water, which will ruin the supercooling process."

Make sure the water in the bottles has not frozen. If the water has frozen, let the bottle thaw before trying again from the beginning. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Tap a water bottle firmly against a hard surface. You can hit the ground, kitchen counter, or table. Ice crystals will form at the top of the bottle and creep down to the bottom. Open the cap of your second water bottle, and it will freeze the same way without being tapped. The motion of unscrewing the cap on the second bottle is enough to set off the ice crystals . If the water doesn’t freeze, tap it more firmly. If that does not work, return it to the ice water mixture and let it cool for another 30 minutes before trying again. [7] X Research source"
