      "content": "Consider the dress code. Before deciding how the season will affect your clothing choices, you should make sure that you understand the wedding’s dress code. Consult the invitation, which will usually make it clear how guests are expected to dress. That way, you won’t dress too formally or casually for the event. [1] X Research source If the invitation says “White Tie”, the wedding has an extremely formal dress code. Women should wear floor length evening gowns with long gloves, while men are expected to wear a tuxedo with long tails, a white vest, and a black bowtie. If the invitation says “Black Tie”, women can wear a floor length evening gown or a dressy cocktail dress. Men should wear a traditional tux with a cummerbund and bow tie. If the invitation says “Formal” or “Black Tie Optional,” women can wear a floor length dress, a formal cocktail style dress, or dressy separates. Men can wear a traditional tuxedo or a dark suit, white shirt, and tie. If the invitation says “Dressy Casual” or “Semiformal,” women should wear a cocktail dress or a dressy skirt and top. Men should wear a suit. If the invitation says “Festive Attire,” you can have a little more fun with your outfit. Women can wear a cocktail dress in a bold color and pair it with fun accessories, such as a cute hat. Men should wear a suit, but pair it with a fun tie in a bold color or pattern."

      "content": "Follow a deep, rich color palette. While you can certainly wear any color that you like no matter what the season, a winter wedding is the perfect opportunity to wear rich, dark colors that fit the season. Black and navy appropriate for winter weddings, but so are jewel tones, such as sapphire, ruby, garnet, emerald, citrine, or amethyst. [2] X Research source Metallic tones such as gold, silver, and bronze, also work well for winter weddings. Pro tip from wedding planner, Karen Brown: \"If you're attending a winter wedding, dress in warm colors like burgundy, brown, purple, gray, and green.\""

      "content": "Choose textured fabrics. While lightweight fabrics such as chiffon and linen are ideal for spring and summer, they’re not the best option for winter weddings. Instead, opt for weighty, textured fabrics that will not only keep you warm but add visual interest to your outfit too. [3] X Research source Fabrics such as velvet, brocade, cashmere, and wool are all good options for a winter wedding."

      "title": "Opt for a longer skirt or dress.",
      "content": "Opt for a longer skirt or dress. Even if the dress code for the wedding doesn’t call for extremely formal wear, you may want to opt for a longer dress or skirt to help stay warm. That doesn’t mean you have to choose a floor length option, though - a midi dress or skirt, which usually hits at mid-calf, can be a stylish option. [4] X Research source Tea length dresses and skirts, which are usually slightly longer than midi styles but not floor length, are also a good option for winter weddings. If you’re not sure about wearing a midi or tea length dress or skirt, consider wearing a high-low style. They’re usually longer in the back and shorter in the front, so you’ll get some added warmth while not committing to a longer length all the way around."

      "title": "Pair tights with a shorter dress.",
      "content": "Pair tights with a shorter dress. If you want to wear a shorter dress that ends at the knees or above, your legs may be a little cold at the ceremony and reception. That doesn’t mean you have to ditch the dress -- just swap your bare legs or sheer hosiery for a pair of opaque tights that will help keep you a little warmer. [5] X Research source Err on the side of caution by choosing tights in a neutral color such as black or gray. Wearing a color that coordinates with your dress can sometimes like a little too costume-y. Depending on what type of dress or skirt that you’re wearing, you may want to opt for a textured pair of tights. For example, you can complement a simple sheath dress with a pair of tights with a lacy texture. If you’re wearing a dress with a bold pattern or texture, it’s best to wear smooth tights."

      "content": "Consider wearing pants. It may not seem traditional, but pants can actually be an elegant option for a winter wedding. Just opt for a tailored pair that have an elegant look, and pair them with a statement top. [6] X Research source For a winter wedding, pants in a dark color, such as black, are an ideal option. However, you can also go for a sophisticated, stylish look by choosing a pair in winter white or cream. If you’re wearing pants to a winter wedding, wear them with a bold sequin top or elegant satin blouse to ensure that you look dressy enough. In addition to pants, you can wear an elegant tailored jumpsuit to a winter wedding."

      "content": "Add a blazer over a short sleeve dress. If you have an ideal dress to wear to a winter wedding but you’re worried that you’ll be cold in its short sleeves, layer a blazer over it. A sophisticated velvet or brocade blazer can keep you warm and add style to your look. [7] X Research source If you’re wearing a simple, solid colored dress, consider pairing it with a blazer in floral pattern that features rich jewel tones to give your outfit some more flair."

      "title": "Choose stable shoes.",
      "content": "Choose stable shoes. At a winter wedding, you may have to deal with icy sidewalks or snowy parking lots -- which can be difficult to navigate in stiletto heels. Instead of skyscraper pumps, opt for shoes that are easier to walk in, such as velvet wedges or peep toe kitten heels. [8] X Research source Ballet flats that are embellished with rhinestones or covered in satin are also a good option for winter weddings. If you’re concerned about your feet being cold, pair your dress, skirt, or tailored pants with stylish ankle boots for added warmth."

      "title": "Opt for a wool suit.",
      "content": "Opt for a wool suit. When in doubt, your best bet for a winter wedding is a classic trim-fit wool suit. You’ll be warmer than if you wear a basic cotton suit and have a more stylish look in a slim-fitting option. Add a tie for a more dressed up look, or pair it with a simple button-down for a more casual wedding. [9] X Research source A cashmere suit is another option for a winter wedding. The fabric will keep your warm, and has a slight sheen that might make it too much for the office but will look appropriate at a special event such as a wedding."

      "content": "Dress in layers. If you’re worried about being cold at the ceremony and/or reception, dressing in layers can help keep your warm. You can wear a zip-up sweater over your shirt and tie but under jacket to ward off the chill. Choosing a zippered style makes it easier to remove if you get too warm. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Incorporate patterns. At a winter wedding, you can add flair to your look by incorporating patterns. You might wear a striped shirt with a solid suit or add a elegant plaid pocket square to the pocket of a solid jacket. Wearing a patterned tie can also help spice up your outfit. You can mix patterns, but be careful to keep your outfit from looking too busy. For example, if you’re wearing a striped shirt, you might pair it with a suit with a subtle herringbone pattern but not a noticeable plaid pattern."

      "title": "Choose dress boots instead of shoes.",
      "content": "Choose dress boots instead of shoes. Dress shoes can work well for a winter wedding, but your feet may get cold. Instead, consider swapping your usual dress shoes for a pair of dress boots. They’ll keep your feet warmer without taking anything away from your finished look. For example, you can find wingtip boots. They’ll look just like dress shoes with your suit or pants, but they’ll provide extra warmth."
