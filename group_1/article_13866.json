      "title": "Tell your audience you're going to magically switch a coin from one hand to the other.",
      "content": "Tell your audience you're going to magically switch a coin from one hand to the other. Allow them a moment of disbelief. Make it sound convincing, letting them know that you've been practicing the lost art of teleportation for a while now. The more they doubt you, the more fun it will be when the trick works! [1] X Research source Magic tricks are all about confidence and distraction. The more you make it \"entertaining,\" the less they'll scrutinize your hands and the tricks you're actually employing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Close your hand into a fist around the coin, leaving a tiny gap.",
      "content": "Close your hand into a fist around the coin, leaving a tiny gap. Display your flat palm and place the coin over the bottom section of one of your fingers (above the palm). Close your hand into a fist such that the coin is near a small gap between two of your fingers. [2] X Research source The coin is going to fall through your hand without your hand opening up. Make sure the coin is placed just right to be able to access this opening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move your fist over your other hand and drop the coin without opening your fist.",
      "content": "Move your fist over your other hand and drop the coin without opening your fist. The audience will believe you’re just quickly waving your fist over your other hand—what they don't see is that the coin drops. As soon as you feel the coin drop, clench your other fist around the coin as fast as you can. [3] X Research source The audience shouldn’t see the coin drop because the drop happens fast and they’re distracted by the moving fist. If you’re sitting and they’re standing above you, then your fist will cover the coin drop from their viewing angle. Widen the gap of the starting hand so the coin more easily falls into your hand; otherwise, it might just get stuck in the original hand. While you might be tempted to drop the coin into your shirt sleeve, Martinez warns against this. People assume magicians use their sleeves—you want to be unpredictable."

    {
      "title": "Ask a volunteer to say which hand the coin is in.",
      "content": "Ask a volunteer to say which hand the coin is in. They will, hopefully, choose the original hand, since it never opened up to deposit the coin in the other hand. [4] X Research source If they choose the new hand, demand they explain to you how you could've possibly had the coin change hands if it weren't for your amazing telekinetic powers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slowly reveal both hands: the original hand empty, and the hand with the coin.",
      "content": "Slowly reveal both hands: the original hand empty, and the hand with the coin. If you managed to not move your fingers when the coin dropped and clenched your fist soon enough in catching the coin, your friends will be adequately wowed. If this trick is proving difficult to master, move to a smaller coin. It will more easily fall through any gap you create in your fingers. Plus, it will be harder to spot falling into your palm. To make the trick easier, perform seated at a table so you can drop the coin close to your lap, under the table."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell the audience you can change the color of a coin to distract them.",
      "content": "Tell the audience you can change the color of a coin to distract them. This isn't the actual trick, but they don't have to know that. This distracts them from your actual trick so they're not as suspicious of what you're about to do. [5] X Research source Alternatively, just tell them you're going to make a quarter disappear. That's fine, too, but they may be ready to look out for any sleight of hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the coin in one hand and rest your chin on the other fist.",
      "content": "Hold the coin in one hand and rest your chin on the other fist. First, take the quarter and place it in your dominant hand. Put your other elbow on the table and rest your head on your non-dominant hand (which should be clenched in a fist). The elbow on the table is the one you're going to rub the quarter into. Instead of changing colors, the quarter is going to mysteriously \"disappear.\" Yes, your hand does have to rest on your chin. It should be clenched into a fist and not palm open for the purposes of the latter part of this trick."

      "content": "Start rubbing the quarter on your forearm, keeping it hidden in your hand. After a couple rubs, accidentally drop it on the table in front of you. Whoops, silly you. At this point, you may want to distract them by saying something about how you should practice more, or how quarters are naturally slippery—something that diverts their attention away from your hands. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick the quarter up with the hand that was on your chin.",
      "content": "Pick the quarter up with the hand that was on your chin. However, you cannot be seen doing this . You can do it one of two ways: Pretend to hand it back to the rubbing hand and resume rubbing. Just do a fake switch very, very quickly. [7] X Research source Scoop the quarter up with your dominant hand, but let it drop into your non-dominant hand underneath the table. This is more about timing and less about hiding, like the above method."

      "title": "Continue rubbing your elbow, then reveal your empty hand.",
      "content": "Continue rubbing your elbow, then reveal your empty hand. This time your rubbing hand has nothing in it. Rub for a few seconds, telling your audience that something strange is happening. The quarter isn't changing colors...the quarter is...disappearing. You can then reveal your hand to be empty. [8] X Research source If people want to check the other hand for the quarter, you can drop it down your collar before showing them that that hand is also empty. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the quarter reappear.",
      "content": "Make the quarter reappear. The trick can end at the last step, or you can magically make the quarter reappear. You can do this any number of ways, from scratching your head with your non-dominant hand and acting as if it appears from underneath your hair, to \"taking it\" from someone else's clothes, or simply \"coughing\" it up. Whatever you fancy. If you want to be clever about it, wait a while until people have forgotten about the trick. Then mysteriously the quarter reappears. Oh, so that's where it went. Huh. You had no idea. Funny, that."

      "content": "Find a coin that's not identical on both sides. A 10p coin is a good example of this. If you're not sure if any of your country's currency has qualifying coinage, sit down and study them. You may find one has thicker ridges on one side, or identifiable engraving. Make sure you can identify the sides with your eyes closed. [10] X Research source You may be able to get away with making a scratch on one side, but if the other person sees it, they may wind up suspicious and figure out your trick. It's better to use a coin with no obvious damage."

Just make sure the coin goes across your fingertips before you make the \"prediction.\" Learn how to quickly identify the coin side that’s face-down in your hand based on its feeling. [11] X Research source Take some time to practice flipping it, sensing what side it's on, and exposing it by slapping the coin onto your opposite wrist in one swift, natural movement. That second you take to assess the coin shouldn't be visible to an unsuspecting audience."

Then, ask them to guess which side it'll land on as you flip it. Throw the coin up and catch it. Before you put it on your wrist to reveal it, feel the indentation on the side facing down. [12] X Research source You are able to manipulate the coin in your hand to land on the side you want. Call it 5 minutes beforehand, 10 seconds beforehand, or right as you turn it over—and you'll always be right. Buy extra time to feel the coin by asking them to make their own prediction as you discreetly feel it."

Before you put it on your wrist, subtly turn the coin in such a way that it will be exposed facing the direction you guessed (heads or tails). You'll have to be quick—practice makes perfect. After you manipulate the coin (or evaluate that you don't have to), slap it on your opposite wrist for the reveal. That's it. [13] X Research source The beauty of this trick is that you can do it over and over and over—unlike many other tricks that require anonymous set-up. However, you can't do it when someone else flips the coin. Tell them that you need to get a good read on the coin for your psychic powers to work, and you can only do this when you have physical contact with the coin."

Also find a normal penny and a small piece of double-sided tape. In private, put the piece of double-sided tape on one corner of your cloth. Make sure the penny will stick onto it—if it doesn’t, find stronger tape. For the cloth, you can use a piece of paper, a rag, or a paper towel. The coin doesn't have to be a penny, but a penny is a good, average size and weight. The smaller the piece of tape, the better (it'll be less obvious should you not be skilled in sleight of hand)—however, you risk the penny not sticking to it when the trick is in full gear."

It's just a regular penny inside a paper towel, right? Right. Use your hand to block the piece of tape from view. The flimsier the cloth, the better. This way, when you show the center of the cloth with the penny, the sides naturally fall down away from view."

For this trick, do either a classic palm or a finger clip palm. [14] X Research source Set up the palm right before the trick, making sure your audience doesn’t see you hiding the coin. To do a classic palm, place the coin in the center of your palm with your thumb slightly held inward and your fingers curled a bit. This will allow your hand muscles to secure the coin in place, though it may take some practice. [15] X Research source Be careful not to show your palm to your audience—keep your palms facing down or toward your body. To do a finger clip palm, place the coin between your middle and pointer fingers. Tuck it so it’s not sticking out far on the back-of-your-hand side that’s toward the audience. Squeeze the two fingers together to secure it in place. [16] X Research source Hold your fingers slightly bent for a more natural appearance."

You will pass a coin through a solid object: your hand. Specifically, the same hand that is currently palming a coin in secret. This is a valid method to make people believe you’re passing a coin through your hand, confirms Seth. If you have identical coins, show them the coin you’re not palming so they can inspect it. If the coins are only similar, try not to give them a chance to inspect the coin."

Lift your dominant hand down to pull the thread backward over your head, causing the coin to lift with it. Your friends will be amazed! [20] X Research source When it comes to levitating a coin, “Dexterity is very important,” says Seth. That means practicing constantly, even hundreds of times daily, in order to make the moves look and feel natural. Lower the coin again by lifting your dominant hand up."
