      "content": "Eat smaller meals, more frequently. Being underweight means you will have lower energy requirements and a smaller stomach, so you will become full faster. Planning on eating five or six slightly smaller—but complete—meals throughout the day can help you to get the nutrients you need more regularly, and to struggle less with finishing large portions at the beginning. And, as with any seemingly insurmountable task, breaking it into smaller parts can help to make it feel achievable. ”Hara hachi bu” is a Confucian saying which means to eat only until you are eighty percent full. While usually thought of as a mantra for those trying to avoid overeating, it can be helpful for keeping the big picture in check: the point of this is to be healthy and well, not to keep eating to the point of being uncomfortable. You might already know that eating more frequently is also a tip given to those wanting to lose weight as well, to maintain the body's metabolism. So which is right? Both, actually! It just depends on what those frequent meals you're eating consist of. Slowing your metabolism can be attempted to gain weight, but it's not a healthy method that's generally advised."

      "content": "Drink whole milk, not skim. Full-fat options should be taken over fat-free alternatives whenever possible. Light or fat-free versions of food often lead to your body being just as full, but with fewer nutrients to put to work. This rule doesn't apply as you might think to cuts of meat. Fattier meats aren't an overall bad choice--and are more affordable than leaner cuts--but meat with less fat just means more protein, which is good for our goal here."

It’s certainly okay to occasionally splurge on your favorite sugary, salty, junky treats too, as long as it’s not all you snack on. Try eating a large snack or even a small meal before you go to bed. The calories from this nighttime snack are more likely to be stored in your body as you sleep instead of burned for energy. This may help you gain weight."
