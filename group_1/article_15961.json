When you’re caught up in theming the room and telling a story, you can accidentally make a puzzle that’s too abstract—while you understand it, the average person wouldn’t. Dodge this pitfall by including plenty of clues for each puzzle and getting feedback from testers. [36] X Research source “You want to make the puzzles solvable, but still challenging,” says D’Onofrio. “And it should also make sense with the theme that you’re doing.” For example, put safe-cracking puzzles in a bank-robbery themed escape room."

[37] X Research source If you want something scary, you might make the theme a haunted house or a spooky hospital. If you want something more kid-friendly, the theme might be escaping a classroom. Other common themes are bank robbery, spies, escaping an island, or a murder-mystery mansion."

Mix it up with puzzles that range from hidden objects players have to find, to physical puzzles they have to assemble, to stories or videos they have to review to gain clues. Think about the abilities and experience of your players, too. You don’t want the puzzles to be too difficult or too easy."

If not, make sure you designate any private areas as off-limits so players don’t look for clues there. Remove dangerous objects, especially if younger players are doing your escape room. Add your puzzles and any decoration that complements your theme. [38] X Research source"

      "content": "Test your puzzles before it’s playing time. This is especially important for any puzzles that have physical parts, use technology or sensors, or require reaching for or manipulating props. Make sure everything works. Plus, ask yourself if all the steps are clear for solving the puzzle. If they aren’t, add a clue or two to assist players. After your players complete the escape room, ask for feedback. Their insight helps you enhance the experience for future games."
