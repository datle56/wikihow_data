      "content": "Think about how you treat your brother throughout the day. Do you push him when you pass him in the hall? Do you lock him out of the bathroom just to annoy him? Do you take his things without asking? It can be easy to pick on a little brother without even thinking about it, especially since he's littler than you and can't really do anything about it. Start noticing how you treat him throughout the day. In some cases, it can feel like it is your brother's fault that you pick on him. He annoys you, so you pick on him, so he annoys you more-- it's a cycle that won't stop until you try something different."

He probably thinks you are cool and wants to be with you, but isn't mature enough to play the kind of games you like or hang out with you like your friends do. He might be starting fights or bothering you because he wants attention. When you imagine how someone else is feeling, it is called empathy. Empathy helps you decide how to act toward someone by imagining how they feel, and then responding with what would feel most helpful or reassuring to you if you were in their place.

Just because he's your younger brother doesn't mean he doesn't deserve regular respect! Treat him how you want him to treat you. Don't yell at him, take his things without asking, or tattle on him. He may not treat you the same, but if you're respectful and kind to him, you can't be blamed for him starting a fight."

If you and your brother have been fighting a lot lately, or if he has been doing things that annoy you, you should have a conversation with him to let him know how you feel. Make sure that you don't make him cry. Try not to talk down to him in a bossy way, or tell him what to do. Let him participate in the conversation and tell you how he's feeling as well. Try using \"I-statements\" to explain how you feel. Instead of blaming him by saying things like \"You are always so nosy and rude!\" you might say, \"I feel frustrated when you come in my room without knocking. It makes me think you don't respect my privacy.\" [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

You might ask him to not interrupt when you have friends over, knock before coming into your room, and not borrow your toys without asking.
