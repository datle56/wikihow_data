Fax machines are used to send and receive information. Offices often use these machines to pass along important documents or printed memos. [3] X Research source When a fax machine is plugged into a landline, it turns the landline telephone number into a fax number as it adopts the number to be used for sending and receiving information. [4] X Research source Unlike phone numbers, fax numbers don’t necessarily need a geographic area code. A fax machine is a phone, scanner, and printer all rolled into one, allowing users to send and receive paper documentation."
