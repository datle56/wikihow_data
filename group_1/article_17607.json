      "content": "Get 1 highlighter, 1 bronzer, and 1 dark shade with gray undertones. Starting at your inner eyebrows and going down to the tip, draw 2 straight lines on each side of your nose with the gray shade. Make the lines perfectly straight. Then, use the bronzer to draw 2 straight lines right below the first ones you made (that way, when you blend the makeup, the darker colors will fade out and you won't have any harsh lines). Finally, make a super straight line down the center of your bridge with highlighter and use a big, fluffy brush to blend all of the lines together seamlessly. [1] X Research source Use the same formula—liquid, cream, or powder—for all 3 contour shades. If you're using powder contour, apply it with a flat, angled brush. For cream or liquid contour, use your fingers, a sponge. For creamy stick formulas, you can apply it directly from the tube. The gray shade creates shadows to disguise the bent part of your nose. The bronzer softens those shadow lines so the contour looks more natural. The highlight creates the illusion of a super straight bridge."

      "content": "Filler injections require no down time and results last 6-12 months. Hyaluronic acid (HA) filler is strategically injected into your nose to create volume in hollow areas and refine the overall shape of the bridge and tip. The results are instant, although you may have mild swelling for 1-2 days. Don't let the word \"acid\" scare you—HA is a naturally-occurring sugar molecule already present in connective tissue. Your body slowly absorbs the filler, but you can repeat the procedure to maintain your results. See a cosmetic dermatologist or licensed aesthetician to find out if you’re a good candidate! [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Nose filler is often called “liquid rhinoplasty” or “nonsurgical rhinoplasty.” [3] X Research source FDA-approved HA fillers for the nose include Juvéderm and Restylane. [4] X Research source If you don't like the results, your doctor can dissolve the HA filler. Filler is charged by the syringe. Prices vary but $600 to $900 per syringe is a common price range. You'll probably need at least 2 syringes. [5] X Research source HA is the preferred filler for nose reshaping. You've probably heard of Botox, but it's not filler. Botox injections paralyze muscles to smooth out wrinkles."

      "content": "These fillers are safe and results can last up to 12 months. Calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) dermal injections are made of naturally-occurring material and can be used to correct nose asymmetry. CaHA filler lasts a little longer than HA filler and may stimulate your natural collagen production. However, using CaHA filler for nose reshaping is \"off-label\" (meaning it's not intended for nose reshaping). Cosmetic dermatologists and licensed aestheticians tend to prefer HA fillers for the nose, but it wouldn't hurt to ask about CaHA filler. After examining you, your doctor might decide that CaHA filler is the best choice to correct your nose. [6] X Research source The only FDA-approved CaHA filler on the market is Radiesse. Unlike HA fillers, CaHA fillers aren't reversible. Unfortunately, if you don't like the results, you'll have to wait it out. CaHA fillers are usually used on rhinoplasty patients after their surgery to fix any lingering irregularities.

The surgery is complex and highly individualized, so make an appointment with a licensed and experienced cosmetic surgeon to go over your options and come up with a surgical plan that’s right for you. [8] X Research source There are 2 types of rhinoplasty: open and closed. Open rhinoplasty is more invasive and used to make fairly major adjustments. Closed rhinoplasty is less involved and works best for minor adjustments. Your surgeon will tell you what's best for your situation. Your doctor may inform you of limitations in the procedure or other elements that may play a role in the appearance of your nose.

      "content": "Septoplasty is a surgery to permanently straighten a deviated septum. Your septum is the wall of bone and cartilage between your 2 nostrils. If your septum tilts more toward 1 nostril than the other, you may have a deviated or \"crooked\" septum. Deviated septums usually make it harder to breathe and can cause snoring. During the procedure, a licensed surgeon cuts and removes parts of the septum and reinserts them in the proper place. [12] X Research source You can have a septoplasty by itself or in conjunction with a rhinoplasty. Some health insurances may cover this particular surgery, so be sure to call your provider and ask about your options. The downtime after septoplasty is usually 3-4 weeks.

These devices usually attach to your nose in some way and attempt to force it into alignment, similar to the way splints are used for broken bones. These devices may seem tempting, but doctors don't recommend them. Nose shapers aren't well-tested or science-backed, and there's evidence that they can injure, bruise, or even permanently damage your nose. [15] X Research source"
