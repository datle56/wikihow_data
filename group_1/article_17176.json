The apothem is the line from the center of the pentagon to a side, intersecting the side at a 90º right angle. [1] X Research source A regular pentagon can be divided into five triangles. Where the height of the triangle is known as the apothem. Then, using the apothem, the area of a regular pentagon will be ½ x apothem x 5. Don't confuse the apothem with the radius, which touches a corner (vertex) instead of a midpoint. If you only know the side length and radius, skip down to the next method instead. We'll use an example pentagon with side length 3 units and apothem 2 units."

The side opposite the 36º angle is the base of the triangle (half the pentagon's side). The side adjacent to the 36º angle is the height of the triangle. tan(36º) = opposite / adjacent In our example, tan(36º) = 3.5 / height height x tan(36º) = 3.5 height = 3.5 / tan(36º) height = (about) 4.8 units."
