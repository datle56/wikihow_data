[1] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 21 April 2020 Look for a ceiling or support system above your balcony that can hold up your string lights.

Then, reattach the other side of the string lights to another section of the balcony ceiling, or another support on your balcony. [2] X Research source For instance, you can drape the string lights across opposite edges of the ceiling.

You can hang up string lights over 1 wall, multiple walls, or around the perimeter of your balcony! It all depends on how much space you have."

[14] X Research source It might be easier to install the light bulbs after the string is set up. If possible, unscrew your bulbs beforehand and install them after your strings are in place.
