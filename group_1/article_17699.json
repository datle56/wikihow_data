      "title": "The machine is the problem if the disc drive can’t play any game.",
      "content": "The machine is the problem if the disc drive can’t play any game. It’s easy to assume scratches are the problem when you can see them in the disc, but tiny scratches and imperfections are normal and don’t always affect the game’s performance. If the scratches don’t look too bad, put another disc in your gaming console and see if it runs. If not, you might need to get the console repaired. [1] X Research source Disc errors can result due to anything from outdated drivers to incompatible software. It’s a good idea to test this first because some scratch removal methods can damage the disc. If it’s not necessary to fix the scratches, it's better to know immediately."

      "title": "A simple cleaning can help the disc run if the scratches are light.",
      "content": "A simple cleaning can help the disc run if the scratches are light. First, place the CD on a microfiber cloth, playable side up, and drop a small amount of cleaner (either mild dish soap or rubbing alcohol ) on the disc. Moving from the center of the disc to the outer edge in a straight line, gently rub cleaner over the disc. Then, rinse off the cleaner with cold water. [2] X Research source Always clean a disc with straight motions rather than circular ones to avoid further damaging its data. Dish soap and rubbing alcohol are effective cleaners that can remove smudges and oil stains from a game disc. Wash your hands before handling the disc to prevent any oils or dirt on your fingers from getting on your video game."

      "title": "Gently rubbing the disc can polish out any tiny scratches on it.",
      "content": "Gently rubbing the disc can polish out any tiny scratches on it. After washing the disc, wipe it down to remove excess water and see if a simple polish can help the disc run without any extra fixes. Be sure to use a microfiber cloth (sometimes called a lint-free cloth) to polish the disc, as microfiber preserves the disc and prevents further damage. [3] X Research source Never use paper towels to dry off or polish a game disc, as they can damage the disc's playable side. Test out the disc after washing and drying it. Sometimes that’s all you need! Only continue to the next steps and do a DIY disc repair if the scratches are still causing problems."

      "title": "Toothpaste acts like a mild abrasive that can remove scratches.",
      "content": "Toothpaste acts like a mild abrasive that can remove scratches. Place a few dabs of toothpaste around the center of the disc. Spread the toothpaste over the disc with your finger, using straight motions from the center of the disc to the outer edge. Rub the toothpaste into the disc for 60 seconds before rinsing it off under cold water and drying it with a microfiber cloth. [4] X Research source Don’t use toothpaste with any large beads or other particles in it, as those will damage the disc. When drying the video game disc, be sure to use straight motions rather than rubbing in circles. Ensure you get all the toothpaste off the disc before using it again. Dip a cloth in rubbing alcohol and clean excess toothpaste before rinsing it under water if necessary."

      "title": "Petroleum jelly can be used in place of toothpaste to remove scratches.",
      "content": "Petroleum jelly can be used in place of toothpaste to remove scratches. Like toothpaste, petroleum jelly can fill in some of the gaps left by scratches, even after being removed. Rub a small amount of petroleum jelly into the scratch and let it sit for 60 seconds. Then, gently wipe it off of the disc using the microfiber cloth, clearing away as much jelly as you can, and test the disc in your console. [5] X Research source Once again, use straight motions from the inside of the disc out to wipe away the petroleum jelly. Ensure the disc is dry and clean before trying to use it."

      "title": "Car wax can fill in deeper scratches and repel future scratches too.",
      "content": "Car wax can fill in deeper scratches and repel future scratches too. Place a few light dabs of carnauba car wax around the center of the disc and use a microfiber cloth to rub it into the disc’s surface. [6] X Research source Then, using a clean cloth, wipe the car wax off of the disc in straight motions until your game is clean. Test it out in the console and see if it works. Because carnauba car wax is made from plants, there aren’t any chemicals in it that can further damage your disc. Feel free to repeat any of these methods if the disc doesn’t work right after one fix, going through and trying each of them or trying a resurfacing machine if the scratches are too deep to fix with an oil-based product."

      "title": "A banana can effectively buff the game disc and help it run.",
      "content": "A banana can effectively buff the game disc and help it run. Peel a banana and cut it in half. Then, with the cut end facing out, rub half of the banana across the game disc, concentrating on gently filling in any scratches. [7] X Research source Briefly wet the disc under running water and spread the banana around with a fingertip. Finally, spritz the disc with glass cleaner and wipe it clean with a microfiber cloth. Bananas (along with toothpaste and petroleum jelly) are oil-based and, therefore, capable of polishing and filling in troublesome scratches. There are other oil-based products you can rub into the scratches of a disc to fill and polish them, too, including lip balm, white stick deodorant, shoe polish, and even peanut butter!"

      "title": "Scratch-repair tools are designed to buff the scratches out of discs.",
      "content": "Scratch-repair tools are designed to buff the scratches out of discs. While some professional tools are expensive, you can pick up a small disc scratch-repair machine cheaply online. The machine grinds down the disc's surface (without damaging it beyond use) until the scratches are nonexistent. Use this if your disc is scratched too deeply for one of the polishing methods above. [8] X Research source While you can sand down a disc by hand, a machine is more precise and protects your game from being damaged. Scratch-repair machines are also a good investment because they can be used repeatedly to fix and polish any discs that get scratched in the future."

      "title": "Local game stores often have resurfacing machines that can fix discs.",
      "content": "Local game stores often have resurfacing machines that can fix discs. If the scratches on your game look a little deep, or you’d rather not attempt a DIY fix, professional resurfacing is usually quite cheap—rarely costing more than $4 or $5 per disc. Search for video game stores in your area; even small mom-and-pop shops typically have a resurfacing machine. If a game store advertises buying and selling used games, it’s highly likely they have a resurfacing machine due to all the used discs they deal with. Check your local library and see if they have a resurfacing machine, too! Libraries that carry DVDs often have to deal with scratches since so many people rent them. If there are no locations in your area that can repair a disc, you can also mail your disc to an online resurfacing service like eStarland , which charges $3 per disc."

      "title": "The easiest way to address scratches in game discs is to prevent them!",
      "content": "The easiest way to address scratches in game discs is to prevent them! Never touch the surface of a video game disc (unless cleaning it in the steps above). Instead, hold the disc by its sides and place it safely in its case between uses. Additionally, check the disc (and disc tray, if possible) for dust before inserting it into a console, and don’t move your console while a disc is inserted. [9] X Research source Moving a console with a disc in it can cause the parts inside the console to move and scratch your game. Don’t leave a game in the console when you turn it off, even if you plan to play the same game again later. Remove it and put it back in its case. If a disc gets wet, always ensure it’s completely dry before you store it in a case once again."
