      "content": "Go to the Roblox catalog. Currently there is a way to get fake Korblox using a bundle called \"Pirate.\" However, Roblox has been known to take down bundles like these, so this method may not work indefinitely. If you purchase a Pirate bundle that gets removed, Roblox will refund the Robux you spent on the item. If the Pirate bundle is missing from the catalog, try looking again in a few days. Creators sometimes reupload items that get taken down."
