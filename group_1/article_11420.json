      "content": "Fold the back of a baggy T-shirt in half lengthwise. Fold the shirt in half lengthwise so that the back is on the outside and the front of the shirt is on the inside. Next, pull the front of the shirt out of the sandwich. This way, you won't accidentally cut through the front when cutting the back. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide what shape you want the slashes to create on the back of your shirt.",
      "content": "Decide what shape you want the slashes to create on the back of your shirt. Slash-back t-shirts have horizontal slashes in the back. These slashes are cut at different lengths to create a simple shape, such as a heart or an upside-down triangle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw half of your desired shape along the folded edge.",
      "content": "Draw half of your desired shape along the folded edge. Divide your desired shape in half lengthwise, then draw it along the folded edge of the shirt. The shape can be whatever size you want it to be, but larger shapes look better in this style. Keep the width of the shape in mind. The wider it is, the more revealing it will be. [2] X Research source Extend the shape from just below the collar to one-half or two-thirds of the way down. Use a tailor's chalk on dark fabrics and a tailor's pen on light fabrics. If you can't find these, use regular chalk instead."

    {
      "title": "Cut slits into the folded edge, stopping at the lines that you drew.",
      "content": "Cut slits into the folded edge, stopping at the lines that you drew. Use fabric scissors to cut the slits. Space the slits finger-width apart. Begin cutting them at the folded edge of the shirt, and finish cutting at the lines that make up your half shape. [3] X Research source Use your pinkie finger for thinner stripes, and your index finger for thicker ones. Make sure that you are only cutting through the back of the shirt. The front of the shirt must be pulled out of the way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfold your shirt.",
      "content": "Unfold your shirt. You should now have a full heart or upside-down triangle filled with horizontal slashes! Don't worry if the edges of the slashes look uneven. You will fix that next."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tug on the strips of fabric making up the slashes.",
      "content": "Tug on the strips of fabric making up the slashes. This will cause the edges to curl inside the shirt and make any unevenness less visible. It will also help make the strips thinner! Be gentle when tugging, however; you don't want to accidentally rip the fabric. [4] X Research source Grab a strip on 1 side, and slide your finger across it to the other side. This makes them more even."

      "content": "Cut the neck, collar, and hem off, if desired. You can cut the sleeves off all the way, including the seams, or you can cut them off at the hems. You can also cut the bottom hem off as well as around the collar for a more rugged look. Be sure to pull on the cut edges to curl the fabric inwards when you are done!"

      "title": "Wash the shirt by hand or in a washer.",
      "content": "Wash the shirt by hand or in a washer. This will get rid any chalk or pen marks that you used to create your shape. Check the tag on your shirt to find out what temperature and cycle setting to use. You can also wash the shirt by hand, then hang it up to dry. This is great if you don't have anything else to wash."

It can be as large as you want it to be. Use a tailor's chalk for dark fabrics, and a tailor's pen for light fabrics. [6] X Research source If you are creating a design on the collar, draw 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) lines radiating from the collar instead. Keep about a finger width between each line. [7] X Research source If you can't find a tailor's pen, use colored chalk instead. You want these lines to be washable."

      "content": "Draw a second identical shape inside your first shape. Make this shape a few inches/centimeters smaller. How much smaller you make the shape depends on how long you want the slits to be. About 2 inches (5.1 cm) would be ideal, however. This will create your inner frame. [8] X Research source Skip this step if you are doing the collar."

You can make them evenly spaced, or you can vary the spaces by making some closer together than others. [9] X Research source Keep the lines at least finger-width apart. If you are varying the spaces between the lines, create a pattern. You can make the lines point in different directions, but don't let them cross each other. Skip this step if you are doing the collar."

Finish cutting along the line, from your inner to outer frame. Do not cut through the frames themselves. Make sure that you are only cutting through the back of the shirt. [10] X Research source Use this technique to cut the lines around the collar. Make sure that you are only cutting through the fabric in the front of the shirt."

      "content": "Stretch the cut edges. Once you have your shirt cut as desired, go through all of the cut edges of your shirt, and gently pull on the fabric. This will cause the cut edges to curl into the shirt and hide any unevenness. The spaces between the slits will also shrink. [11] X Research source You can stretch the slits by pulling on the top and bottom edges. You can also slid your fingers into them and open them like scissors."

Widen the sleeve by cutting further into the bottom of the arm hole, if desired. Fold the shirt in half so that the side seams match up, then use the cut sleeve hole as guide for cutting the second sleeve off. [12] X Research source Finish the rugged look by cutting the collar and bottom hem off as well. For a shirt that's perfect to wear with a bralet, cut the sleeves down to 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) above the bottom hem. For a tied shirt, cut all the way down to the hem, splitting the front from the back. Tie the bottom corners on each side of the shirt together into double-knots."

Next, cut a small slit into the middle of the hem in the front of your shirt. Connect the slit to the cut edges of the side seams using angled lines. Cut a 6 in (15 cm) vertical slit into the bottom of the V, then tie the tails into a double-knot. Take things a step further by cutting the collar and sleeves off. Be sure to cut the seams off as well!"

      "content": "Cut a fringe into the hem if you want to give your shirt a hippie vibe. Spread your T-shirt out on a flat surface, then lay a strip of tape across it, from side-to-side. Cut vertical strips into the shirt, starting at the bottom hem and finishing at the bottom edge of the tape. Peel the tape off when you are done, then gently tug on the fringe to even it out. How far up the shirt you place the tape depends on how far up you want the fringe to go. A third of the way up the shirt is a safe bet. How wide you make the fringe is up to you. Anywhere between 1 ⁄ 8 to 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.32 to 0.64 cm) wide would look great. Tie the fringes together in an alternating pattern for a macramé look!"

Make sure that the tips of the triangles don't go through the stitching on the hem. Leave about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of space between each triangle. When you are done, unfold the hem to reveal a diamond pattern. [13] X Research source Make the triangles about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide."

Make the 1 slit next to the stitching, and the other slit about halfway between the collar and shoulder. Cut the collar off, starting at 1 slit and finishing at the other. When you are done, tug the collar apart to curl the edges of the fabric and hide any unevennes. [15] X Research source Finish the rugged look by cutting the hems off of both the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt. Tug on the cut hems to curl the fabric.
