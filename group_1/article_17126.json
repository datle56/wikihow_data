      "content": "Search an image database using a screenshot from the anime. Take a screenshot of the anime you’re watching to see if a database can recognize the exact show. Try to take a picture of a scene with specific characters and detailed scenery so the database has a better shot at identifying the show. [1] X Research source You can look up screenshots here: https://trace.moe . For instance, a picture of 2 characters talking would be better than a screenshot of an open meadow. Any reverse image site will work well for this, like Yandex, IQDB, and SauceNAO."

      "content": "Use the Anime Character Database with specific parameters to narrow it down. Using the specific details you remember, narrow down your search with different categories, like the year the anime was released or which genre it falls under. While there will still be quite a few options to browse through, you may have an easier time finding the show that you’re looking for. [3] X Research source For instance, it’s a lot easier to narrow down which anime you’re looking for if you know it falls into the “slice of life” genre, as opposed to the “sports” or “historical” genres. If it’s a recent anime, you can search within the last 5 years and see if any familiar titles show up."

To get a quicker answer, provide as much detail in your post as you can remember, even if it seems insignificant. Within a few minutes or hours, you may get a response back! [4] X Research source You’ll need a Reddit account to be able to post your question. You can also try posting in “r/animesuggest” and the general “r/anime” subreddits as well. For instance, you can say something like: “I can’t remember the name of this anime I used to watch. One of the main characters has long white hair and wears a crop top, and she travels around with a talking pig. Does anyone know which anime this is?” You can also say something like: “I found this screenshot while I was browsing Twitter, but I completely forget which anime it’s from. Could someone help me out?”"

Do your favorite characters have really bold, unconventional names, or are they more Western? Your perfect anime name might be the very same as a character that you know and love. [7] X Research source For instance, if you’re a fan of the Sailor Moon franchise, you might choose “Hikari” as your name. “Hikari” means “light” in Japanese, while “Usagi” means “bunny.” If you’re a fan of the One Piece franchise, you might try a fun spin on the name “Ace” by naming yourself “Spade.”"
