For a no-fuss solution, just throw your grounds and paper filters in the garbage as you would any other non-hazardous household waste. [1] X Research source As a bonus, coffee grounds can absorb odors, so they might help keep your trash from smelling bad. [2] X Research source If you have a reusable coffee filter , French press, or another reusable coffee vessel, gently tap it against the side of the open trash can to make sure all the grounds make it inside. To get the last dregs, Reddit user @achilton1987 recommends filling a reusable vessel with a little bit of water, swirling it around, and pouring it into a small metal strainer over a sink. Dump the grounds into the trash."

      "content": "Toss your coffee grounds into the soil in your garden. Coffee grounds contain nutrients that plants need to grow, like nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. If you only have a pot of grounds you’d like to reuse, simply empty it into the soil around your plants. Throw away your grounds in different locations each time so they don’t harm your plants. [8] X Research source Professional gardener Ben Barkan says there’s “a myth that you shouldn't apply coffee grounds to the soil because it will acidify the soil.” However, “if that's a concern, then you can mix in a little bit of limestone… to reverse the acidification process.” Because it’s naturally acidic, coffee grounds are especially good for acid-loving plants like hydrangeas and roses. However, some plants (like tomatoes) may not react well to them. Try not to apply a large amount of grounds to the top of your soil—the grounds can clog together and prevent water or air from reaching the roots of your plants. The safest way to use grounds in your garden in large quantities is to add them to a compost container or worm bin. [9] X Research source"

Combine 2 to 3 tsp (0.33 to 0.5 g) of dried grounds with warm water and dish soap. Scrub the pans with the mixture and a soft sponge until the pot or pan is clean. [10] X Research source Coffee grounds may leave behind a brown tinge, so make sure anything you clean with them is stain-resistant. Coffee grounds can clog a drain, so make sure to use a kitchen sink plug or a fine mesh drain basket to collect the grounds, then throw them in the trash."

Massage your face and any areas of dry, flaky skin, then rinse off the grounds and oil with water. [11] X Research source If you have oily skin, skip the olive oil. Just massage your face with coffee grounds, then rinse. For larger amounts of coffee grounds, like 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL), collect them with a drain stopper instead of letting them go down the drain."
