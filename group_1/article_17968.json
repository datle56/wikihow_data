      "content": "Clean the tent before you begin folding. Most of the time, all you’ll need to do is shake out any dirt, sand, pine needles, or other debris, says Goldbach. While you can attempt this later, the debris can get stuck in the tent folds. Simply tip the tent to pour out the debris. Then, wipe down the tent with a little bit of powdered laundry detergent and a moist rag when you have time. [1] X Research source Never pack away a damp tent or else you may end up with mold ! If your tent is wet, Goldbach advises that you let it dry before packing it away. If it’s currently raining, unfold the tent at your next available opportunity to let it dry before you store it away."

[2] X Research source Leave the tent’s door open to let out the air. Note : The folding process is the same for single, 2-person, and 4-person pop-up tents."

      "content": "Fold the bottom 2 poles together. The bottom poles form the outer edges of the tent, which now stick out to your left and right. You’ll need to reach both of them. Simply fold one of the bottom poles up and over to the top poles. Then, do the same with the other bottom pole so you’re holding all 4 poles together. [3] X Research source Ask a friend to help you if you’re folding up a 2- or 4-person tent since these can be bulkier and more difficult to handle."

      "content": "Grab the top poles and fold them under themselves to the ground. Hold the 4 poles together with 1 hand. Then, use your other hand to grab the 2 poles at the top part of the tent. Push down the top of the tent and bring it down to your other hand, so the top folds under itself. Then, wrestle the tent to the ground to flatten it. [5] X Research source The poles are lightweight, so you won’t need more than a minimal amount of force to bring down the tent. The poles are also flexible, so they’re unlikely to break."

Press down on the tent with your hands and knees to remove any leftover air preventing it from laying flat. Then, slip the tent into its storage bag to pack it away for your next trip. [7] X Research source Make sure to secure the tent closed with the attached strap (if it has one) to prevent it from popping back out again as you place it in the storage bag."

Then, clean the tent with a little water and a hose or rag. If you don’t have time to tackle tough stains now, you can pack away the tent and do it at home. A little bit of a powdered detergent helps when scrubbing off tough stains."

Goldbach’s biggest piece of advice for putting away your tent is to make sure you’re “not storing it wet.” Moisture can make your tent smell bad, damage the material, and encourage mold and mildew to grow. So, Goldbach says to always let your tent dry completely before folding it up. To help waterproof your tent, Goldbach suggests using a seam sealer ."
