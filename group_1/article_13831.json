      "content": "Divide your hair front to back into three sections. The sections should start at your forehead and end at the nape of your neck. The middle section should have the most hair, and the two other sections should be equal. Put the middle section into a low ponytail. Leave the two other sections down for now. [1] X Research source For example, begin each side section at your temple, then create a part that goes over and behind your ear."

      "content": "Tighten the base of the middle ponytail. Pull on each side of the ponytail to push the elastic band up the ponytail. Try using a fiber-wrapped elastic for the tightest hold. [2] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. The elastic band will get closer to your scalp, pushing the top of your hair up into a small bump. If the bump isn't big enough, you can use a comb to tease your hair more. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure with bobby pins. Pull the two other sections of your hair back towards the ponytail. Cover the elastic with the two sections. The elastic band should be hidden. Secure them with bobby pins at the base of the ponytail. Place the bobby pins vertically so that they are hidden, creating a polished look. [4] X Research source The two other sections should be secured in a way that they make the ponytail look fuller. They should not appear separate from the ponytail."

      "content": "Tease the ends of your hair. Use a hairbrush to tease the ends of your hair. This will contribute to a fuller looking ponytail by making it appear longer. You can use a teasing comb for extra volume if you’d like. [5] X Research source After you tease your hair, you'll want to gently smooth the top of the hair using a light touch with a brush."

      "content": "Use hairspray. Spray the ponytail with a hairspray that provides a strong hold. Secure the ponytail, but don’t use so much hairspray that your hair loses its natural bounce. Once you’re finished, you can push back your bangs or put on a headband. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Put your hair in a low ponytail.",
      "content": "Put your hair in a low ponytail. Brush your hair behind your eyes. Divide it front to back into three sections. The sections should begin at your forehead and end at the nape of your neck. Pull the middle section into a low ponytail. Secure it with a clear elastic. Leave the other two sections down. Let the middle section be the thickest. It will be difficult to twist your hair if the other two sections are too thick. For example, each side section should begin at your temple. Create a part that goes over and then behind your ear. Brush your hair out first if it is straight or slightly wavy. Do not brush it if you have curly hair that you want to maintain."
