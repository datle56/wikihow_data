      "content": "Hose down the smelly area with some water. Surprisingly, the most effective way to get rid of urine on soil or grass is to dilute it with water over time, and this is also an all-natural solution. Hose down the area your animals use the most at least once a day, or point an oscillating sprinkler toward the area. After a couple of days, you’ll notice that the urine smell has decreased (and it may even go away completely!). [1] X Research source Not only will the water dilute the urine, but it will allow it to slowly sink into the soil, too."

Add 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of lemon juice for some extra odor-fighting power. Mix the ingredients together, then spritz the urine-infested areas with your mixture.

      "content": "Spray the area with a baking soda solution. Baking soda is a powerful deodorizer, and it’s very effective at neutralizing the ammonia smell from pet urine. To use it on your lawn, simply mix 1 tsp (5.7 g) baking soda into 4 cups (1 liter) of water. Spray this solution onto the smelly areas of your lawn lightly, being careful not to saturate the soil fully.

Sprinkle the stinky patches with lime, then get the lime damp with a hose. Let the lime sit for a week, then cover the patches up with top soil. [4] X Research source If you have any dead patches of grass in your yard from urine, you can sprinkle grass seed on top of the topsoil to reseed the area. If you use this method, you’ll want to make sure the lime is fully incorporated into your soil before using your lawn again or letting your pet play on it, since lime dust can irritate the lungs, eyes, and skin.

If it’s been a few hours (or a few days) since your pet peed on the concrete or cement surface, water probably won’t be enough to get rid of the urine smell.

If the smell is lingering, try covering the affected area with a thick layer of baking soda (the more, the better). Let the baking soda sit for one hour to really absorb the urine smell. Then, pour white vinegar over the area to neutralize the baking soda and get rid of the urine. After you're done, rinse the area with water.

Keep adding cleaning solution and blotting it up until the urine is gone. [10] X Research source You’ll probably have to do this process 2 or 3 times before the urine stain is completely gone. If the stain is still there, add a few drops of hydrogen peroxide and 2 drops of ammonia. Then, sponge the area with cold water and blot it dry."

This keeps them from going to the bathroom near concrete or wooden decks, which can hold strong urine smells longer than grass. It might be helpful to add a marking post where you want your dog to go, like a bird bath or a lawn ornament. Then, praise them with with treats and affection when they go in the right spot. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Remember to keep a close eye on your dogs when they’re playing in your backyard. That way, you can prevent them from peeing in the wrong places, and address any accidents right away. “I think that the most important thing is not to give the dog too much space or freedom, not letting them run around unattended or supervised. That's where most of the accidents happen,” explains professional dog trainer Elisabeth Weiss. [13] X Expert Source Elisabeth Weiss Professional Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 27 September 2022. If training doesn’t work, consider putting in a fenced dog run. That way, your animals can only access a certain part of the yard when they need to pee."

Most people look for a dark, secluded spot to urinate when they’re out and about. Instead, make your area bright with lights, and put up cameras so people are afraid of getting caught. Add a sign that says “Smile for the cameras!” so people know they’re being filmed. Hopefully, they’ll move onto somewhere else to relieve their bladders. You could also put up signs to encourage patrons to speak up if they see someone using your building as a urinal."
