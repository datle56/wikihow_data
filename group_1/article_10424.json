    {
      "title": "Lay a sheet of contact paper flat on a table with the paper side up.",
      "content": "Lay a sheet of contact paper flat on a table with the paper side up. Contact paper comes in rolls. Unroll some and lay it flat on the table. Make sure the paper side is facing up. [1] X Research source Don’t unroll too much paper at first, or the wrapping will be difficult to work with. You can always unroll a little more later if the book is large. Contact paper is available at many convenience stores, as well as arts and crafts stores. You can also order a roll online."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the book on the paper with the text block 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end.",
      "content": "Place the book on the paper with the text block 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end. The text block is the opposite end from the spine. Arrange this edge parallel with the end of the paper. Leave a 1 inch (2.5 cm) space between the book and the end of the paper so you have room to wrap the plastic over the inside cover."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a line along the spine of the book.",
      "content": "Draw a line along the spine of the book. Take a pencil and trace up the spine of the book. Hold the book down so it doesn’t shift while you draw the line. [2] X Research source Don’t draw the line from one end of the wrapping to the other. Just make the line as long as the book. A pen will also work, but there may be some ink marks on the plastic wrapping."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the book over the line you drew.",
      "content": "Flip the book over the line you drew. Imagine the line forms a hinge for the spine to rotate on. Flip the book to the other side of the line so the spine still faces the line. Then arrange the book so it’s parallel with the line. You can also slide the book over and align the text block with the line. The position of the book doesn’t matter, as long as you get an accurate measurement."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the paper 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the side of the book.",
      "content": "Cut the paper 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the side of the book. Measure 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end of the text block. Then use a sharp pair of scissors and cut the sheet of contact paper off the roll. [3] X Research source This cut doesn’t have to be perfectly straight. Just make sure you leave enough room for the wrapping to fold over the book cover."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel 1 inch (2.5 cm) of paper off the side of the plastic layer.",
      "content": "Peel 1 inch (2.5 cm) of paper off the side of the plastic layer. Contact paper works like a band-aid or sticker. Start at one of the side corners and lift the backing paper up, exposing the sticky plastic underneath. Work your way down and peel 1 inch (2.5 cm) of paper off. Then fold the paper over, making a straight line parallel with the plastic. [4] X Research source Don’t peel off any more than 1 inch (2.5 cm). The contact paper will be very difficult to work with and could stick to itself if you peel all the paper off at once. Work from the sides of the contact paper, not the top or bottom. You measured the paper from the sides of the book, so the size will be incorrect if you peel the top or bottom first."

    {
      "title": "Lay the book’s text block just over the fold so it touches the sticky plastic.",
      "content": "Lay the book’s text block just over the fold so it touches the sticky plastic. Line up the book where the backing paper and contact paper meet. Then press the book cover onto the contact paper. Press your hand down along the book cover to work out any air bubbles under the plastic. [5] X Research source Make sure the book cover is straight. If it’s crooked, your measurements will be off. Peel the book off and press it down again to straighten it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the backing paper off while pressing the contact paper down.",
      "content": "Pull the backing paper off while pressing the contact paper down. With the contact paper sticking onto one side of the book cover, flip the book over so the cover is facing up. Hold the cover down with one hand and grab the fold of backing paper with your other hand. Pull the backing paper slowly to peel it off. At the same time, use your other hand to press the contact paper down onto the book cover. [6] X Research source Smooth out any bubbles as you press the contact paper down. Use a ruler or similar instrument to help press the contact paper down and push out any bubbles. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the corners off the contact paper at a 45-degree angle.",
      "content": "Cut the corners off the contact paper at a 45-degree angle. Stop peeling when you reach the book spine. Take a scissor and cut diagonally along the corners of the contact paper at a 45-degree angle. Get close to the book cover but be careful not to cut it. Then cut the contact paper at the spine straight down towards the book, parallel with the spine. Get as close to the book as you can without hitting the cover. With these cuts, you can easily fold the contact paper inside the book."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the sticky contact paper inside the book cover.",
      "content": "Fold the sticky contact paper inside the book cover. Start with the contact paper near the block text. Fold this flap inside the book cover and press it down to work out any bubbles. Then do the same with the 2 side flaps. [8] X Research source If you make a mistake or leave bubbles under the contact paper, carefully peel up the wrapper and press it down again."

      "title": "Wrap the contact paper around the spine of the book and cover the other side.",
      "content": "Wrap the contact paper around the spine of the book and cover the other side. With the first side secure, continue working around the book. Press the contact paper down around the book spine and be careful to work out all the air bubbles. Then, continue onto the other side. When you reach the end of the book, peel the excess backing paper off completely. [9] X Research source Remember to keep working with your hand to squeeze out any air bubbles that get trapped."

      "title": "Cut the corners off the contact paper on the other side.",
      "content": "Cut the corners off the contact paper on the other side. Use the same technique you did on the first side. Cut diagonally along the contact paper at the book corners, taking care not to cut the cover. Then cut straight down towards the cover on the wrapping near the book spine. [10] X Research source Just snip off the remaining contact paper around the book spine."

    {
      "title": "Press the remaining contact paper flaps underneath the book cover.",
      "content": "Press the remaining contact paper flaps underneath the book cover. Finish the job by tucking the last bit of contact paper under the book cover. Fold the piece near the block text first. Then fold the 2 flaps. Press all the flaps down to work out any air bubbles."

      "title": "Cut the plastic wrapping so it's 4 inches (10 cm) longer than the book cover.",
      "content": "Cut the plastic wrapping so it's 4 inches (10 cm) longer than the book cover. Unlike contact paper, plastic wrapping does not have an adhesive backing, so it doesn't stick on its own. Roll a bit out on a flat surface and place the book on it. Lay the book 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end of the plastic. Then roll the plastic around the rest of the book until it extends 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the other side. Cut along this line. [11] X Research source Plastic wrapping is available from office supply or craft stores, or online."

      "title": "Leave 2 inches (5.1 cm) of plastic wrap on the top and bottom of the book.",
      "content": "Leave 2 inches (5.1 cm) of plastic wrap on the top and bottom of the book. Lay the book in the center of the plastic sheet. Then measure 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the top and bottom. Cut the plastic wrapping at this point so you have enough to wrap the book. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the plastic on the sides underneath the front and back covers.",
      "content": "Wrap the plastic on the sides underneath the front and back covers. Press the plastic down so it fits tightly over both covers. Use a small strip of clear tape and secure the plastic to the front cover. This is only supposed to hold the plastic down while you work, so no need to use a lot of tape. [13] X Research source Don't fold the corners of the plastic down yet. Leave the plastic arranged so 2 inches (5.1 cm) of wrapping are on the top and bottom of the book. Only use tape on the front cover. Do not place any tape on the back cover yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the plastic at the spine straight down towards the book.",
      "content": "Cut the plastic at the spine straight down towards the book. Line up your scissors so they're parallel with the book spine. Then snip the plastic on the top and bottom of the book straight down. Get as close to the cover as you can without cutting it. This gives you 2 tabs at the book spine, 1 on the top and 1 on the bottom. Snip both tabs off. [14] X Research source If your scissors are long enough, you can snip both layers (front and back) of the plastic at the same time. If they aren't then cut each one individually."

      "title": "Snip the remaining corners off the plastic at 45-degree angles.",
      "content": "Snip the remaining corners off the plastic at 45-degree angles. Again, get as close to the book as you can without cutting the cover. Do this for the 2 corners on the front and back of the book. [15] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold the top and bottom flaps under the cover and tape the plastic down.",
      "content": "Fold the top and bottom flaps under the cover and tape the plastic down. Start on the front cover. Fold the top and bottom flaps down underneath the cover. Then tape the side flaps to the front flap so no tape touches the book cover. Then do the same for the back cover. [16] X Research source Keeping tape off the cover makes it easier to replace the cover in the future. You can just undo the tape holding the plastic together rather than peeling the tape off the cover. This could damage your book."
