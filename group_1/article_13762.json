      "content": "Run and hop. In order to gain momentum, start by running a few steps and then doing a hurdle. A hurdle is a quick hop or skip that allows you to start the handspring. Hop from your dominant foot, land on your dominant foot, and then quickly step with your non-dominant foot. [1] X Research source Raise your arms straight up in the air when you hurdle."

      "content": "Plant your hands on the ground and kick your legs up. Use the momentum from your hurdle to propel yourself forward and direct your arms and upper body towards the ground. Plant your hands on the ground and then kick your legs up to get your body vertical. The distance from where you last stepped to where you plant your hands should be about one body length.

Start off by skipping like you normally would around the room if you’re having a hard time understanding the rhythm of the hurdle. Once you have the motion down, try using it to go into a simpler gymnastics move, such as a cartwheel or a roundoff. [10] X Research source"

If you’re using weights, keep your arms by your sides. Keep your upper body straight and look forward as you do the exercise.
