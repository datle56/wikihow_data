Depending on the method and the initial temperature of the beer, it could take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to cool the beer - so in deciding which method to use, consider how soon you want to open your first beer. Be careful not to leave your beer in the freezer for more than 30 minutes, as it may explode. Using a cooler with ice water is the fastest method to cool beer (it transfers heat more quickly). [2] X Research source With this method, allow the ice to settle inside the cooler for an hour or longer. Once the ice melts a little, place the Corona beers inside the cooler."

      "content": "Open and dress the Corona with salt and lime. Use a bottle opener to remove the bottle cap from the top of the beer - as all Corona bottles require a bottle opener. Sprinkle the rim of the bottle with a little sea salt, Lucas brand seasoning or other salt-based seasoning of your choice. Place a lime wedge over the opening of the beer bottle and squeeze the lime juice into the bottle. Push the lime wedge into the bottle to flavor the beer even more. [3] X Research source If you'd like to mix the drink more completely, try putting your thumb over the top of the beer and slowly turning it upside down a few times. Be careful: Turning the beer upside down at a fast rate will cause the beer to release carbonation and explode."

      "content": "Make your own mixed Corona. Add one to all of the following to a mixer or empty cup with half a Corona in it: lemon, Tabasco sauce, spicy tomato juice, salt and/or pepper. These ingredients are most common in corona, besides the lime and salt combination. Adding these elements of flavor to your Corona will really improve the taste and can be fun to experiment with. If you decide that you want to only add one or two of the ingredients, you can go ahead and put the ingredients directly into your Corona bottle and skip putting them in a mixer. Make sure that you'll enjoy each flavor that the different ingredients create. You can do this by tasting each ingredient mixed in a shot glass with Corona. Place a few ice cubes into the mixer or cup with the ingredients if the Corona becomes warm in the process."

[5] X Research source Make sure that the drinking glass' rim is wide enough to support a Corona bottle without tipping over. If the only drinking glasses that you have are small, you can try using a Coronita (a smaller Corona)."
