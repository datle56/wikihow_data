Wi-Fi connections are typically higher-speed than mobile data or cellular connections, but quality may vary. In addition, playback quality can be affected by: Screen size: Videos generally look better on smaller screens, and larger screens will require higher quality to look better. Upload quality: It’s up to creators to make and upload high-quality videos. If a video was uploaded at low quality, you won’t be able to enhance it. Browser: Some browsers don’t allow for more recent or higher-quality video formats. To get the best quality, use the official YouTube app, or watch on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or MS Edge."
