      "title": "Collect all used wallpaper paste in one container.",
      "content": "Collect all used wallpaper paste in one container. Before you begin removing adhesive from the wall, designate a container for all glue residue. Be mindful of the container you choose as it may be thrown away at the end of the process—don’t choose your favorite bucket! Most wallpaper paste is water-soluble. If you remove the glue from the wall with water, you will collect the liquid waste mixture in the designated disposal container. If you scraped the glue off the wall in solid strips, you may simply throw the scraps away. If the pieces are wet, combine in a container and proceed to the next step."

      "content": "Wait 24-48 hours for the paste to dry and harden. [1] X Research source Exact timing depends on the amount of paste in your container. Wait at least one full day for the glue mixture to dry completely. This step is important because you do not want liquid paste to leak and stick to the inside of the garbage bin. [2] X Research source Do not cover or seal the container. This will prevent the paste from hardening."

      "content": "Throw away container with solid paste in the garbage bin. Once it is completely solid, the dried material can be treated like normal waste and disposed of with the rest of the household trash. [3] X Research source If you are getting rid of large amounts of used wallpaper paste, you may have the option to bring it to a local waste or recycling yard."

      "content": "Add water to dilute dried wallpaper paste. Most wallpaper pastes are water-soluble, meaning they dissolve in water. [4] X Research source Combine water with used glue until it is a thin, watery liquid. In the rare instance that you are disposing of a solvent paste, this method will not apply."

      "content": "Rinse liquid paste down household drains. The diluted solution will flow down the drain like any other liquid. Make sure to dilute it fully to avoid any build up or clogs. Flushing the liquid paste down the toilet is also a popular option. Make sure to clean up any paste that may splash or splatter during this step—you don’t want it to harden to your sink or toilet!"

      "content": "Treat like all household water waste. Just like anything else you rinse down the drain, the diluted paste will move on to a water treatment plant where it will be taken care of from there. Your work here is done!"
