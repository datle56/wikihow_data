If you have 16-bit software, like old video games you want to play, you cannot run them on a 64-bit version of Windows. To play old 16-bit games, your best bet is to use virtual machine software like VirtualBox to install an older version of Windows, ideally Windows 95 or even Windows 3.1. You can also play DOS-based games using DOSBox . If you want to install a 64-bit operating system, you will need 64-bit hardware.

A 32-bit operating system and processor can only use 4 GB of RAM, even if more RAM is installed. A 64-bit processor can handle a massive amount of RAM (many terabytes), though the actual amount of RAM that can be utilized also depends on the operating system and other hardware. For example, a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Enterprise supports up to 6 TB of RAM, while a 32-bit version of the same operating system can still only support 4 GB.
