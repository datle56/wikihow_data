      "content": "Make sure you have the necessary tools and equipment for the task. There are many different fasteners, clamps, and connections that must be removed or loosened to remove a fuel tank. Here are some: Strap bolts, usually requiring a 1 ⁄ 2 or 9 ⁄ 16 inch (1.3 or 1.4 cm) or 12, 13, or 14 mm open-end wrench. Slotted and Phillips screwdrivers for hose clamps. Special tools for disconnecting fuel line fittings. Other items you may need include a jack, jack stands, a pump for removing the fuel, fuel rated containers for fuel that is removed from the tank, rags, and a fire extinguisher in case of an emergency."

      "content": "Make sure the container you are draining the fuel into is large enough to hold it all. Most fuel tanks have a 12 to 20 gallon (45.4 to 75.7 L) capacity, so if your fuel gauge is working properly, you can estimate the amount of fuel in your tank. Get the EPA/Underwriter's Laboratory approved gas container ready below your car in a position to catch the draining fuel. Remove the drain plug if your car has one, being careful not to allow the fuel to spill on your person when it begins to drain. If your car doesn't have a drain bolt, find your tank's drainpipe or filler hose."

If it is a two or three-piece assembly, loosen the clamp and remove the neoprene hose from the filler neck. Make sure the fuel hose that goes to the top of your gas tank has enough room to drop down when the tank is lowered. These are often molded assemblies and may need to be guided while the tank is lowered to avoid obstructions and possible damage to this part. [6] X Research source"
