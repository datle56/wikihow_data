If overwatering is the issue, you may notice brown spots near the base of the leaf, spreading outward, or new leaves might have tiny reddish or brown dots. [1] X Research source How to fix it : Instead of sticking to a regular schedule, pay attention to how dry the soil feels, and only water when the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil dries out.

      "content": "Underwatering If you’re underwatering your fiddle leaf fig, you might notice light-colored spots around the leaf veins. Over time, these will turn brown. The leaves might also get a crispy texture, and you might notice the soil pulling away from the edges of the pot. [4] X Research source How to fix it : Regularly check your plant’s soil to see if it needs water. When the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of the soil feel dry, water your fiddle leaf fig thoroughly—ideally, until water drains freely from the bottom of the pot. [5] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If your fiddle leaf fig is in a container and you can’t lift it, water the soil evenly until water pools in the saucer, then remove the excess water."

      "title": "Stunted growth",
      "content": "Stunted growth If your plant's pot is too small, it may not be able to thrive. Fiddle leaf figs prefer a slightly smaller pot, but they do need to be repotted when roots start coming out of the pot’s drainage holes or up above the soil line. How to fix it : Choose a planter that’s only one size larger than the pot it’s already in. A pot that’s too small can prevent the roots from growing, but if the pot is too big, the roots could rot. Either of these can cause the leaves to turn brown. [6] X Research source Be sure to choose a pot with drainage holes. If you want to put your fiddle leaf fig in a decorative planter that doesn’t have drainage holes, place it in a plastic nursery pot, then put that inside the decorative planter. Just be sure to pull the nursery planter out of the decorative pot when it’s time to water."

      "content": "Low humidity If humidity is the issue, you’ll likely notice brown spots forming on the tips of your leaves. Fiddle leaf figs like a fairly humid environment, so it’s a good idea to use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity in the air near the plant. [7] X Research source How to fix it : Keep the humidity around 40%, although anywhere from 30–65% is probably fine, as long as it’s consistent. If the humidity is too low, mist the fiddle leaf fig about once a day, or place the pot in a large tray full of damp pebbles. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Too much direct sunlight Fiddle leaf figs like plenty of sunlight, but it should be filtered. If your fiddle leaf fig gets too much direct sun, you’ll notice the leaves that get the most light will scorch and turn brown. [11] X Research source How to fix it : If you keep your plant near a window that gets direct sunlight during the day, use a sheer curtain to soften the sunlight."

    {
      "title": "Not enough sunlight",
      "content": "Not enough sunlight If your plant isn’t getting enough light, the bottom leaves may turn brown. The large, broad leaves of the fiddle leaf fig are prone to developing a light coating of dust, which can block sunlight from reaching the leaves, which can cause the leaves to turn brown over time. [12] X Research source How to fix it : Move your plant to a sunnier spot. Rotate it weekly so all leaves get enough light. Every few weeks, use a soft, damp cloth to gently dust the leaves on your fiddle leaf fig. Don’t use any oils or polishes on the leaves, as this could damage them. Dusting the leaves regularly can also help prevent mites from infesting your plant. Low light can also cause fiddle leaf figs to get a “leggy” appearance, meaning the limbs are long and thin with sparse leaves."

      "title": "Lack of fertilizer",
      "content": "Lack of fertilizer If your plant isn’t getting enough nutrients, it could wilt and turn brown. Fiddle leaf figs can benefit from a balanced liquid fertilizer with an NPK of around 3-1-2 or 20-20-20. NPK stands for nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium—the main elements in plant fertilizer. [13] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source How to fix it : Feed your plant with fertilizer diluted to half-strength twice a month from the spring through the fall. [14] X Research source Don’t fertilize your fiddle leaf fig during the late fall and winter. It will be dormant, which means it isn’t growing and doesn’t need to be fed."

      "title": "Overfertilizing",
      "content": "Overfertilizing If you’re fertilizing too much, minerals can build up in the soil. Often, this will result in a white salt-like deposit on the soil, and you may notice the leaves browning. [15] X Research source How to fix it : If you see salt on top of your soil, pour as much fresh water as possible through the pot and allow it to drain thoroughly. If you have a very large fiddle leaf fig, you may need to add the water a little at a time, removing it from the saucer with a cup or turkey baster once it pools."

      "title": "Bacterial or fungal damage",
      "content": "Bacterial or fungal damage Your fiddle leaf fig may have a fungal or bacterial disease if you notice lighter brown spots with an irregular shape. These spots can be anywhere on the leaf without much of a pattern, and they’ll spread over time. [16] X Research source How to fix it : If there’s bacterial or fungal damage, snip off the damaged leaves and plant the fig in fresh potting mix. If more than half of the leaves have damage from disease, the plant may not be able to recover from pruning and repotting. Disease on a plant usually indicates another issue, so be sure to look for an underlying cause. For instance, if a plant is infested with aphids or mealybugs, the leaves can develop a black fungus known as sooty mold.

Bugs like these may create brown spots as well as holes in the leaves. [18] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source How to fix it : If you spot signs of any type of pest infestation, spray each leaf of the fiddle leaf fig with neem spray , coating both sides. Follow the label instructions and repeat this every two weeks until all signs of the insects are gone.

Fiddle leaf figs can often stay in the same pot for years, so in general, they should only be repotted if the roots need to be snipped, there's a bacterial or fungal infection, or the roots start to appear above the soil or through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. Choose a pot that’s only one size larger than the pot it’s currently in—the new pot should almost look too small. [26] X Research source If the roots are mushy and brown, use clean, sharp shears to trim away only the damaged part of the root before you repot.

As long as all of the other care conditions are right for the plant—like the soil moisture and lighting—give it time to recover. [27] X Research source If you re-pot a fiddle leaf fig in late summer or fall, it may take longer to recover than if you repot it in the spring or early summer."
