It is a ploy to get you to hand over your private information or get you to download a keylogger that can be used to steal your passwords. Phishing often happens via email. \"Many phishing websites and emails have long absurd email addresses, Meshesha explains, \"names that typically aren't from the company they're emailing.\" Check the domain name to make sure the sender is who they say they are.
