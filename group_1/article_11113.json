      "content": "Decide whether a superficial toe infection can be treated at home. If you don't have any of the serious symptoms, but you are in a bit of discomfort, you may be able to treat the infection at home. Like other minor injuries, it might be possible to treat the infection by cleaning the area, applying an antibiotic, and keeping the area bandaged for a few days. If this seems like the case, then go ahead with home treatment. [3] X Research source If you have cleaned the area thoroughly, applied a good antibiotic, and kept the area bandaged and clean and it is still hurting, it’s time to get it looked at by a medical professional. If the infection is mild and doesn't seem like a serious risk to your health, you can still make an appointment to get it looked at. Use your own judgement and remember that it's always better to be safe than sorry."

The doctor will pack the wound with gauze for 24-48 hours. The packing can be removed after this time and the wound is then examined and re-bandaged.
