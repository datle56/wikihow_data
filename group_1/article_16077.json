This is the key for any dribbling movement to work. If the defender knows what you're going to do, then he or she will stop you, but if you keep the defender guessing, then you're in control."

      "content": "Execute the crossover dribble. This dribble is quite effective, because it allows you to use all your momentum after an easy weight shift. [3] X Research source With your ball in your right hand, give a step towards the right with a head fake to the same direction. Lower your left shoulder to look sincere. If your defender goes all over the right, then turn your weight and bounce the ball to your left hand in front of your defender, and go all the way to the basket! If your defender doesn't go over the right, then quickly run to that direction. Try an in and out plus a crossover. Do an in and out move (carry the ball left then right in one fluid motion). Go for an exaggerated crossover to your other hand, then drive past your opponent. Rememberâ€”a crossover should always involve a quick change of direction."

      "title": "Spin.",
      "content": "Spin. This is a very smart solution when you are going fast towards the basket. [4] X Research source With the ball in your right hand, go where the defender is and dribble hard towards him or her. Stop with your left foot forward and planted. Change the ball of hand and bounce it once, making a 360-degree rotation with your left foot. Then bounce it back with your left hand, and finally go to score!"

      "content": "Use the step jump shot. This is a very effective drill when you want space for a good shoot. Dribble hard towards the defender. In the same place where you are, make some quick stutter steps as if you're about to dribble. When your defender falls with your fake, use the space to quickly rise up and shoot a jump shot!"

      "title": "Execute the change of pace dribble.",
      "content": "Execute the change of pace dribble. When you see a double-team coming, calm down, plant your front foot and straighten up slightly. Your defenders will do the same instinctively. Now that you have got them, run quickly all the way to the basket and score."

      "content": "Dribble with both hands. If you only dribble on one side, then your defender will know where are you going, but if you change the direction, then it will be harder for him or her to stop you. Therefore, try to use both hands."
