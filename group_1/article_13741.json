      "title": "Make a ponytail.",
      "content": "Make a ponytail. Pull your hair to the back of your head, then gather it in one hand just like you would for a normal ponytail. All of your hair should be in a single thick rope. It doesn't matter exactly where you wear your ponytail; you can wear it low, high or in the middle. It does help, however, if you have at least shoulder-length hair so that you have enough length to work with."

    {
      "title": "Put a twist in your hair about halfway down.",
      "content": "Put a twist in your hair about halfway down. Either use your free hand for this, or hold the ponytail down with elastics and use both hands. Grab your ponytail and wrap it around itself once to form a circle with an indent in the middle. Use an elastic to hold this in place. Standing in front of a mirror and having a friend hold a second mirror behind you can help you see what you're doing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the end of the ponytail around the twisted hair.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of the ponytail around the twisted hair. Wrap the ponytail tight around itself once more. Tuck the end of the ponytail underneath the new bun. Hold it in place with another elastic band."

    {
      "title": "Make minor adjustments as needed.",
      "content": "Make minor adjustments as needed. At this point, your bun is basically done. You can gently push it to change its position or to tuck stray hairs back in. When it's just how you like it, you're done. Be careful-fiddling with your bun too much can make it come apart."

      "title": "Make a bun doughnut from a sock you don't need.",
      "content": "Make a bun doughnut from a sock you don't need. If you have an elastic sock (or even a stocking) that you don't mind cutting up, it's not hard to make your own bun doughnut. Follow these steps: Find a (clean!) sock that has a good amount of elastic in the ankle. Ideally, it should be close to your hair color so it's hard to see. Cut the toe off of the sock. Roll from the new toe hole towards the ankle. You should get a small, bunched-up, doughnut-like piece of elastic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a ponytail.",
      "content": "Make a ponytail. This is exactly how you'd normally make a ponytail, with no special changes. Gather your hair behind or on top of your head and smooth it into a single dense rope, pulling the rest of your hair tight. Secure it with an elastic. If you just washed your hair or it's naturally a little slippery, it can be hard to get this bun to stay in place. Try using a texturizing spray to give it some hold. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slide the sock doughnut over the tip of the ponytail.",
      "content": "Slide the sock doughnut over the tip of the ponytail. Now, hold your ponytail so it's pointing straight up. Use your free hand to spread the doughnut open and pop it onto the ponytail an inch or two from the tip. Don't roll it to the base yet. If the sock doesn't quite stay on your ponytail, don't worry. It will get tighter as you roll it down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fan your hair out and tuck it into the sock.",
      "content": "Fan your hair out and tuck it into the sock. This part is a little tough. You want to take the hair at the end of your ponytail and spread it out equally in all directions. Roll the hair around the top of the sock and tuck them in underneath the roll. Move the doughnut down slightly to catch the hair. If you have hair that isn't naturally very stiff, you can hold your ponytail up and let the hair fall around the doughnut. Then, just run your hand downward over the doughnut to gather the hair and tuck it in."

    {
      "title": "Roll the sock down, gathering the hair into a doughnut.",
      "content": "Roll the sock down, gathering the hair into a doughnut. As you roll the doughnut down, it should catch the hair and start rolling it up, making a doughnut-shaped bun that gets thicker as it gets nearer to the bottom. [2] X Research source It can take a little practice to get this right, so don't get discouraged if you have to start over. It should get easier to roll near the bottom of the ponytail."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the bun in place.",
      "content": "Secure the bun in place. Once the doughnut has been rolled up to the bottom of your hair, you can hold it in place with an elastic band or scrunchie. You can also use bobby pins to hold particularly troublesome sections of hair down. It can also help to use a little hairspray to give the bun a stiffer, stronger form. [3] X Research source You can even make your own , if necessary."
