It can take months to figure out if your partnership can improve or not. In some cases, it might make sense to detach emotionally for a short period, while staying in the relationship. [1] X Research source For instance, you might detach if your relationship has soured due to a recent change in you and your partner's routine. You might both just need time to readjust. If you and your significant other are constantly at odds, or in an on-again-off-again pattern, consider detaching. When tensions die down, both of you can reach a better decision about whether or not the relationship should continue. Don't detach before you have tried seriously to fix the issues in your relationship. Detachment should only be employed if you are on the verge of breaking up. [2] X Research source"

Don't announce your plans to detach, but if asked, say that you are thinking about the relationship and focusing on yourself for a while. You may not want to use the word \"detach\" or \"disengage\" unless that is the language you and your partner already share. Instead, say you need time to focus on a project you have, on getting right with yourself, or on work.

It can be helpful to avoid pictures of your ex, and, while you are in a wounded state, it can be helpful to spend some time away from images of other people's lives as well. If you are not on good terms, you can just block or unfriend him or her. Depending on the website, you may be able to temporarily block notifications from the person without changing your status as \"friends.\" However, if you are worried about obsessively checking their material and getting bummed out, you should either shut down your account or drop them as \"friend.\""

Part of loving yourself means taking care of your needs and goals. If you have a goal that requires you to continue your education, you may need to take the necessary steps to do so regardless of whether those around you—your significant other, your parents—agree with your decision. However, be prepared to do it alone. Loving yourself also means finding your own sources of happiness. You should never completely rely on any one person to make you happy. If you feel like your partner or another person is the only source of your happiness, recognize that you need to set better boundaries."
