      "content": "Put your open hands in counting position over a desk or table. Extend both hands in front of you as if you are about to play the piano on your desk or tabletop. Your palms should be facing down, with all 10 fingers extended and your thumbs pointing toward each other. Hold your hands about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the table. You’ll count by pressing combinations of 1 or more fingertips down on the desk or table—once again, almost as if you are playing the piano."

      "content": "Count by extending fingers from closed fists as a variation. Keeping all 10 fingers extended and tapping the table is the traditional chisenbop style. However, you can also keep your hands closed and extend combinations of 1 or more fingers as you count. PLEASE NOTE: The images in this article demonstrate the closed fist method because it is easier to visualize from overhead images."

      "content": "Use symbols to reinforce your finger positioning as you learn chisenbop. This way, you can make up flash cards to test yourself, for example. You might use ^ to represent a finger off the table, * to represent a finger on the table, < or > to represent a thumb on the table, and # to represent a thumb on the table. If you symbolically represent your 2 hands and 10 fingers extended in front of you, you'll end up with strings of symbols like the following: ^^^^> <^^^^ represents all 10 fingers off the table (equaling 0) ****# #**** represents all 10 fingers touching the table (equaling 99) ^^^^> <*^^^ represents 1 (with only the right index finger down)"
