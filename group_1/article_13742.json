Start by holding the middle of the drumstick and see which way the drumstick tips. Then, move your hold up or down the drumstick until it stays even and balanced on both sides. [1] X Research source Repeat this with your other drumstick in your other hand until you find your grip on both sticks. The balancing point, also known as the Fulcrum point, is the point on your drumsticks where you can hold and get the most bounce back from your stick when it hits the drum. [2] X Research source"

Loosen your grip as much as you can while still maintaining control over the drumstick. Then, hold your hand a few inches above the edge of the drum and let the end of the drumstick drop into the middle of the drum. Count the number of times the drumstick bounces before settling onto the drum. If the balancing point and grip tightness are right, the drumstick should bounce about 6 times. [3] X Research source If the drumstick doesn’t bounce at all, you are likely holding it much too tightly. Relax your hand and loosen your grip, and then try the bounce test again.

Then, alternate dropping each drumstick onto the drum. Let your first drumstick bounce once and then, just as it finishes the bounce, drop the other drumstick on the drum. Typically, a single stroke roll pattern begins with the right drumstick bounce, then the left, then back to the right, and so on. However, you can start a single stroke roll with whatever hand you prefer. [6] X Research source Practice this until the bounces and sounds are uniform on both sides and you are able to hold your pace. [7] X Research source If you are new to playing the drums, it may take you a while to get into this rhythm. Finding your basic drum roll rhythm is primarily based on your own feeling and intuition, so don’t be discouraged if it takes you several tries."

To do this, first tap the drumstick in your right hand on the center of the drum twice. Then, immediately after the second tap, tap the left drumstick on the drum twice as well. After the left drumstick taps the drum twice, repeat this double tap on the right side, then back to the left, and so on. The basic sequence of the double stroke drum roll is RIGHT-RIGHT, LEFT-LEFT, RIGHT-RIGHT, LEFT-LEFT.

To do this, begin by striking the drum with your right drumstick and allowing it to bounce once after the initial strike. As soon as the drumstick bounces and hits the drum for the second time, strike the drum with your left drumstick and let it bounce once after the initial strike as well. [14] X Research source Repeat this right strike-right bounce, left strike-left bounce sequence slowly until you’re able to get a feel for the rhythm and get comfortable with this sequence. The “diddle” is the bounce that occurs after you initially strike the drum with the drumstick. [15] X Research source It can take some time to get a feel for the double stroke “diddle,” so be prepared to practice this for awhile before you start to get comfortable."

Once you are comfortable doing a double stroke “diddle” in the double roll alternating sequence, start to add a bit more pressure to the initial strike of each drumstick. This added pressure will make the bounces smaller and faster. While you want to apply pressure, make sure that you don’t press the stick down at a sharp angle onto the drum. [16] X Research source Instead, apply pressure while keeping the drumstick at only a slight angle, allowing the drumstick to still maintain a natural bounce."

Once you are comfortable alternating drumstick bounces between your right and left drumsticks, you can start to speed up the bounces to create a faster, more sustained “buzz” sound by adding just a bit of pressure to your initial strike, and maintaining that pressure as the drumstick bounces. To do this, press down a bit on the drumstick while keeping the drumstick at only a slight angle. Make sure that you don’t press the drumstick down at a sharp angle onto the drum, as this will decrease the amount of bounce rather than speed it up. [21] X Research source To help you understand how applying pressure will work to create a faster “buzz,” imagine that your drumstick is a ping pong ball. If you drop the ball onto the drum, it bounces several times, getting lower with each bounce. Now, imagine that you drop the ball and immediately hold a paddle over it. The ball will bounce faster because the paddle prevents it from reaching its full height, and the bounces will be consistent. [22] X Research source Applying just a bit of pressure on your drumstick works as the paddle does, creating a faster, sustained “buzz” sound."

Practice at each speed until you notice the natural flow and rhythm that’s produced from seamlessly overlapping each buzz stroke. When you execute a successful buzz roll, the drum will sound like it is making a single buzz note, versus a series of separate strokes. [23] X Research source Part of a successful buzz roll lies in how well you can overlap each successive buzz. [24] X Research source Therefore, you’ll need to practice to gradually build up your speed until the beginning of each new buzz comes at the tail of the previous one."
