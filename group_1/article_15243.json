      "title": "Use lemon juice.",
      "content": "Use lemon juice. It is best if you used fresh squeezed, but organic lemon juice in a bottle will also work. [1] X Research source The amount of lemon juice you need will depend on how long your hair is, how thick it is, and whether you want to use it all over your hair, or just on sections. If you have very long hair and you want to lighten all of your hair, you will probably need at least 2 cups of lemon juice. If you have shorter hair, or you just want to lighten a couple of small sections, you might be able to get by with a 1/2 cup of lemon juice. You can potentially also use non-organic lemon juice, but this should be a last resort as you won’t know what toxins and/or pesticides might be present in the juice. These may be trace amounts, but they still aren’t good for you."

    {
      "title": "Mix the lemon juice with water.",
      "content": "Mix the lemon juice with water. Mix two parts lemon juice with one part water in a spray bottle. [2] X Research source How much a part is depends on how much you want to make, it is not an exact measurement, but rather a ratio. In this case, if you were to use 2 cups of lemon juice, you would use one cup of water. If you used 1 cup of lemon juice as a part, you would use only a half a cup of water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray the mix into your hair.",
      "content": "Spray the mix into your hair. If you want to lighten all of your hair, then spray the mixture all over, until your hair is completely covered in the juice. Use a wooden or plastic comb to help spread the mixture evenly through your hair. Be careful not to get it in your eyes, as this will burn!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate your hair into sections.",
      "content": "Separate your hair into sections. If you only want to lighten certain parts of your hair, you can separate those sections, and apply the lemon juice directly to this part of your hair. Dip your fingers in the mixture and then disperse the mixture throughout the hair you wish to lighten. Alternatively, you can dip a cotton ball or pad into the mixture, grab the sections of hair you want to lighten and run the cotton ball down the shaft. If your hair is long enough, you could also try dipping it directly into a bowl of the mixture, and then applying it to the roots using your fingers. Avoid using a spray bottle if you only wish to lighten parts of your hair; it will most likely cause the mixture to coat more than the hair you intend to lighten."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use heat to activate the lemon juice in your hair.",
      "content": "Use heat to activate the lemon juice in your hair. This method will work best if you then apply heat to your hair, and will work even better if you can spend some time in the sun. If it is very sunny and warm outside, then your best option is to go outside for a few hours. The sunlight, in combination with heat, will lighten your hair. Make sure to apply sunscreen to your face, and any other areas where your skin will be exposed! If you don’t have access to the sun, another option is to use a blow dryer. Turn the dryer on the highest setting, and dry your hair thoroughly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat.",
      "content": "Repeat. You can repeat this process as often as necessary to achieve the desired result; however, be aware that the lemon juice is acidic, and will dry out your hair with frequent use. Understand that you may not see results the first time you do this, especially if you have very dark hair. Consider using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, or a deep conditioning hair treatment to keep your hair healthy by restoring moisture back into it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tone down brassiness, if necessary.",
      "content": "Tone down brassiness, if necessary. If you use the lemon juice method to lighten your hair, you may end up with “brassiness” in your hair, meaning it appears more orangey than blonde. If this happens, you can use tomato paste or tomato sauce to help combat this problem. Make sure the tomato paste or sauce only contains tomatoes and water. Apply the tomato sauce on your hair so that it is evenly spread throughout your hair. Wrap your head in aluminium foil. Leave in for 20-25 minutes. Rinse thoroughly. Repeat daily until all of the brassiness is gone. Finish with a regular shampoo and conditioner to remove the tomato smell from your hair."

      "title": "Thoroughly combine the ingredients in a bowl.",
      "content": "Thoroughly combine the ingredients in a bowl. You will need to mix the ingredients thoroughly, so consider using a whisk or a fork to make sure the ingredients are well-incorporated. This method requires more ingredients, but may work better together than they would on their own. [3] X Research source Raw honey is best because it is the least processed, meaning it will not behave differently than expected because of anything that might have been done to it or added to it before you bought it. [4] X Research source You can usually find raw honey at your local health food store. The necessary ingredients include: 2 cups of distilled vinegar. [5] X Research source 1 cup of raw honey. [6] X Research source 1 tablespoon of olive oil. [7] X Research source 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon or ground cardamom. [8] X Research source There is no difference between the two in terms of end result, so just use whichever you have on hand, or whichever you will be able to keep for different uses."

      "content": "Apply mixture to hair. You should apply this mixture to damp hair. You can do this either using a comb, to make sure that it completely covers your hair, or with your hands. [9] X Research source You don’t necessarily need to shower to get your hair wet, you can also just spritz your hair with a spray bottle filled with water, or you can wet just your hair in the sink. If you only want to apply it to a section or your hair, separate that section, and apply it with your fingers, with an applicator brush, or by dipping the section directly into the mixture."

      "title": "Apply plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Apply plastic wrap. Wrap the plastic wrap around your head so that it is tight enough to stay in place, but not so tight that it will give you a headache. [10] X Research source You can also use a plastic bag, which you can tie in place, or use a headband to hold in place. If you have a shower cap, you can also use that. A silicon swim cap might also work well."

      "title": "Leave on overnight.",
      "content": "Leave on overnight. This mixture does not require sunlight, but instead, just needs time to work. Therefore, you should leave it on while you sleep. [11] X Research source Rinse the mixture out of your hair thoroughly in the morning, using whatever you use to wash your hair."

      "title": "Brew the tea.",
      "content": "Brew the tea. The tea needs to be strong, so consider using two bags. Brew enough tea so that you will be able to rinse your hair completely with the tea. [12] X Research source The amount will depend on the length of your hair. If you have very short hair, a large cupful may be enough. If you have very long hair, you may need a pitcher of tea. Fortunately, tea is cheap and easy to make, so if you need more, you can always make some extra. Make sure that you wait for the tea to cool before applying it to your hair! It can still be warm, but make sure it won’t burn your skin."

      "content": "Spend some time in the sun. If you can, after applying the tea to your hair, go out into the sun, and let the sun dry your hair. This will speed the lightening process. [16] X Research source As an alternative to completely drenching your hair in the tea, you could make the tea, put it in a spray bottle, and spritz onto your hair before going in the sun each day. [17] X Research source Remember to use sun screen each day on the parts of your skin that will be exposed."

If you have very dark hair, be patient! Eventually your hair will lighten, but understand that it is unlikely that your hair will ever be platinum blonde without using bleach or some other chemical treatment."
