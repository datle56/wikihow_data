      "content": "Dress as a \"traditional\" zombie. If you want to embody the classical zombie type, go traditional. Be a walking, shuffling zombie who is slow and dumb with dead eyes. No specific type of clothing is needed for this type. Use whatever’s on hand, such as old jeans and t-shirts."

      "content": "Make a special zombie. Maybe you want to go for a zombie with a special theme, such as zombie princess or ballerina who’s been zombified? Go for a cute identity that’s gone terribly, terribly wrong. If you want to be extra realistic, use stage blood. [1] X Research source This might be where last year’s costume comes in handy. You could zombify it so long as you don’t mind destroying it in the process. You can also just be an interesting zombie, making a twist on other clothing. Zombies may have been a cheerleader, a pizza delivery guy, or had been on the way to prom."

      "title": "Create a couple or group theme.",
      "content": "Create a couple or group theme. It can be fun to have a couple, family or group of friends dress as zombies. Some costume competitions have this as a category. Be a zombie pair, such as a zombie wedding couple or maybe a famous couple from history who’ve come back from the dead. Be a zombie family! Mom, dad, sister and brother can all have fun as undead. [2] X Research source Hit up a used clothing store to look for wedding apparel."

      "content": "Make an undead version of a familiar character. Have a favorite superhero? Nursery rhyme character? Disney character? Choose a character and turn them into a zombie! Make sure you’ve got a costume on hand that’ll identify you as your character. You could always do something recognizable, such as simple, reworked Little Red Riding Hood costume. This is a great tactic if your costume is worn, or in bad condition. Since you will likely be fatiguing or distressing your costume (see below) it is better to work with items in less than new condition. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Fade and/or dingy your clothing.",
      "content": "Fade and/or dingy your clothing. Seasoned zombies don’t wear brand new clothes, so you’ve got to make your clothing look old to be authentic. There are a few ways to do this with common household items. Use a spritz bottle filled with water and a few drops of brown or black food coloring, coffee, or black tea to make your clothes look old. This works best on lighter colors to make clothing seem dingy, dirty, and worn. [4] X Research source Spritz your clothing unevenly to make it look more realistically aged. Use a 1:1 bleach solution to \"fade\" clothing. Zombies stand out in the sun, so clothes fade and look old. This is a good approach to make darker colored clothes look worn out."

      "title": "Tatter your clothes by ripping and tearing them up.",
      "content": "Tatter your clothes by ripping and tearing them up. Zombies stumble around catching themselves on things, so to make it realistic tear up those clothes. Add some tears into your clothing with a seam ripper or knife or running a grater over areas. Don’t be afraid to also use your hands to tear at some small cuts. To make your tears look realistic, cut in random areas and vary the size of the cuts and the amount of fraying. Remember that your clothing will need to stay on your body, so don’t get too carried away with the ripping and tearing! Keep the tears PG-13"

Add mold to your clothes by mixing up some liquid latex and oatmeal and letting it dry on your clothing. [5] X Research source If you’ve got time in advance you could always bury your clothing outside for a week. You can find liquid latex at any costume store, a basic superstore, or online."

      "content": "Add blood to your clothes. Zombies are all about blood and gore, so add some to your clothing to help add to the effect. Use store bought blood or make your own, and then spatter it all over your clothing using your own hands and sponges. Make sure to step away from your clothing to see how it looks at a distance. An easy do-it-yourself recipe for fake blood is combining corn syrup with a few drops of red food coloring. Then add a squirt of chocolate syrup to thicken and darken the blood.

      "content": "Singe and sear your non-flammable clothes very carefully. Using extreme caution, take a lighter to your clothing to singe or burn parts of it to achieve that zombified look. Do not burn your clothes while they are still on your body. You should always do this in an open area away from flammable surfaces and have a fire extinguisher nearby."

      "content": "Make wrinkles using liquid latex. Apply liquid latex on your face in a light layer using a sponge, and then stretch your skin tight while drying the liquid latex with a hairdryer. This’ll be sure to make your face look old and tired. [7] X Research source Do this before you put on your face makeup so when you apply makeup the wrinkles will appear deeper. If you’ve got a latex allergy, you can easily make your own liquid latex substitute. Mix together 1 cup (236.59 mL) cold water, ¼ cup (59.15 mL) tapioca flour, 1 packet plain gelatin, and 1 tablespoon (14.79 mL) of solid coconut oil. [8] X Research source"

This’ll give you the perfect dead looking tongue and mouth. You can stain your teeth with black or blue food colouring to give off a feeling that your teeth are rotting. You many add a few fake worms too, for extra detail. [9] X Research source"

If your liquid latex wound is going to cover any hair, add a layer of petroleum jelly first.

Use hairspray to make sure your teased hair stays in place. Put conditioner in it while dry to make it look greasy and gross. [13] X Research source You can find colored hairsprays if you want to add some darker black or brown tones into your lighter hair. You can purchase these at any local pharmacy. Get creative and incorporate leaves or twigs into your matted hair. If you don't want your hair to be ruined or deal with combing it out later, get a cheap wig that you can destroy."
