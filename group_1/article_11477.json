      "content": "Step side to side to do a step touch. A step touch is a popular beginner reggaeton dance move. Step out wide to the side with just 1 foot and then bring your second foot to touch the ground next to your first foot. Try to bounce a little on the spot as you step. Then step to the other side and repeat the movement. [1] X Research source You can use your arms while you’re doing a step touch too! Bend your elbows and spin your forearms around in small circles in front of your chest. Alternatively, you can take steps that are further apart so that you squat slightly."

      "content": "Jump and bounce your shoulders to do a shoulder pop. Start with your feet together and your hands on your hips. Then jump out so that your feet are wider apart than your shoulders. Bend your knees and your elbows, and then shift your weight from leg to leg. As you shift your weight to each leg, bring that arm up and bend the other arm down slightly. Move each shoulder up and down as you transfer your weight from leg to leg. [2] X Research source As you’re doing shoulder pops, you can also bring your hands to just in front of your chest and rotate them in circles to make this move more lively."

      "content": "Do alternating heel digs to perform a heel tap. Stand with your hands on your hips and your feet together. Extend 1 leg straight out in front of you and keep just your heel on the ground. Then bring your leg back to the starting position and swap to the other leg. Do another heel dig with your first leg again and then quickly draw that knee up to your hips and back down. Repeat this sequence to perform a heel tap! [3] X Research source You can use your arms while you’re doing a heel tap too. Swing your arm out in front of you that is opposite to the leg you’ve extended and then return your arm back to your side as you bring your feet together again. You can also use your arms to pretend to pull up your knee as you draw it towards your body. Do this move fast and try to roll your body in time with the heel digs."

      "content": "Roll downwards through your chest, ribs, and hips to do a body wave. Stand with your feet just further apart from your shoulders and angle your upper body slightly to one side from your hips.

Gradually bring your chest and sternum back as you push out your ribs and hips in a rolling, wave-like formation. [4] X Research source A body wave is an easy and flirty reggaeton move for beginners! When you have pushed your hips out in front of you, start from the top again at your chest and continue to roll your torso like a wave."

      "content": "Bend down slightly and dip your knees to the beat to get low. Stand with your feet slightly further apart than your shoulders and bend your knees. Angle your right knee in towards the center and then back out to the original position. Repeat this movement with your left leg. Then do this twice with each leg again, at double the speed. Try to roll your hips out as you move your legs so that your hip movements are exaggerated. [5] X Research source You can also use your arms to make this move even more flirtatious! Girls can click their fingers and swing their arms slightly above their head to the beat of the music. Guys can clap their hands and bounce their shoulders as they move. [6] X Research source This is not only a great dance move for a club, but it’s also a good leg workout!"

Swing your hips back and then forth towards 1 of your legs. As you swing your hips, bend your elbows and swing your arms back and forth from your body, alternating with your hip movements. Then draw your hips in a circular motion behind you, beginning from the side that you were swinging your hips over towards the other side. [7] X Research source Try to click your fingers to the beat of the music while you do lower body isolations. Alternatively, you can move your hips in front of you in a circular motion rather than behind you."

      "content": "Hold your partner and keep stepping out and in to do a fast, double-count move. Stand behind your partner with you both facing in the same direction. The person who is standing behind needs to wrap their arm around the waist of the person who is standing in front. Keep your right legs together but extend your left legs out to the side and then quickly back in to the beat of the music. Repeat this along to the song and make sure that you both move your legs at the same time. [9] X Research source This move is best done fast at a double-count speed to the music. The guy usually stands behind with the girl in front. While performing this move, the person in front can twirl their hands above their head or run their fingers through their hair to make it even more sensual."

      "content": "Do lower body isolations with somebody else for an easy partner move. Stand facing your partner with the right sides of your bodies close together. Use 1 arm to place around each other’s shoulders and your other arm to hold hands. Push your hips back and forth in the same direction, moving together in time to the beat. Then swing your hips around together in a circle, just like a regular lower body isolation, making sure that your hips are staying close together at all times. [10] X Research source Then repeat the move but push your hips back and forth in the other direction instead. This move is easiest to do if you keep your hips close together as you dance but your upper bodies titled outward slightly so that each person has room to move. It can be helpful for both partners to click their fingers as they dance to make it easier to stay in time."
