To do so, focusing on keeping your belly button \"in\" (towards your spine) and flexing your abdominal muscles as you work-out. Whenever you are doing and ab workout, think about having a strong core -- moving fluidly from your core in a straight line, no matter what your exercise. Think of you body like an engine piston, making the same steady motion each time."

      "title": "Do sit-ups.",
      "content": "Do sit-ups. The most famous ab workouts are sit-ups, and for a reason -- they work your abs directly. For sit-ups, lie down with your feet on the floor, knees up, and hands crossed on your chest. Sit all the way up, bringing your shoulders to your knees while keeping your back straight. Lower yourself down slowly, with control, and repeat 20 times. Once these become easy, hold onto weights or a resistance band to make them harder. While it is popular, do not have someone hold your feet down -- this works your hip muscles more than your abs."

You can find time to do ab workouts throughout your day to make sculpting your abs a part of your daily life. Perform 20 sit-ups, 20 push-ups, and 2 minutes of planks during commercial breaks on TV. Take a break from the computer and do 20 crunches every hour during work. Perform 10-15 minutes of simple exercises right when you wake up in the morning, or before bed. Take the stairs, run to work, or bike to the store whenever possible."

      "content": "Train your whole body. Your abs sit at a crucial place in your muscular system, helping transfer energy and motion from you upper body to your hips and legs. As such, it is hard to get great abs without working out the rest of you body as well. This doesn't mean you need to go to the gym every day, though this will help. You can also perform body-weight exercises at home. All of these exercises utilize your core, though it is not the principle muscle. Push-ups: Place your toes and both hands (shoulder length apart) on the floor. Focus on keeping your spine straight as you lower yourself to the ground so your nose is roughly 6 inches (15 cm) from the floor. Slowly push back up to your starting position. Aim for 20 reps. (Biceps, Triceps, Pecs) Pull-up: Grip a horizontal bar with both hands so your palms face towards you body. Using your arms, pull your chin above the bar and slowly lower yourself down. Aim for 5-10 reps. (Biceps, Triceps, Deltoids) Wall Sits: Sit as if you were in a chair with your back against the wall. Your legs will form a right angle at the knee and you back should stay straight against the wall. Hold for one minute at a time. (Quads, glutes). Squats: With your feet shoulder length apart, slowly lower your butt to the floor. Try to keep your knees directly in line with your ankles, not leaning over them. Slowly return to standing position. This exercise is great with weights as well. Aim for 15-20 reps. (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes)."

It can be running, swimming, biking, dancing, or playing pick-up soccer with some friends. Aim for 3-4 hours of cardio a week, at minimum, to start seeing your stomach flatten. Interval training is a workout that requires short bursts of vigorous activity followed by longer periods of low activity, like jogging around a track and sprinting every 4th lap. Researchers believe that interval training helps burn fat four times faster than exercising at the same intensity for longer times. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Eat small, healthy meals. Fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and a little protein are all that a good diet requires. Try to eat smaller meals, eating more frequently if you need, as this keeps you from eating too many calories at once and feeling bloated. Substitute baked potatoes for a side salad. Eat yogurt and granola in the morning instead of eggs and cheese. Cut back on red meat and eat chicken or turkey instead. Plan small snacks like fruit and vegetables to keep from hungrily over-eating during a meal. Eat slowly -- it takes 20 minutes for you to feel \"full,\" but if you eat quickly you'll continue eating food until this point."

While they may taste good, donuts, cake, and soda will eliminate any gains you've made by working out and prolong your goal of great abs. Some foods to avoid include: Refined carbohydrates , such as white bread, pasta, and rice. Processed Sugars, found in sweetened juices, soda, and candy, are absorbed quickly into the bloodstream but brings your metabolism to a crawl. Saturated Fats , found in fried food, fatty red meat, and most fast-food. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Balance your exercise and diet to lose more calories than you eat. The formula for losing weight is easy-- you need to burn more calories than you eat. This is why exercise and limiting fatty foods is so important. Running two miles can eliminate 250 calories, but eating one slice of cake might add 350 more. There are 3,500 calories in a pound of fat, so you can use this number to plan your diet: eliminate 500 extra calories a day and you can lose a pound of fat a week. [5] X Research source If you maintain similar diet each day, simply adding 30 minutes of daily exercise will burn away calories and flatten your stomach over time. Similarly, switching from a high-calorie breakfast like bacon and eggs to sometime like yogurt and granola will decrease you \"net calorie\" use significantly. Use a fitness tracker, like Nike Fit, Fitbit, or MapMyRun to monitor how many calories you burn when you exercise."
