With this feature, plug in your flight number to find out if your flight is on time or delayed. Or, use a friend or loved one’s flight number to track the progress of their flight as they travel. Note: You don’t necessarily need your flight number to check-in for a flight 24 hours before departure. For example, American Airlines requires your ticket number for check-in , which is on your confirmation receipt, corresponding credit card statement, or airport receipt. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Go over your airline’s luggage requirements ahead of time. Airlines typically divide luggage into 3 categories: checked luggage, carry-on items, and personal items. Visit your airline’s website to see what the requirements are for your luggage’s dimensions (height/depth/width) and weight before you start packing so you don’t end up getting charged extra. [5] X Research source Checked luggage typically includes larger suitcases (or other large items) that go in the plane’s cargo area, while carry-on and personal items can be carried onto the plane (with carry-on items often going in the overhead bins). Some airlines may waive certain luggage fees, while other airlines (like low-cost airlines) charge extra for most types of luggage you bring on the plane. Check your airline or government website (like TSA ) to confirm what you can and can’t pack on an aircraft."
