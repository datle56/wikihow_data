      "content": "Make your friends laugh with a goofy message. Who says voicemail messages have to be serious? We sure don’t! Let your voicemail greeting reflect your silly side with messages like these: “Hi, this is [your name]. If you’re part of the problem, hang up. If you’re part of the solution, leave a message.” “Hey!...Ha, gotcha! Now leave a voicemail.” “Hello?...Hello?...” “Hey! I’m probably home, but I’m avoiding someone I don’t like. Leave a message, and if I don’t call you back, I’m avoiding you.” “This is you-know-who at you-know-where. Leave your you-know-what you-know-when.” “[Your name]’s voicemail is broken. This is their refrigerator. Please speak slowly, and I’ll try to convey the message.” “You know what I hate about voicemails? They go on and on, wasting your time with silly information! Like, I know who I called. That’s why I called you. I don’t care why you’re not available. Just let me leave a message after the beep, and I’ll go about my day.” “Voicemail. Speak.” “Hello? Can you hear me?” “Hi…Now, you say something.” “This is [your name]. You know the drill.” “You’ve reached [your name]’s voicemail. If you’re hot, leave a message. If you’re not, don’t even bother.” “I’ll answer you next time if you give me $100.” “Howdy! It’s [your name]! Want to hear a joke? Knock, knock? Who’s there? Not me! So, leave a message after the tone.” “If you’re hearing this, I probably don’t want to talk to you. Or I’m in the bathroom. Or I’m climbing Mount Everest. I’ll let you decide.” “No one answers phone calls. Who do you think I am? Send a text.” “Please leave a message after the tone. Emergency response vehicles are currently being dispatched to your area. Thank you.”"

Beep! Welp, you failed.” “So, I can’t come to the phone right now. But if you hop 3 times, spin around in a circle, and boop your nose, I may just appear.” “Hello. You are talking to a machine. I am capable of receiving answers. Leave your name, number, and information, and I will ensure my all-mighty master gets in touch.” “Hey, I just missed you! Hope you’re not crazy, so leave your name, and I’ll call you maybe.” “Hey! Wait, can you repeat that…I still can’t hear you. Hello? Well, I guess you’ll just have to leave a message.” “The number you’ve reached is currently not in service.” “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used by me to return your call.” “This number is down and being monitored by the FBI. Thanks for calling. We have your name and address, so don’t bother leaving a message.” “Hello? Oh, good. I was hoping you’d call. Wait, I’m kind of in the middle of something. Can I call you back? Thanks. Just leave a brief message after the tone. “The number you dialed is imaginary. Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again.”"

      "content": "Speak with a tone appropriate to the setting. Before you make a personalized voicemail greeting , it’s important to know who you’re talking to. If you’re creating a message for your personal phone that only friends and family call, getting a little silly won’t hurt.

If you’re worried about what someone will think when they hear your voicemail, it might not be the best message to pick."
