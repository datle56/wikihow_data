      "content": "Cut down on your sedentary activities. Almost everyone has at least one sedentary pleasure, be it binge-watching favorite television shows, playing video games, or surfing the internet on your laptop. Not only do these activities often require you to sit or lay prone as you do them, they have also been shown to cause problems with self-esteem and anxiety in children and teenagers. [1] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source Getting active doesn’t mean you have to quit all of these enjoyable hobbies, though: you can simply reduce the time you dedicate to these activities rather than cutting them out all together. For example, limit your daily television to 2 hours. You can give yourself more time as long as you’re doing something active while at it, such as jogging on the treadmill. If you spend too much time online, install a program that blocks problem sites and increases productivity, such as Freedom, Anti Social, and StayFocused. [2] X Research source You can also give yourself time limits for surfing the web or playing video games. Just make sure that you stick with them."

      "content": "Stop mindless snacking. There's nothing wrong with snacking on popcorn while watching a movie, but if you do it too often, then it does become a problem. If you suspect that you might be snacking too much, make a diet plan where you allow yourself 1 or 2 snacks per day. [3] X Research source Choose healthier snacks such as popcorn made without a lot of oil, salt, or butter, or fruits or veggies and a low-calorie dip. Salty and sweet junk foods like chips and soda are particularly addictive, so you might want to keep them out of the house altogether. Ask your parents to stop buying unhealthy snacks, especially if they don't eat them themselves. Alternatively, you can ask your family to hide unhealthy snacks from you."

      "content": "Quit lazy behaviors. Modern society often encourages lazy behaviors in ways one doesn’t even realize, such as offering escalators in malls, making automotive vehicles the default mode of transport in daily life, and emphasizing convenience through mobile applications, delivery services, and virtual socializing. You can opt out of lots of these behaviors, though, by substituting them with active pursuits. Walk whenever possible. If the grocery store is just down the block, there's no reason to take the car, especially if it is nice outside.

      "content": "Socialize on the move. Your go-to activity when meeting up with friends might be sharing some apps at the local diner or gabbing on the couch, but you don’t have to limit your social hour to sedentary activities. Next time you’ve set a date to catch up with your pals, go to a nature trail or neighborhood path and take a walk together rather than slouching on the sofa, or play an active video game like WiiFit instead of your usual fare.

      "content": "Quit smoking if you are a smoker. Smoking can cause lots of health problems and it can also affect your ability to be physically active. For example, you might find vigorous cardiovascular activities like running, swimming, and dancing are much harder if you are a smoker. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about how to quit. There may be smoking cessation programs in your area that can help."

      "title": "Create an exercise plan.",
      "content": "Create an exercise plan. Regular, well-rounded exercise will benefit you more than sporadic workouts which include only one type of exercise like weight-lifting or running. You should incorporate both aerobic exercise—any activity that uses large muscle groups and can be sustained for at least ten minutes—and strength-conditioning—resistance-based activities which strengthen your muscles through repetition—into your fitness regimen, with aerobic activities taking up more time than strength-training. You can make sure you perform the recommended balance of activities by establishing a workout calendar. Make sure you plan your workouts around other, mandatory aspects of your life such as school, work, and family. While fitness is important, it’s only one pillar of your life and shouldn’t cause you to sacrifice other things. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Work your arms, legs, and core during strength training. Many people make the mistake of doing weight-lifting and other strengthening exercises which only address one part of their body: they’ll do a bunch of arm reps, for example, but ignore their core and legs. Avoid this mistake by making sure you do a mixture of exercises which address all three main muscle groups. In order to strengthen your core, do exercises such as sit ups , plank exercises, and crunches . These will strengthen and tone your abdominal and back muscles. For your legs, you should do things like squats , vertical jumps, and wall sits . Good arm exercises include pushups , pullups , and lifting dumbbells."

      "content": "Join a school or community sports team. If you have a difficult time getting and staying motivated during individual workouts, consider joining a sports team. Sports are a fun way to get aerobic exercise and strength training while building strong relationships with other teammates, learning time management, and developing a sense of personal responsibility. [9] X Research source If you don’t know what sports to try, check out the offerings at your local YMCA and school groups. Try out several sports, then continue the ones you enjoy."

You can also sign up for classes which teach you a physical activity, such as ballet, yoga, and modern dance are all great examples. See if there’s a yoga or dance studio in your area and then ask your parents if you can afford the monthly fees. Communities often have lower-cost options at local schools, rec departments, gyms, YMCAs, or community centers. If you’re interested in yoga, register for a beginner’s class where they’ll provide sufficient instruction. If you try moves that are outside for your level, you can hurt yourself.

Try to be a bit picky about your proteins, though: go for lean and unprocessed meats such as lean steak and chicken breast rather than regular grade ground beef (containing 75-85% fat), bacon, and sausages. If you’re a vegetarian, you can still get your daily intake of protein through foods such as nuts, beans, and eggs."

Recent studies have shown that emphasizing calorie-counting does little to enhance a healthy diet and can lead to disordered eating habits. After all, if you’re just trying to stay under a prescribed calorie mark, it won’t matter if the foods you eat are largely homogenous and supply minimal nutrition, as long as you duck under your 1,200- or 1,500-calorie goal. Instead, prioritize eating three nutritious, well-rounded meals with high-quality ingredients while keeping non-fruit or veggie snacking to a minimum.
