      "content": "Ease the transition by distracting yourself. Moving into a dorm takes a lot of work and you can really make a difference by helping your sibling with the moving process. Unload boxes, help them set up their stuff, and decorate the space with them. Plus, by keeping yourself busy, you won’t have time to feel sad or upset. [1] X Research source It’s also important to be respectful of your sibling’s wishes. If they want to do something on their own, don’t try to force your way in."

      "content": "Plan a fun summer or Christmas break. While you may not be able to see your sibling every day or every weekend, they’ll have breaks and vacations throughout the year where they can come back home. Think about fun things you can do together and make plans with your sibling for when they do visit home. [2] X Research source For instance, you can find out what movies are coming out in the winter so you can make plans to go to the theaters with your sibling when they visit home for Christmas break."

      "content": "Harness the power of modern technology. Staying in touch can get tricky when your sibling moves out for college. You have your life at home and school, and your sibling is getting adjusted to their new life at college. One simple solution is to schedule a time for you to call your sibling so both you and they can plan around it. [3] X Research source For example, you could set Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. as a regular weekly call with your sibling. You aren’t limited to just calls and texts! You can use apps or programs such as Skype, Zoom, or FaceTime to video call your sibling and see them when you talk to them. [4] X Research source Texts are super easy to send and you won’t really disturb or disrupt their day. Send them a funny meme that you think they’ll like. Tell them about something crazy that happened to you. Stay connected through short messages that let them know you’re thinking of them. [5] X Research source"

Frame the photos and hang them up in your room so you can see their face every day. [6] X Research source You could also use a digital photo frame, which cycles through multiple photos that you upload to it."

You can talk about how much you love and miss your sibling and it may make you feel better. [7] X Research source If you’re feeling really depressed and sad, talk to a therapist or counselor. They can give you tools that can help you cope with your feelings."

      "content": "Surprise them with a little treat from home. Who doesn’t love getting a surprise gift? Find some local goodies that you know they’ll love as well as some of their favorite treats. Package them up and ship them to your sibling’s college address. Don’t tell them a package is coming so they’ll be extra surprised when they open it. [8] X Research source For instance, if your hometown is famous for its strawberry jam or your sibling enjoys a special brand of coffee, you could send it to them to brighten their day and let them know you’re thinking of them."
