Use the same method as you would to tell if an avocado or pear is ripe. Lawson says, “It should be soft but not mushy.” If you touch the mango and it remains firm, Dulaney suggests the following: “You should definitely store it in a dark, cool place, preferably a paper bag. It will help ripen them up.” If you eat an unripe mango, the texture will be hard and the taste bitter. You don't want to waste a good mango— especially as they can be expensive."

The mango should be clean even if you plan on peeling the skin. If you’re planning to slice up or use a bunch of mangoes, wash them all in a big bowl filled with water.

      "title": "Peel off the skin.",
      "content": "Peel off the skin. Lawson believes the most efficient way to slice a mango is to “peel [the skin] and cut parallel to the large seed inside.” One easy way to peel a mango is by using a vegetable peeler — the same one you’d use to peel a potato or carrot. Secure a firm grip on your mango and then use the peeler lengthwise, peeling from top to bottom until the mango is stripped of its entire outer layer. Alternatively: peel the skin from a mango like you would a banana. Make a small cut at the top. Next, peel off the skin, eat a portion of fruit separated from the skin, and continue to peel and rotate as you eat your way down the mango. Another option: use the side of a large-mouthed glass cup. Slice the mango in half. Then, press the halved mango against the rim of the glass to help separate the skin from the mango. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the peeled mango into halves or thirds.",
      "content": "Cut the peeled mango into halves or thirds. Once your mango is peeled, set it on your cutting board and cut lengthwise or vertically. When you cut the mango , avoid the large pit in the middle, which is in the shape of a large almond. The pit is hard to cut through, which is how you’ll know when your knife has hit it. With a pairing knife , slice two halves away from the center pit, and then slice around the pit to make sure you carve out all of that luscious mango flesh. If you choose not to peel off the skin, you can pick up the sliced wedges by the skin and eat them at this point. You can try to eat some of the loose skin around the pit, but don't eat the skin too close to the pit because it can be stubborn and will get stuck in your teeth. After slicing, you can cube the pieces of mango with a knife and eat them that way. Or you can use a spoon to scoop out the mango flesh."

      "content": "Make vertical cuts in a checkered pattern and pull off the chunks. After your mango is cut into large pieces, cut each of the pieces vertically. Then, make horizontal cuts to create a checkered pattern. Do this carefully, so you don’t cut through the skin. Grasp the skin on the back of the half and push it forward so the cubed chunks pop out. [3] X Research source This should make the piece of mango look like a flower or a hedgehog, which is why it’s sometimes referred to as the hedgehog method. Pull out the mango chunks. If they don't come off, use a knife to slice them off into a bowl or a spoon to scrape them off. Storage tips: Mango is best enjoyed fresh, but if you want to save some of it for later, store it in Tupperware in the fridge. [4] X Research source Mango stored in the fridge usually lasts 5-7 days, and frozen mango can last up to 6 months. Dulaney also suggests only slicing up the half of the mango that you’re planning to eat part of it. Then, wrap the other half tightly with plastic or Saran wrap for optimal storage in the fridge."

However, the skin of a mango is chewy and bitter, unlike that of its cousins, and therefore not particularly enjoyable to eat. Still, mango skin is nutritious, rich in fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins, and it can be served in other unique ways that help tame its harsh taste, like in smoothies or teas. [14] X Research source Mangoes are also related to poison ivy and poison oak, and mango skins contain the same irritating, hive-inducing chemical called urushiol. If you have had a brush with poison ivy or poison oak and have a known allergic reaction to them, don’t consume any mango skin. If possible, try not to even touch it too much!"
