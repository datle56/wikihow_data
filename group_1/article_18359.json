      "content": "Get extra laughs from the crowd by dancing and acting out the lyrics. So, you’re hopping on stage just to make your friends giggle or impress your crush with your comedic skills, huh? Well, if you really want to put on a silly show, here are a few tips for the best funny performance: Dance. A choreographed number thrown into the middle of your song is a great way to capture the crowd! Plus, you get bonus points for being extra silly with awkward twists, turns, and hand movements. Act out the lyrics. Don’t be afraid to be overdramatic! Be melodramatic with a sad song, or give a bad impression of the original artist. Have a costume change. If you’re planning ahead, consider switching outfits or changing up your wardrobe mid-performance. Revealing a sparkling jumpsuit underneath your business getup will be a crowd stopper! Use props. The microphone isn’t the only thing you have to work with. Grab a glass from the bar, borrow a friend’s hat, or bring a feathery boa from home to amp up your performance. Work with the space. Own the space you have to perform in. If allowed, walk on a table or move closer to the audience. Don’t be afraid to strut across that stage!"
