      "title": "Beware of unsolicited requests for wire transfers.",
      "content": "Beware of unsolicited requests for wire transfers. Wire transfers, Zelle, and other instant payment methods are preferred by scammers because they're difficult to reverse. Many scammers have successfully lured unsuspecting people out of thousands of dollars by pretending to be Wells Fargo, the IRS, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, the IRS, the FBI, and other reputable organizations. If you receive a call or email from somebody asking you to wire them money, it's likely a scam—even if the person claims to be from a government agency. If you wire money to a scammer thinking it's a trustworthy company, you likely won't get that money back. Instead of talking to the person who calls or emails you, hang up (or ignore the email) and contact the company or agency's fraud line directly. If the scammer emailed you, don't call the phone number listed in the email—go to the agency's actual website to find the real phone number. If somebody claiming to be Wells Fargo asks you to wire money, call 1-866-867-5568 to report the call. Wells Fargo will never ask you to wire them money, or wire or Zelle yourself money to yourself to \"receive a refund,\" \"reverse a transfer,\" or for any other reason. [7] X Research source"
