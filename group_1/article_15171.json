      "title": "Obtain white chocolate.",
      "content": "Obtain white chocolate. Chocolate that is milk brown or dark brown will not show the true color of most dyes––you'll end up with murky black or deep brown colors instead. However, if your recipe calls for a different type of chocolate and insists that it will work, follow the recipe in preference to this general rule."

      "title": "Melt the chocolate.",
      "content": "Melt the chocolate. Chocolate can be melted in one of the following ways: [1] X Research source Use a microwave, on medium power, in 10-second increments to melt the chocolate to a smooth consistency. [2] X Research source Use a double boiler or a metal pot filled with water and a glass bowl to melt the chocolate over low heat. [3] X Research source Use a dry oven, set to 110ºF (43ºC) to melt the chocolate. It will take about an hour to melt using this way. If your oven does not go this low, use the lowest temperature setting and leave the oven door open a little bit."

      "content": "Check the temperature of the melted chocolate using a chocolate or candy thermometer. These thermometers will provide temperatures in 1 degree increments, allowing better control than the standard candy thermometer. The ideal temperature for the chocolate will depend on the chocolate treat you're making."
