      "title": "Wear T-shirts for a more casual, laid-back style.",
      "content": "Wear T-shirts for a more casual, laid-back style. If you prefer T-shirts without designs, stick with plain black or white—even the V-neck style if that's your thing! If you like to be a bit more eye-catching, wear band shirts from 2-tone bands like The Specials, Madness, The Beat, The Selector, and Bad Manners. Pair your white T-shirt with checkered black and white braces and a hat with the same pattern. For band ideas, look at the 1960s ska artists that influenced popular 2-tone bands. Check out Prince Buster and other artists on the Trojan Records label."

      "content": "Stick with polos if you like a hint of class in your outfit. Polos are commonly black, white, and darker colors like navy blue and burgundy. The most popular brands are Lambretta and Fred Berry, but be wary—the latter is pretty expensive. Combine a white polo with a black trilby hat and dark slacks."

      "title": "Wear button-down shirts for a nice balance of casual and classy.",
      "content": "Wear button-down shirts for a nice balance of casual and classy. The most common button-down shirts are from the British clothing brand Ben Sherman, especially those with checker patterns, clock colors, and flannel. You can also wear short-sleeve button-downs in the summer. Pair your button-down shirt with slacks for a great match. For example, beige or gray slacks and a button-down shirt with a flannel black and white pattern looks great. If you're going with a button-down shirt, try and find one with pearl-decorated buttons to create a vintage feel. Front pockets are also a great addition."

      "content": "Try wearing a low waistcoat or Harrington jacket during cooler months. Waistcoats are sleeveless upper-body clothing pieces that are usually worn over dress shirts or plain T-shirts. The iconic Harrington jacket with plaid lining is another option. For the winter, try wearing a plain V-neck sweater. Layer your waistcoat over a band shirt or plain black or white shirt. Wear jackets and waistcoats in black, white, or a black and white checker pattern. If you wear a 3-button dress jacket, keep the bottom button undone for style."

      "title": "Stick with slacks and skinny jeans for cooler weather.",
      "content": "Stick with slacks and skinny jeans for cooler weather. If you wear slacks, gray, black, and beige are the most common colors for the 2-tone style. If you prefer to wear jeans, skinny jeans—also known as drainpipe trousers—are your best bet. Whether you wear slacks or skinny jeans, cuffed pants are the most common finish. This is when the fabric at the bottom of the pant leg is turned upward on the outside as opposed to folded inside (this is called hemmed). [1] X Research source Look for skinny leans that have rips and holes in them, or just make your own! If you wear skinny jeans, avoid wearing them with Converse sneakers—this is more in line with the New York punk scene. Wear 1960s black ski pants for a unique feminine twist on leg apparel."

      "content": "Try checkered and dogtooth patterns for the classic 2-tone look. Most of these patterns are themed black and white, but you are really free to do what you want. Pairing the same dogtooth or checkered pattern with your accessories and bottom is a good rule. In these cases, wear a solid-color top that matches one of the pattern's colors. Wear a checkered skirt, checkered tie, and checkered hat of your choice—all in black and white patterns. For your shirt, wear a solid black V-neck or even a band shirt with a black and white theme."
