      "content": "Check for bites on the legs and ankles. Fleas tend to bite humans on parts of the body that they can easily reach from the ground, such as the feet, ankles, and legs. They sometimes also bite in areas such as around the waistband (in the gap between the shirt and pants) or around the tops of your socks.

      "title": "Look for hard, red spots.",
      "content": "Look for hard, red spots. Unlike other types of insect bites, flea bites don’t usually swell. Instead, the bites typically look like little red spots, sometimes with a light spot in the center. [2] X Research source You may be able to see a single puncture mark in the middle of the bite. Flea bites can sometimes bleed or scab over if you scratch them a lot."

      "content": "Make note of itching or pain. One of the major symptoms of flea bites is intense itching, although some people may experience more itching than others. You might also find the bites painful. [3] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source If possible, try to avoid scratching the bites too much. Excessive scratching can cause the bites to become infected, and will also make the itching worse. Try relieving the itch with a topical cream, such as calamine lotion or an antihistamine cream."

      "content": "Watch for blisters if you’re sensitive to flea bites. If you’re allergic to flea bites, you may have a more severe reaction. In this case, the bites might swell and develop a blister at the center, which can eventually break and crust over.

      "title": "Keep an eye out for fleas.",
      "content": "Keep an eye out for fleas. If you think you’re getting bitten by fleas, see if you can spot the fleas themselves. Fleas are small (about 1–3 millimetres (0.039–0.118 in) long, or a little smaller than a sesame seed), black or dark brown insects that typically jump. You may also see them wiggling through human hair or animal fur. They do not have wings.

      "content": "Look for persistent scratching or biting behaviors. If your pet is being bitten by fleas, it will likely be intensely itchy. You may notice your dog or cat scratching itself constantly or biting and chewing on areas that it can’t reach with its claws. [7] X Research source An animal being harassed by fleas may also act jumpy or irritable."

Additionally, allergens in the fleas’ saliva can cause hair loss. [8] X Research source Check your pet for bald spots and rough or unusually dirty looking fur.

[11] X Research source Look for sores and scabs in areas like the tail, rear end, legs, and neck. You might also notice general redness, irritation and inflammation, or areas where the skin is thickened or discolored. If your pet is allergic to fleas, they may develop sores that ooze or crust over."

      "content": "Check your pets’ fur and bedding for flea dirt. Even if you never see the fleas themselves, they often leave behind tell-tale black flecks in your pet’s fur and bedding. Try running a comb through your animal’s fur to see if you can find flea dirt (feces) and live fleas. [12] X Research source Try combing your pet over a white surface, such as a piece of cloth or paper, so that any falling dirt or fleas are more obvious. To prevent the fleas from escaping and moving around your home, you can also comb your pet over a sink or tub with a little soapy water in it. This way, any fleas that you comb out of your pet’s fur will die when they land in the water. Since flea dirt is primarily composed of blood, it will turn red or reddish brown if you mix it with water. Focus on the parts of your animal where fleas are most likely to be active. For example, fleas most commonly gather on the ears, neck, lower back, and base of the tail on dogs.

Pets such as dogs and cats can easily pick up fleas by going outside, so one of the best ways to keep fleas out of your home is to keep your pets indoors as much as possible.

Some outdoor locations are more likely to have fleas than others. If you find that your pet keeps coming back from a specific park with a fresh flea infestation, try taking them to a different spot for a while and see if the situation improves."

There are also a variety of fast-acting oral flea medications on the market, which are helpful for severe infestations. Some popular brands include Sentry Capguard and PetArmor Fastcaps. You can also purchase a flea collar to kill fleas on your pet and prevent future infestations.

[22] X Research source Flea treatments may come in the form of a spray or a “flea bomb” designed to spread the insecticide through your entire home. You may need to reapply the insecticide treatment after a couple of weeks to make sure you get any fleas that have hatched since the first treatment."
