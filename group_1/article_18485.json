Choose 1 player to be the dealer, and have them give 10 cards to each player, including themselves. None of the players look at their cards. Use 1 deck of cards for 2 to 3 players and 2 decks for 4 to 6 players. For 6 or more players, use 3 decks. Jokers can be placed aside or shuffled in the deck and used as wild cards."

Each player takes the 10 cards they were given and places the cards in front of them in 2 horizontal rows with 5 cards in each row. The top left card represents the ace (or 1) position, the next card is the 2 position, and so on. The bottom right card represents the 10 position. [1] X Research source The deck in the middle is the draw pile. The discard (or “garbage”) pile can be placed next to the deck."

If you draw a card with an Ace or a number on it from 2 to 10, put the card in the correct position over the 10 cards in front of you. If you draw a 7, put the card over the 7th position, which is over the second card in row 2. Kings are wild. If you draw a king, you can place it over any card in any position. Jacks and Queens mean nothing in Garbage. If you draw one, your turn ends. In some versions of the game, jacks or jokers are wild while kings are “trash” and are discarded."

Once you place the card you drew in the correct position in the rows in front of you, take the face-down card underneath it and move it to its correct spot. If the face-down card is an 8, put this card over the 8th position. You can now pick up the face-down card in the 8th position and move it to its correct spot. If you draw a card with a number that corresponds to the position that a king is in, put the numerical card in its correct position and move the king to whatever position you’d like."

If you draw a jack, queen, or a numerical card with a position that has already been filled by another card, put it in the discard or “garbage” pile face-up next to the draw pile. The person to your left now takes their turn. After the first player finishes their turn, the other players can pick up a card from the discard pile instead of the draw pile if they see one they’re missing."

After a player places the last card they need to have 2 rows of 10 cards from ace to 10, the other players take 1 last turn to see if they can tie with the winner. Alternatively, ask the other players to flip over the remaining cards in their rows. If a player happens to have the rest of the cards in the correct order, they tie with the winner. The 10 cards in your rows don’t have to be the same suit."

The winner now only has to get 9 cards face-up in order from ace to 10 to win this round. Continue playing until a player is only dealt 1 card. When this player replaces the card with an ace, they win the entire game. This version of the game is longer, but can be more fun! Some versions require the player with 1 card left to place either an ace or a king, while others require them to place an ace to win."

Instead of having the kings as wild cards (or “garbage” cards), allow players to use a king they turn over on another player of their choice. [2] X Research source Pick which face-up card in position you’d like to flip over, then discard the king. The other player will replace the face-up card with a face-down card from the draw pile. The other player then places the face-up card from their row in the discard pile. For example, if a player draws a king from the middle, they use it to flip over a person’s 8. The 8 card is discarded with the king, and the other player puts a new face-down card in that position."

[4] X Research source Play using the rules for the first alternate version of the game, dealing yourself 1 less card each time you complete a sequence. When you have 1 card left, draw an ace to win. Optionally, place a timer nearby to time yourself. Try to win the round as quickly as possible.
