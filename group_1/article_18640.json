      "content": "These clues tend to be easier to fill in than others. Rather than starting with the first clue and going in order, scan through all of the clues and look for some easy “gimmes.” Fill-in-the-blank clues are usually common knowledge, so you should have an idea of what the right answer is. After you get a few of the easy words in, you’ll feel a big boost of confidence going forward. Some example clues could be: “____ Lisa (famous painting)” for MONA “Costa ____” for RICA “ ____ and the Giant Peach ” for JAMES “Do re mi fa __” for SOL"

      "content": "Short words are usually simpler to solve than the longer answers. While some short words might be more challenging, you still have a good chance of finding a few that you can answer. Look through the crossword puzzle for shorter words and check the clue to see if you know the answer. Filling in the shorter answers first can give you some extra letters to help you solve longer words. Some clues could be: “Primate” for APE “Pig’s home” for STY “Oak or elm, for example” for TREE “Chocolate and cream cookie” for OREO"

      "title": "The answers in the puzzle will match the tense and number in the clue.",
      "content": "The answers in the puzzle will match the tense and number in the clue. Even if you don’t know the exact word for the clue, you can make assumptions based on how the clue is written. If a clue is in the past, present, or active tense, or if it’s singular or plural, then you know what the last few letters of the answer might be. [1] X Research source Past tense clues tend to end with -ED, like “Performed on stage” for ACTED. Present tense clues usually end in S, like “Goes for a walk in nature” for HIKES. Clues with an -ING verb tend to end the same way, such as “Leaving” for GOING. Many plural clues end in the letter S, like “Things Santa leaves” for GIFTS."

      "content": "Punctuation and add-ons in the clues tell you how the answer is formatted. Since crossword constructors want to give you a challenge, they may try to play a few tricks on you that are easy to catch. Break down the clue and look for these parts to get an idea of how the answer might appear. [2] X Research source Abbreviations in the clue or “abbr.” mean the answer is abbreviated, like “Stat. for a pitcher” for ERA. Question marks always mean the clue has wordplay or is trying to mislead you. “Flower?” could mean “something that flows” and be a clue for RIVER. The term “in” followed by a city usually means a foreign word, like “Boy, in Barcelona” for NINO. Words in brackets mean the answer is a sound, like “[Hey over here!]” for PSST."

      "content": "Short words with lots of vowels tend to show up in multiple puzzles. Since the words on a crossword puzzle need to intersect, constructors rely on some less-common words that contain a lot of vowels. You might not know the definition from the clue, but you can usually work it out from the surrounding words and remember the definition for future puzzles. Common answers (and their possible clues) can be: [3] X Research source EPEE (“Fencing sword”) AIOLI (“Garlic spread”) AGRA (“Taj Mahal location”) BEE, CEE, or DEE (“Common letter grade”) Puzzles may also use compass directions, like ESE, ENE, NNE, or SSE."

If you start with the toughest puzzles you can find, it’ll be more of a struggle if you don’t already know some tricks for solving them. Instead, look for websites or crossword books that offer easy puzzles so you can get used to solving them. Themed puzzles are easier since some of the answers have something in common. [8] X Research source Magazines like People have easy crosswords with more clues based on pop culture. Most print publications, like The New York Times and The New Yorker , publish the easiest puzzles on Mondays and they get progressively harder throughout the week."
