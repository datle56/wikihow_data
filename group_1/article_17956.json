      "title": "Begin with the colored side of your paper facing up.",
      "content": "Begin with the colored side of your paper facing up. Traditional origami paper is colored on one side and white on the other, so face the colored side up. [1] X Research source If you are using paper colored on both sides or white paper, it will not matter which side faces up. Standard origami paper is square, and you need square paper for this tutorial. Double-check that the paper is square before you start folding!"

      "title": "Fold your paper in half top to bottom and left to right.",
      "content": "Fold your paper in half top to bottom and left to right. Bring the opposite edges of the paper together to create creases that form the shape of a cross through the middle of your paper. First, fold the paper in half by bringing the top edge to the bottom. Then, fold the paper in half by bringing the left edge to the right one. [2] X Research source Crease the paper along the seam of the fold well for best results."

      "title": "Flip the paper over and fold an X.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over and fold an X. Turn your paper over so that the reverse side is facing up. Fold the bottom right corner to the upper left corner and crease. Unfold. Then, fold the bottom left corner to the upper right corner. Crease and unfold. Check that your folds have produced an “X”-shaped crease. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Collapse the sides to form a triangle.",
      "content": "Collapse the sides to form a triangle. Hold the paper with the reverse side facing up (the side you just folded into an “X”). Collapse the base by tucking the sides of the “X” crease into the middle. Pull the top and bottom edges together to sandwich the left and right sides in place. Crease the resulting fold to form a triangle shape. [4] X Research source Congrats—you’ve completed a waterbomb base, a fundamental origami fold!"

      "content": "Fold the flaps to line up with the center crease on both sides. Look for the fold running down the center of your waterbomb base. Take the right-side front flap and fold it until it lines up with the center crease. Repeat this fold with the left-side front flap. Turn the paper over and fold the remaining flaps to the center crease on this side. [5] X Research source When you’re done, check that the paper resembles a diamond shape."

      "title": "Fold the outside corners of the outer flaps inward.",
      "content": "Fold the outside corners of the outer flaps inward. First, take the right flap and pull it over to the left side. Do the same with the back side of the paper so both sides are smooth. Fold the outer corners of the top flaps straight inward until they reach the crease in the middle. Flip the paper over and repeat this fold, turning the diamond into a pointed triangle. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Tuck the right-side flaps into the left-side ones.",
      "content": "Tuck the right-side flaps into the left-side ones. The left-side flaps of the triangles on each side of the paper have a fold, creating a kind of pocket. Open this fold with your finger, then slide the opposite flap into it. Flip the paper over and repeat with the remaining flaps. [7] X Research source"

Air can escape easily from this seam, so hold it firmly. Put your lips to the center of the “X” shape that forms the base of your tulip bulb. Exhale steadily until your tulip bulb feels fully inflated. [8] X Research source"

Peel these petals back about ¼ of the way down from the top so each petal comes to a point. [9] X Research source Leave your petals uncreased and slightly pulled back from the tip of your tulip bulb to create a more natural appearance.

Pick up the lower-right corner and bring it to the upper-left corner, creating a triangle. Crease at the base of the triangle. Repeat the fold by picking up the lower-left corner and bringing it to the upper-right corner, creasing. Unfold. [10] X Research source Popular tulip colors include red, pink, orange, yellow, and purple. Use origami paper in one of these colors to create a realistic tulip flower."

      "content": "Fold the right and left corners upward to form petals. First, take the right-side corner and bring it toward the crease in the center of the triangle. Don’t align it with the middle crease—place it halfway along that side of the triangle. Crease the fold to secure it. Repeat with the left-side corner, bringing it toward the central crease so it lines up with the midpoint of the left side. [12] X Research source Your petals don’t have to be perfect. Homayoon recommends changing the angles to experiment with different petal shapes. Do what looks best to you."

      "content": "Flip the paper over and fold in the side corners. Turn your folded tulip flower over so the reverse side is face up. Look at the diamond shape—the edges are too pointy to resemble a real tulip, which is round. Take the left-side corner and fold it inward about 2 centimetres (20 mm). Repeat with the right-side corner, folding it inward. [13] X Research source Your tulip flower is complete!"

If it’s double-sided paper, place the white side face up. Fold it in half from top to bottom, then unfold and fold it in half from side to side. Line up the points and edges when you fold.

First, pick up the top corner of the diamond and fold it down so the tip touches the center of the cross-shaped crease (where the lines intersect). Repeat this with the bottom corner of the diamond, folding it up so it meets the top point. Crease the edges. [16] X Research source The resulting shape resembles a hexagon."
