      "content": "Define the beginning and end of your fast. Many traditional religious fasts only require you to refrain from eating until the sun goes down. If you're fasting for an Islamic rite, for instance, the fast begins about 1 and 1/2-2 hours before sunrise and you can eat after sunset.

      "content": "Drink at least 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water the day before the fast. Water helps balance the bodily fluids that aid the digestion, absorption, and transportation of nutrients; the circulation of blood; the production of saliva; and the maintenance of body temperature. This doesn't mean that you should chug a ton of water immediately before the fast. All this will do is make you urinate a lot a couple of hours later. Instead, increase your water intake beginning 72 hours before the fast. Juice, milk, tea, Gatorade, and other hydrating drinks will also help you prepare for your fast.

      "content": "Stay strong. If you have the sudden urge to give up, remind yourself why you're doing this fast. Exercise discipline. Assure yourself that your hunger will not last forever. And besides: if you remain strong now, the rewards may be far greater than if you give in. Towards the end of the fast, you will likely feel strained and exhausted. This is where you'll need to bring out the reserves. Nap, if possible, or let visual media take over your brain. An absorptive action movie or video game can work wonders in this situation."

      "content": "Break your fast at the time you've designated. Take it slow, and be very mindful of how much you eat. Half your portions: it is absolutely imperative that you don't eat as much as you would regularly eat at mealtimes. Your digestive system is on low-power mode, and it isn't able to handle a massive burger right now. Instead, eat light foods like fruits, vegetables, and soup. Water and fruit juices are also important. Remember not to eat and drink too much, too quickly. Have an apple and a glass of water first, and wait ten minutes. Then, have a bowl of soup with a glass of orange juice. Space the process over 30 minutes to an hour. Eating a ton right away can land you in the bathroom for a long time accompanied by considerable pain – and it can even be hazardous to your health. Take it slow."
