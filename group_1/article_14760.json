      "title": "Wear long underwear if you have them.",
      "content": "Wear long underwear if you have them. Thermal or silk long underwear do a great job of wicking moisture away from your body. These can be worn under almost any outfit to help you stay dry and warm. [1] X Research source Thermal knits are usually made from either fleece or a cotton and polyester blend. Silk underwear may provide a sleeker outfit underneath form-fitting clothes."

      "title": "Wear an undershirt made from moisture-wicking fabric.",
      "content": "Wear an undershirt made from moisture-wicking fabric. If you’re not going to be wearing long underwear, choose an undershirt that will help keep you dry. Look for naturally moisture-resistant materials like merino wool, or athletic fabrics like polypropylene. Avoid wearing cotton next to your skin. When you sweat, cotton will retain the moisture, creating a damp layer against your skin which will actually make you feel more cold."

    {
      "title": "Wear tights or leggings under your pants for added warmth.",
      "content": "Wear tights or leggings under your pants for added warmth. If you don't have long-underwear, keep your legs warm by wearing a thin layer beneath your pants. This layer can be tights, leggings, or even another pair of pants, as long as they're thin enough so that your pants still fit comfortably. [2] X Research source If you're wearing heavy pants like corduroys, a pair of tights will likely be sufficient to keep you warm. For thinner, dressier pants, a pair of fleece-lined leggings will help keep your legs from getting cold."

      "title": "Protect your feet with thick, long socks.",
      "content": "Protect your feet with thick, long socks. Your socks shouldn’t be so thick that they interfere with putting on your shoes, but you should wear the thickest socks that you find comfortable. Woolen socks are a good option because they help keep moisture away from your body. Your socks should be long enough to be pulled up over your base layer to ensure no cold air can touch your skin. If it’s really cold out, try wearing 2 pairs of socks."

    {
      "title": "Top your base layer with a shirt that can be easily removed.",
      "content": "Top your base layer with a shirt that can be easily removed. Being able to take off layers is extremely important in the winter. Wear a shirt that is easy to pull over your head or that has buttons or a zipper. [3] X Research source Try wearing a button-down shirt over your base layer, since these are easy to take off. Another option is to wear a lightweight sweater that you can easily pull off if you get too warm. Getting too hot inside can also make it seem colder when you go back outside."

      "title": "Look for fabrics like fleece, wool, and flannel to help you stay warm.",
      "content": "Look for fabrics like fleece, wool, and flannel to help you stay warm. Sturdy, thick materials like these are ideal for a middle layer because they'll keep you warm but they're breathable, so you're less likely to get overheated. A flannel shirt worn with a pair of jeans and hiking boots is a great way to show off your rocker style even when the weather is cold. A wool sweater worn over a skirt with leggings and knee-high boots is a cute, preppy winter outfit."

      "title": "Wear heavy pants like jeans or corduroys.",
      "content": "Wear heavy pants like jeans or corduroys. Lightweight materials like nylon aren’t going to do much to keep you warm, even if you’re wearing multiple layers. Opt for heavier fabrics like denim, corduroy, and wool to ensure you stay toasty during the coldest months. [4] X Research source You may also want to invest in a pair of pants with a thermal lining."

      "title": "Add a sweatshirt over your shirt for a casual look.",
      "content": "Add a sweatshirt over your shirt for a casual look. Sweatshirts are the ultimate in casual comfort. Choose a basic sweatshirt or opt for a hoodie or a zip-up sweatshirt. A zip-up hoodie will be easiest to remove indoors, but there are lots of other styles to choose from."

      "content": "Wear a cardigan for a lightweight layer perfect for work or school. You don't want to wear a heavy coat indoors all day, but it still be a little cool in your office or classroom. A cardigan will keep you warm at work, at school, or anywhere else indoors, and it's easy to take off if it gets a little warm.

      "content": "Wear a dress over your base layer for a warm, feminine look. You don’t have to sacrifice your style just because the weather is cold. Add a warm twist to your favorite dress by layering it over cold-weather pieces, or choose a sweater dress that's perfect for winter.

      "content": "Invest in a heavy coat in a neutral color. When the weather gets really cold, you’ll be wearing your coat everywhere you go. A heavy parka in a color like tan or black will keep you warm and will go with almost any outfit. [6] X Research source The warmest option is a coat that is insulated with down. If you’ll be spending a lot of time outside, choose a hard-shell coat. These are made from a waterproof material. If you’re going to be active, opt for a soft-shell coat. These are breathable and water-resistant, perfect for winter activities like skiing."

You can also choose from a wide range of materials, including cashmere, merino wool, and heavy knits. [7] X Research source A hat with ear flaps will keep you warm without needing to be pulled down low over your eyes. If you have long hair, a knit hat with a hole in the top will keep your head covered while still leaving room for your ponytail or bun.

      "title": "Cover your hands with gloves or mittens.",
      "content": "Cover your hands with gloves or mittens. When you’re out in the cold, your extremities are affected first. Keep your fingers warm with leather, wool, or knit gloves. Chunky cable-knit gloves are practical and affordable, so they're a perfect choice for anyone who's prone to losing gloves. Leather gloves with a fur cuff are a must-have for any fashionista. Gloves made from cashmere are buttery-soft, making them a classic that's well worth the indulgence."

      "content": "Wear water-resistant boots in the snow. You don’t necessarily have to give up fashionable footwear, but whatever shoes you wear should be practical, especially if you'll be walking on ice. Look for boots that are made with water-resistant materials and which offer non-slip soles. Luckily, there are plenty of boots out there that perfectly fit the bill.
