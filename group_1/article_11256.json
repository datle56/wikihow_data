You might also match the color and weight closely for a more a subtle version."

      "content": "Fold two pieces of your gusset material in half, one over the other, and mark your cutting line diagonally on the wrong side of the fabric. Be certain the diagonal cut is slightly longer than your slit length. When measuring where the bottom cut should begin, keep in mind that you are cutting twice the width that you are looking at because of the fold in your material (e.g. 4.5 inches will open to 9 inches). The reason for doing two pieces at once is to ensure that your gussets match in size and shape."
