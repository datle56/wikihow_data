      "content": "Embrace spontaneous, silly fun. Leos have a naturally fun-loving nature and look for significant others to match this energy. When planning dates with a Leo, embrace your inner child and opt for playful, unconventional activities, instead of the typical dinner and a movie plan. [1] X Research source For example, try doing something like mini golf or laser tag. A Leo will be delighted by these childlike games. They’ll also jump at the chance to engage in a little friendly competition. Leos also love spontaneity and being woo-ed, so consider surprising him with tickets to see his favorite musician. He’ll appreciate the effort you put in to plan something special! [2] X Research source Garbis also recommends participating in his favorite activities, even if they’re new to you. For instance, if he likes football, go to the game or bring snacks on game day to show that you're interested in the same things he is."

      "content": "Plan dates where you take risks. Leo men tend to admire people who push themselves outside their comfort zone. They’re bold risk-takers themselves, so they’re looking for someone who can be their partner on all of their exciting adventures. So, if you want to keep a Leo man interested, try doing things that scare you a little from time to time to show him you’re willing to face your fears. For example, if you're afraid of heights, be brave and ride the ferris wheel at a carnival with him. Or, if you’re not an outdoors-y person, show him that you’re willing to try new things by going on a hike with him or accompanying him on a camping trip. Your willingness to step outside your comfort zone and broaden your horizons is bound to impress a Leo man!"

Just try not to go overboard with your compliments and praise—you don’t want to feed a Leo man’s ego too much. Focus on pointing out things you sincerely like about him (“I really love when you plan romantic dates. You’re so thoughtful!”), and avoid hyperbolic language (\"You're the handsomest guy ever!\").

Leo men like to feel special, so they really value it when someone strokes their ego a bit. If this is something you don’t enjoy doing, it may cause a bit of a rift in your relationship at times.
