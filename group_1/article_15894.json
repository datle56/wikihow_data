      "content": "Move into the eating part of the experience. This step varies from individual to individual but there are two broad approaches under which most individual techniques fall: If you are patient by nature, and prefer to savor something good slowly, then you will want probably to take the \"layer-by-layer\" approach. If you are a person who likes to take in something wonderful all at once, then you might take the \"pop-it-in\" approach."

      "content": "Continue by savoring the next layers, consisting of wafer and pure chocolate. Whether you prefer to savor them separately or together is entirely up to you. The crisp wafer and the melted chocolate complement each other, no matter how they are consumed, opening the way to the toasted nut at the center. At this stage, \"layer-by-layer\" believers most often take a break to simply let their senses soak in the experience before reaching the climax."

The \"layer-by-layer\" followers already sample this in their stages but a more wholesome pause is needed to recollect and remember the wonderful experience. This step is vital because thinking of how good the chocolate was leads to a repetition of all the above steps thereby doubling your already heightened pleasure."
