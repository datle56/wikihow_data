      "content": "Fold the pieces of paper in half one at a time. Do this to however many sheets of paper you plan on having in your book. Repeating the folding process for one sheet of paper at a time will create a clean sharp fold for your pages. It is okay to take a few at a time to speed up the process in return for a less clean and precise fold. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use an object with a flat edge to flatten each piece of paper at the fold.",
      "content": "Use an object with a flat edge to flatten each piece of paper at the fold. Use a bone folder if it is available to you. If not, a ruler or a similar object will work as well. Hold the folded paper down and press the flat-edged object along the fold for a sharp edge. Following this step using one sheet at a time will produce the best result. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Poke evenly spaced holes along the paper fold using a needle.",
      "content": "Poke evenly spaced holes along the paper fold using a needle. Choose any number of holes that is suitable for the size of paper you are using. Use a ruler to measure out and mark where you plan to poke a hole. The spacing and number of holes should be the same for every piece of paper. A 0.5- to 1- inch spacing between holes is recommended. Repeat for the rest of the paper. You may choose to poke through all the pages at once to save time. Ensure your needle is thick enough to go through all of them. If your stack is too thick, just choose to poke through a few at a time. Be gentle while handling your paper in this step, if not, your papers may end up very crumpled at the end."

      "title": "Cut a piece of thread twice the length of the book.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of thread twice the length of the book. The length is the dimension parallel to the direction of the holes. Cut the thread to be longer than instructed if you worry you will run out of thread or have more excess at the end to make tying a knot easier, but the twice the length should be enough to work with.

      "title": "Thread the needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread.",
      "content": "Thread the needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread. Tie a double knot if the thread you used loosens easily or the knot is much smaller than the thickness of the needle. This is so when you begin the threading process, the knot does not get pulled through the hole. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the needle through one of the holes at the far end through all the sheets of paper.",
      "content": "Pull the needle through one of the holes at the far end through all the sheets of paper. Tug the thread gently until the knot hits the other side of the hole. Next, pull the thread through the next hole but in the opposite direction as the first hole. Tug gently to remove any slack in the thread, but not too tight causing the thread to snap."
