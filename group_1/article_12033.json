      "content": "Understand that some of your family member’s behaviors are linked to the disorder. For example, a person who is chattering on about themselves selfishly or bragging is normally recognized as arrogant or self-centered. This behavior in a person with bipolar disorder is a sign of mania, as are other risky behaviors that may be equally unappealing to you. Recognizing that this is a symptom of the illness, and not an intentional behavior by your family member is helpful in understanding their condition. However, be cautious not to associate every mood your family member has with their illness; people with bipolar disorder can be mad or sad in healthy ways, too. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Alliance on Mental Illness Grassroots mental health-focused organization providing resources, support, and education for those affected by mental illness Go to source One way you can understand your family member's illness better and show support is to simply ask about their experience of it. Make sure, however, that you use discretion and identify if they feel comfortable talking with you about it before you attempt to engage them. If this is too threatening, you could simply ask how they are doing and gain more information about what they are currently going through."

      "content": "Help monitor medication compliance. It is common for individuals with bipolar disorder to avoid taking their medication since the “high” of mania can feel good to them. If you notice that your family member has gone off their medication, the first step would be to notify their psychiatrist or general practitioner as soon as possible. Most likely the doctor will want to speak with your loved one and will inform you of how to proceed. If you are not able to speak with a doctor, you can encourage your loved one to take their medications, or provide incentives (such as special treats or doing something with them that they enjoy) if they agree to be med-compliant.

      "content": "Adhere to a medication regime. Do keep in mind that adherence to a medication regiment is not necessarily just a simple, straightforward matter of choosing whether or not to take a pill. Medications commonly used to treat bipolar disorder frequently cause substantial adverse effects such as forgetfulness, sleepiness, gastrointestinal symptoms, excessive sweating, substantial weight gain, hair loss, skin rashes, sexual problems and other unpleasant and distressing symptoms. If someone you care about has stopped their medication or expresses the desire to discontinue medication, it may be helpful to inquire as to what their reasons are. They may well have compelling reasons, beyond merely “I’m feeling better and I don’t need it”. Others may claim that they enjoy the high of hypomania and don’t want to take medication that will end their feeling of euphoria. Adverse effects are most commonly experienced when starting a new medication or increasing the dose, however they may occur at any time in treatment and may be a cause of substantial distress or discomfort to the individual. If your loved one is not adhering to their medication regimen because of adverse effects, do encourage them to talk with their doctor to determine whether a change in strength or timing of dose, or an alternative medication might alleviate or minimize the problem to a tolerable level."

      "content": "Help your family member avoid triggers. A trigger is a behavior or situation that may increase the likelihood of a negative outcome, in this case, a manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode. Possible triggers include substances such as caffeine, alcohol, and other drugs. [7] X Research source Triggers can also include negative emotions such as stress, an imbalanced diet, sleep irregularities (sleeping too much or too little), and interpersonal conflicts. Your loved one will have their own specific triggers. You can help by discouraging your family member from engaging in these behaviors, or by helping them prioritize their responsibilities to reduce stress levels. Criticism and critical people are common bipolar triggers. If you live with your family member you could remove substances such as alcohol from the home. You could also attempt to foster a relaxing environment by controlling lighting, music, and energy levels."

While it may still be a challenge to cope with this disorder in the family, your concern and thoughtfulness can go a long way in supporting your family member. One way to show that you care is by simply letting your family member know that you are there for them, and you want to be supportive of their recovery. You can also offer to listen to them if they want to talk about their illness."

It is important to understand and remind yourself (either aloud or in your mind) that you cannot control your family member's behaviors. They have a condition that you cannot fix. Shift your attention to focusing on your own needs. For example, you could make a list of your own personal goals and begin working toward them. Use coping resources. Coping resources are specific ways to cope with a particular issue, and they are vital to self-care. Coping strategies can include activities you enjoy such as reading, writing, art, music, outdoor activities, exercise or sports. Therapeutic activities can also assist self-care including relaxation techniques (such as progressive muscle relaxation), meditation, keeping a journal, mindfulness, and art therapy. Another way to cope is to create distance or remove yourself from stressful situations when they arise."
