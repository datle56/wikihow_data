      "title": "Think about things you can sell.",
      "content": "Think about things you can sell. One of the easiest ways to make money on the side is to sell things you no longer need. Look around your house or yard for things you have but are willing to part with for some money. You will have the easiest time earning some extra cash this way if the items are in good condition and are desired by others (it will be hard to sell a broken video game console, or your personal collection of gum wrappers, for instance). Things that can have good resale value include: Books Video games CDs or records DVDs Gently-used name brand clothing Jewelry Smartphones Computers Tablets Musical instruments and equipment Bicycles Cans and bottles (in some states, you can get a refund for these; otherwise, you might be able to sell them to a recycling center) [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for ways to sell your items. You might already know some friends that would like to buy your stuff. If not, you'll need to find some ways to advertise the things you have and connect to buyers. Some options include: Online auction sites such as eBay “For Sale” postings (these can be posted to a bulletin board, in a newspaper, or on an online classifieds board like Craigslist ) Online retailers like Amazon or AbeBooks.com (these sites usually charge a small fee or percentage of your profit) Yard sales Flea markets Pawn shops [2] X Research source Trade-in at stores (this works for certain items; some stores will buy used clothing, CDs and Records, or books, for instance)"

      "title": "Set a price for your items.",
      "content": "Set a price for your items. Deciding how much to sell you stuff for can be difficult. If you are selling via an auction, you can let the price be determined by the highest bidder. Otherwise, you can either set a price or ask potential buyers to make you an offer. You are more likely to make a sale, however, if you set a price for your buyers. Your price might be determined by market demand. For instance, if you are selling a used smartphone that you know people can purchase for $100, you are most likely to make a sale if you sell it for $100 or less. You can get a good sense of the price to sell an item by looking for how much comparable items sell for online. For instance, if the used smartphone you want to sell appears for $90 to $125 on online retailers, you can set a price that is within or below this range. If you really want to make some money, you might consider selling your item for well below its going rate. If you advertise the smartphone for only $75, for instance, you can have a better chance of making a sale. However, you might not want to part with your items for less than they are worth."

Possible items to rent include tools, camping equipment, gaming consoles, DVDs, and musical instruments. There are websites that you can use to advertise the items you have for rent.

[15] X Research source However, these methods require you to not use your money during the time that it is invested. Many investments carry some degree if risk that you might lose money, so make sure you can handle this possible outcome. In other words, you might not want to invest money if you know you need it for something else. Depending on your age and the type of investment, you might need an adult to help you open an account. If your parents support the idea of you investing, you might ask them to match the funds you put away. For instance, you can ask them to contribute $25 for every $100 that you save, so that you will actually save $125 every time instead of $100 each time. You can also promise not to withdraw the money for a certain amount of time, such as until you are 25. Saving even a little bit can make a difference over time. Consider trying hard to make yourself save at least a little bit whenever you can, instead of spending all of your money."
