      "content": "Eat mindfully . When it's time to eat, make sure that you're away from distractions. Studies have shown that people who were distracted while eating felt less full, satisfied, and consumed more food than people who practiced mindful eating. People who have healthy weights enjoy their meals and snacks to the fullest and have limited distractions while they eat. Remember, skinny people may not be the same. [2] X Research source Focus on each bite that you take: What are the tastes? What is the texture like? Is it hot or cold? Make sure that you chew your food thoroughly before you swallow. Try putting your fork down in between bites and chewing 20–30 times per bite."

      "title": "Stop eating when you're satisfied, not full.",
      "content": "Stop eating when you're satisfied, not full. Do not eat large portions regularly or eat until you are full; instead, listen to what your body is telling you about the appropriate amount of food to eat. [3] X Research source This ability may come naturally for some, but may take practice and concentration for others. Stopping when you're satisfied can be difficult. It's easy to eat until we feel \"full\" or have had a little too much. However, if you eat mindfully and pay attention, your body should tell you when you're satisfied. Satisfied may feel different to everyone. Typically signs include: a lack of hunger, a feeling that you will not get hungry again for 3–4 hours, or a disinterest in your food. You may feel a slight presence of food in your stomach. Many times satisfaction is a lack of a feeling. If you feel full, you might have eaten too much. Fullness may feel like: a stretching of your stomach, bloated or uncomfortable. When you're full, you may think \"that was a few bites too many.\""

      "content": "Track emotional eating . Another hallmark of people who stay thin, rather than skinny people, is that they typically do not emotionally eat on a regular basis. [4] X Research source Those that have trouble managing their weight may cope with stress or other emotions with food. Come up with a list of activities that can help you de-stress, calm down or self-soothe. This could be: listening to music, taking a hot shower, reading a good book or going for a walk. Journaling may also help manage emotional eating as well. Spend some time journaling your thoughts and feelings down a few times a week. [5] X Research source If emotional eating is something you struggle with significantly, try seeing a life coach or behavior therapist for additional support."

      "content": "Don't skip meals. All skinny people avoid skipping meals. By having an eating schedule your body will be more likely to stick to your eating plans. Having three meals a day with one or two healthy snacks can help regulate your eating and make you less likely to snack throughout the day. Remember, three proper balanced meals a day should mean you don't need to snack. Don't eat a snack because it's snack time, snack if you are hungry. [6] X Research source Eating for a healthy weight does not mean eating less food or skipping meals. You need to eat regularly and healthily so that you are able to maintain a healthy weight and metabolism. Always eat breakfast. You might think that skipping meals would make you skinny, but many times the exact opposite is true. Also, skipping meals slows down your metabolism so you end up storing more of those calories because you're body was in \"starvation mode\" If you eat breakfast, it gets your metabolism going, then you eat smaller meals throughout the day. [7] X Research source For the two snacks it's a good idea to have higher protein (like a hard-boiled egg and an apple) to help keep your energy up."

Exercising may help keep your appetite under control and it will help you burn those extra calories that you intake.

[9] X Research source Exercise can be anything you like: a 30-minute walk, going for a run, doing yoga or dance, doing martial arts, etc. Also try to include more lifestyle activity. These are activities that you do every day — walking to and from your car, taking the stairs at work, or mowing the lawn.

      "content": "Get enough protein. Protein takes care of things like body tissue, internal organs, and muscle as well as your immune system and hormones. People who are naturally thin consume adequate protein daily to help them maintain satisfaction throughout the day. [11] X Research source Try to eat more lean meat rather than fatty meat since leaner proteins are lower in calories. All skinny people eat lean meat, unless they are vegetarian. [12] X Trustworthy Source USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion U.S. agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research Go to source The best sources of lean protein are fish, meat, poultry, eggs and low-fat dairy. You can also get protein from soy, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. Protein might be able to better satisfy hunger and to leave you feeling more satisfied for a longer period of time compared to other foods. It can also help you control your appetite and calorie intake. [13] X Research source The way to calculate how much protein you should be getting in your diet is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. In general, this is about 46 g daily for women and 56 g daily for men. However, the amount will differ based upon age, gender, weight and activity levels."

[14] X Research source Those people who manage their weight easily, base large quantities of their diet on fruits and vegetables. [15] X Research source More of those servings should be veggies than fruit. This will help you get the nutrients you need to be healthy, with fewer calories. [16] X Research source Fruits and vegetables are a frequent choice in diets eaten by thin people. These foods are high in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber. They can add bulk to meals and snacks and help make meals more satisfying. [17] X Research source Choose whole fruits and vegetables over juice. Juices do not provide the healthy fiber found in whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables."

[26] X Research source By eating your favorite foods more mindfully you'll find that you're enjoying those foods and you'll be less likely to immediately go back for more. If you end up eating a meal that's higher in calories (like you went out to eat, or had a bigger dessert), don't stress. Try balancing that meal or snack by eating smaller portions for the rest of the day or hit the gym a little harder."
