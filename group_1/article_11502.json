      "content": "Listen to a variety of country music to familiarize yourself with the beats. Tap your foot up and down along with the beat. Country music typically follows a 4-beat rhythm, so as you tap, count “1-and-2-and-3-and-4.” Each down beat is a count and each up beat is an “and.” [1] X Research source The foundation of country music dancing lies in being able to follow the beat so you know when to move your feet."

      "content": "Watch videos of people dancing to country music. Simply look up basic country dance moves online for a good visual of what you should look like when you're out on the dance floor. There are also websites devoted to showcasing different popular country songs and accompanying dance moves. Also try to pay attention to people when you are out at country bars—sometimes the best learning comes from watching and imitating others."

      "content": "Master the two-step for a foundation for your dance moves. Make sure you have the “1-and-2-and-3-and-4” beat count down. Grab a partner (or pretend you're dancing with someone if you're at home alone), and follow a “quick, quick, slow, slow” pattern to move forward across the dance floor by doing the following: [2] X Research source The first “quick” step forward takes place on the “1” beat, and the second “quick” step forward takes place on the “and” beat. The first “slow” step forward takes place on the “2-and” beats, and the second “slow” step forward takes place on the “3-and” beats. Follow this “quick, quick, slow, slow” pattern with your partner as you move all around the dance floor."

      "content": "Practice the “sweetheart” position to set yourself up to do spins. Stand so that you and your partner are facing one another and hold hands with your arms fully extended. If you are leading, grab your partner's right hand and lift it over their head and twist their body so that their back ends up against your chest and their arms are folded across their stomach. [3] X Research source Hold hands loosely while doing the “sweetheart” so that it's easier to maneuver from one position to another."

      "content": "Practice doing basic dips with your partner. Spin your partner out counter-clockwise. As you pull them back in, take their right hand and put it on your lower back. Put your right hand on the small of their back, squat slightly to rest your weight your hips and legs, then dip them back over your right knee. [4] X Research source If you're the partner, leave your right leg on the ground, bend your left leg up so it's parallel to your dipped torso, and arch your back. Dips require a bit of trust! If you're the leader, make sure you keep a firm grip on your partner so they feel secure."

      "content": "Practice the “spin out” to spin your partner several times in succession. Start with the “sweetheart” move, then spin your partner out by continuing to hold hands while they basically spin away from your body. If you're being led, you'll stop spinning once your and your partner's arms are fully extended. If you're the leader, then pull them back in, and spin them out a second time. At the end of the second spin, release their hand so they can make a full 360-degree spin on their own. [5] X Research source For a fun addition to this move, slap hands on first the left side (your left hand and their right hand) and then again on the right after your partner completes their full spin."

      "content": "Do a corkscrew for a fun variation while you're dancing. If you are leading, squat down on your knees while facing your partner so that your face is about equal to their waist. Reach behind their back with your right hand and grab their left wrist from behind. Then simultaneously stand up as you guide their wrist up and over their head. Your partner will let their body follow their guided arm and will spin outward and away from you. [6] X Research source This move is also often called a behind the back pass. From the corkscrew, you can enter into multiple different spins, dips, and tucks, so it's a fun move to learn to bulk up your dancing repertoire."

      "content": "Try the pretzel for a move that doesn't require any flips or lifts. Look up some videos of the pretzel online—it's a twisty, tricky move that can be hard to get down. The step-by-step breakdown follows: [7] X Research source Stand facing your partner while holding hands. If you're the leader, step to the right side of your partner and lift your left hand up while still holding theirs. Turn away from your partner and twist your arms so that your arms are behind your back. Twist your partners arms and position your bodies so you are standing back-to-back. Lift your right arm while holding their left hand, and bring it down over their head, and then back up over your head while you start to turn back around to face each other. Bring your hands down in front of you. You should be back in your original starting positions, facing one another."

      "content": "Incorporate your various moves for a fun freestyle dance. Remember to pay attention to the beat of the music and know that you can always return to the two-step if you start feeling like the song is getting away from you. Most importantly, have fun! [8] X Research source You can also learn how to do backflips, trust falls, and between-the-legs moves for even more advanced options, though it's recommended that you work with a professional and have someone around to spot you and your partner before doing these more dangerous (and fun!) moves."

      "content": "Move in time with the music and with others to line dance . You don't need a partner for line dancing—just the ability to count along to the beat of the music! Generally, you will move in a predictable pattern and turn periodically to face all 4 walls of the building. Try following these steps for a basic line dance: [9] X Research source Move your right foot out to the side on beat 1. Cross your left foot behind it on beat 2. Bring your right foot back out on beat 3. Stomp your right foot on beat 4. Move back to the left by moving your left foot to the side on beat 1. Follow the same steps listed above, but in reverse, by moving your right foot behind the left, moving the left foot back out, and stomping it on beat 4. Follow the crowd for signals as to when you take a few steps backwards and turn."
