To check, head over to https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com or https://downdetector.com , enter the domain name (for example, wikiHow.com), and click the blue button. If the site is up and running, you'll see \"It's just you.\" If there's something wrong with the site, you'll see confirmation that it is down. If the website is down, there's not much you can do until it comes back up. Check back after a while to see if anything changes. If you know the site is back up but you still can't access it, clear your browser cache and then try again. Sometimes, the site may be up and running, but a network issue may prevent your computer from connecting to and loading the page. If the site isn't down, read on to keep troubleshooting."
