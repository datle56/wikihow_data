      "content": "Get free fruit from seasonal events. Blox Fruits has a number of seasonal events, and you can get free fruits from some of these events. The only downside is that you have to wait for that event to happen again, which is only once per year. These events are as follows: Christmas: Held in December. During the Christmas Event, players can get Holiday Gifts from the North Pole island (a temporary island added to each sea during the event). [1] X Research source Holiday Gifts can give out Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, and Mythical fruits. [2] X Research source Halloween: Held in October. During the Halloween Event, you can exchange Bones with the Death King for a number of rewards, including a \"Random Surprise.\" [3] X Research source If you pick Random Surprise, there's an 8% chance you'll get a random Blox Fruit. Bones can be obtained year-round by killing certain NPCs, but you can only exchange them for a surprise during Halloween. Valentine's Day: Held in February. During the Valentine's event, you can exchange Hearts for Blox Fruits at the Event Shop. Hearts are earned when you defeat an enemy that is either 100 levels higher or 100 levels lower than your level. The cost of an item (in Hearts) depends on the rarity of said item. For example, Rocket cost 50 Hearts while Control costs 3,200 Hearts. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Hacks and glitches to get fruits exist, but it's best to avoid them.",
      "content": "Hacks and glitches to get fruits exist, but it's best to avoid them. Using hacks and glitches to get free fruits illegitimately is against Blox Fruits's rules, so you could get in trouble if you're caught. These hacks and glitches are also often fixed or blocked, so they aren't a reliable way to get fruits. If a hack states that you need to send money or download something to make it work, avoid it—it's more than likely a scam. Many videos promising to show glitches of how to get free Blox Fruits don't actually show how to complete the glitch. These videos instruct players to take a lot of steps to do the glitch, which is more than likely a way to make the video long enough for monetization and also to increase viewer retention time."
