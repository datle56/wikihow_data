[1] X Research source For example, legacy.com provides free access to obituaries from newspapers in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Bermuda, Australia, and New Zealand. [2] X Research source You can run a simple search with just the person's first and last name, or you can narrow your search by limiting the time, or by specifying the country and state, county, or region. Legacy.com also allows keyword searches, which could be particularly helpful if you were unsure what name was used in someone's obituary. [3] X Research source Legacy.com only includes obituaries as far back as February of 2001.

      "content": "Search for funeral home death notices. If a funeral home was used, you can find an online database of official funeral home death notices at obitsforlife.com. Obitsforlife.com allows you to search by name or location for death notices, or you can conduct a keyword search. In addition to funeral homes in North America, the website includes global death notices from countries such as Brazil, India, the Philippines, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Death notices on obitsforlife.com can only be uploaded by licensed funeral homes, so authenticity is assured. At the same time, the site's database only includes listings from funeral homes that are members of the site, so results may be somewhat limited in that respect."

The National Archives has information about vital records, including death records, and links to websites with free databases of death notices and records.
