      "content": "Lift your right hand with your fingers open or first two fingers together. Many worshippers make the sign of the cross with an open hand, their five fingers reminding them of the five wounds of Christ. Others raise the index and middle fingers together, symbolizing Christ's divine and human natures. [2] X Research source The thumb is often bent to touch the ring finger in the two-finger position. Many other hand shapes are also in use. There is no requirement to make a specific hand shape, but most leaders encourage you to follow your congregation's tradition unless you derive a spiritual benefit from another form."

Some people place it on their chest instead, as in the Western tradition. [8] X Research source In the Orthodox tradition, some people are concerned that touching your chest makes an inverted cross, with a short lower end. Instead of touching your chest or stomach, you can bring your hand all the way to touch the ground. This is sometimes used during the Great Fast of Easter, or in times of great trial."

One common one asks you to approach the Gospels with an open mind, confess them with your mouth, and safeguard it in your heart."

The basic sign of the cross involves touching your fingers to your forehead, then your chest or stomach, followed by your left (or right) shoulder, and finally the opposite shoulder. However, there are a number of variations, including differences in how you hold your hands and which shoulder you touch first. Typically, the “correct” way to cross yourself is to follow what the rest of the congregation does when you’re at a religious service. The only truly “wrong” way to cross yourself is to do it without reverence for the act."
