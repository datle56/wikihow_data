      "content": "Measure your band size. Put on a non-padded bra or go braless to take this measurement. Use a flexible measuring tape to measure right below your bust line where your bra band will go. If you get a partial measurement, go to the closest whole number. For an even number, add 4 inches (10 cm) to the total. For an odd number, add 5 inches (13 cm). The resulting number is your band size. [1] X Research source For example, if you measure 35 inches (89 cm), your band size is 40. If you measure 36 inches (91 cm), your band size is 40. If you measure 32.3 inches (82 cm), your band size is 36. If you get a bra with a smaller band size, then you’ll likely end up with bra bulge."

      "title": "Get your bust measurement.",
      "content": "Get your bust measurement. While wearing a non-padded bra or going braless, position a flexible measuring tape across the largest part of your breasts, usually at the nipples. Measure around your back to get the whole circumference and bust number. Again, round your measurement to the nearest whole number. [2] X Research source For example, if you measure 40.3 inches (102 cm), then your bust number is 40. Bring this number with you when shopping to find your cup size ."

      "content": "Stop wearing any bras with a poor fit. If your breasts spill out of the cups at the tops or sides, then the cup measurement is too small. If the straps are cutting into your shoulders, then the cups or band size is off. With a good fitting bra, you should be able to use the middle hook fastener. [3] X Research source If only the last hook will clasp, then the bra is too small and is likely causing bulge, too. Choosing a bra that fits you right will also make it more comfortable to wear on a daily basis."

      "content": "Do an incline chest fly. Lie back on an incline bench, placing your feet firmly on the ground. Hold a single dumbbell in each hand and position your arms directly out in front of your body. Keeping your arms locked and straight, slowly move them out to your sides. Then, pull them back in to the starting position. Repeat for at least 1 minute. [4] X Research source Adjust the weight of your dumbbells so that you break a sweat and are challenged, but can still complete your exercise sets. Many people start out with dumbbells weighing between 5 to 7 pounds (2.3 to 3.2 kg). Make sure to keep your wrists and elbows locked or you’ll lose the benefit of the exercise. This move is good for strengthening your pec and shoulder muscles, which can create a more toned appearance. [5] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 7 May 2021."

      "content": "Perform a front bar raise. In a standing position, place your feet shoulder width apart and slightly bend your knees. Place your hands shoulder-width apart on a weighted bar and keep your arms straight. Swing your arms outward and upwards until the bar is higher than your shoulders. Slowly return the bar to its starting position. Repeat this exercise for as many reps as you’d like. Most people start with 6-10 reps and build up from there. Start with the bar itself and add weight as you progress. To get even more benefit from this exercise, exhale as you lift up and inhale as you go back down. This helps to keep oxygenated blood pumping to your muscles."

      "content": "Do at least 5 pushup holds. Place yourself in a traditional pushup position on an exercise mat. Push yourself up off the mat using your arm muscles and check that your entire body is flexed into a straight line. Then, slowly bend your elbows until you are just slightly off the mat. Hold this position for a single inhale and flex your arm muscles to rise half-way up again. Hold once more before lowering again. [6] X Research source If possible, repeat this pattern at least 5 times. You can always do more once you are used to the exercise. Never fully relaxing into the mat keeps your shoulders and back flexed, which helps with toning. In the starting pushup position, your feet should be spaced hip-width apart. Your hands should be placed just outside of shoulder-width apart with your palms flat on the mat."

      "content": "Jump rope for 1-3 minutes. Put your knees and feet together and hold the rope’s handles. Position the rope so that it’s barely touching the back of your heels. Look forward with your chin slightly tucked in. Swing the rope around and jump as it nears your feet. Continue for 1-3 minutes at the fastest pace that you can sustain without tripping on the rope. [7] X Research source Jumping rope is not only great cardio, it helps to tone your upper body, especially your shoulders and back. If you are no longer fatigued by extended jumping rope sets, try jumping while wearing wrist weights. Using a weighted rope can boost the toning action, too."

      "content": "Massage your upper back with a foam roller. Lie on your back on an exercise mat with your knees bent and feet flat. Position the roller under your back right at your bra line. Touch your hands to the back of your head and relax your neck. Then, flex your thigh muscles to move your body back and forth over the roller. [10] X Research source Just roll the space between your bra line and the tops of your shoulders. Massaging this area helps to improve blood flow and flexibility in between exercise sessions. Start by doing 10-20 rolls and build up over time. If you want an even deeper massage, bend your arms with your elbows angled toward the sky."

      "content": "Get a surgical bra back lift. This plastic surgery procedure is a very extreme measure where a surgeon cuts away any excess back weight or skin. Patients who have undergone this procedure usually end up with a scar on each side of their back running parallel to their bra line. While the results often last for years, it does have the same serious risks of any cosmetic surgery, such as bleeding. [11] X Research source Make sure to talk over all of your options with your doctor before agreeing to any type of surgery. When speaking with the plastic surgeon, ask them to outline all of the potential risks of the procedure. This surgery is often used as an alternative to liposuction, as it also removes any excess skin."
