      "content": "Decide how wide you want the top strip of your hair to be. Pick a place above your temples where you want to keep your hair long. You can choose to make it as wide or as narrow as you want. Make sure you choose the same place on each side of your head to make the top look even. [2] X Research source Narrower strips of hair on top of your head are referred to as high and tight recon cuts."

      "title": "Use a #1 or #2 guard on your hair clippers.",
      "content": "Use a #1 or #2 guard on your hair clippers. Snap the guard onto your clippers and turn them on. The number on the guards corresponds to the length of the hair left, where #1 leaves 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) with each number using 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) increments. [3] X Research source If you have longer hair, start with a larger blade guard and work your way down towards a shorter cut. Or, if you hair is at least a few inches long, then you can gather it with your hands in 1 or more sections and cut it with shears before cleaning it up with clippers. This will make it easier to remove the majority of your hair. If you want the sides and back close to the skin, use the clippers without a guard."

      "content": "Trim up your scalp towards the top strip of hair. Start at your neckline on 1 side and work up to where you want the strip of hair to start. Go slow as you get close to the top hair to cut it precise. Work from 1 side of your head to the other, checking a wall-mounted mirror and a handheld mirror to make sure you’re cutting the sides evenly. [4] X Research source Ask someone to help cut the hair on the back of your head if you have difficulty reaching or seeing it yourself."

      "title": "Shave",
      "content": "Shave the sides and back with a razor for a “whitewall” look. Trim your hair short with clippers without using an attachment first. Then apply a clear shave gel to the sides and back of your head. Use short upward strokes, rinsing off your razor occasionally. Watch yourself using a wall-mounted and handheld mirror to make sure you shave all the hair. Use a straight razor for the closest, cleanest shave."

      "title": "Wet your hair down with a spray bottle of water.",
      "content": "Wet your hair down with a spray bottle of water. Spray your hair until it’s damp to the touch, but not so it’s dripping wet. Go through your hair with a wide-toothed comb to spread the water so your hair is easier to manage. [5] X Research source If you spray too much water, dry your hair off with a towel."

Pull your hair to the length you want on top and snip it with the barber scissors. Use this section as your guide, and work across the top of your head to maintain the same hair length.

      "content": "Use clippers for the easiest haircut. Attach the #2 or #3 guard to your clippers to keep your hair slightly longer than the sides. Run the clippers through your hair to cut it all to the same length easily. [7] X Research source Work in long strokes from the front of your head towards the back for the smoothest cut."

      "content": "Fade the top into the sides if you want a smooth transition. Use a guard the next size up from the 1 you used on your sides. Trim up from the side, pulling the clippers towards you as you work. This helps add a smooth transition between your long and short hair. [8] X Research source High and tight cuts typically have a clear distinction between the top and sides, so a fade is not necessary if you don’t want one."

      "content": "Work pomade or styling wax into the front and top. Rub a fingertip-sized amount of product between your fingers to warm it up before running it through your hair. Work the pomade near your roots and pull it toward the tips. Pull the hair in the front to the side or into your preferred style. [9] X Research source Styling products can be purchased from your local salon or the hair care aisle at a big box store."

Use the number attachment you prefer to keep your haircut short and clean. [11] X Research source The time between trims may vary depending on how fast your hair grows, which is usually about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) per month."
