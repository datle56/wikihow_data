      "title": "Choose a match.",
      "content": "Choose a match. Some Sims are more compatible than others, based on their personalities and interests. Two Sims can still marry even if they have difficult traits or conflicts — but it might take a while, and the marriage might not necessarily be a happy one. Be strategic about where you look for possible dates. For example, if your Sim is interested in books, check at the bookstore or library. The romance will go faster if a Sim has one of these traits: Charismatic, Friendly, Flirty, or Hopeless Romantic. [1] X Research source A Sim with Commitment Issues or Unflirty will be a difficult partner, but not impossible."

      "content": "Learn about teen romance. If you want two Teens to start a relationship, there are a few things you should know first: Teens can start a romance with another Teen, but cannot get married until they both age up to Young Adult. When one teen ages to Young Adult, options for romantic interaction with the Teen will disappear. You can continue the romance once the Teen ages. However, they will still be listed as \"Boyfriend\", \"Girlfriend\" or \"Romantic Interest\"."

      "content": "Become friends with the other Sims. Select one of the Sims and have him or her interact with the other. The Sims 3 gives a large number of social options. Try starting with a few conversation topics, then move on to other positive Social interactions. You might have a few setbacks along the way, but it should only take a few meetings to become Acquaintances, then Friends. Whenever you can, choose conversation options based on the other Sim's traits. A Vehicle Enthusiast enjoys talking about cars, and a Technophobe will hate talking about electronics. Relationships decrease over time. Invite the Sim over the next day to keep your forward momentum."

Try this early on so you know the other Sim's relationship status. A Sim that's already in a relationship is usually much harder to impress, but it will still be possible to woo them. If you do succeed in breaking up the Sim's relationship, both Sims will lose a massive amount of relationship with the former partner. Decide whether it's worth it before you continue."
