      "content": "You'll need to know the range your IP address is a part of to find its subnet mask. Unfortunately, you can't determine the correct subnet just by looking at an IP address. Each IPv4 subnet has a subnet mask, also known as a netmask, which is basically an alias for the range of IP addresses allocated to that network. If you use a subnet mask that isn't correct for your IP range, your device won't be able to access the internet. [1] X Research source If your IP address is assigned automatically , so is your subnet mask. In this case, if you're connected to the internet, don't worry about finding or changing your subnet mask. But, if you're setting up a static IP address that isn't assigned automatically, you'll need to find the right subnet mask to get online. The easiest way to find out what subnet mask you should be using is to ask your network administrator. If that's not possible right now, read on!"

You can use the instructions in this article to find the IP address and subnet mask for other Windows , Linux , macOS , Android , and iOS devices on the network and simply use the same subnet mask. This is not foolproof, as network administrators can divide up IP ranges into many subnets. But for smaller networks, this might be all you need to do to find the subnet mask. Once signed in, compare the other device's IP address to your static IP. Do they appear to be in the same range or from a similar-sized range? If so, using that device's subnet mask might work. For example, if your static IP address is 192.168.0.5 and the other device is 192.168.0.12, having the first three octets in common means you're likely on the same subnet. However, subnets can be broken up in a multitude of ways so there's a chance your network administrator has sub-divided the network even further."

      "content": "Once you know the range of IP addresses (or you think you can guess it), use a subnet calculator or cheat sheet to find the subnet mask. There's no need to do complicated math to calculate the subnet mask once you have the range thanks to these handy tools: Spiceworks' Subnet Calculator is easy to use if you know the IP range. Just enter the first and last IP addresses in the range, then choose 1 as the number of subnets (if you're sure the range you've entered is a single subnet). Subnet Calculator and Cheat Sheet provides a subnet mask based on a starting IP address and its associated CIDR notation, which is a special value that explains how many addresses are in that range. If you're not sure what to enter here, just refer to the CIDR cheat sheet at the bottom of the tool. For example, if you're working with a range of 256 IP addresses (a common subnet size for homes and small offices), you'll use /24 . For /24 ranges, the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0. The cheat sheet at the bottom is also helpful if you just want to try to guess the subnet mask based on the presumed size of the subnet. For example, you'll see that when a subnet contains 1024 IP addresses, its mask will be 255.255.252.0, which is /22 in CIDR notation."
