      "content": "Enter some instructions. Once your GPT chatbot has a name, GPT Builder will ask you some questions to fine-tune its behavior. You'll have a chance to upload documents and give more precise instructions later, but for now, continue interacting with GPT Builder in the left panel as prompted. As you keep adjusting the instructions, issue prompts into the Preview panel to make sure your GPT answers how it should. For example, if your GPT is aimed at youth and the bot's responses aren't age-appropriate, you can tell GPT Builder to tailor responses to a specific age group. You may ask the bot to be less wordy, sound more professional, change its tone, and more."
