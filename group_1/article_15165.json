      "content": "Melt down your desired amount of white candy melts. Fill a microwave-safe bowl or candy melting pot with 1 bag of candy melts, or however many are needed for your recipe of choice. If you’re using a candy melting pot, turn your device to the “melt” setting, or the highest temperature available. Stir the candy melts for about 10 minutes, or until the melts have completely liquefied. [2] X Research source If you’re using a microwave, heat your bowl of candy melts for 1 minute at 40% power. If your microwave doesn’t let you change the power level, use the defrost setting instead. Search online or in your local craft store to find mini melting pots designed for candy melts. Use a double boiler if you don’t have a candy melter or microwave."

      "content": "Stir in 2-3 drops of oil-based food coloring. Add just a few drops of an oil-based food coloring into your bowl or container of melted candy melts, then stir the liquid into the melts. [3] X Research source Try not to use traditional, alcohol-based food coloring for your candy melts, as this could cause the mixture to seize. You can find oil-based food coloring online."

      "content": "Add more coloring to deepen the hue. It's much easier to darken the color than to lighten it, so incorporate the first few drops of food coloring well before deciding if you need more. You can also mix shades. For instance, add blue and red to make purple or yellow and blue to make green."

      "content": "Opt for white, yellow, or orange melts with red to create pink or coral. Create a coral shade by melting red, orange, and yellow melts at a 1:1:1 ratio. If you’d like to make a rosy pink color, mix 1 red candy melt with 3 white candy melts. [4] X Research source For instance, if you were making a large batch of rosy pink candy melts, you could mix 6 red melts with 18 white melts."

      "content": "Use pink, yellow, and white melts to make new shades of orange. Mix orange and white candy melts at a 1:2 ratio when adding them into your melting pot or microwave-safe bowl. To create a more vibrant orange color, fill your melting container halfway with both yellow and pink melts. You can also create a more subtle shade of orange by mixing orange and pink melts together at a 2:1 ratio. [5] X Research source For example, to make a large batch of light orange candy melts, you could mix 20 orange melts and 40 white melts together."

Additionally, you can make a turquoise mixture with 4 regular blue melts and 1 dark green melt.
