If you find yourself in a Jungle, Mushroom Fields, Dripstone Caves, or other biomes not supported for villages, don't waste your time looking. [1] X Research source Minecraft worlds are randomly generated, and every player's world is different. They also tend to be sparsely scattered throughout the world. Villages are often made of wood planks and cobblestone, and tend to stand out from their surrounding areas."
