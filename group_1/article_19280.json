      "content": "Some people can dish criticism, but they have a hard time taking it. If this person has an inflated ego, any small negative comparison or critique will cut them to their core. We’re not advising going out of your way to insult them for the fun of it, but when they make a mistake—especially one that affects you—don’t beat around the bush to protect their ego. Point out their bad behavior or let them know when they’ve gotten something wrong to remind them they’re not perfect. [2] X Research source You don’t have to be mean, pointed, or sassy when you deliver your criticism. Keep an even and polite tone like you would for anyone else—they’ll still be irritated by it. Prepare for them to lash out to defend themselves. They may try to criticize you back or blame their shortcomings on something else."

      "title": "Manipulative or toxic people often feel safest when they’re in control.",
      "content": "Manipulative or toxic people often feel safest when they’re in control. They need constant validation and approval, and they fear strong individuals and authority figures because they’re the ones that can give (or not give) it to them. Take control of your interactions with this person and be assertive , make strong eye contact , and speak with a steady, unwavering voice. People who stand up for themselves make controlling people truly miserable. It can be intimidating to stand up to a controlling person, but you’re more likely to gain their respect when you fill the role of a superior rather than an equal. For extra impact, position yourself as a leader on a team at work, in a group project, or on a sports team or planning committee. Your status will intimidate and aggravate this person."

      "content": "Some people expect you to do whatever they want, whenever they want. They think everything revolves around them and are absolutely floored when someone sticks up for themselves and tells them “no.” Stay calm and deny their ludicrous requests for special treatment or favors. They’ll try to change your mind, so stay persistent. They will feel less powerful when you don’t yield to them. [3] X Research source For example, say “no” when they tell you to run an errand for them to empower yourself and draw a boundary around what you’re willing to do."

      "content": "People who crave attention panic when you stop giving it to them. They’ll never understand why someone would ignore or reject them because in their mind, they’re flawless. Don’t answer their calls, texts, or DMs, and avoid interacting with or speaking to them in public when possible. They’ll feel defeated when they realize they can’t trigger an emotional response out of you whenever they want. When you ignore them, they may try to reach out to you excessively. It might be satisfying to watch them flounder at first, but their messages will turn uglier and more hurtful the longer you hold out. If your goal is to break off your relationship with this person entirely, this is the best route to go."

      "content": "Shattering their public image may make them behave better. If this person tends to lie or gaslight you in front of others, call them out. Say, “You’ll do anything to make yourself seem right.” When they lie again to defend themselves, call them out again (“See? You’re doing it again.”). Show evidence in the form of texts or emails if you can so they don't get away with lying. [4] X Research source You may feel guilty, but standing up for yourself and focusing on the facts—not their version of reality—isn’t mean. It’s possible this person will feel humiliated and try to humiliate you back. Be prepared for insults and false claims about your character or actions."

      "title": "Some people fear direct competition because of their need to be the best.",
      "content": "Some people fear direct competition because of their need to be the best. That’s partly why they work so hard to tear people down—they want others to feel less competent, less capable, less skilled, or less valuable than them. Refuse to let them intimidate you and shut them down by outperforming them in something they value highly. At work, this could be something like selling more products than them, earning a promotion over them, or becoming employee of the month. In school, this might look like earning higher grades , being elected leader of a club they’re in, or cultivating a good relationship with a teacher they like. In your personal or social life, you can network with more influential people, grow a larger social media following, or build stronger relationships than them."

      "content": "Some people will do anything if they think it will benefit them. People with an inflated ego often want to cultivate a positive image so other people will think highly of them. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can get an egotistical person to do you a favor by explaining how the task will make them look good or telling them they’re the best person for the job. They’ll go along with it to earn praise and validation (and they’ll probably convince themselves it was their idea in the first place, too). Try phrasing your requests like: “The boss will be so impressed with you if you can cover my shift this weekend.” “Can you help decorate for the gala? You just have an eye for design that no one else has.” “You’ll be an absolute hero if you can pick me up from the airport next week!”"

      "content": "They’ll leave you alone if they can’t get you emotionally riled up. You can get a manipulative or energy-draining person off your back by “gray rocking” —refusing to react to anything they do or say. Act as boring, uninteresting, and mild-mannered as possible. They’ll get bored and irritated when they realize you have nothing to offer them and that they can’t get a rise out of you. [7] X Research source Some toxic folks like to stir up drama for fun or because they want emotional reactions or personal information to use against you later. If they can’t get these, they’ll leave you alone."

Feeling good about yourself is the antidote to someone whose goal was to control you and bring you down. Forgive this person for their behavior—and move on. Even if they don’t suffer consequences for hurting you, it helps you release the negativity they’ve created and forget about them. [8] X Research source Instead of worrying about getting revenge on this person, focus on your goals , dreams , and personal fulfillment. Doesn’t it feel better not to care what this person thinks?"
