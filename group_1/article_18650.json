[1] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 6 December 2019. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in either hand at your sides, with your arms fully extended and your palms turned in. Curl the dumbbells to your chest, then slowly lower them back down. [2] X Research source Perform 1 set of between 12-15 reps. Increase to 2 sets after a week or 2. After that, increase the weight of the dumbbells. Throw in some bicep curl variations , like the reverse grip (hold the dumbbells with your palms facing away from you) or the hammer curl (hold the dumbbells like ski poles) for a more extensive workout. Alternatively, use kettlebells or barbells . [3] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 6 December 2019."

      "content": "Do inclined dumbbell curls to push your biceps to the limit. Sit on a workout chair at a 45-degree incline. Place your feet on the floor and hold the dumbbells at your sides with your arms fully extended downward. Curl one dumbbell at a time, alternating arms, until the dumbbell is level with your shoulder and your elbow is totally bent, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position. [4] X Research source Perform 2 sets of between 6 and 8 reps. Increase to 3 sets after a couple weeks, then add more weight as you get stronger. Use a lighter weight for this exercise than you use for regular dumbbell curls; the inclined position makes it more difficult to lift, so your biceps are still getting a great workout. This exercise hyperextends your shoulder to stretch both portions of your biceps brachii (the 2-pronged muscle that make up your biceps), which more effectively builds muscle."

      "content": "Perform concentration curls to isolate your biceps in a workout. Sit on an exercise bench with your feet flat on the ground and knees spread. Lean forward so that your elbow touches the inside of your knee, and your arm is fully extended downward, holding the dumbbell near the floor. Slowly curl the dumbbell toward your chest, keeping your elbow in place, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to its starting position. [5] X Research source Perform 2 sets of between 6 and 8 reps, then repeat with your left arm. Place your free hand on your knee for stability, but avoid using either of your knees for leverage during the curl, which may lessen the intensity. Like the name implies, concentration curls isolate your biceps as the primary “movers” in the workout, making for a more intense lift that boosts growth."

      "content": "Do pull-ups to work your biceps’ full range of motion. Grip a pull-up bar with your hands placed shoulder-width apart and your palms facing you. Cross your feet and lift your body until your chin is higher than your hands. Slowly lower your body back to the starting position. [6] X Research source Perform 2 sets of 6-8 reps, and increase to 8-12 reps and 3 sets once you have gained strength. Chin-ups engage your biceps’ entire range of motion, activating them more fully and allowing for a more thorough workout than just curls alone. Grip the bar with your palms facing away from you, and vary the width of your grip to target every portion of your biceps, as well as other muscle groups. To increase the intensity of this exercise, wear a weighted belt. Add more weight as you get stronger over time. If a pull-up is too difficult for you right now, start with a dead hang; grip the pull-up bar, lift your feet off the ground, and hang with your arms straight for 10 seconds. Reader Poll: We asked 409 wikiHow readers and 57% of them agreed that pull-ups are the most challenging exercise to perform.

      "content": "Perform pectoral flies to enhance your bicep exercises. Lie on a bench so that your head, torso, and rear are all supported, and your feet are flat on the floor. Hold the dumbbells straight up over your chest, elbows bent slightly, then slowly lower your arms out to the sides—only as far as you can comfortably manage while still being able to lift them again. Exhale and bring the dumbbells back together over your chest in an arched motion. [7] X Research source Do a single set of 6-8 flies, or as many as you can comfortably perform, up to 10. Once you’ve built some strength, perform 2 more sets with 5-minute breaks in between. This exercise works out your pectoral muscles as well as your biceps, and helps you create a strong foundation for a safe, successful bicep workout. Incorporate pectoral fly exercises into either your bicep workout or additional strength training workouts on days you rest your biceps."

Set your feet so that your legs are straight back behind you with your toes on the ground. Keeping your head, neck, and spine in a straight line, slowly lower yourself so that your arms are bent at 90 degrees, then raise yourself again—take 2 seconds to go down and 1 second to go up. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Perform as many reps as you can while maintaining proper form, gradually increasing as you become stronger. Push-ups help build strength in the shoulders , chest and triceps, all of which work in conjunction with the biceps and make your arms bigger. Incorporate push-ups in your regular workout routine as a body-weight exercise to help build up your supporting muscle groups. Place your hands in a diamond shape to target your triceps. Place your hands wider, so that your elbows nearly make a 90-degree angle when raised, to target your chest."

      "content": "Add stretching to your routine to speed the recovery process. Stretching is important to help your muscles loosen up and repair after a workout. Plus, stretching helps build muscle mass by loosening and tearing muscle fibers, which then grow back stronger. [9] X Research source Add upper-body stretches to your routine , such as yoga, to make sure that your biceps and supporting muscle groups are all getting the attention they deserve. Perform arm-specific static stretches, but also perform whole-body stretching exercises to provide a more inclusive, comprehensive stretch for all the muscles worked in your routine, including smaller supporting muscles."

      "content": "Train your biceps 2 or 3 days a week. Don’t lift every day! You might think that working out every day will lead to bigger biceps, but your muscles actually get bigger and stronger during the resting period in between workouts, when they have time to recover. Start training your biceps 2 days a week, then increase to 3 days as you get stronger. [10] X Research source Give each muscle group at least 1 day to recover in between workouts. Work out other parts of your body on the days you aren't doing arm training."

      "content": "Go all in on weight, not reps. Lifting a heavy weight several times will do more for you than lifting a light weight many times. To start, lift the heaviest weights you can lift for 12-15 reps to make your sessions as high-intensity as possible. Bodybuilders call this method \"training to failure,\" because you should be training with weights heavy enough that you eventually can't complete another rep. [12] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Find your \"train to failure\" weight by choosing a weight you can curl no more than 12-15 times before experiencing too much muscle fatigue to keep lifting. If you're able to complete several sets without breaking a sweat or \"failing,\" increase the weight. If you can only lift it a few times, decrease the weight. Your train to failure weight will gradually increase as you gain muscle strength. Add weight in 1–2 pounds (0.45–0.91 kg) increments every week or so, using the same standard to determine whether you're lifting too much weight or too little."

      "content": "Use the proper form to maximize gains and avoid injury. Your train-to-failure weight is also a weight you can lift while using the proper form. Using the right form keeps your biceps from getting injured and promotes speedier, more thorough muscle building, without setbacks. [13] X Research source Don't use momentum to lift the weights; use controlled movements. Lower them slowly rather than letting them drop quickly. If you find that you can't complete more than a few reps without losing your good form, you're lifting too much weight. Start with a lighter weight and build up your strength. Take 1- to 2-minute breaks between sets to let your muscles rest."

      "content": "Prioritize nutrients over calories. When you're training a lot, make sure you get plenty of calories for energy, but eating too many calories can create a layer of fat on your body that will obscure the muscles you're working so hard to build. By focusing on nutrient-rich foods over high-calorie foods, you get the energy you need without overeating. [14] X Research source Opt for dishes with plenty of vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, poultry and whole grains. Avoid alcohol, sugary sweets, and deep-fried or breaded foods. Drink plenty of water to keep your body hydrated and ease your hunger pangs after working out."
