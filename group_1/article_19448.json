      "content": "Try a dairy mask. Another natural method for lightening freckles is to apply a milk-based mask to your face and let it soak into your skin. The lactic acid in milk peels away the top layer of skin, making freckles lighter in appearance. This method is better for natural freckles than sun-induced freckles. Spread 1/4 cup of sour cream over the areas most affected by freckles. Let the sour cream soak into your skin for 10 minutes, then rinse it away with cool water and pat dry. Use a whole milk wash. Simply pour some whole milk into a bowl and rub it over your face. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse your face with cool water and pat dry"

      "content": "Make a fruit peel. Mixing fruits together and letting them dry on your skin is a natural way to peel away the top layer of skin to lighten the appearance of your freckles. The sticky fruit bonds with the skin and helps it gently peel away. Mash up strawberries and a kiwi in a bowl. Rub the mixture over your face, concentrating in the areas where you have the most freckles. Let the mixture dry completely, which should take about 20 minutes. Peel the fruit away and rinse your skin with cool water. [1] X Research source Try cucumbers or apricots as a substitute for strawberries or kiwis."

      "content": "Use lemon juice. Lemon juice is a natural bleaching agent that can be used to make freckles look lighter and disappear. It works best on natural freckles, rather than freckles caused by sun exposure, since those tend to be darker and less uniform in appearance. Buy a few fresh lemons and squeeze the juice into a bowl. You can also use pre-squeezed lemon juice. Dip a cotton ball in the lemon juice and apply it to your face in the freckled area. Let the lemon juice soak into your skin for 10 minutes, then rinse it off with cool water. [2] X Research source Apply lemon juice every day to lighten your freckles over time. Caution: Lemon juice can cause skin irritation and may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. This is especially try if you have sensitive skin. [3] X Research source As such, it might be best to try less harsh treatments before lemon juice."

      "title": "Use a lightening cream.",
      "content": "Use a lightening cream. Drugstores and beauty stores carry skin-lightening creams with a variety of different ingredient bases that are designed to remove freckles and other dark spots. Skin lightening creams may be effective for both natural and sun-related freckles. For best results, apply it every day. Look for a cream with licorice extract, which has been shown to have skin-lightening properties. Aloe is another popular ingredient in lightening creams. It can help lighten and moisturize the skin without causing damage. Be careful with creams that contain chemicals like hydroquinone and oxybenzone. These ingredients may help lighten skin, but they can also be damaging. Read up on the side effects and test the product in a less sensitive area before you decide to use a cream containing these ingredients. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "See a dermatologist for a chemical peel. [6] X Research source Peeling away the top layer of skin is an effective way to reduce the appearance of freckles, and may even lead to the elimination of lighter freckles. Chemical peels are usually used on the face, but they can also be used on the arms and hands. Chemical peels come in three different strengths: superficial peels, which use alpha or beta hydroxy acids to remove the top layer of skin; medium peels, which use trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to penetrate deeper into the skin and remove more layers; and deep peels, which use high concentrations of trichloroacetic acid or phenol to remove even more layers of skin. After getting a chemical peel, your skin will take 2 - 3 days to heal from the procedure. It is not recommended to get chemical peels too often, since they are hard on the body. One study showed that TCA (70%) and phenol (80%) are effective at removing most or all freckles.

      "content": "Get laser treatment. [8] X Research source Lasers can be used to burn the blood vessels just underneath the freckles, reducing their appearance or removing them entirely. The procedure is not known to have any long-term damaging effects, but it may cause temporary bruising, redness and swelling. Laser treatments are typically administered in 3 or so 10 to 15 minute sessions. The skin is pre-treated with a cool spray to make sure the heat of the laser doesn't cause the patient pain."

      "content": "Protect yourself from the sun. Some people are born with freckles, but many others develop them over time as a result of sun exposure. They may fade during the winter, but they come back darker every summer if you don't take precautions to keep the sun's rays off of your skin. Use plenty of SPF 30 or higher sunscreen on your face, neck, and body and reapply it every hour, or more often if you are swimming or sweating. [9] X Research source Wear a hat and other protective clothing. Sunscreen can only go so far to protect your skin from the sun. Having a layer of clothing over your skin is a much more effective way to prevent freckles from forming. Wear light, airy long-sleeved shirts and pants during the summer to keep cool and protect your skin at the same time."

[10] X Research source Citrus fruits, kiwis, spinach, and other leafy greens are all excellent sources of vitamin C. Start your day with a burst of vitamin C with a fruit and vegetable smoothie. Add a kiwi, a nectarine, and a cup of raw spinach to your blender. Puree the produce with almond milk or another healthy base. Vitamin C supplements are another option you can choose to make sure you're getting enough. Take pure vitamin C or a multivitamin that contains it."

      "content": "Use a cream foundation. This type of foundation is great for people with dry skin. Choose a color slightly lighter than the color of your freckles.

Applying a small amount of powder over the foundation helps it set and stay in place all day. Avoid the temptation to apply more than one layer of foundation. You may end up drawing extra attention to the areas you'd like to cover."
