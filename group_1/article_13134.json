Disney fans call this the “rope drop,” and the festivity involves Mickey and all his friends. Cast Members choose a family to be a part of this tradition and will even get a private tour of Main Street before the park opens. [1] X Research source How Cast Members choose the family of the day is still a mystery, but based on past family picks, here are a few ways to increase your chances: Get to the park at least an hour early. Skip early morning dining reservations so you’re present for the opening. Be enthusiastic, and don’t be afraid to show your love for Disney. Chat with nearby Cast Members and be friendly. Wear your best Disney attire."

Some have a missing star or stripe because the nation has strict regulations on when flags should be lowered or lifted.

Disney World uses an optical illusion of placing items nearer and farther away to make the castle seem bigger.
