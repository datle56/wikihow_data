      "content": "Add vinegar when watering plants to lower the pH of your soil. Combine 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar and 4 litres (17 c) of cool water together in a watering can or jug. Next, stir both ingredients together using a long utensil. Pour the mixture over your plant beds to lower the pH, which can help certain plants (e.g., azaleas, rhododendrons) to thrive. [1] X Research source Check if your plants grow better in an acidic environment before watering them with vinegar solution. If the plants do better in an alkaline environment, then the mixture could do more harm than good."

      "content": "Kill off any unwanted weeds with a few sprays of vinegar. Spray or pour vinegar directly onto the pesky, offending weeds that are plaguing your garden. If you want to use an all-natural weed killer before turning to a pesticide, try using pure white vinegar. Pour the liquid over the weeds until both the soil and plant are saturated with vinegar. [2] X Research source Be careful whenever you use vinegar. The acid in vinegar can cause serious bodily harm when concentrated more than 11%. Use eye goggles and gloves to prevent any injury.

      "content": "Spray vinegar to keep your outdoor pets away. If your pet likes to loiter around your plants, try spritzing the edges of your garden with white vinegar. Cover any surfaces near where your pet likes to prowl, as the smell will drive them away. Try and spray vinegar on a daily basis, or however often your pet goes through your garden. [6] X Research source Citrus spray and lemon peels can also work for this. Vinegar is also a great hazing option for scaring away coyotes. Consider filling a water gun with white vinegar and using it to spray any coyotes that wander through your yard.

Try several of these containers to different tree branches, and see if the fruit flies begin to go away! You might need to hang up more than 1, depending on the size of the plant. [10] X Research source These traps are especially effective with fruit trees and fruit-bearing plants."

      "content": "Leave out vinegar-soaked corncobs to keep rabbits from coming in your garden. Take several old corncobs and place them in a bowl filled with at least 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar. Make sure that the corncobs are completely submerged, so they reek with the scent and taste of vinegar. Place these corncobs in spots where the rabbits tend to frequent to give these rodents a sour surprise! [11] X Research source If you don’t have enough vinegar to completely submerge your corncobs, spin them around in the bowl so all surfaces are coated with vinegar. Use as many corncobs as you need. If you have a small garden, you might only need 1-3 corncobs, while a larger garden might require more."
