      "content": "Make sure that your cat is healthy enough for travel. Trips in a car can be physically and emotionally stressful on cats. Before you embark on yours, have your veterinarian review your cat’s health and make sure it is healthy enough to travel. You can also discuss with your vet whether or not feline sedatives are a good idea while traveling with your cat. [1] X Research source These can calm some felines, but your cat may react badly to the medicines, or it may wear off during the trip. Never give your cat a sedative designed for humans."

      "content": "Get a carrier. The safest place for your cat to be while traveling in a car is in a designated cat carrier. You cat may not enjoy being in the carrier, but it will protect it from harm while you are on the road. Choose one that is: Well-ventilated Large enough for your cat to sit, stand, turn around, and lay down in Made of a sturdy material, whether soft (cloth or mesh) or hard (plastic or wire)"

If your cat has time beforehand to inspect the carrier, nap in it, etc., it might feel more comfortable and less stressed in it later on."

      "content": "Try short trips first. If you know that your cat will accompany you on an upcoming long drive, take it on some short trips first. Gradually increase the length of time you are on the road. Hopefully, these short trips will acclimate your cat to being in its carrier and in your car, so that the longer trip goes more smoothly."

      "title": "Feed your cat before starting the trip.",
      "content": "Feed your cat before starting the trip. Your cat should have a light meal three to four hours before your trip begins. That way, your cat won’t go hungry, but won’t be overfed, either. If you and your veterinarian have decided to give your cat sedatives, make sure to give it a dose prior to your trip, according to instructions. For trips under 2 hours, you won’t need to feed your cat on the road. Otherwise, feed it every 2 to 3 hours. Your cat may not want to eat or drink while traveling. Don’t feed your cat while moving in your vehicle, as there are risks that it could choke, become sick, or get loose in the vehicle. If you need to feed your cat en route, stop first."

It may take some coaxing to get your cat to enter and stay in the carrier, so offer it some treats or a favorite toy, and be patient. Letting your cat loose in the car while traveling is not safe. If your cat is not safely in its carrier, it may crawl to a dangerous place (such as under your feet), or it may become even more stressed. Only let your cat out of its carrier when you are safely at your destination or a stopping point."

      "content": "Consider nutraceuticals supplements. [7] X Research source Zylkene is a nutraceutical, which is a food supplement that has a pharmaceutical-like action on the body. Because nutraceuticals are not drugs, they are much safer and rarely have side effects. The active ingredient in Zylkene is derived from milk protein and it acts on the same part of the brain as diazepam. This calms the cat and removes some of her anxiety. Zylkene is available without prescription and comes in 75 mg capsules. The dose for a cat is a 75 mg capsule once a day, given with or after food. It can take a couple of days to take effect, but if there is no noticeable difference after 7 days, it is unlikely to help your cat."

If your cat’s veterinary appointment is for a routine wellness examination, your veterinarian may prescribe a sedative if your cat’s stress is severe. Do not administer sedatives if you are not sure that your cat is in healthy condition. Buprenorphine, gabapentin and alprazolam are examples of medications that have recently begun to be used to reduce the anxiety associated with car travel or veterinary visits. If one of these medications is appropriate for your cat’s situation, your veterinarian will prescribe it.
