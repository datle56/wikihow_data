      "content": "Wash your fabric. Before starting the dyeing process, make sure to run your fabric through the washing machine on whatever cycle you normally use for laundry. Doing so will help remove any chemicals that could taint the tint. Though detergent is fine, avoid using fabric softener since it can leave a film on the tulle, leading to an uneven dye job."

      "content": "Fill a disposable pot with water and heat it to a medium temperature. Grab a pot big enough that you can easily and fully submerge your fabric in it. Use a pot you don’t mind ruining, since the dye chemicals may make it unsafe to cook with. Then, fill it about ¾ of the way full with water, place it on a stovetop, and set the heat to a medium temperature. [1] X Research source Clear the area around your burner, that way you have enough room to manipulate the fabric and nothing gets ruined if some of the dye accidentally spills out."

      "title": "Pour your dye into the pot.",
      "content": "Pour your dye into the pot. Make sure to open your dye carefully, that way nothing spills out. Before throwing the dye in, check the container to see if there are any mixture-specific instructions you need to adhere to. Then, add the dye to the pot. For average-sized items, expect to use half a bottle of liquid dye or a whole container of powdered dye. [2] X Research source While handling dye, make sure to wear rubber gloves so you don’t stain your hands. If you’re tinting non-natural fabrics like nylon, add up to 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar. If you’re dyeing natural fabrics like silk, add in a similar amount of salt instead. This will make the solution more effective."
