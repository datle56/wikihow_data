Submerge your hand into the water and let it soak for several minutes. Scrub the area with a teaspoon of sugar or salt. Scrub until the glue rolls up and detaches from the skin. If you can’t access a bowl, plug the drain in the sink or hop in a warm bath with plenty of suds. If your skin is stuck together, do not pull it apart. You could accidentally rip off layers of skin along with the glue."
