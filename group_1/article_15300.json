Herpes can easily infect a healthy person through direct contact with an infected person, be it from their saliva, skin sore discharge, or through sexual contact. The infected person can infect anyone even if the virus is in “dormant” state, meaning they are currently asymptomatic. Some patients don’t know that they have the virus until experiencing an “outbreak,\" which means having their first sore or a blister, signifying herpes. The virus present in the saliva can be transferred through sharing personal items, like toothbrushes, dental floss, makeup like lipstick or gloss, used utensils, used towels, or through direct contact like kissing. HSV-1 causes oral herpes, though some reports mention genital herpes arising from the HSV-1 strain. HSV-2 is generally reserved for genital herpes as semen or vaginal fluid can be the perfect mediums to transmit HSV-2. Condoms should always be used for anal, oral, or vaginal sex, whether the infected person is asymptomatic or not. That said, even condoms don’t guarantee that you or your partner won’t get infected but they do dramatically lower the risk. If you have any oral lesions, you should not give oral sex or receive oral sex from someone who has oral lesions without protection. If a pregnant person is having a genital herpes outbreak during delivery, the baby has a higher chance of acquiring the infection than if the mother is asymptomatic during delivery.
