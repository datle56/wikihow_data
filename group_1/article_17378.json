      "title": "Choose a visible location on the top middle of your windshield.",
      "content": "Choose a visible location on the top middle of your windshield. The FASTag is about the size of a credit card and needs to be positioned in the upper portion of the center of your windshield so the scanners at the toll plaza are able to read it. Look for a spot on the top part of your windshield that won’t obstruct your view while you’re driving and isn’t hidden by your rearview mirror. [1] X Research source The scanners at the toll plaza are positioned directly above your vehicle, so the tag needs to be in the center of your windshield. Just below your rearview mirror is a good location if it doesn’t obstruct the tag."

      "title": "Clean the inside of your windshield with glass cleaner and dry it off.",
      "content": "Clean the inside of your windshield with glass cleaner and dry it off. Take a spray bottle of glass cleaner and coat the inside of your windshield with it. Then, take a clean cloth or sponge and wipe away any dust or dirt from the surface so the FASTag will adhere to the glass. Use a dry cloth or a paper towel to dry off the glass so there isn’t any moisture to affect the adhesive. [2] X Research source Use a glass cleaner so there aren’t any streaks or residue left behind. Dust and dirt will make it difficult for your tag to adhere evenly to the surface of the glass. Make sure the glass is completely dry before you install your tag."

      "title": "Remove the adhesive from the front of the FASTag sticker.",
      "content": "Remove the adhesive from the front of the FASTag sticker. Take your tag out of its packaging and peel off the strip of paper on the front to expose the adhesive beneath it. Keep the tag flat in your hand and avoid folding it onto itself or you won’t be able to unstick it without damaging it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the adhesive side against the inside of the windshield to attach it.",
      "content": "Press the adhesive side against the inside of the windshield to attach it. Hold the tag flat in your hand and carefully press 1 of the sides against the glass. Then, gently roll the tag onto the glass so it sticks to it without any bubbles, folds, or creases forming in the paper. Smooth the tag with your hands to make sure it’s fully attached to the surface of the glass. [4] X Research source Once the sticker is in place, don’t try to remove it or reposition it or you’ll damage the tag and the scanner won’t be able to read it. If you stick the tag in the wrong location, you’ll need to get a new one."

    {
      "title": "Drive through the toll plaza without stopping to use your tag.",
      "content": "Drive through the toll plaza without stopping to use your tag. Don’t stop as you’re driving through a toll plaza that uses the FASTag system to avoid causing delays or traffic, but keep a consistent speed so the scanner reads your tag. The scanner will automatically withdraw your fare from the account linked to your tag so you’re able to breeze through the toll gate. [5] X Research source As long as there are funds in your account, you don’t need to stop at the toll gates. If there’s a problem, you’ll be signaled to pull over and a toll plaza operator will assist you."

    {
      "title": "Add funds to your account using the FASTag app.",
      "content": "Add funds to your account using the FASTag app. Your FASTag is linked to an account and funds are taken out of it any time you go through a toll plaza. Download the FASTag app to your smartphone, tablet, or computer and use a credit card, debit card, National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), or Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) to add funds to your account so you’re able to continue using it. [6] X Research source Keep an eye on your balance to make sure it doesn’t get too low."

      "title": "Purchase replacement tags from an authorized seller.",
      "content": "Purchase replacement tags from an authorized seller. Only licensed sellers such as authorized banks, certain petrol stations, and toll plazas are allowed to sell legitimate FASTags. If your tag gets damaged or the adhesive is no longer able to keep it attached to your windshield, visit an authorized seller to purchase a new one. [7] X Research source A scratched or damaged tag won’t work when you try to pass through a toll plaza. The cost of a replacement tag my vary from location to location, but they generally cost about Rs. 100."

      "title": "Avoid putting tape or another adhesive on the tag.",
      "content": "Avoid putting tape or another adhesive on the tag. Adding tape or another type of adhesive to your tag to get it to stay on your windshield will affect the way the scanner at the toll plaza reads it. If your tag won’t stay on your windshield, return it to an authorized seller and get a replacement. [8] X Research source Even clear tape will prevent the scanner from reading your tag. Glue will warp your tag, making it difficult for the toll plaza scanner to read it."
