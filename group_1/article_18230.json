      "content": "Bag your candy and transfer it to a small cooler. Partially fill a freezer-safe bag with the candy of your choice, and then seal it closed. Slip the bagged candy into a mini cooler that can fit in your freezer. [1] X Research source Sugar-based candies tend to work best for freeze-drying, like Skittles, gummies, and even marshmallow treats, since their flavor profile typically stays the same. Chocolate candies don’t always fare as well, and might not be super tasty after getting freeze-dried. [2] X Research source Skittles, Starburst, candy corn, saltwater taffy, peach rings, and gummy worms are all great candies to try freeze-drying."

      "content": "Place dry ice into the cooler at a 1:1 ratio with the candy. Slip on a pair of insulated gloves before you get started—despite its mostly gaseous nature, dry ice is incredibly cold and can harm your skin, so it’s important to handle it correctly . [3] X Research source Then, put the same amount of dry ice as candy into the mini cooler. So, if you put ½ lb (0.2 kg) of candy in the cooler, you’d use ½ lb (0.2 kg) of dry ice, as well. Visit your local grocery store to buy dry ice ."

      "content": "Move the cooler to the freezer without locking the lid in place. Make enough space in your freezer so the cooler fits comfortably. [4] X Research source Don’t put the lid on the cooler—solid dry ice sublimates (turns into a gas) very quickly in cold temperatures, and can create an explosion when left in airtight containers. Your freezer might not get cold enough for this rapid sublimation to happen, but it’s important to take every safety precaution when you’re using this freeze-drying method. Alternative: Keep your candy and dry ice in a styrofoam cooler without putting it in the freezer. Wait for the dry ice to evaporate completely before enjoying your candy. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wait 2 days for the candy to freeze, or for all the dry ice to dissipate. Check back on your candy after about 48 hours to see what it looks like. [6] X Research source If all the dry ice has dissipated, your candy is ready to go."

      "content": "Store your freeze-dried candy at room temperature in a sealed bag indefinitely. Like any type of candy, it’s best to store your freeze-dried treats in a sealed bag. Unlike other types of candy, though, your newly freeze-dried candy will last a really long time—a couple of decades, even! [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Space your candies out evenly on a lined baking sheet. Grab a baking sheet that’s small enough to comfortably fit in your freezer. Slip a sheet of parchment paper on top, and then spread your candies on the tray. [8] X Research source You don’t want to overcrowd your tray, or else the candy could get stuck together during the freezer process."

      "content": "Slip the tray into the freezer for at least 2-3 weeks. Clear away some space in your freezer (if necessary) and slide the tray inside. Let it freeze for at least a couple of weeks; if the candy retains its color after being thawed out, it’s ready to eat. [9] X Research source Store your candies indefinitely at room temperature in a sealed bag and enjoy them at your leisure! Warning: Both of these methods are simplified versions of the actual freeze-drying process and may not yield candy that’s identical to the treats you’ve seen on TikTok."

      "content": "Freeze-drying is a process that increases a food’s shelf life by removing moisture. During a flash-freezing session, the food gets flash-frozen, or frozen quickly. After this, a vacuum pump sucks out all the moisture from the food, which makes it safe for long-term storage. True freeze-drying has to be done with a freeze-drying appliance, rather than a freezer or dry ice contraption. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "TikTok candy makers use a professional freeze dryer to make freeze-dried candy. Small business owners (like the content creators you see on TikTok) invest in large freeze-drying appliances. These are outfitted with special trays that slide into a chamber fitted with a vacuum pump that sucks out all of the moisture. A small freeze-drying appliance typically costs around $2,000, with commercial-scale appliances being at least $10,000. [11] X Research source Buying a freeze dryer could be a worthwhile investment if you’re interested in making a lot of freeze-dried candy (or other foods) or starting your own business. Keep in mind, though, that maintaining a freeze dryer can get pretty pricey, and requires specific supplies."
