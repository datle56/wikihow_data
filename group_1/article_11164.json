Cover your entire shoe in rhinestones or just the toe by drawing a line of E6000 glue on the shoe and sticking a gem to the rubber or fabric. [1] X Research source Start at the shoe's middle and work your way out for a clean, even design. [2] X Research source Place your rhinestones and gems on the shoe using your fingers or tweezers. Mix and match jewel sizes and colors to make a design that’s uniquely your own. You can also add the glue to the back of the gem if that’s easier for you. E6000 glue has a strong and durable hold that's ideal for decorating Converse shoes."

      "content": "You can embroider on your converse shoes with some basic materials and give your shoes a unique and vintage flair, as well as show off some new skills! Draw an outline of what you want to embroider onto your shoe. Thread the embroidery needle with the thread or yarn of your choice and continue stitching onto your drawing, poking the needle in and out as you go. Try researching on different types of stitches. Tie off all loose ends and iron the embroidery on low heat to flatten it out."

      "content": "Give your shoes an artistic edge with some spray paint. Tape a stencil with a design you like to the fabric of your Converse. Next, use spray paint to apply a light coat of paint over the design. Peel off the stencil and let the paint dry before showing off your new kicks. Make stencils at home by printing out a simple black image, like a heart or star, and cutting out the inside of the shape. Try using orange and yellow spray paint to create a shooting star. If you have an airbrush , use that instead of spray paint for a smoother finish."

      "content": "Add a fabric accent to the tongue of your Converse. Remove the laces, and cut a piece of fabric that’s slightly larger than the size of the shoe’s tongue. [3] X Research source Cover the tongue with E6000 glue . Fold the edge of the fabric, and place it as close to the toe as possible, pressing down on the glue to hold it in place. [4] X Research source Press the rest of the fabric flat against the tongue, smoothing out any wrinkles. [5] X Research source Fold and glue the edges of the fabric to the back of the tongue to secure. [6] X Research source Try to avoid getting glue on the rubber parts of your shoe as it can be hard to get off when dry. Relace your shoes once they’ve dried for about 10 to 15 minutes. [7] X Research source Pick a fabric pattern that pairs well with the color of your converse. For example, red shoes and leopard print fabric are a fabulous pairing."

[11] X Research source Use a sponge to paint a galaxy on the side of your shoe: starting with the darkest color, layering with the next lightest color, and dabbing white in the middle. [12] X Research source Add stars with a thin paintbrush or toothpick and white paint. [13] X Research source Try using a dry sponge when blending, so the colors mix evenly. Splattering white paint over the galaxy can add a sporadic and random amount of stars to your design. Use purples, blues, and pinks when creating your galaxy for a classic look, or go wild and use all colors of the rainbow. This customization works best with high-top Converse as you’ll be able to see the mesmerizing galaxy design better."

[16] X Research source The larger the drip, the larger the bleach stain. Be careful when using bleach as it can stain anything it touches. Bleaching Converse works best on black fabric but can add a unique effect to any color except white."

[20] X Research source Do this DIY project outside or on a newspaper-covered surface as it can get messy. [21] X Research source Remove the laces before you start if you don’t want the laces to get splattered with paint.

[24] X Research source Repeat until you’ve made your desired pattern. [25] X Research source The hard backing is usually towards the heel near the brim of the shoe. Studs come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, so choose the stud you like the most! Try laying your pattern out on the table or floor before attaching the studs to get an idea of what it will look like. Spikes work similarly to studs but with a screw on backing."

[28] X Research source Clip down the tongue with a binder clip or clothespin to keep it out of the way while you work. [29] X Research source Use a wet rag to wipe off any dye that gets on the rubber parts of the shoe. [30] X Research source Have fun with colors! Go for a rainbow effect or a tri-colored tie-dye effect. Make sure your Converse are cotton canvas, as other materials won’t soak in the dye. [31] X Research source"
