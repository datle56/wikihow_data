The rumor is that, long ago, a pair of travelers were robbed of all their supplies, including their bacon. Locals told them that outlaws lived in a spot where the trail “leveled” out, and that’s exactly where they found the bacon. Hence, Bacon Level, Alabama. [2] X Research source"

In reality, there are records of the community already being called “Booger Hole” by then—so the origins of the name are unknown. [4] X Research source"

It wasn’t named for a famous local figure or landmark; rather, the people who founded Carefree named it as such to get more people to move there!

It may actually be derived from the Lenni Lenape language (a language used by Lenape Native Americans in the area); specifically, the word Cheseh-oh-ke , which means “upland.” Alternatively, the name “Cheesequake” may be based on the Lenni Lenape word Chiskhakink , which means “Land that has been cleared.”"

They settled down instead, and referred to the location as “halfway to hell.” [23] X Research source “Half Hell” may also be a reference to the settlement’s former reputation for illegal activity (like the making and distribution of moonshine)."

While the origins of the name aren’t known for sure, there are plenty of theories: [25] X Research source One claims that it comes from a pair of German travelers; upon stepping out of their stagecoach on a sunny day, one said “So schön hell!” (“So beautifully bright!”) to the other. Other claims say the name comes from the “hell-like” conditions in the area that early explorers had to deal with (like wetlands, mosquitos, and thick forests). There are a couple of theories centering around George Reeves, an important businessman who moved to Hell in the 1830s. According to one, when Reeves was asked what the town should be called, he said, “You can name it Hell for all I care.” Since Reeves was reputed to pay farmers for grain with home-distilled whiskey, farmers’ wives were believed to say “He’s gone to Hell again” when asked where their husbands were."

      "content": "Sadly, the definitive source of this bawdy name is unknown—but there are definitely theories! The community was originally named Cross Keys and became Intercourse in 1814. One possible reason for this is that Intercourse refers to two famous roads that ran through the center of town: the Old King’s highway and the road from Wilmington to Erie. Another theory comes from the fact that “intercourse” used to be a common word for “fellowship,” and social support, and thus the village may have been named after its community values."

However, state law required the town to have a name that was at least 3 letters long…so Y changed to Why, and the town gained its name. [45] X Research source"

In fact, nobody is entirely sure where the name comes from, although it’s very possible it’s a corrupted or anglicized word from a Native American language."
