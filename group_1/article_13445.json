To do a straddle sit, seat yourself on the ground with your hands flat on the floor and your feet spread apart. Try separating your legs as much as you can until you're stretching comfortably.

      "content": "Start in a standing position with one leg forward. When preparing to get into a split stance, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean forward on your dominant foot. This will be the leg that goes forward in your split. It is best to practice doing the splits on a softer surface, such as carpet or a yoga mat. Try to avoid practicing on tile or hardwood, if possible."

Keep your stance controlled and tight; do not allow yourself to wobble back and forth or slip. Try taking your socks off to prevent your feet from sliding. Another option is to try performing the splits on carpet flooring with your socks on."

Once you begin to feel a tightness in your thighs, refrain from stretching any further. Forcing your body past what feels comfortable is a sure way to injure yourself. If necessary, use a small chair or table to help keep your balance as you lower yourself down."

      "content": "Hold the stretch. When your legs are both extended as far as they can go, pause and hold the stretch. Try counting to 15 or even 30. The point is your body will learn to relax while in the splits pose. Rest your arms on a supportive chair, side table or ground if necessary. Always remember that a stretch will cause discomfort, but not pain. If you feel pain while doing the splits stop immediately. You can ask a partner, friend, relative, or anyone you feel comfortable with to place their index finger on the tip of your shoulders. Then, ask them to gently push down ever-so-slightly. As you practice, ask that person to slightly increase the pressure on a daily basis. [2] X Expert Source Tanya Berenson Gymnastics Instructor Expert Interview. 22 May 2020."

Moving too fast can cause you to lose your balance and fall, injuring yourself. If you’re stuck here, you may find it helpful to use a chair or table as a halfway support. You can use the support until you’re confident in your ability to go all the way down. Bending all the way backwards takes some serious flexibility. If you’re stuck, get into a bridge and rock back and forth. Rock all the way onto your hands and feet. This allows your back to really curve and helps prepare for the standing bend."
