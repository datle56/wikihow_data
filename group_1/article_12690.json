      "content": "Consider the individual's personality and mannerisms. Sociopaths are usually extremely charming and charismatic. Their personalities are described as magnetic, and as such, they generate a lot of attention and praise from others. They also tend to have a strong sexual energy and may have strange sexual fetishes or be sex addicts. [2] X Research source Sociopaths oftentimes feel overly entitled to certain positions, people, and things. They believe that their own beliefs and opinions are the absolute authority and disregard the opinions of others. [3] X Research source Sociopaths are rarely shy, insecure, or at a loss for words. They have trouble suppressing emotional responses like anger, impatience, or annoyance, and constantly lash out at others and respond hastily to these emotions. They may cultivate an innocent persona. It is as if they are playing a character in a play, with very thoughtful displays of their personality. They may act innocent or especially sweet, which is easy to believe because they are very good actors. You should not take your first impression of them at face value. If you do not know a person well, they can mislead you into thinking they are innocent or sweet. The only real way to know a sociopath's true personality is by getting to know them well. If you listen to your intuition, you may get the feeling that their persona is just too simple to be real. Non-sociopaths are genuine people and not a perfect picture of a simplified personality."

      "content": "Take the person's past and present behavior into account. Sociopaths exhibit abnormally spontaneous and daring behavior. [4] X Research source They seem to act outside of the realm of social norms, and may do bizarre, risky, or outrageous things without assessing the potential repercussions. Sociopaths can be criminals. Because of their tendency to disregard the law and social norms, sociopaths may have a criminal record. They may be con artists, kleptomaniacs, or even murderers. [5] X Research source Sociopaths are professional liars. They fabricate stories and make outlandish, untruthful statements. Because they have practiced lying so much, they are able to make these lies sound convincing. As their experience with lying grows, so does their confidence and assertiveness in telling their lies. Sometimes their lies are stories to get sympathy, others are lies about work they have done. Sociopaths have no typical feelings of guilt associated with claiming someone else's work as their own. They only care about their image and will do whatever is easiest to create it. [6] X Research source Sociopaths have a low tolerance for boredom. They get bored easily and require constant stimulation. Their image and ability to control others are the only things that they really care about, so they satisfy their boredom by working to enhance their image and playing with the feelings of others.

      "content": "Consider the person's relationships with others. The way that a person interacts with others may also be an indicator that that person is a sociopath. Sociopaths are very good at convincing others to do what they want, either through charm or other more aggressive means. As a result, friends and coworkers of a sociopath may find themselves doing whatever the person wants them to do. [8] X Research source Sociopaths are incapable of experiencing guilt or shame for their actions. It is common for sociopaths to lack remorse when they have done something that hurts others. They may appear indifferent or rationalize their actions. They will feign remorse or pity though if they need to appear to be socially normal. For example if someone tells a sociopath about a family member's death, they would feign sympathy. Sometimes they might use the other person's sorrow as a vulnerability to take advantage of. Sociopaths often seek out others who are weak or at weak moments to exploit their emotional vulnerability, and to make the person feel more attached or dependent on them. [9] X Research source Sociopaths are manipulative. They may try to influence and dominate the people around them and tend to seek positions of leadership or high social standing. [10] X Research source Sociopaths have a hard time dealing with criticism. They often desire approval from others and may even feel like they are entitled to it. [11] X Research source Sociopaths lack empathy and may be incapable of love. While some sociopaths will have an individual or a small group of people that they seem to care about, they have a hard time feeling emotions and it is likely that they have not had healthy romantic relationships in the past. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 2572 wikiHow readers and 50% of them agreed that the most telling behavior of a sociopath is lack of empathy . [Take Poll] So this may be the key trait to look for when determining whether someone’s a sociopath."

If you are in a relationship with someone who is abusive to you or you have a coworker who treats you with disrespect, talk to someone about it. If the relationship has become violent or you fear for your safety, ask for help to get away from the person. Do not attempt to deal with the person alone. Ask a friend or family member to help you.

Stop contacting the person, and avoid situations/places where you may run into the person, if possible. Let the person know that you need some space, and request that they refrain from contacting you.

      "content": "Confront the person with caution. If the person you are dealing with is someone that you cannot or do not want to cut out of your life, be cautious about the way that you confront them about their behavior. Before you confront a sociopath about their behavior, remember that sociopaths are by nature defensive, irritable, and potentially violent. Ask for help from friends or family members and organize an intervention to prevent the likelihood of a hostile reaction. Avoid making accusatory statements or pointing out specific things that the person has done wrong. Rather, focus on the bigger picture and let the person know that you are genuinely concerned for their health. Start by saying something like, “I am worried about you and I want to help.” Avoid talking about your feelings or how the person has hurt you. Sociopaths are likely to be unresponsive to these types of statements."

Sociopathy and psychopathy are not fully understood, but they are different according to certain researchers and theorists. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders V (DSM-5), or the handbook used by mental health professionals, provides a description of antisocial personality disorder which shares many of the same characteristics of sociopathy and psychopathy. [18] X Research source Sociopathy and psychopathy are not diagnosable disorders like antisocial personality disorder, but some research has suggested that these two terms are specific kinds of antisocial personality disorder and that they share several traits. These shared traits include: disregarding laws or social mores failing to acknowledge the rights of others being unable to feel remorse or guilt displaying a tendency for violent behavior [19] X Research source"

Some research has suggested that sociopathy may be inherited, while other research has suggested that it may be the result of childhood neglect or abuse. One study showed that about 50% of sociopaths appear to have inherited the disorder through their genetic makeup. But environmental factors or other conditions were thought to be the cause of the remaining 50% of sociopaths in the study. As a result of these conflicting findings, the exact cause of sociopathy is unknown. [22] X Research source"
