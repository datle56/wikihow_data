      "content": "The conversation always seems to turn back to them. Someone with diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) typically lacks empathy for other people, so they tend to make every conversation about them.

However, the focus will always turn back to them. [4] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 Aug 2020. For instance, they might think that: [5] X Research source All of their problems are harder than yours. They’ve faced the same problems as you, but they handled them much better. Their experiences are more exciting or upsetting than yours. No matter what you do, they’ve always done something better. They have a personal connection to every important event that happens."

      "title": "They always seem to take but are never willing to give.",
      "content": "They always seem to take but are never willing to give. Someone with narcissistic qualities may see every relationship as one-sided, with them playing the starring role. That means your friendship will involve you giving them what they need or want. However, they will be unwilling to reciprocate and may even back away when you expect them to be there for you. [6] X Research source For instance, they may expect you to always be available when they want to make plans but may be unwilling to work around your schedule. Similarly, they may want to talk when they’re dealing with an issue but refuse to listen to your problems."

      "title": "Your friend often seems to manipulate others.",
      "content": "Your friend often seems to manipulate others. Think about the experiences you've had with your friend, then ask yourself questions about their behavior. For instance, does your friend always seem to get what they want? Have you caught them in a lie? Do you feel guilted into doing things for them? If you answer \"yes\" to these questions, then your friend may display narcissistic qualtities [7] X Research source For example, they may try to make you feel bad for them in order to get things from you. Similarly, they might do something nice for you so that you “owe” them, but then make really big demands of you."

      "title": "They seem to lack empathy and remorse.",
      "content": "They seem to lack empathy and remorse. People with diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may struggle to have empathy and remorse because the symptoms of this condition lead them to think selfishly and prioritize their own needs. [8] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 Aug 2020. That means your friend may care more about their own emotions than yours or anyone else's, and they may not notice when they’re being hurtful. When they make a mistake, they likely won’t express remorse because they’ll blame someone else. [9] X Research source Let’s say it’s your birthday and you’re having a special get-together with your friends. A friend with narcissistic qualities may have no problem making other plans, even though your feelings get hurt. If you confront them about this issue, they may blame you for picking a bad time or a restaurant they don’t like, or they might blame an external factor like the weather. If you told your friend that it doesn't make you feel like the friendship is equal when they don't ask you anything about your life, their response may be counterintuitive, like that it's your problem and not theirs.

      "title": "Your friend projects their bad qualities onto others.",
      "content": "Your friend projects their bad qualities onto others. In most cases, someone who behaves in a narcissistic way will deny that they have any bad traits. Instead, they’ll accuse other people of having those traits. This allows them to feel like they’re the good person, while everyone else is the problem. [11] X Research source For instance, your friend may accuse you of being the real attention hog, or they may accuse you of being controlling even though they’re controlling you."

      "title": "Your friend may be afraid of rejection.",
      "content": "Your friend may be afraid of rejection. Keep in mind that narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a genuine mental health condition. The grandiose, self-centered bravado of your friend is likely covering up low self-esteem caused by this personality disorder. These types of NPD patients are called “vulnerable” because they are masking insecurities. That means your friend may lash out if they feel like you’re questioning them or rejecting them. [12] X Research source You may notice that your friend feels attacked really easily or gets upset over the smallest issues. For instance, they may get really upset when you and another friend do something without them, even if they weren’t available to go. That’s because they fear that you two will reject them. Remember that only a licensed psychologist can diagnose a person with NPD, and having NPD doesn't automatically make someone toxic, abusive, or a bad person. Many people with NPD can learn to manage their behavior with therapy and other treatments."

      "title": "Flatter them for a quick fix for problem behavior.",
      "content": "Flatter them for a quick fix for problem behavior. Although it’s not a long-term solution, complimenting and praising your friend can quickly get them on your side. You can use this technique to prevent your friend from ruining an event or making something all about them. However, using it too often may get them used to it. [13] X Research source It might be hard to give your friend compliments when they don't deserve them, so don't do it if it makes you uncomfortable. You may save this technique for times when you honestly have something nice to say about them. This works because people with narcissistic personalities like to think highly of themselves and want you to recognize how great they are."

      "title": "Laugh off their behavior if you don’t think it will hurt their feelings.",
      "content": "Laugh off their behavior if you don’t think it will hurt their feelings. At times, your friend might tell outlandish stories or act unreasonably, which can be frustrating. When this happens, pretending their antics are a joke can make them stop temporarily. They want you to be impressed with them, so they will likely back off if they realize you aren’t buying their story. [14] X Research source Don’t try this if you think your friend might get hurt by your laughter. This works best if your friend really thinks they’re better than everyone else. For instance, say, “Haha, that would be hilarious,” or “You’re so funny.”"

      "title": "Get them on board with plans by making them feel important.",
      "content": "Get them on board with plans by making them feel important. You shouldn't have to go out of your way to make your friend feel good, but doing so might make it easier to get them to do what you want. In addition to making them feel important, you might let them think an activity was their idea or that they're somehow benefiting from it. Do your best to frame things in a way that makes them feel like they’re getting something out of the situation, and you should be able to have a pleasant time. [15] X Research source For instance, let’s say your friend group is going out to dinner to celebrate someone else’s accomplishment. You might let your friend pick the restaurant or decide to celebrate several accomplishments at once, including something they did. Similarly, you might be doing a group activity, such as karaoke. To keep your friend from derailing the fun night, you might heap praise or tell them the only reason you wanted to go to karaoke is that they’re so good."

      "content": "Ignore them if they are being unreasonable. While you likely care about your friend, you aren’t responsible for their needs. You deserve to have your own boundaries, so don’t be afraid to ignore your friend when they’re being inappropriate. Don’t allow them to yell at you, guilt you, or blame you for things they do. Get away from them when you need to do so. [16] X Research source Give yourself time to calm down before you try to deal with them again. If you’re stuck with them, you can still ignore them. Put on some earbuds to block them out, pretend to take a nap, or ask another friend to be a buffer.

      "content": "Recognize and avoid situations that bring out their narcissistic behaviors. Your friend may display their narcissistic habits more when their ego is threatened. If this friend is single, for instance, they may act rudely during events where couples are present. If they tend to be a know-it-all, they might get insecure when other people are more educated than they are. Plan activities that you know don’t trigger their insecurities. [17] X Research source Sometimes it may be best to avoid inviting them to events you know will just upset them."
