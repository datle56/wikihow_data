      "content": "Give yourself a castor oil massage to relieve sinusitis. To help alleviate sinusitis, and restore your sense of smell and taste, rub about 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of castor oil mixed with a drop of essential oil like eucalyptus onto your face, using moderate pressure. Start between your eyes, and massage out across your eyebrows toward your ears, then down either side of your nose. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Castor oil applied topically can increase blood flow and help drain the sinuses. Your sense of taste and smell are intimately linked, and loss of one can affect the other. That's why you tend to lose your sense of taste when you have a cold, flu, or congestion caused by allergies."

      "title": "Drink hot tea",
      "content": "Drink hot tea when you're sick. Boil water in a pot or kettle and pour it into a teapot. Add tea leaves or tea bags of the herbal tea of your choice and let it steep for the correct amount of time depending on the kind of tea you're using, usually between 3 and 5 minutes. Drink the tea while it's still hot. [2] X Research source You can drink as much herbal tea in a day as you want, but aim for at least one cup a day when you're battling illness. Consuming hot herbal teas when you have a cold helps to thin out the mucus in your nostrils. This restores your senses of smell and taste. The hot flavorful drinks can also stimulate your taste buds. There are many kinds of herbal tea you can try. Chamomile is anti-inflammatory and peppermint is anti-microbial and good for your digestive tract. Both are excellent for helping to fight off illness and ameliorate cold symptoms."

Cover the pot with a lid for 5 minutes, then remove the lid and put your face directly over the pot with a tea towel covering your head to hold the heat in and direct the steam into your face. Breathe the steam in for as long as you can, aiming for up to 15 minutes.

      "content": "Rinse out your mouth with oil to maintain oral health. Put 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 mL) of coconut, olive, or sesame oil in your mouth and swish for 20 minutes. The oil will thicken as you swish and should be creamy white when you spit it out. When you're done swishing, spit the oil into your trash can instead of your sink to avoid clogging your pipes. Rinse your mouth out with warm water and brush your teeth. Oil pulling can combat harmful bacteria in your mouth that can impair your sense of taste, and cleanse out bad tastes. Do oil pulling once every morning before eating or drinking anything. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "content": "Eat foods rich in zinc. Loss of smell and taste can sometimes be caused by deficiencies in zinc. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Zinc is very important for proper bodily functioning, but isn't stored for long periods of time in your body. You therefore need a constant zinc supply from your diet. [8] X Research source Foods like oysters, beef, pumpkin seeds, tahini, dark chocolate, crab, lobster, pork, and beans are all rich in zinc. Sometimes a zinc supplement is required, but don't take one without first consulting your doctor. Consuming too much zinc, more than 100 to 200 milligrams (0.0035 to 0.0071 oz) a day can lead to reduced iron and copper levels, vomiting, and gastrointestinal issues."

[13] X Research source To compensate for losing taste buds, you can get more flavor out of your food by topping it with spices and herbs, like basil, oregano, cilantro, and black pepper. If your diet permits, put cheese, bacon bits, butter, olive oil, and toasted nuts on vegetables to get more flavor out of your food. Avoid adding too much salt or sugar, which can be unhealthy. Avoid dishes like casseroles that combine many ingredients and mask individual flavors. This can dilute the taste.

If medication doesn’t work to reduce or eliminate your nasal polyps, your doctor may perform endoscopic surgery. The surgeon inserts a tube with a camera into your nostrils and then uses tiny instruments to remove the polyps and possibly enlarge the openings from your sinuses to your nasal passages. This surgery is typically an outpatient procedure with a recovery time of about 2 weeks."
