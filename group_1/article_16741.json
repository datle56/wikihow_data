      "content": "Lower its health and put it to sleep. Your chance of successfully catching a Pokémon rises once it has been weakened. Putting it to sleep (such as with moves like with Hypnosis or Spore) raises this chance even further. Note: Unlike its counterparts, Dialga & Palkia, Giratina has an EXTREMELY low catch rate and will only last 30 turns in battle. Additionally, two of its moves sometimes raise ALL of its stats at once, making it progressively harder to catch. Note: Giratina is part Ghost-Type, and thus is not affected False Swipe (a Normal-type moves that leaves the opponent with a minimum of 1 HP)."

You may use any Poké Ball you like here, though three in particular provide an additional advantage: Quick Balls: Highest chance if thrown on the very first turn, though its success rate drops with each subsequent turn (works opposite to the Timer Ball). Dusk Balls: Higher success rate at night and in caves. Timer Balls: Success rate grows the longer the battle goes on (works opposite of the Quick Ball)."
