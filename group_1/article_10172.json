      "content": "Heartbreak is incredibly painful, but it’s important to acknowledge it. Instead of trying to numb your pain, ignore your feelings, or deny what happened, be honest with yourself. You’ve just gone through an extremely tough experience! It will be really difficult at first, but ultimately you’ll heal faster if you admit that something bad has happened and allow yourself to feel awful about it. [1] X Research source Try not to cling to unrealistic ideas about what could happen, such as getting back together with your ex after a bad breakup. False hope may help you feel better temporarily, but it will ultimately lead to more disappointment and heartbreak. If you need to, take a couple of days off from school or work. While distracting yourself and keeping busy can be helpful, it’s also important to give yourself a little space and time to rest and feel your grief. [2] X Research source"

You’ve suffered a huge loss, and grieving is part of the healing process. Instead of trying to avoid those feelings, allow yourself to feel them. Tell yourself that you need time to mourn. [3] X Research source Think of your emotions as waves in a troubled ocean. Instead of trying to fight against them or go around them, just let yourself ride the waves. It may not feel like it now, but they will eventually get calmer! Don’t try to numb yourself to the pain or swear off relationships forever.

      "content": "Crying is a good and healthy way to express your feelings. If you feel like crying, let it out. Find a place where you can be alone, or with a good friend, and let the tears flow. It'll be over more quickly than you think, and you'll feel a little better after getting those emotions out. If you don’t want to cry in front of other people or in public, try taking a few slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth to help you calm down. Go someplace where you can have some privacy, like a bathroom, and let it out."

      "content": "Dwelling on blame or negative self-talk can make heartbreak worse. It’s normal to have some dark thoughts when you’ve just gone through a terrible experience. But letting those thoughts take over your mind will make it harder to heal and move on. Next time you find yourself thinking something negative, notice the thought and gently challenge it with a more positive or realistic one. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, you may find yourself thinking things like, “This is all my fault,” or “I’ll never find love again.” Respond to those thoughts with things like, “There were a lot of reasons it didn’t work out. My ex and I both played a part in it.” Or, “I’ve been in relationships before, and there’s no reason it won’t happen again. I learned things from this one that will help me make the next one even better.” It’s easier to deal with negative thoughts if you notice them when they happen. Practice mindful meditation to help you become more aware of your thoughts and the feelings they trigger. If you’re not sure how to get started, try signing up for a meditation course ."

      "content": "If your heartbreak is because of a breakup, think about what went wrong. Remember, there is always a reason. Recognizing what was bad about your relationship will help put things in perspective. It will also help you learn and grow so you can build better relationships in the future! [6] X Research source Also think about what you liked in the relationship, and what things you would want to look for in a future partner. For instance, if you find yourself pining for your ex, think about how you often you argued, or the fact that they weren’t always good at being there for you when you needed them. Remembering the bad things doesn’t mean you have to ignore the good parts! In fact, accepting how much you loved the person is an important part of helping yourself heal. Just try to keep your perspective balanced and realistic. For example, remind yourself how annoying it was that they never washed the dishes, but also remember how much you enjoyed their sense of humor."

Sometimes just getting your feelings off your chest can help you work through them. Additionally, you never know what help other people can give, whether it's good advice or just a shoulder to cry on. If you don’t have anyone to turn to, look for a support group online. There are tons of heartbreak groups out there for people who are going through—or have already been through—similar things. You can also call or text a crisis line, such as the Crisis Text Line. [9] X Research source To text the Crisis Text line, text “HOME” to 741741.

If you have to, write reminders for yourself, like “Take a shower!” or “Pay your electric bill tonight.” If you’re really struggling with motivation, try starting with one simple thing, like brushing your teeth or putting on clean clothes. Then, see if you feel up to doing something else, like eating a healthy snack. Take it one thing at a time!"

Next time you feel down, go for a jog, hop on your bike, or exercise along with your favorite workout video. You don't need a full workout. Something as simple as a 10- to 15-minute walk can help you feel better. Even work that doesn't feel like exercise, like weeding a garden or taking a walk outside, gets you some fresh air while you move. The most important thing is that you stay consistent in what you do.

For a while, you might also want to avoid activities or places that remind you of them, such as listening to an album you both loved or going to your regular date night restaurant. [13] X Research source If you have photos or videos on your phone that trigger painful feelings or memories, delete them or move them to a location you won’t be as tempted to look at. This doesn’t mean you have to throw away or destroy things that remind you of your ex, or keep avoiding your favorite places forever. Just give yourself some time to process your feelings away from those reminders. If you have things that belong to your ex, consider mailing the items to them.

Unfollow them on social media, and take their number out of your contacts if you find it too tempting to call or text. [14] X Research source You may be able to have a friendship with them in the future, but it’s important to get some distance and time to heal before you try that. Be especially careful not to contact your ex late at night or when you’ve been drinking. It’s not likely to help anything, and you’ll probably feel embarrassed or upset about it the next day. If there’s something you really want to say to them, write it down in a journal or a text document, but don’t send it. You can even destroy what you wrote after the fact. Ask your friends to help. Say something like, “Hey, if I start asking what my ex is up to, just remind me that I need space.” Or, you can ask them to distract you by changing the subject.

This is frustrating, but it’s totally normal. Don't beat yourself up over feeling sad when you thought you were recovering. [17] X Research source Just recognize that you’re having one of your rough days, and be extra kind to yourself until you feel a bit better. One study found that it takes 3 months on average to start feeling a lot better after a breakup. However, don’t be too worried if it takes you longer than that—every person is different, and so is every heartbreak. Occasionally fantasizing about your ex is normal. Rather than trying to push these thoughts away, accept them, and then look for something else to think about instead."
