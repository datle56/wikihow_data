      "title": "Cover the scar with concealer",
      "content": "Cover the scar with concealer 1 shade lighter than your skin. Paint the concealer over your scar so that it covers it completely. Then, use your fingertips or a makeup sponge to blend the makeup in, especially around the edges of your scar. Allow the concealer to sit untouched for about 3 minutes so that it will dry and set. [3] X Research source You can also apply the concealer to any other imperfections on your face at this time, such as dark circles under your eyes or blemishes."

      "content": "Emphasize other areas of your face with a bold lip color or eye makeup. This is a simple way to pull attention away from the scar and towards another feature of your face. Try emphasizing your eyes with black eyeliner or a smoky eye look to draw the attention there. Or, wear bright red, pink, or coral lipstick to draw the attention there. [6] X Research source The location of the scar may also help you decide which feature to emphasize. For example, if the scar is near your eye, then emphasizing your lips might be the best option."

      "content": "Fake freckles with brown eyeliner to draw the attention elsewhere. This may work if you have freckles or beauty marks elsewhere on your face. Try dabbing the tip of a brown eye liner pencil in a few random spots across your nose and cheeks to give the appearance of freckles. This will draw attention away from the scar as long as the scar is not in this area of your face. [7] X Research source Avoid doing this if it will draw attention to the scarred part of your face."

Some good options include: [8] X Research source A bold statement necklace or earrings A fancy bow or sparkly barrette in your hair A brightly-colored top A large, fancy hat"

Of course, getting bangs will easily hide a scar on your forehead, but this isn’t for everyone. Instead, try combing your hair with a side part so it falls over 1 side of your face more than the other. [10] X Research source Use a styling product, such as hairspray or gel to keep your hair in place."

If the scar is in a spot where you can grow facial hair, then you could grow a beard, mustache, sideburns, or goatee to help cover it. However, sometimes hair will not grow in an area of your skin that has been scarred. In this case, keeping a clean-shaven face or only growing facial hair in areas away from the scar may be your best option. [11] X Research source"
