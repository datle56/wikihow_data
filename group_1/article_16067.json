Whether it's Covid, the flu, or a common cold, even going to the grocery store is enough to put yourself in the face of some kind of germ you wouldn't want to spread.

I think I'm just going to lie low today. I'm afraid it'll get worse if I don't rest.\" \"So sorry, but I have to cancel our plans. I went out last night and must've eaten something bad. Been throwing up for hours.\" \"I think I caught something at that party the other night. It sounds like some other people got sick too. I'm going to have to reschedule with you.\""

Everyone can relate to needing more time to finish something, especially when it comes to work or school assignments, so they shouldn't be too hard on you for needing to cancel to get things done. If you have time before your plans, start by bringing up the big project you've been working on so no one's surprised when you have to bail. [2] X Research source \"Ah, so sorry to cancel on you last minute, but this project at work is killing me. I thought I would have it done by now, but unfortunately, I don't.\" \"I just got feedback on my essay for (insert class), and I literally have to re-write the entire thing. I'd much rather be with you, but it looks like I can't make it.\" \"My partners aren't getting their work done on the project we've been working on, so I'm going to have to pick up the slack.

Can we reschedule for another time instead?” “Hey, I have a lot of anxiety today, and I don’t think I’d be much fun to hang out with. Let’s make plans for when I’m feeling more like myself.”"
