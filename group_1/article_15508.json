All of this meat is safe to eat raw, except chicken meat, which can give you food poisoning. Cooking meat will increase its benefits. You can get meat from cows, pigs, chickens, mooshrooms, sheep, and rabbits. See Start an Animal Farm on Minecraft for instructions on farming animals for meat."

Others, such as wheat, sugar cane, pumpkins and cocoa beans you will need to craft to make food. You can farm wheat, potatoes, carrots, beetroots, apples (by planting trees), pumpkins, and melons. You'll find these plants in various locations throughout your world, though you may be able to find a lot concentrated in village farms. See Build a Basic Farm in Minecraft for instructions on creating your own farm to harvest crops. Try to find a village. There are many benefits of finding a village. [1] X Research source All around a village you can find farms filled with many different seeds and grown foods. [2] X Research source These farms can provide food which can sustain your hunger in the present and in the future. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Get to know how the Hunger bar works. Although you only see the Hunger bar in the game, there are actually two hunger systems at work: Hunger and Saturation. The Saturation level is hidden from the player but affects how the Hunger bar depletes. The hidden Saturation level needs to completely deplete before your Hunger bar starts to drop. Certain foods give higher Saturation bonuses, allowing you to go longer without having to eat. [6] X Research source Your Saturation level drops as you perform strenuous activities like sprinting. The Hunger bar will begin to jiggle when your Saturation level has been completely depleted."

      "title": "Cook your meats to make them more effective.",
      "content": "Cook your meats to make them more effective. You can eat any of the raw meat and gain a small amount of food points, but you'll get better results if you cook the meat first. In order to cook meat, you'll need a furnace. You can create a furnace by placing 8 cobblestone blocks around the edge of your crafting grid. Once you have a furnace, place some fuel in the bottom box and your raw meat in the top. The meat will be cooked and will give you about 3 times the original Hunger benefit and about 5 times the original Saturation benefit when eaten. Cooking chicken is the only way to safely eat it. If you eat raw chicken, you have a 30% chance of getting food poisoning. Putting a potato in a furnace will create a baked potato, which has better hunger benefits."

These can provide good Hunger recovery, but don't offer as much Saturation. Eat these when your Hunger meter is low to get the best effect: Bread - Crafted from 3 wheat. Cake - Crafted from 3 milk, 2 sugar, an egg, and 3 wheat. Cookie - Crafted from 2 wheat and a cocoa bean. Mushroom stew - Crafted from a mushroom and a bowl. Pumpkin pie - Crafted from an egg, a sugar, and a pumpkin. Rabbit stew - Crafted from a cooked rabbit, a carrot, a baked potato, a mushroom, and a bowl.

When you get food poisoning, you lose 0.5 Hunger units per second for 30 seconds. Drink milk to counteract the effects of food poisoning. [7] X Research source Raw chicken has a 30% chance of giving you food poisoning. Cook chicken to avoid this. Rotten flesh has an 80% chance of giving you food poisoning. There is no way to make it safer. Pufferfish has a 100% chance of giving you advanced food poisoning, which will take 1.5 Hunger units per second for 15 seconds. It will also give you Poison IV, which will drop your player health. You cannot cook pufferfish. Spider eyes have a 100% chance to give you Poison, which will drop your player health by two full hearts."
