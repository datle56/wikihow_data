      "content": "Begin to show slight symptoms the night before. If you plan on staying home the next day, tell your mom or dad that you don't feel well the night before. [1] X Research source Don’t tell them too early the day before, because some illnesses tend to go away overnight as a stomach ache does. Aim for starting your symptoms after 6:30 P.M. or after dinnertime. If you've been ill before with a virus or bug, repeat those symptoms; it will seem less like you are faking. But remember that you can't get the same bug twice! If you've been to see someone who had a cold or some other illness, replicate those symptoms so it seems as though you caught it from them. Use blush or cheek stain. If you are planning on faking a fever or bad cold, use a bright pink blush or cheek stain on your cheeks and nose to make your face look flushed. But make sure to not overdo this, otherwise they'll see right through it. Act slightly clumsy, as this will make you look ill or tired."

      "content": "Don't do something you want to. Your parents will believe you more if you sacrifice something you like to do as well as the thing you don't like (school). Don’t finish eating half of your favorite meal at dinnertime. When your parent(s) ask what's wrong, tell them that your stomach hurts (if faking a stomach illness) or that you just don't have an appetite (if faking a respiratory illness). Make sure you hide snacks in your room so you can miss a meal so they think you are sick because you're \"not feeling well.” If you have plans with friends, cancel going out with them. Ask to be excused from family time or don’t watch your favorite TV show."

      "title": "Start but then don’t finish your homework.",
      "content": "Start but then don’t finish your homework. This will cover the fact that you're trying to stay home from school, while giving you a reason to stay home the next day. If you normally do your homework at night, get started on it but put your head down periodically so that they see you're \"not feeling well\" and it's interfering with your work. If you usually do your homework on time, continue to do it to make it look like you were intending to go to school, but halfway through, complain about feeling ill. By not finishing your homework, they'll have another excuse to keep you from school. This works best if you have parents who care about your grades."

      "title": "Go to bed early",
      "content": "Go to bed early . Choosing to actually go to bed early will be a red flag, especially if you usually try to stay up later than you’re allowed. Don't say anything or just say you're not feeling well and need to lie down. Alternatively, try to catch your parents’ attention by just walking by them or out of the room and head straight for your bed. If you feel like you really are sick, but so mild that your parents wouldn't even listen, exaggerate your symptoms. (For example, nauseated becomes I'm about to throw up ) Some studies say that you feel like what you think, so that might be an awesome plan which your parents can't foil! Remember: this devious step only works if you are getting sick in reality, so don't just go for this one if you're not sick. This is a strengthener for your saying for the next morning! Don't brush your teeth. If your parents notice, they'll probably come into your room to remind you. At that point, they'll probably wonder what's wrong, and you can tell them that you're not feeling well. Appear impatient, maybe even cranky, and eager to go to bed. Don't act too cranky, though; you want your parents’ sympathy for being sick, not punishment for being rude!"

If you're pretending to have stomach issues , tell them you just threw up (having left some fake vomit in the toilet). [2] X Research source Force tears (if you can) to make it seem real that you’re sick. Try and make it realistic though! Think of something sad (for instance, a pet dying) to make yourself cry . Pull at the bottom of your eyelids until it hurts then blink hard a few times; you should get watery eyes. If this doesn't work, try holding your eyes open for 30 seconds, then blinking 20-30 times to jumpstart the waterworks. For flu or sore throat symptoms, cough or clear your throat loudly enough for them to hear in their bedrooms. Rub your face vigorously right before they come in to look red and appropriately ill. Rubbing your eyes excessively is also key to achieving the sick, bloodshot look."

Purple or gray eye shadow works too if your undereyes are still too bright, but make sure you blend it in subtly, otherwise they'll notice right away. Go to bed an hour or two later than you usually fall asleep. This may make small bags underneath your eyes or make them slightly puffy. Try to get at least four hours of sleep if you don’t want to be too sleep-deprived for your sick day off.

Skip a button on your shirt, don't comb your hair properly, and don't tie your shoelaces properly (or even at all). Have droopy eyes. Think of something sad and let your eyes water and droop.

Take yours or your mom's light lavender (purple) or blueish eyeshadow. Mix in some water to make the color fade into a more natural tint. Rub it in well, but still make it noticeable. You could also take some petroleum jelly and rub it under your eyes, or in your waterline. You could also try adding some kind of pale makeup to make sure your parents know you are ill."

Protest their decision (but only if you didn't have to convince them first). This reinforces the fact that you really are sick. Say, \"But Mom, I'm going to have so much work to make up!\" or \"But I have a math test today!\" If your parents know you don't care about tests, say \"But I have band practice, or art class\" or something they know you enjoy. Do not overdo it. Don't randomly state that you want to do a test if they know you don't care. This can backfire unless you're careful. Don't beg excessively to stay home, or your parents might know you are faking it."

      "content": "Fake having a fever. If you do a good job at seeming sick, your parents will probably want to take your temperature. Be ready, though, to act quickly and fake having a fever. Ask to go to the bathroom before they take your temperature. Make sure you have a cup with you. Fill it with warm water to drink and rinse through your mouth, especially under your tongue. This will raise the temperature of your mouth. Be sure to flush the toilet before you turn on the sink, just so your parents don't get too suspicious! Note: this only works if they check it under your tongue, obviously. If the thermometer is one that goes in your ear, try to get it before your temperature's taken and hold it to something warm, like a radiator or a light bulb. If your parents are the kind that just feel your forehead, frequently rub it rapidly when they're not looking, or take a blow dryer and heat your face and say your forehead feels warm. Put warm water in your armpits, forehead, and cheeks. It makes you warm and looks like you have been sweating. You’re aiming for a temperature that is above 99 degrees (37 Celsius) but lower than 103 degrees (39.4 Celsius). If it's below 99 degrees then it doesn't count as a fever, if it's 103 degrees you'll likely be taken to the doctor's right away."

This is essential if you want to fake a migraine. Touch your forehead every now and then and frown when doing so. Say that you feel dizzy and can't see very well. While walking slowly, suddenly stop, close your eyes and \"regain balance\" by holding onto something or someone. Ask your parents if they could lower their voice a little. If it's the day before the day you want to skip school, go take a nap and turn off all the lights, or if you're just chilling at home, turn off the lights closest to you and lie down on the nearest couch or chair. Ask for medicine such as ibuprofen, but don't actually take it."

      "content": "Fake having a stomachache, nausea, or cramps. Other than your word, the only other real symptom for these are vomiting, which you can also fake pretty easily. After eating a meal, start complaining that you feel sick. If your parents aren’t looking, stick your finger down your throat (but not too far), and you will start retching but not vomiting. When you feel as though you might actually throw up, quickly remove your fingers. Use this technique sparingly, though. You don't want to hurt yourself. Have fake vomit ready to complete the effect. Get oatmeal and water, run to the bathroom, put the oatmeal and water in your mouth, then spit it in the toilet and show your parents. You can also fake a vomiting incident by pouring fake vomit on your floor (or on your bed if you want it to be more believable). In the morning, say that you don't remember it and act apologetic to whoever has to clean it up. Be careful with making people clean it up, because if they look at it too closely, they might realize that it's not actually vomit. If you've started having your period, tell your parents you have cramps or it's that time of the month. Neither of them will be able to disprove it. They may be suspicious, however, if your menstrual cramps aren't usually debilitating, yet if they are, it's a perfect excuse."

These are also highly contagious conditions, so your parents will probably not want to send you to school and infect your classmates. [5] X Research source Blow your nose in a bunch of tissues and throw them on the floor or on your nightstand/on your bed. Then, your parents will think you have a runny nose and they will not let you go to school if you have that much of a cold. Breathe only through your mouth, as if your nose is stuffed. If you're not in the same room as them, and they ask you something, hold your nose slightly when you talk. Wear many layers of clothing. This makes it look as though you have the chills and are freezing. If it's allergy season and you have hay fever, make sure to fake other symptoms besides a runny nose, or else your parents will think it's just hay fever. Sneeze loudly , then sniffle in front of your parents. Do this also when they're not in the same room but can overhear you from wherever they are. Stretch your lips to make them look chapped and twist your nose to make it red. Mention that your “bones hurt” or that you have lots of aches and pains all over."
