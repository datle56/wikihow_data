      "content": "Make sure your hair is knot-free so your cut is even. Before setting up, hop into the shower and shampoo and condition your hair. Use either your fingers or a wide tooth comb to detangle your hair so it’s smooth and frizz-free . [1] X Research source If you typically put product in your hair, don’t apply it just yet. It’s better to cut your hair without product in it so you can see how the curls naturally lay."

      "content": "Cutting curly hair is much easier when it’s dry. Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer . It’s important to cut curly hair while it’s dry, not while it’s wet, since you can immediately see what the final cut will look like. Plus, dry hair tends to be shorter than wet hair. [2] X Research source You may notice that some hair stylist professionals will cut curly hair wet instead of dry. This is a personal preference, as some find it easier to keep the cut even when the hair is wet. However, if you’re not a professional, it’s easier to cut layers while your hair is dry."

      "content": "Section your hair to make it easier to trim. Section the top half of your hair from the ears up, then pull that hair into a ponytail above your forehead. Then, part the rest of your hair down the middle into 2 separate sections. [3] X Research source Use a comb to part your hair to make sure each section is even."

      "title": "Start with your front section, angling it in front of you.",
      "content": "Start with your front section, angling it in front of you. Using your first 2 fingers, grab your front section of hair at its base. Then, slide your fingers up the length of your hair, angling your hair upward and slightly in front of you. Stop sliding your fingers when you reach the point where you want to make the cut. [4] X Research source Pull your hair out straight so that all your curls are the same length. This will make it easier to get an even cut. The amount you trim off is up to you. For subtle layers, start with about 1 in (2.5 cm) of hair. For more noticeable layers, try cutting 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) off. Look for damage at the ends of your hair. If you see frizz or breakage, try to remove all of it when you cut your layers. Trim only a small amount of hair at first. You can always go back later and take more off, but it can be tough to fix a haircut if you cut too much off."

      "content": "Use hair cutting scissors to carefully snip off the end of your hair. Always use sharp hair cutting scissors to avoid any raggedy ends. Keeping your fingers in place, use your free hand to gently snip the hair above your fingers. Then, angle your scissors so they're nearly parallel to your hair, and cut a few times into your hair to thin the ends out slightly. [5] X Research source That angled cutting is also called “point cutting,” and it helps remove some of the weight from the ends of your hair. This helps your curls form and gives your overall style more volume."

      "title": "Unclip one of the back sections, then trim the end.",
      "content": "Unclip one of the back sections, then trim the end. Pull the hair straight up, or at the same outward angle that you used when you cut the first section. Use the first section as a guide to determine how much hair to trim—hold up both pieces of hair next to each other, and cut off the new section to be the same length as the first. [6] X Research source When pulling sections upwards to trim them, use the same amount of tension to pull your curls mostly straight. That way, one section won't be shorter than the others."

      "title": "Unclip the final section of hair and give it a trim.",
      "content": "Unclip the final section of hair and give it a trim. Bring each section up and forward to the same imaginary point above your head before making the cut. Because the hair on the bottom of your head has further to travel when it is lifted up above your head, it will end up being longer than the hair on top of your head. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your scissors to cut any curls that look uneven.",
      "content": "Use your scissors to cut any curls that look uneven. Once you are done cutting the basic layers, let your hair fall naturally around your head, like you would normally wear it. If there are pieces that look too long or that stick out too far away from the rest of your hair, give them a quick trim . [8] X Research source The overall shape of your hair should be fairly even and symmetrical. If the curls on one side of your head are sticking out a lot farther than they are on the other side, resection the longer hair and trim each of these sections to be a little shorter."
