      "content": "Work with ripe peppers. The peppers should be deep green and have a firm texture. [1] X Research source Use peppers that are as fresh as possible. Peppers harvested directly from your garden work best, but you can also buy them at the store as long as you choose peppers that are in good shape. If you cannot freeze the green peppers immediately, refrigerate them temporarily and freeze them within a day. Do not use green peppers that have weak coloring, soft spots, or other rotted spots. Stay away from peppers that are overripe or those that have been sitting out for several days."

[3] X Research source Use a sharp paring knife to cut around the stem. Slowly lift the stem out, removing the majority of the seeds in the process. Cut the green pepper in half widthwise, from side to side. Rinse each half with water to remove any loose seeds. If needed, you may use the paring knife to cut away any remaining sections with attached seeds. You can leave the green peppers as halves or you can cut them into smaller pieces. For instance, you can dice them, chop them into 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) pieces, cut them into skinny strips, or slice them into thin rings. The exact cut is a matter of preference and should be determined based on the form you will need to green peppers to be in after thawing them out."

[4] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source If you plan on using the green peppers in fresh, uncooked dishes, do not blanch them. Skip the blanching process entirely and go directly to the freezing process. Green peppers that are frozen raw have a crisper texture when thawed. Blanching is an important process if you plan on using the green peppers in cooked foods, however. Blanching removes enzymes and bacteria that destroy nutrients, flavor, and color over time. As a result, your peppers will retain their present condition and value longer in the freezer."

[9] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source If you blanched the peppers beforehand, leave 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container to allow the peppers room to expand as they freeze. If you did not blanch the peppers, however, you do not need to leave any headspace. Glass containers are not recommended since they tend to break and shatter in the freezer. If packaging the green peppers in plastic bags, squeeze out as much excess air from the bag as possible before sealing it. Excess air is more likely to lead to freezer burn. Vacuum-sealed bags are ideal, but not necessary. Label the bag or container with the current date so that you will be able to keep track of how long the peppers are in the freezer."
