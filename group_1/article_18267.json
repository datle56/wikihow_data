      "title": "Put water bottles in the fridge for 2 hours and 45 minutes exactly.",
      "content": "Put water bottles in the fridge for 2 hours and 45 minutes exactly. The water should still be liquid, but the temperature is actually below freezing. If the bottles are frozen, then something has gone wrong. Recheck the temperature and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give the bottle a firm jolt.",
      "content": "Give the bottle a firm jolt. The entire bottle should slowly turn into ice. You can also open the bottle which may start the freezing process. If you freeze the bottle with the cap off, or carefully remove the cap, then you can try dropping a piece of ice into the water to instantly change it to ice. You can also pour the water over ice and make yourself ice sculptures."

    {
      "title": "Remove impurities from water.",
      "content": "Remove impurities from water. Water from the tap often contains minerals and other impurities, which makes it more difficult for the water to form ice crystals. Use water with fewer impurities for fasting freezing times. Any of the following options have less impurities: Bottled water Boiled water Filtered water"
    },
    {
      "title": "Increase surface area.",
      "content": "Increase surface area. The bigger the surface area in relationship with the total amount of water will reduce the amount of time it takes for the water to freeze. For example, an ice cube tray will freeze much faster than a bottle of water. Another example is if you take a bottle of water and empty it out onto a cookie sheet, the cookie sheet will freeze faster than the bottle. The ice cube tray and cookie sheets freeze faster because they have more surface area directly touching the cold air."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chill ice cube trays.",
      "content": "Chill ice cube trays. Leaving an empty ice cube tray in the freezer will help quickly freeze water when you are ready to make ice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use metal trays.",
      "content": "Use metal trays. Metal conducts heat better than plastic. If you have an ice cube tray made out of copper, then it helps remove the heat from the water faster than its plastic counterpart. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Boil water before freezing.",
      "content": "Boil water before freezing. This may seem counterproductive, but hot water can actually freeze faster than cold. This is called the Mpemba effect. There is some debate among scientists about why this is the case, but many agree that it has to do with the fact that the bonds that hold hot water together are similar to the bonds in ice crystals.

    {
      "title": "Increase the power of your freezer.",
      "content": "Increase the power of your freezer. Most refrigerators have a temperature setting that you can adjust. It sometimes takes several hours before a temperature change can take effect, but if you have the freezer on the coldest setting, then it will help to freeze water faster. [4] X Research source Refrain from opening your freezer too often. Every time you open the freezer door, cold air escapes, increasing the temperature inside of it. If you really need to check it periodically, avoid doing so for one hour intervals."

      "title": "Fill a container with water.",
      "content": "Fill a container with water. Any container that holds water without leaking will work fine. You can choose to fill it all the way or part way with water. Don’t use porcelain cups or hard bottles. Water expands as it freezes, so if you use a mug or Nalgene bottle to freeze water in, then it is possible that it will crack the container. A metal cup, ice cube tray, or a plastic disposable water bottle are all good options. If you boil water before freezing it, the ice will come out crystal clear instead of cloudy. There are several molds you can find online that will let you freeze ice into different shapes, such as a fish, skull, or even a shot glass."

      "title": "Wait for 2 to 5 hours.",
      "content": "Wait for 2 to 5 hours. It will take a while for the water to completely freeze. The bigger the container of water, the longer it may take. For example, water in an ice cube tray will freeze faster than an entire bottle full of water."
