Keep the color scheme simple; stick to black, white, gray or brown. If you don't have a suit jacket, then wear a vest and roll up the sleeves of your collared shirt. Either wear a white collared shirt with a black tie or a black collared shirt with a white tie. Wear a pair of black or brown dress shoes. If you want to add a dash of color, just try to make them work in harmony. Use the color wheel and look at which colors sit together on it. For example, blue and green work really great together."
