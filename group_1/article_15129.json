      "content": "Tell them a famous duck joke from the legendary comedian. Buddy Hackett was an actor and comedian who was known for both crude standup routines and starring in family-friendly movies made by Disney. He even voiced Scuttle the seagull in Disney’s The Little Mermaid . [7] X Research source Here’s the duck joke he famously told on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on August 27, 1987 : This guy shoots a duck. It falls, hits a barn, and goes into a guy’s yard. This guy climbs over the fence, and he goes into the yard to get this duck. A farmer comes out and he’s a big guy. He says, “What are you doing in my yard?” The guy says, “I’ve come to get the duck. It’s my duck.” The farmer says, “This is not your duck. This is my yard. That duck fell and hit my barn.” The guy says, “That’s not your duck. I shot the duck. I've been out hunting for a couple of days. Give me a break. You know, I’m from the city.” The farmer says, “You’re from the city? Well, you don’t understand about property, do you? This is my property. It’s my duck. However, I’ll give you a chance at the duck. We can settle this country style.” The guy says, “Country style?” The farmer says, “Yeah.” The guy asks, “How do you settle it country style?” The farmer says, “How? I kick you in the groin. And then you kick me in the groin. And we take turns kicking each other in the groin. Whoever’s left keeps the duck.” The guy says, “Well, if that’s what I have to do.” The farmer says, “I go first.” He hauls off and…WHACK. The guy falls to the ground moaning in pain.

      "content": "Pick the right duck joke for the situation and audience. Muñoz suggests using humor carefully in serious situations and always paying attention to your audience’s reaction. For example, a duck joke that normally kills at parties might go over like a lead balloon at a funeral. Part of being funny is the ability to read the room by paying attention to the mood and listening to what people are talking about. If you’re hearing a lot of laughter, listen to the types of things people are laughing at. Then, match your joke to the overall vibe. If you’re in a crowd that includes kids and adults, stick to jokes that are funny, appropriate, and understandable for all ages to get the most laughs."

      "title": "Pause before delivering the punchline.",
      "content": "Pause before delivering the punchline. Timing is everything when you’re delivering a joke . That’s especially true when you’re dropping the punchline. Good comedic timing involves using pauses and how quickly—or slowly—you speak to make a joke even funnier. [8] X Research source For example, the classic Henny Youngman joke, “Take my wife…please,” wouldn’t be as funny without the pause before “please.” One of the most famous forms of comedic timing is the “pregnant pause.” This is pausing after the joke’s set up to build tension for the punchline. Just remember, even the funniest joke can fall flat if the timing is off. Pause just long enough for people to start to think about the setup. Don’t give them too much time to figure out the gag or the punchline might be disappointing."

      "content": "Don’t take it personally if your joke doesn’t get a laugh. Payne says that sometimes your joke will bomb, but that’s okay. Not getting laughs is just part of telling jokes. The best thing you can do when a joke bombs is to shrug it off and move on . Payne advises to “just have fun, do your best, but know that you’ll probably fail the first few times.” The good news is that you’ll get better at telling jokes the more you do it. Payne says you just have to be confident and believe in yourself when you’re telling a joke."
