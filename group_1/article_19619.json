Keep in mind that the lights will probably deter other critters and wildlife from your yard as well.

      "content": "Skunks don’t like loud noises, and a radio may scare them away. If you know that skunks like to head inside an outdoor shed or under your deck, place a radio nearby and turn it onto a talk radio station. Leave it on at night to scare skunks away and keep them off your property. [3] X Research source If you have neighbors close by, they might not appreciate this tactic. Instead, try an ultrasonic skunk repellent that emits a high-pitched noise. Skunks can hear it, but humans can’t."

      "content": "Keep trash cans secured tightly to remove a skunk’s food source. Skunks are scavengers, and an open trash can or compost pile is like a 3-course meal for them. Keep your garbage in a thick plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, and put it inside, if possible. [4] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source If you have a compost pile outside, don’t put kitchen scraps in it until the skunks are gone. Leaving kitchen scraps outside is a great way to attract skunks to your yard."

If you notice any bird seed on the ground, clean it up before nightfall to avoid attracting skunks.

      "content": "Get rid of grubs to remove a natural food source for skunks. Your tall, watered lawn may be hiding a plethora of delicious grubs that attract skunks. To quickly get rid of grubs, stop watering your lawn for 3 to 4 weeks. As your lawn dries out, the grubs will die, and the skunks will look for food elsewhere. [7] X Research source You can also release nematodes in your lawn, or sprinkle milky spore over your lawn to kill grubs. However, these methods can take years to kill off grubs, so they’re not ideal."

Put up chicken wire to keep skunks out and prevent them from making a home. [8] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Make sure you aren’t blocking off an area that has skunks in it currently, since trapping them in a small space could kill them. If you’re not sure, put loose dirt or wood shavings into an area and leave it for 2 to 3 days. If the dirt and wood chips aren’t disturbed after 3 days, you can safely assume that no skunks are living there."

      "content": "The smell of ammonia is a known skunk deterrent. Ironically, skunks aren’t a huge fan of strong smells, like ammonia. Dip a few rags into ammonia and leave them around your property to hopefully send the skunks elsewhere. [9] X Research source Ammonia tends to evaporate quickly. Be sure to replace the rags every day for this technique to be effective. Some people also have success with other strong scents, like soaps and citrus sprays. These aren’t proven by experts to deter skunks, but they can’t hurt, either."

The smell of the repellent will deter the skunks and make them go elsewhere. [10] X Research source Most skunk repellents are safe to use around animals and children. However, always read the label carefully on your skunk repellent, and follow the safety instructions on the bottle."
