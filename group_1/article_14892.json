      "title": "Drink Metaxa in a rocks glass.",
      "content": "Drink Metaxa in a rocks glass. If you love the taste of Metaxa, this is the purest way to drink it. A rocks glass, also called a lowball or old-fashioned glass, is a small glass that you can use to drink most liquors. Pour the Metaxa into the glass a quarter or a halfway and sip on it to enjoy it in its pure form. [1] X Research source If you prefer your Metaxa chilled, leave the bottle in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours."

    {
      "title": "Add ice cubes to the drink to chill it.",
      "content": "Add ice cubes to the drink to chill it. If you prefer your liquor to be ice cold when you drink it, add one or two ice cubes to the rocks glass. This will also slightly water down the Metaxa as it melts which will make it taste less intense. [2] X Research source Large, square ice cubes work best with Metaxa."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take shots",
      "content": "Take shots of Metaxa to celebrate or avoid the taste. If you don’t prefer the taste of Metaxa but want to drink it, you can take shots of it. While it isn’t the most traditional way to drink the liquor, it could be appropriate when celebrating. Fill the shot glass up and tilt your head back. Try to drink the contents of the shot in one gulp. You should not take more than 1 or 2 shots in a 1-2 hour period because of the high alcohol content. You can mix the shot with an equal amount of Kahlua or creme de cacao to make it taste creamy. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Frost a cocktail shaker and tall glass for a colder drink.",
      "content": "Frost a cocktail shaker and tall glass for a colder drink. A cocktail shaker is a metal cup that you can use to mix cocktails and can be purchased from department stores or online. Place the cocktail shaker and tall glass into the freezer for 15 minutes to frost them. This will help keep the drink cool as you mix it. [4] X Research source You can also pour the ingredients in the glass and mix it with a spoon, but they won’t be as well incorporated."

      "title": "Pour a shot of orange juice and a shot of Metaxa into the shaker.",
      "content": "Pour a shot of orange juice and a shot of Metaxa into the shaker. Use a jigger to measure out about 1 shot, or about 5 cl (1.7 fl oz) of Metaxa and 1 shot of orange juice directly into the shaker. If you don’t have a shaker, pour them directly into the tall glass you’ll use to drink the Metaxa. [5] X Research source Replace the orange juice with cranberry juice for a more tart drink. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour 2 cl (0.68 fl oz) of lime juice and liquid sugar cane into the drink.",
      "content": "Pour 2 cl (0.68 fl oz) of lime juice and liquid sugar cane into the drink. Pour 2 cl (0.68 fl oz) of both liquids directly into the shaker. You can also use agave nectar as an alternative to sugar cane. The sugar cane or nectar will add a sweetness to the drink while the lime juice will add a tart flavor. [7] X Research source You can replace liquid sugar cane with high-fructose corn syrup but it won’t be as healthy."

      "content": "Shake the drink and pour it into a tall glass. Attach the lid to the shaker and shake the drink up and down over your shoulder vigorously. Then, remove the lid to the shaker and strain it out into a tall glass. [8] X Research source Straining the drink will remove any pulp from the juice that you added to it."

      "title": "Garnish the top of the drink and serve it.",
      "content": "Garnish the top of the drink and serve it. Metaxa cocktails are typically garnished with a grapefruit slice, orange zest, or chocolate shreds. Grapefruit or orange will add a fresh citrus taste to the drink while chocolate shreds will add sweetness. [9] X Research source Other popular garnishes that go well with Metaxa include lime zest, grapes, and orange slices."

      "title": "Cut 1 lemon",
      "content": "Cut 1 lemon and 1 orange into slices. If you want to eat the fruit directly from the drink, peel the lemon and orange before you cut it. Then, hold the lemon on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it into .5 in (1.3 cm) thick slices. Do the same thing to the orange. If you don’t peel the fruit first, thoroughly rinse it under cold water before you cut it to remove harmful pesticides and dirt on the skin."

      "content": "Dice .5 pounds (230 g) of watermelon into cubes. Peel the skin off the watermelon first. Then, cut the watermelon into small 1 in × 1 in (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) squares. Once you’ve cut up around .5 lb (230 g) of watermelon, or about 3 cups, set it aside for later. [10] X Research source If your watermelon has seeds, remove the seeds from the pulp with a small spoon."

      "content": "Mix 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 ml) of Metaxa and 3.2 c (760 ml) of red wine in a pitcher. The Metaxa and red wine blend will serve as the base of your Sangria. Pour both of them into a large pitcher and use a spoon with a long handle to mix it together until both liquids are well incorporated. You’ll know when both liquids are well mixed when the colors blend together into a dark red."

      "title": "Add the fruit and 3 US tbsp (44 ml) of agave nectar into the pitcher.",
      "content": "Add the fruit and 3 US tbsp (44 ml) of agave nectar into the pitcher. Carefully place the cut up watermelon, lemon slices, and orange slices into the pitcher and use the spoon to mix it up. Then, measure 3 US tbsp (44 ml) of agave nectar and pour it into the pitcher. The orange and lemon slices will add a slightly bitter, citrus flavor to the drink. The agave nectar adds sweetness to the drink."

      "content": "Refrigerate the drink for a minimum of 2 hours and serve. If you want an even colder drink, refrigerate the sangria overnight. This will also allow the fruit to soak up more alcohol. You can serve the sangria in a glass as is, or you can serve it over ice depending on your preference. You can store the sangria in your refrigerator for up to 3 days."
