      "title": "Draw a circle with the compass.",
      "content": "Draw a circle with the compass. Align the pencil tip with the tip of the needle. Place the point of the compass down on the paper. Set the distance between the pencil and needle equal to the radius of the circle that you would like and draw. Swing the compass around 360° to complete the circle. [1] X Research source Make sure the hinge is tight so it doesn’t slip while drawing. Also make sure the pencil is securely in its holder so it also doesn’t move while drawing. This first circle is the main circle that you will be dividing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a second circle whose center is the edge of the first circle.",
      "content": "Draw a second circle whose center is the edge of the first circle. Place the needle of the compass at any point along the edge of the main circle. Keep the distance between the needle and pencil the same as the first circle. Swing the compass around to complete the second circle. [2] X Research source The second circle should overlap with the first circle and the edge should cross through the center of the first circle. If the distance between the needle and the pencil changes at all, the circle will not be divided equally."

      "title": "Use the intersection of the first and second circle to draw a third circle.",
      "content": "Use the intersection of the first and second circle to draw a third circle. Place the needle at the intersection of the first and second circle. There are two intersections and you can use either one; this will be the center of a third circle. Use the compass to complete the third circle. [3] X Research source Again, keep the compass at the same distance for every circle you draw. At this point you should have three overlapping circles. You should notice that the two outer circles overlap with the center of the first main circle."

      "title": "Draw a fourth circle using the intersection of the main circle and the third circle.",
      "content": "Draw a fourth circle using the intersection of the main circle and the third circle. Just as you did to draw the second and third circle, use the intersection of the third circle with the main circle as the center point. Remember, going clockwise around the circle, you will use the intersection to the left of the circle. Place the compass on that intersection and draw a fourth circle. [4] X Research source You are halfway done with drawing circles."

      "title": "Draw three more circles using the next intersection of each circle.",
      "content": "Draw three more circles using the next intersection of each circle. Using the intersection of the previously drawn circle with the main circle as the center, draw the next circle. Continue the next three circles until you have a total of six circles all around the main circle. [5] X Research source The inside of your original circle should now look like a 6 petaled flower."

      "content": "Use a ruler to draw a straight line through the center of the circle. This is the first of three lines you will need to draw to divide the circle into 6 parts. Every line, including this one, should cross the exact center of the circle and divide two of the six inner \"flower petals\" of your drawing in half."

Choose a point anywhere along the circle and draw a line through the center of the circle to the opposite end. The circle is now divided into two equal pieces. This method works well if you are trying to cut a pie or a cake."

You can approximate this by dividing one half of the cake into three equal pieces. [7] X Research source Get as close to three equal pieces as possible. Again, this method is just an approximation."

      "content": "Extend those lines into the other half of the circle. Continue both of those lines through the center of the circle to the opposite side of the circle. If done correctly, the circle should now be divided into six approximately equal parts. This method is not exact, but is an easy way to divide the circle into six equal parts by eye."

If you accidentally press the key too many times, simply push the left arrow key to decrease the number of divisions. When the circle is the size you want and divided into 6 equal parts, you can let go of the mouse. If you let go of the mouse too early, there is an alternative method: Keep the Polar Grid tool active (don’t click back to the black arrow) and click on any whitespace in your document.
