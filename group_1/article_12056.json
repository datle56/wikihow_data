Instead of starting complaining about what they are doing, simply share how you feel. When we are scared, it's normal to either fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. Do your best to express to your partner how their actions link to how you feel in yourself with clarity. You might say, “I’m a little nervous right now. Would you mind slowing down?” You might also try stating something like, “That sudden turn back there startled me.” Try to end the conversation saying something like, \"I know you may not see it the same way but I really need your help in this.\""
