      "content": "Disorganized attachment styles cause people to feel fear in their relationships. Also known as a fearful-avoidant attachment style, this attachment is characterized by fear, mistrust, and conflict within the individual. People with a disorganized attachment style often desire intimacy but also put up barriers to protect themselves from being hurt. Their emotions within their relationships with others are often conflicting, and they generally view the world as a hazardous place. The disorganized attachment style is 1 of the 4 attachment styles. The other 3 are: Secure: Secure attachment styles result in stable, healthy, and long-lasting relationships and often stem from healthy relationships with a caregiver during childhood. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Anxious-preoccupied: People with this type of attachment style often have low self-esteem and a fear of being abandoned within their relationships. This is often caused by childhood neglect or other past traumatic experiences. Anxious-avoident: Those with an anxious-avoidant attachment style are usually unwilling or unable to connect with others intimately on a physical or emotional basis. This usually results from a caregiver who didn’t provide enough emotional support."

      "content": "Fear of rejection People with disorganized attachment styles deeply desire intimacy and closeness with others, but they’re often afraid that the people in their lives will reject them. This often manifests in their relationships as clinginess or even possessiveness on the disorganized person’s part. They might crave attention from those around them, and they may even become controlling of others. [2] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source For example, a disorganized person might easily become jealous and accuse their partner of cheating if they talk to someone else. Children with a disorganized attachment style will often become distressed if they’re left with an unfamiliar babysitter or other caregiver."

      "title": "Distrust of others",
      "content": "Distrust of others Despite craving closeness and intimacy, people with a disorganized attachment style usually are very distrustful of others and view the world as a dangerous place. Therefore, it can be hard for them to develop the kind of intimate relationships that they desire, and they often purposefully try to establish distance and independence from others. [3] X Research source For example, a disorganized person might prefer casual flings rather than choosing to settle down in a long-term relationship. For some, their disorganized attachment style may be the result of an abusive or neglectful upbringing, and this may make them fearful of getting hurt again."

      "title": "Inability to regulate emotions",
      "content": "Inability to regulate emotions Someone with a disorganized attachment style can quickly swing between extreme emotions and have a hard time controlling them. This is often due to their conflicting thoughts regarding relationships. On the one hand, they crave closeness, but they also believe that others aren’t dependable. Therefore, this can cause them to swing between extreme emotions, oftentimes rather unpredictably. [4] X Research source For example, someone’s disorganized attachment style may cause them to go from loving their partner one day to feeling extreme resentment and loathing the next. A disorganized attachment style can also cause a person to lash out in anger or aggression, and they may even become violent in certain situations."

      "content": "Inconsistent or chaotic behavior The way a disorganized person behaves can be very contradictory. This can even be seen in children with this type of attachment style. After being separated from their caregiver, a child may act conflicted by initially running toward their caregiver, but then change their mind and run away. The individual’s conflicting thoughts and perceptions of others can cause such inconsistent behavior.

They might also suddenly change their self-image and fluctuate between high and low views of themselves. This can cause them to abruptly change their goals, opinions, and relationships. For example, they might feel a high sense of self-worth and go out and look for a romantic relationship, but then suddenly be overly critical of themselves and quickly break off the relationship. A person with a disorganized attachment style who’s suffered from abuse or neglect in the past might view themselves as someone who’s unworthy of love or affection."

      "title": "Abuse",
      "content": "Abuse Sadly, many people’s disorganized attachment style is a direct result of past physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. For many, this abuse occurred during their childhoods and was initiated by a caregiver or another adult figure in their lives. Abuse of any kind can cause a child to become extremely distrustful and fearful of others, and these negative emotions can easily manifest in their adult relationships through their disorganized attachment style. A child can feel very conflicted when it comes to an abusive caregiver. On one hand, they likely fear and distrust their caregiver, but still view them as someone they can’t survive without and depend on. As a disorganized attachment style forms, a person may feel similar conflicting feelings of fear and desire for closeness in their adult relationships."

      "content": "Inconsistent parenting Caregivers who fluctuate between being affectionate and distant can cause a child to form a disorganized attachment style. Such inconsistent behavior can be really confusing, and a child may find it increasingly difficult to trust and depend on their parent. As a result, they may have a hard time getting close to and trusting others later on in life, and they may even replicate some of these conflicting behaviors in their own relationships.

For example, seeing a caregiver act out violently toward someone or having to witness them deal with an addiction can be very traumatizing and create a lot of fear and distrust in a child. Unfortunately, such traumatic experiences can stick with a person for a long time, and they may result in a disorganized attachment style that affects future relationships."
