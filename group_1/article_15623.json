The Browse window will close and you'll return to your email. If you need to attach multiple files to one email that are in the same folder on your computer, there are a few ways to attach them at the same time: If the files are in order, click the first file, hold down ⇧ Shift , then click the last file. Click Open to attach them. If the files are not in order, hold down Ctrl (Windows) or ⌘ Command (Mac) while clicking each file. Once the last file has been selected, let go of the Ctrl or ⌘ Command key and then click Open . If you want to send the entire folder, Oppido recommends uploading it to Google Drive or Dropbox . Or, if you're composing the email message in Gmail, Oppido suggests dragging the folder directly into the body of the message. \"Gmail will offer to upload it to Google Drive and provide a link,\" he explains. When the recipient receives the link, they can choose which files to download. Most email services will have a limit on how big the files you can attach are. File size is usually limited to a max of 20 to 25 MB. [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft.
