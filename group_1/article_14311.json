      "title": "Learn the foundation of calligraphy.",
      "content": "Learn the foundation of calligraphy. Calligraphy letters are drawn using thick and thin strokes to create shapes. They are not written like traditional letters. This ‘thick-and-thin’ effect creates a flowing, consistent pattern. [1] X Research source Here are basic rules to follow: Keep the pen-angle constant. Don't push too hard on the nib. Draw parallel lines and even curves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a variety of nibs.",
      "content": "Get a variety of nibs. A ‘calligraphy nib’ refers to a pen tip that is broad and flat instead of a more commonly rounded point pen such as a fountain pen. This wide, flat structure allows the nib to create a unique ‘thick-and-thin’ effect which is what makes calligraphic letters look fancy. Nibs come in different widths, so having several will allow you to experiment. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hold your pen at a constant angle.",
      "content": "Hold your pen at a constant angle. Hold the pen between your thumb and index finger, while resting the pen on your middle finger. It is important that you hold the pen so that the tip of the nib points away from you and to the left, at around 30° to 60°. The angle will vary depending on the specific script that you want to create, or naturally with the way you hold the pen. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain proper form.",
      "content": "Maintain proper form. As you write, the nib should never turn to form lines and curves. The trick to creating beautiful, uniform calligraphy is to keep the point in the same direction. This is why you will have to pick your hand up to create several strokes that form each letter. Each stroke follows a pattern and shares similarities with other letters. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not press hard on the pen.",
      "content": "Do not press hard on the pen. Form each stroke by gently leading the nib across the paper. Your strokes will move backwards, forwards, and sideways from the direction the nib is pointing. Your hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow should not be touching the table. By fully supporting your hand and arm, it will help you keep a light pressure on the pen to help your strokes flow. [5] X Research source You may damage the nib if you press too hard. If you lean on the pen, your letters may not flow, and your arm may get tired. [6] X Research source By pushing the nib incorrectly, it may dig into the paper and blot. Always follow the strokes of calligraphy. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Draw vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines parallel with one another.",
      "content": "Draw vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines parallel with one another. Regardless of the specific type of calligraphy you draw, this same rule will follow. For example, italic calligraphy is created with lines that slope away upwards to the right, while Roman letters are drawn with perfectly vertical, straight-up-and-down lines. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Beware of the different angles.",
      "content": "Beware of the different angles. Each skill focuses on the practice of accurate angles. Drawing lines that have the same angle as each other is just as important as keeping your pen-nib at a constant angle. If you draw lines at the correct angle, they won't look right if your pen is not kept at the correct angle. Never alter your pen angle for different line strokes. As you form each letter, you will constantly be picking the pen up from the paper to start new lines. To keep your pen angle accurate, do not move the pen from your fingers before finishing a letter, and do not twist the pen around between your fingers."

The letters share many shapes to create a uniform and flowing piece of work. Here are important skills to use: Keep the pen angle at 30° to 45° Draw straight vertical lines Draw short, diagonal lines for decorative tails Use small, controlled movements Create a flow and a rhythm among the letters"

      "title": "Use several strokes to form each letter.",
      "content": "Use several strokes to form each letter. Instead of one fluid motion to form a letter, you will use two to four strokes to create each one that will form a pattern among the letters. Even though each letter is different, there are certain shapes that many of them have in common. [11] X Research source"

Hold your pen at a 30° angle, and make a straight line down and a sharp 45° tail up and to the right. The tail should be small with a sharp edge and not interfere with any part of the letter.

Lift your pen, and make the bottom part of the circular pattern by moving from left to right, and stroking upwards.
