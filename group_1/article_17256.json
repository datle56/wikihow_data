      "content": "Consider the qualities you want in a spouse. Though you may never know exactly who is the perfect fit for you until you lock eyes with that person and your world stops, it can help you to narrow down the qualities you know you're looking for in your future spouse. These qualities may be so important to you that you would have a hard time even considering a person who doesn't possess some of them. [1] X Research source As you look for your future spouse , keep an eye out for certain traits you need in a partner. For instance, you might want your partner to share your religion, sense of humor, or family values: if you want to have a bunch of kids, it's important your spouse shares that desire. Make sure their personality and lifestyle align with your values and long-term goals. For instance, if your plans include buying a home and raising a family, you want a partner who is mature and reliable and who has their finances in order. You may want certain traits that don't match yours: for example, if you're socially anxious, someone with a relaxed personality may balance you out. Ideally, the person you love won't share all of your interests—variety is the spice of life, after all! Still, it’s essential to have some things in common with your spouse so you have things to talk about and activities to bond over. Some people who seem incompatible at first may change over time, but as a general rule, avoid going into any relationship expecting your partner to change.

      "content": "Consider the qualities you don't want. The qualities you don't want in a future spouse can be just as important and decisive as the qualities you are looking for. As you start looking for your soulmate, think about your deal breakers , the things that will make it impossible for you to get hitched no matter what. It may be helpful to look back at your past relationships and understand what you didn't like about them and why they didn't work. Here are some things to consider: [2] X Research source Lack of attraction: physical attraction can grow, but it is not overrated. Though you may not want to rip off your husband's shirt 50 years—or hey, a few years—down the line, it’s necessary to have a baseline of attraction that keeps things going. Even if the person fits the mold in all other aspects, sadly, you just can't force yourself to be attracted to someone. Lack of agreement on something that really matters to you: if you’re really politically active and your partner holds completely opposite views, then you may have a problem. You don’t have to agree on every little detail, but if there's something that defines who you are that your future spouse absolutely doesn't understand or agree with, then your relationship may not last. Geographical incompatibility: you may have found the love of your life, but if they live in Hawaii and you live in New York and neither of you has any plans to relocate, it may not work."

Though making a list of all the things you want and don't want can help you have a better sense of what will truly make you happy, the truth is that you won't ever be able to find the person who satisfies all of your needs—and that's OK. The right person for you will be the one that makes you the happiest, and that person may even fulfill some needs that you didn't know you had. Don't bend on the things you know are deal breakers, but don’t turn a person down because they don't meet all of your needs. This is unrealistic and being too picky won't get you very far."

That special person may pass every future spouse test with flying colors, but when you're together, you may find that there's just a lack of...something. Maybe you just don't really \"get\" each other; maybe you always end up bickering; maybe you just can't talk without running out of things to say after a few minutes. If you're not compatible, you're not compatible, and there's nothing you can do to change that. [3] X Research source Sexual attraction is different from compatibility—it wears off. Compatibility means that your personalities really work well together, and that things just click for you more often than not."

      "content": "Give the relationship time to grow before committing. Though you may have been wanting to get married for 20 years, avoid running down the aisle after 2 weeks with the person you think is Mr. Right. Even if you just have \"that feeling,\" it's very risky to marry someone you've known for just a few months, or even just a year. Give the relationship enough time to know that your feelings aren't just based on attraction, that you can get through some ups and downs together, and that you can really truly see a lifetime of happiness with that person. [4] X Research source You may think that you're absolutely sure after just a few months, but this won't give you enough time to test the relationship. Experts advise dating for at least 3 years to give you time to get to know your potential spouse really well. [5] X Research source"

Though marriage will naturally change 2 people as they become bonded more closely, make sure that the person you want to be with lets you truly be yourself instead of expecting you to be some ideal person.

Before committing to someone, try to ensure that you have the same vision of the future—whether it's settling down in a nice house with 2 kids, or traveling the world and being nomads together.

That could be a very long time, so make sure that you really mean that you want to see that person grow old, to have kids with that person (if that's what you both want), to support each other's careers or other pursuits, and to truly become life partners. \"I do\" means \"I do want to be with you forever,\" not \"I do want to be with you for a while.\" If you’ve found someone you really cannot imagine not being with for the rest of your life, then congratulations—you’ve found the right partner or spouse.

You don't have to be 100% satisfied with yourself, but if you're unhappy with who you are, you're at risk of getting together with someone just because they make you feel better about yourself.

You may want love more than anything in the world, and it's natural for you to feel lonely or sad if you can't find it. But part of loving yourself is loving spending time solo , and finding ways to stay interested and excited about life without a significant other. This will make you feel even better when that special person comes along! If you're miserable by yourself, then you will be too easily swayed by the first person who comes along and gives you something to do. Don't expect someone to come and save you. Don't mistake companionship for love. Even if you know you’d like to get married someday, it’s still best to take time to get to know yourself before shacking up. Reader Poll: We asked 545 wikiHow readers how they feel about marriage, and 72% said that they’d like to get married someday . [Take Poll] So while it might feel difficult to be single now, rest assured that there are still plenty of people out there that want the same things you do."

      "content": "Be open to dating lots of different people. If you find your first love when you're 16, then you are a rare and lucky breed. However, most people do not marry their first, or second, or even their third or fourth partner. Dating more people lets you understand the endless ways that a relationship can work, and can help you see that there are so many forms and dynamics that a relationship can have. [8] X Research source We're not saying to ditch the person you love just to play the field, but if you think you're just \"pretty happy\" with the person you're with but have never dated anyone else, it's better to see what's out there than to settle. Dating a lot of people helps you learn to compromise, and it'll will help you narrow down what you're looking for in a spouse, so that when you find them, you'll be more certain they're the one for you. Don’t feel pressured to have sex if you’re not comfortable, but if you want to have a sexual relationship with your future spouse, having a few partners before you've met your special someone may help you be sure that the chemistry you share is truly special. If you end up committing to the first person you've been with without being truly happy, you may spend the rest of your life wondering about what's out there."

People settle for partners they don't really connect with all too often because that person makes them feel less alone and loved, even if it's not in the right way. Another reason people settle is because they've been with the same person for 5 years and realize they \"might as well\" get married because that's what everyone else is doing or because they've been together for so long that it seems like the only logical step. Only get married if that's what you want, not because it's what the other person wants, because it's what your family wants, or because you're too scared to say goodbye."

It makes sense: in a given day, you may spend more time with your coworkers than anyone else, and if you love what you do, then you and that person may have similar interests. Avoid actively pursuing your coworkers because that could be breaking your company code—and coming on strongly could make a coworker uncomfortable. But don’t be afraid to develop platonic relationships with coworkers and see where they go."

Though it's less likely, the perfect person can come up to you at any time at all, so don't put your blinders up at the wrong time. Try not to be distracted looking for your future spouse at a company meeting or at a funeral, but be open to the possibility that love can strike at almost any time. If you're receptive, then more people will be receptive to wanting to get to know you. While being open will help you recognize an opportunity when it falls in your lap, avoid expecting to find your perfect person at any given moment. Don’t put pressure on every interaction you have with a hot stranger. Just go with the flow."
