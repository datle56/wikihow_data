      "content": "Pour henna powder in a bowl and mix it with brewed chamomile tea . The first thing you’ll need to do is brew 1 cup (240 mL) of chamomile tea. The tea is used to release the dye in the henna. While it is still hot, slowly pour it in a bowl of 100% pure henna powder and mix it with a fork or whisk until you get a chunky yogurt consistency. The amount of henna you use depends on your hair length and thickness. It is recommended to use 3.5 ounces (99 g) for every 6 inches (15 cm) of hair. [1] X Research source Only use 100% pure henna and indigo powders instead of store-bought henna hair dye. These may contain harmful chemicals and are not completely natural. If you plan on visiting a professional hair colorist to lighten your hair anytime in the future, avoid using henna or indigo. These products can cause buildup in your hair that makes this process difficult."

      "content": "Cover the henna mixture with plastic wrap and let it sit for 8-10 hours. Your henna mixture needs to sit for a long period of time to thicken and release the dye. Once you have finished mixing the tea and henna, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it in a warm spot for at least 8 hours. Leave it by a sunny window or under a lamp, as the warm temperature will allow the dye to release more quickly. [2] X Research source You’ll know it’s ready when you see a reddish oil sitting on the surface of the mixture."

      "title": "Mix indigo powder and water in a separate bowl.",
      "content": "Mix indigo powder and water in a separate bowl. Prepare your indigo powder in a separate bowl from the henna and tea mixture. Add water and mix it with a fork until the consistency is thick and creamy. The more indigo powder you use, the darker the color will turn out. When you finally mix the henna and indigo together, you’ll want the indigo to make up 75% of the mixture in order for your hair to be completely black. [3] X Research source For example, if you used 3.5 ounces (99 g) of henna, use at least 7.5 ounces (210 g) of indigo powder. If you do any less, your hair color will turn out dark brown or red."

      "title": "Blend the indigo and henna mixtures together.",
      "content": "Blend the indigo and henna mixtures together. Now, add the henna mixture in the bowl with your indigo. Stir it together with a fork until it’s blended completely. Keep stirring until the two colors become one. If there are remnants of the mixtures on the inner sides of the bowl, scrape them off with the fork and mix them into the bottom. This will ensure that everything is completely combined. [4] X Research source It is very important that the two mixtures are completely blended. If not, you may end up dyeing different parts of the hair different colors. To test if you're allergic to the henna dye, do a patch test. Apply it to your skin in an inconspicuous area, like behind your ear or on the inside of your arm, and wait 24 hours. If you don't develop any kind of allergic reaction, the dye should be safe to use on your hair.

Start with the front sections and work your way toward the back. Make sure the henna is fully massaged into every strand of your hair as well as your scalp.

The plastic wrap will hold in the moisture while the color penetrates your hair follicles. Your hair should be wet and stiff enough to fold it up on top of your head. While it is in this position get enough of the plastic wrap to cover your hair. Let it sit like this for at least 2 hours while the dye penetrates your hair strands. [9] X Research source It’s best to use plastic wrap as opposed to a shower cap because it will do a better job of keeping the moisture in and holding your hair up without letting it fall."
