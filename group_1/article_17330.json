      "content": "More tips: Introduce new sight words by themselves first, then follow up right away with sentences, books, or other materials that use them. [7] X Research source Try not to introduce two sight words that look similar or can be easily confused in the same lesson or session. For example, space out words like “will” and “well” or “me” and “my.” Keep sight word sessions short but frequent (for example, only 10 minutes a day, most days of the week). See how your child responds before trying longer or shorter sessions. Give immediate, specific feedback while your child practices. For example, if they pronounce “does” correctly, say “Good job! That is the word ‘does.’” If they pronounce it incorrectly, say “That word is ‘does.’ Let’s say the word ‘does’ together.”"

      "title": "Most children know about 100 sight words by the end of first grade.",
      "content": "Most children know about 100 sight words by the end of first grade. There’s no “correct” number of sight words to know since each child learns and develops differently. A general rule of thumb as your child starts reading is to teach a handful of very common sight words in Pre-K, about 20 sight words in Kindergarten, and 100 in first grade. [8] X Research source It’s better for a child to fully grasp fewer words than to only kind of know a lot of words. In other words, don’t stress if your child can’t recognize 100 words in first grade—focus on strengthening the words they do know to help teach them to read more effectively."

      "title": "Sight words are common words that can be recognized automatically.",
      "content": "Sight words are common words that can be recognized automatically. When a beginning reader has a large vocabulary of simple sight words under their belt, they can devote more time and energy to understanding hard or new words (and can read more quickly and easily overall). There are two types of sight words: [9] X Research source High frequency sight words occur very often in printed English. They can be sounded out easily, but recognizing them by sight allows for faster reading (for example, “and,” “or,” “like”). Irregular sight words also occur frequently but are harder to sound out because they don’t use typical letter sounds (for example, “there,” “of,” “have”). Recognizing these automatically saves time and brain power while reading."

Above you’ll see PDFs to three of the most popular sight word charts. This includes: Dolch list: Educator Edward Dolch created this list in the 1930s based on popular children’s books of the time, and it’s still one of the most popular sight word lists today. Fry list: Another popular sight word list created by Dr. Edward Fry. Fry developed this more modern and comprehensive list (last updated in the 1980s) based on reading materials for grades 3-9. Math sight words: This list contains sight words children encounter frequently when learning math."
