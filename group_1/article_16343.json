Whoever lands the most successful throws wins the game. [18] X Research source Miller explains, “Summer parties almost always have to include cornhole. It's such a simple game, but it allows for anybody of any ability and any state of sobriety to participate.” Let children stand closer to the board to make it easier for them to play. To play in rounds, score the tosses so each beanbag in the hole is worth three points, and each one that lands on the board is worth one point. Whoever reaches 21 points first wins the game."
