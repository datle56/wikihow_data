      "content": "Choose a permanent dye. There are two different kinds of hair dye: permanent and temporary. Permanent dye lifts the hair cuticle and lasts for months. Temporary color, which places the dye on top of the natural hair color, will last for a few days or weeks. Since you’re dyeing black hair red, you’ll need a permanent dye. Search for a product that’s the correct shade of red and is also labeled “permanent.”"

      "content": "Assess your hair's condition. Be honest with yourself about whether your hair is in the proper condition to be dyed. Bleach and hair dye will cause damage to your hair, so it's risky to dye hair that is already damaged and/or has been dyed a lot. If your hair has been previously dyed black, you will not be able to lighten it with more color. [1] X Expert Source Karen Leight Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 13 November 2020. Only the roots where the color has grown out will lift. This means that you’ll have to use bleach to lift the color before dyeing it red, which will be hard on unhealthy hair.

Try going with a shade of red that best compliments your complexion, whether you have cool-toned fair skin, warm-toned dark skin, or something in between. Hold a sample hair swatch close to your face to see if the color works with your skin tone. [3] X Research source If you have pink, red, or bluish undertones, then you have a cool skin tone. If you have peachy, golden, or yellow undertones, then you have a warm skin tone. If you have a combination of the two, your skin tone is likely neutral. [4] X Research source Consider going with a true red, dark auburn, or burgundy if you have warm undertones.

Mix bleach and 10 or 20 volume developer in a bowl with an applicator brush until it's a yogurt-like consistency. Put on some plastic gloves and a cape to prevent your skin from burning or your clothes from being ruined. Part your hair with the pointed end of the applicator brush and paint the bleach onto your hair from root to tip. Continue making new parts and coating your hair until it’s completely covered in bleach. Let the bleach process until your hair color is the level of lightness you desire. Then wash it out with shampoo and moisturize your hair with conditioner. [9] X Research source If you’re wanting your hair to be a light and/or bright shade of red, you may need to wait a few weeks and repeat the bleaching process to bring it up to a true blonde.

Completely saturate the hair all the way down to ends of the strands. Repeat this process for each section of hair. Wear plastic gloves when applying dye. Otherwise, you will stain your hands. Apply the dye everywhere except your roots. You usually have virgin hair at the roots, so if you do the roots first, you could end up with roots that are a brighter color than the rest of your hair. Consider filling a squirt bottle with the dye and applying it that way if you have long and/or thick hair. Remember to paint the tiny hairs near your ears. You might want to use your finger to reach those."
