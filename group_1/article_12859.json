      "content": "Keep track of the frequency of your periods. Even if you have infrequent or irregular periods, it is important to track when you do get your period. If you experience an increase or decrease in bleeding, talk to your doctor right away. Spotting and bleeding can happen during pregnancy, so be on the safe side and take a pregnancy test if you notice a change in your periods. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may also notice other changing symptoms when you are bleeding, such as more or less pain, a shorter or longer period of bleeding, or a change in the color of your blood. All of these could mean you are pregnant.

      "content": "Look for body aches, sharp pain in the breasts, and pressure on the cervix. Body pains, particularly in the pelvic area or breasts, can signal a pregnancy. If you notice unusual pains, especially if they don't seem to go away, this could be a sign that you are pregnant.

Although these symptoms are associated with other conditions besides pregnancy, they can signal an extreme physical change taking place. If your symptoms persist, take a pregnancy test to see if pregnancy could be the cause.

Although pregnancy tests can show false negatives or false positives, they are usually around 99% accurate. [6] X Research source A pregnancy test may show a false positive if you experience a pregnancy loss soon after taking the test, if you take a fertility drug with HCG, or if you are experiencing menopause, an ectopic pregnancy, or problems with your ovaries. A pregnancy test may show a false negative if you take the test too early, read the results before the test is done working, or use diluted urine. For the most accurate results, take the test first thing in the morning a 2-3 days after you think you missed your period. A home pregnancy test is not as accurate after the first trimester. [7] X Research source If you have any doubt about whether you may be pregnant, see your healthcare provider. They can test for pregnancy hormones in your urine and blood. Your doctor can also determine the quantity of any pregnancy hormones that are present, which will help them evaluate the health and progress of the pregnancy."

      "content": "Use an ultrasound to confirm an at-home pregnancy test. Whether your pregnancy came back positive or negative, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor about an ultrasound if you are experiencing pregnancy symptoms. The doctor will use the ultrasound to confirm if you are pregnant or not, and advise you on your next steps. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Depending on how early they suspect you are in the pregnancy, your doctor may not recommend an ultrasound right away. While a pregnancy may be visible on an ultrasound as early as 4 ½ weeks, you could get a false negative if the test is done too early. Your doctor may also order a blood test to confirm whether or not you are pregnant. Conditions such as retroversion of the uterus, a bicornuate uterus, or scar tissue in the uterus can make it difficult to tell for sure if you are pregnant using an ultrasound."

Make note of any changes in your symptoms, such as sudden cravings or food aversions, or an increase in fatigue. If you have PCOS and recently lost weight and reduced your insulin levels, pregnancy is more likely. Also see a doctor if you have other conditions that affect your periods and reproductive health, like endometriosis, and you experience pregnancy symptoms."

If you have recently given birth and your periods haven't returned to their normal frequency or heaviness, you might not see a missing period as a sign of pregnancy.
