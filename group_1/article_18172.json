      "content": "This trope follows characters who become a \"chosen family.” It explores the relationships between people who are not related by blood, but love and support each other as if they were. Usually, the characters have been separated from (or abandoned by) their biological families, so they create their own makeshift family units with close friends. [1] X Research source These “chosen families” bring unconditional love and acceptance to characters who don't receive these things from blood relatives."

      "title": "Lack of support from biological families",
      "content": "Lack of support from biological families In most media with this trope, the group of characters gravitate toward each other because they don’t receive the love and support they crave from their actual biological families. These blood relatives might be neglectful in some cases, or even cruel and harmful in others. For example, in the Harry Potter series, Harry values his found family at Hogwarts so much because his parents passed away, his biological aunt and uncle were neglectful and completely unsatisfactory as parent figures, and his unkind cousin Dudley was not an affectionate sibling figure. In some cases, characters might not have support from their biological family simply because they’ve passed away, like in Lilo & Stitch . After their parents pass away, sisters Nani and Lilo end up finding a chosen family in aliens Pleakley, Jumba, and Stitch, as well as social worker Mr. Bubbles, and Nani’s boyfriend David."

      "title": "Shared experiences & mutual trust",
      "content": "Shared experiences & mutual trust The relationships between found families are often based on an intense shared experience. A sense of camaraderie and understanding develops out of this experience, leading the characters to bond in a profound way. For example, in The Hunger Games , Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch become each other’s found family because they go through the harrowing experience of the games together, and they deeply understand each other because they've all had the uncommon experience of being a \"tribute.\" This is also the case in Grey’s Anatomy. In the show, a group of doctors bond while going through the surgical residency program at Seattle Grace Hospital. Their shared experience of this elite and extremely challenging program forms the basis for their deep familial relationships with each other."

      "title": "Unconditional acceptance & affirmation",
      "content": "Unconditional acceptance & affirmation Found families in media also tend to be made up of characters who are social outcasts to some degree. When these characters are shunned by their families or by society, they find comfort, acceptance, and unwavering affirmation from the friends who become their chosen family. For example, this is the case in the show Pose . The cast of gay and trans characters face discrimination from both society and their families, but they find a sense of love, belonging, and celebration in their relationships with each other. This is also the case in the movie musical Rent , which follows a group of characters facing a range of obstacles, including discrimination, addiction, health battles with HIV/AIDS, and poverty. In the midst of these experiences, they build deep friendships with each other based on understanding and acceptance."

      "content": "The found family trope is a heartwarming and comforting plot device. Many people have experienced some form of rejection or struggle with their biological families, and the idea that it’s possible to find a “chosen family” full of love and acceptance is a particularly inspiring one for these people. It’s also heartwarming to watch a cast of misfits or outcasts find a sense of belonging with people who truly understand them. The found family trope also resonates in a particularly deep way for members of the LGBTQ community, who can sometimes be rejected or shunned by their biological families when they come out. For these people, the found family trope can be an inspiring reminder that love comes in all kinds of forms, that there's more to family than blood, and that there are people out there who will accept them unconditionally.
