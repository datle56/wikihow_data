Place a large sheet pan on the bottom rack as a safety precaution to catch any smaller pieces that slip through the wire. [2] X Research source Most ovens have a built-in thermometer. You can add a second thermometer to the center rack if you want accurate readings to prevent over-drying. Just make sure it's an oven-safe cooking thermometer. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the temperature and preheat the oven. Set your oven to be as close to 218 °F (103 °C) as possible. [4] X Research source If you have an analog oven, try to heat your oven between 200 °F (93 °C) and 225 °F (107 °C). Wood ignites at 500 °F (260 °C), so avoid using higher temperatures. Turn the convection fan on if you have one."

      "content": "Measure your wood's moisture level before adding it to the oven. The best way to check the humidity in a piece of wood is to use an electronic moisture meter. Write the moisture level down to get a better idea of how long you need to dry it for. [5] X Research source To use an electric moisture meter, turn it on and press the two metal pins into the wood with a little pressure. You don't need to insert the pins in to the wood or apply any extreme force. [6] X Research source You want to achieve a moisture level between 15-20% for firewood. [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you don't have an electronic moisture meter, you can simply weigh the wood before you start and note how much the weight changes as it dries. The drier the wood is, the less it will weigh. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread your wood pieces out on the center rack. You don't want any of your wood pieces to touch, so spread them out across your center rack. Place smaller pieces of wood perpendicular to the rungs of your oven rack to keep them from slipping through to the sheet pan at the bottom. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Double-check the temperature and placement of the wood. You want to recheck everything before closing the oven. Look at the temperature again to ensure that isn't higher than 225 °F (107 °C). Inspect the placement of each piece of wood to make sure that they aren't touching one another. [10] X Research source Wood is more likely to warp or crack if your temperature is too high. Your wood may not dry correctly if any of your wood pieces are touching one another."

      "content": "Bake your wood for one hour. Set a timer for one hour and shut the oven door. Remember not to leave the oven unsupervised while the wood dries and keep a fire extinguisher nearby in the event of a fire. [11] X Research source While you don't have to stand right next to the oven while you wait, it's best to not wander off too far. Wood always has a chance of igniting when it is heated."

If you don't have one, take a piece out of the oven and wait for it to cool on a wire rack before weighing it. To take a piece out, use a large pair of tongs or thick oven mitts and carefully move the wood from the oven to the wire rack. [12] X Research source Use your moisture meter the same way you did before drying your wood. Press the metal pins into the wood by applying a light amount of pressure. [13] X Research source Continue to heat it in fifteen minute increments if your wood requires additional drying. [14] X Research source"

[15] X Research source If a crack is small enough, you can fill it with wood glue or epoxy to try to repair it. [16] X Research source If you're trying to dry firewood, it's not necessary to worry about cracks or defects. You can unwarp wood by wrapping it in a damp cloth and ironing it. It may take multiple attempts before the wood is straightened."

Let the sealant or solution air dry. [17] X Research source"
