      "content": "You need at least 16 ender pearls (20 is safer). Try wearing a pumpkin while doing this or hiding in a structure that has a roof 2 blocks tall. Look at their feet while attacking instead of their eyes. Don't try to shoot them with a bow and arrow; they'll just teleport away."

      "title": "You need their blaze rods so you can turn them into blaze powder.",
      "content": "You need their blaze rods so you can turn them into blaze powder. Then, you combine those with ender pearls. This will give you eyes of ender to find the end portal."

      "title": "You need diamond armor and a diamond sword, since the End is full of danger.",
      "content": "You need diamond armor and a diamond sword , since the End is full of danger. Bring cooked meat, a bow , potions of healing and regeneration, obsidian, a pumpkin, torches, a diamond pickaxe, eyes of ender, and a bed. You will need to go to the Nether and collect blaze rods to prepare potions which give you a better chance of survival."

      "title": "Follow them until they fall to the ground.",
      "content": "Follow them until they fall to the ground. They have a 1 in 5 chance of breaking when they fall, so come prepared with extra. Once the pearls start flying really low to the ground, you are standing on top of a stronghold."

      "title": "This allows you to stay in the same area while still digging downwards safely.",
      "content": "This allows you to stay in the same area while still digging downwards safely. Once you see stone bricks, you are in the right spot. Beware that some blocks are monster spawners which means that they will spawn a silverfish when broken."

      "title": "The end room is filled with silverfish and a spawner churning them out.",
      "content": "The end room is filled with silverfish and a spawner churning them out. Try to kill them in one hit, or else they can spawn more from the walls. You can also pillar up two blocks and hit them from there. Take a bucket of lava to kill the silverfish. A flint and steel will also work."
    },
    {
      "title": "You will need 12 to fill all of them.",
      "content": "You will need 12 to fill all of them. Be careful not to fall into the lava. Right-click with the eyes in your hand to place them into the slots. Once you're done, a black portal with stars will appear where the lava was."

      "title": "This resets your spawn point.",
      "content": "This resets your spawn point. That way, if you die you won't have to walk all the way back. Make sure to take all your armor, food, weapons, and tools. You will most likely spawn on a small platform or cave and will need to build a bridge to the mainland or dig yourself out. You can also scout out the situation beforehand and only take minimal armor and tools to get knowledge of the situation you'll be in. Kill yourself after and return to the end portal. Once you get in the End, you can only get out by killing the Ender dragon or dying."

      "content": "Destroy the tower crystals by shooting at them or whacking at them with a sword. You'll need to be a good aim or have strong armor to protect yourself from the crystal explosions. Attack the Ender dragon mostly with your bow, but whack it with your sword when it gets close. Headshots deal the most damage."
