      "title": "Be willing.",
      "content": "Be willing. If you’re unsure if you really want to be hoisted into the air, don’t try to crowd surf. You have to feel comfortable with what you’re doing and where you’re going, and if you aren’t or don’t, you won’t enjoy the experience. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Secure your stuff.",
      "content": "Secure your stuff. The last thing you want is to lose your wallet or cell phone while you’re crowdsurfing. Ask a friend you trust to hold your stuff for you while you surf. You can also keep it in a small, airtight bag that you can hold while you’re in the air. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask a friend for a boost.",
      "content": "Ask a friend for a boost. It’s best to sit on their shoulders (or the shoulders of two people). When other fans see you in the air, they’ll know what you’re trying to do, and you’ll be able to tell if they’re ready for you. [3] X Research source Don’t just have a friend cup your foot and throw you into the crowd – other fans might not catch you and you can get seriously injured – or seriously injure someone else."

    {
      "title": "Avoid stage diving.",
      "content": "Avoid stage diving. Stage diving is very dangerous – you have to make eye contact with people in the crowd, read their body language to ensure they’ll catch you, and get off the stage before you interrupt the band. It’s also against some venues’ rules to stage dive, and you can get kicked out of the concert for trying it. It's best to just avoid doing it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Time your ride.",
      "content": "Time your ride. Fast-paced, high energy songs are your best bet, because the crowd’s energy will be high and they’ll be more likely to pass you along. Slower sets aren’t great. Choose your favorite song, and be ready to go!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay back.",
      "content": "Lay back. Once it’s clear other people will hold you while you surf, lean back until you feel people’s hands underneath you. You’ll need to be flat on your back to surf."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread your body out.",
      "content": "Spread your body out. As you lay back, spread your arms and legs out like you're getting ready to make a snow angel. This gives the people under you more surface area to hold while they pass you along. Keep your back as stiff and flat as possible. A flat and stiff back makes it easier for people to move you and will also protect you from getting hurt. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your body still.",
      "content": "Keep your body still. If you thrash around too much, chances are you’ll get dropped. You can throw up an old-fashioned “rock and roll” sign, but don’t wave your arms or kick your legs too much. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your feet up with your toes pointed at the ceiling.",
      "content": "Keep your feet up with your toes pointed at the ceiling. Otherwise, you’ll kick people in the head. Don’t lift your legs too far, since this will prevent other fans from passing you along, but make sure your feet are pointed up and raised slightly. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Protect your head if you fall.",
      "content": "Protect your head if you fall. Sometimes it happens – you’re crowdsurfing and you get dropped. If you feel yourself start to fall, lift your head up or cover it with your arms to avoid smacking it on the ground. If you think you’re seriously hurt, ask security for help."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring your knees in toward your chest to dismount.",
      "content": "Bring your knees in toward your chest to dismount. If you’re ready for your ride to end, bring your legs in toward your chest. You should naturally fall to the ground, feet first. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don't grab anyone else as you come down.",
      "content": "Don't grab anyone else as you come down. You could pull them down with you and they and you can get hurt. Instead, make sure you’re prepared for the fall so you can catch yourself. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose a place and time to rejoin your friends.",
      "content": "Choose a place and time to rejoin your friends. You’ll go all over the venue surfing, and you don’t want to lose the group you came with. Pick a spot you can meet and a time, even if the time is as soon as you’re done surfing. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid wearing anything that can snag.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing anything that can snag. This includes zippers, chains, or loose jewelry. They can snag in someone’s hair or on someone else’s jewelry and seriously hurt the other person."

      "content": "Wear soft shoes. You don’t want to wear heels or big, heavy boots that can hit someone in the head and seriously injure them. Make sure the shoes fit correctly and aren’t loose – otherwise you might lose your shoes and have to spend the rest of the day barefoot! [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid loose clothing with easy access to your body.",
      "content": "Avoid loose clothing with easy access to your body. Tops that can easily come off, like bathing suit tops, or loose skirts or shorts, give people in the crowd easy access to your body, and you can’t guarantee everyone in the crowd is a good person. Instead, wear clothing that fits close to your body and doesn’t give people easy access. [11] X Research source"
