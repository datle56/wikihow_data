      "content": "Keep your flow going. Don't stop moving while the music plays. Whether you're between moves or completely freestyle, disco is a fast-paced dance with a lot of movement. While getting into the groove or planning more complicated steps, do some cycles of the following components simultaneously: Take a few steps to your right, left, back, and forward to the beat. In general, three steps work best with freestyle solo disco. Keep your posture upright and confident. Try to picture yourself \"strutting\" to the beat with your steps. Wiggle your hips from side to side, also to the beat. Get your shoulders into it. You can shimmy, where you shake your shoulders, alternating each forward and back. Alternating left and right shoulder rolls also works well with disco. Whatever you do, just keep it consistent for a few cycles. Your hands should be kept at about shoulder height and incorporated into your dance. You can choose to move them from side opposite to your shoulders. If you're shimmying, keep them relatively still with your elbows pointed down. The exact movements aren't important as long as they're timed properly and repeat. Make sure your whole body is moving. If you dance with just your legs or just your upper body, your dance won't fit the high energy required for disco."

      "content": "Count the beats. The majority of choreographed disco dances work with 3-step and 4-step cycles that go along with the beat. [2] X Research source The \"beat\" is a measure of time intervals of music. Try tapping your toes or clapping your hands to the music. Each tap or clap is one beat. Keep your steps in time with the beat."

      "title": "Do the Bump.",
      "content": "Do the Bump. The Bump is probably the easiest disco \"move\" you can do and is best done with a partner. Simply sway from side to side with the beat. Move your hips from left to right, switching positions with each beat. Time your movements with your partner so that the two of you gently \"bump\" your hips every other beat. Keep your hands in the air and move them in the opposite direction of your hips. Unlike other disco moves, it's best to keep your feet grounded. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make up your own moves.",
      "content": "Make up your own moves. While early disco relied on choreographed dances plucked from earlier styles, popular mainstream disco became much more freeform. [5] X Research source Choose your own twists, turns, dips, and tricks to personalize your dance. Just be sure to create a consistent step pattern for each dance and keep in time with the music. Modern freestyle disco dancing can incorporate flips and other acrobatic tricks, especially in professional competitions. If you have the skills to pull these off safely, try punctuating every few step cycles with a trick."

      "content": "Synchronize with a big group . As a line dance, the Bus Stop is best done with a group of people organized together into rows and columns. Time your steps so that the entire group does the dance simultaneously. Start with everyone facing the same direction. If you're dancing by yourself, it's perfectly fine to do the Bus Stop solo. Partners are not needed for the dance itself. [6] X Research source The Bus Stop is sometimes called the Hustle. Keep in mind that there are many very different types of disco dances referred to as the Hustle . While the first disco dances with the name were partnered, versions for single dancers dominated later on. Some Hustles, like the Bus Stop are line dances meant to be done by big groups of solo dancers. Each of these three main groups has several regional and cultural variants. There is no definitive version that can be called the Hustle. The Bus Stop or Hustle described here is a 3-step line dance popularized by a dance featured in the movie Saturday Night Fever .
