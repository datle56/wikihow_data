      "content": "Lilith was made at the same time as Adam, and Eve was made after. In some Judeo-Christian literature and theology, Eve was made to be Adam’s wife by splitting him in two, and Lilith was the original first woman, made from the same dust as Adam. There are technically two creation stories in the Bible, Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. In Genesis 2, the female part of humanity is named Eve. However, Gen 1 has no names, humanity is just split into “male and female.” [1] X Research source Some people have theorized that Lilith is the first unnamed woman, although there isn’t solid evidence for this. [2] X Research source Most Biblical scholars agree that Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 are independent re-tellings of the same story from different perspectives, so there isn’t any compelling reason to assume the woman in Genesis 2 is a different woman from the unnamed woman in Genesis 1."

      "content": "Lilith is the mother of demons, while Eve is the mother of humanity. Both Eve and Lilith are heavily associated with their children, Eve’s being Cain and Abel and Lilith’s being incubi and succubi , sexual demons. Eve's image, however, has been used in art and literature to represent motherhood, especially in Europe, while Lilith’s has been used to represent demons. [3] X Research source In Lilith’s myth, she leaves the Garden of Eden after refusing to sexually submit to Adam, so some see her as a symbol of female empowerment. However, these myths aren’t in the Bible. In different myths Lilith’s children have different fathers. Sometimes they come from sperm she stole from Adam, sometimes they’re fathered by the angel of death, Samael . [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Lilith and Eve are seen as dominant and submissive counterparts. Eve is one of the most central figures in the Old Testament, but she’s depicted in a somewhat unpleasant way from a contemporary feminist perspective. She’s dutiful, submissive, and responsible for the fall of man. Lilith represents a more respectable counterpart in some ways. She’s supposedly a “darker” figure who has more agency. [5] X Research source As a consequence, Lilith’s popularity as a figure makes a lot of sense. She’s the more “active” vision of the original Biblical woman."

      "title": "Not explicitly, no—the word “lilith\" is not a name in the Bible.",
      "content": "Not explicitly, no—the word “lilith\" is not a name in the Bible. The word “Lilith” only appears in the Bible once, in Isaiah 34:14, where she’s described alongside other creatures dwelling in a wasteland. [6] X Research source But there’s no woman in that verse! This is likely a translation misunderstanding. The Hebrew word “lilith” (לִּילִית) is not a name—it means “night creature” or “night owl.” In some translations, it means “demon.” The point is, a woman explicitly named “Lilith” does not appear in the Bible. The use of Lilith as a name for a woman is actually a relatively new invention. There are a handful of notable women named Lilith going back to the 1890s, but the name wasn’t really used until the 2010s. [7] X Research source If we assume (as we should) that “Lilith” in Isaiah 34:14 is referring to a night creature, the verse makes a lot more sense. “And there shall the beasts of the desert meet with the jackals, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; the lilith also shall settle there, and find for herself a place of rest.” It’s basically just saying a lot of wild animals are present."

      "content": "Some believe that Lilith was Adam's first partner. Lilith is most commonly known as the first wife of Adam, but her story actually starts before Judaism was an established religion. In midrashic texts, Lilith is inserted as the first woman, made from the same clay as Adam, to explain why there are two creation myths, Genesis 1 and 2. [8] X Research source Midrashic texts were written by rabbis to help explain passages in the Torah and Hebrew Bible. The most famous of these texts may be The Alphabet of Ben Sirah .

      "content": "Lilith was originally a Sumerian demon. Although she shows up in early Jewish texts, Lilith originally was a Sumerian succubus, a kind of sexual demon. [10] X Research source Her name may come from a feminine Mesopotamian word for demon, lilītu . In ancient Babylonian religions ilītu were demons made from the souls of women who had died young. Images of lilītu are most often associated with Aramaic “incantation bowls,” illustrated earthenware bowls used for exorcising demons. [11] X Research source In the Bible she is referred to as “screech owl” or “night bird” instead of by name. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Lilith represents female sexual empowerment to some. In the midrashic explanation of the creation myth, Lilith and Adam almost have sex, but Lilith wants to take the dominant role, which Adam refuses. Lilith leaves Eden instead of submitting to Adam and goes to the Red Sea to give birth to demon children. [13] X Research source God, at Adam’s request, sends three angels to get Lilith back. The angels tell her that they will kill 100 of her children a day until she returns, but she still refuses. This is also seen as a sign of sexual freedom since she gives up her children and place in Paradise in order to be free. [14] X Research source"

She “takes” sperm from Adam, then creates lilium , or earth demons, to replace her killed children. Wearing amulets with the names of the angels that tried to get her back is one way of protecting yourself from her. [15] X Research source Baby boys are targeted by Lilith until they’re circumcised (8 days after birth), and baby girls are in danger for the first 20 days after birth. Lilith is associated with stillbirths and crib deaths. [16] X Research source It is said that Lilith takes sperm to make lilium from sleeping single men and people who masturbate.

      "title": "Eve is considered the first woman in Christianity.",
      "content": "Eve is considered the first woman in Christianity. In the Christian creation myth, humanity begins with “Adam and Eve,” the first man and woman. The Hebrew word adam refers to humanity, so more updated translations see Adam and Eve as two parts of one thing, made at the same time by God. [18] X Research source By this logic, Eve is the first named person in the Bible since “Adam” more correctly translates to “humanity” and isn’t usually used as a proper name. [19] X Research source It could be that the biblical “Adam” is humanity in general, and Eve is the first distinct human. While many translations say Eve was formed by Adam’s rib, the word translated as “rib” may be more correct as “side,” so adam (humanity) was split into two sides. [20] X Research source"

To stay in the Garden, all they have to do is not eat the Fruit of Knowledge. [21] X Research source A serpent brings Eve to the Tree of Life, and she brings the fruit to Adam, who eats it with her. Eating the fruit gives Adam and Eve the knowledge of Good and Bad, which breaks them from their innocence and causes God to cast them out of the Garden."

Eve is considered by some to be a biological mother to humanity, but more broadly, by taking the fruit of knowledge Eve broke out of her unconscious innocence and became an enlightened, conscious being, close to God in that way, but now necessarily imperfect. This enlightenment is the creation of humanity. [22] X Research source"

[23] X Research source However, Timothy 1:2 references Eve sinning. [24] X Research source This is the only mention of Eve and sin together in the Bible. The book of Timothy, supposedly letters from the Apostle Paul, may be a forgery. There are many Epistles (sets of letters) written by “Paul” that are likely forgeries, most notably Second Thessalonians 2:2, where the author warns the reader of other forged letters—a common tactic of forgers at that time.

However, Eve is only actually mentioned twice in the Bible, and histories of biased translations have obscured the original Eve in the text. For example, translations of Genesis 3:16 often have God saying “I will increase your pain in pregnancies,” but the word translated as “pain” for Eve, itzavon , is translated as “toil” for Adam, which is closer to its original meaning. [26] X Research source The passage was written by people in a hot, dry farming-based society, so it’s more likely that the passage means humanity has to toil to survive, and they will have to have more children to help them work.
