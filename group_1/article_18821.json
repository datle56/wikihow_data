Continue high intensity and low intensity intervals for about twenty minutes. Interval training is regarded as one of the most effective exercise regimens. It is less time consuming but appears to produce identical effects. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Do a sprint-walk routine. The most basic interval training routine is to run as fast as you can for 2-3 blocks (or roughly 400 meters) and then walk back to the starting point, beginning the process over again. Alternatively, warm up by walking slowly for five minutes and quickly for ten minutes. You can then sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks, sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks (and so on, lasting 15 minutes). When that time has passed, walk back quickly to your origin point to cool down."
