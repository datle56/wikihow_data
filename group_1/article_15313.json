      "content": "Split your daily protein intake over five meals. According to personal trainer Monica Morris, you should aim to split your daily protein intake over five meals—protein-rich meals include “20 to 25 grams on average,” so in order to get to over 100 grams of protein in a day, “it has to be over the course of five or six meals.” Divide how much protein you’d like to eat a day by the number of meals you’ll have, including snacks. For example, if you’d like to consume 150 g of protein per day and you prefer eating 3 meals a day, aim for about 50 g of protein per meal, or 37.5 g if you’re planning on snacking in between. If you’d like to consume 150 g of protein a day and you prefer eating 6 meals a day, aim for about 25 g of protein per meal."
