      "title": "Check if your thermometer actually contains mercury.",
      "content": "Check if your thermometer actually contains mercury. Newer models of thermometers contain alcohol or another liquid substance that simulates mercury. Look for the words “mercury-free” printed on the thermometer to determine if it’s toxic. If it has “mercury-free” printed on it, then you can throw the thermometer away along with your regular trash. [1] X Research source Don’t mix mercury thermometers in with your regular garbage. Mercury has toxic properties, so it’s not safe to throw away in your regular trash and may be illegal in your area to dispose of it improperly."

      "title": "Check online to find safe disposal sites near you.",
      "content": "Check online to find safe disposal sites near you. Many times, drop-off sites are listed online so you know what locations collect thermometers. First, check your city’s waste disposal site to see if they list any specific locations you need to drop off your thermometer. Then, you can check if plumbing or hardware stores have safe disposal sites you can use either for free or with a small fee.

      "content": "Seal the thermometers in a plastic container with a lid. Choose a container with a tight-fitting lid and place the thermometers inside. Don’t choose too large of a container or else the thermometers are more likely to roll around and break when you transport them. Put the lid on the container and label it “DANGER - Mercury” so people know not to touch it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Drop off the thermometer at your local hazardous waste facility.",
      "content": "Drop off the thermometer at your local hazardous waste facility. Look up the hours for your local hazardous waste facility so you know what times they’re open for drop-offs. Put the thermometers in your vehicle and take them to the drop-off location. If there is a disposal fee, pay it in full before you give them your thermometer. [4] X Research source Some cities may have hazardous collection days rather than an available drop-off. If your city doesn’t allow you to drop off the thermometer, then contact your waste management facility and let them know you have hazardous waste containing mercury so they can collect it. Keep any thermometers containing mercury in the trunk of your car so you don’t inhale the vapors if they break."

      "content": "Put on rubber cleaning gloves and a facemask. Have everyone else leave the room while you’re cleaning so they are protected from the spill. Put on thin rubber gloves to protect yourself from contact dermatitis and irritation if you touch the mercury. Since mercury produces vapors, wear a facemask that covers your mouth and nose you can’t inhale them.

      "title": "Pick up any pieces of glass and set them on a paper towel.",
      "content": "Pick up any pieces of glass and set them on a paper towel. Set a dry paper towel close to the spill so you can easily reach it. Carefully pick up the broken glass pieces of the thermometer and put them on the paper towel. Collect the largest shards of the thermometer first before picking up smaller ones. [6] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Be careful not to cut your gloves on the glass or else you may be exposed to the mercury. Do not vacuum the spill since your machine could spread the mercury into the air."

      "content": "Gather the mercury into small balls using a piece of cardboard. Hold the cardboard at a 45-degree angle to your floor and slowly sweep the mercury together. As you sweep the droplets, they’ll combine to form larger balls that you can easily clean. Look at your floor from a low angle with a flashlight to find any other droplets you missed. Pay special attention to cracks or seams in your floor since mercury may get caught there. [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Don’t use a broom since you could break apart the mercury and spread it around your room more."

      "content": "Collect the mercury with an eyedropper and squeeze it onto damp paper towels. Squeeze the bulb on the end of the eyedropper before setting the tip in the mercury. Let go of the bulb so the mercury gets pulled inside the eye dropper. Slowly squeeze the mercury onto a damp piece of paper towel so it’s off your floor. [8] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Don’t use an eyedropper that you plan on using for any other medicinal purposes since the mercury will contaminate it."

      "content": "Transfer the paper towel into a zip-locking bag. Open a large resealable bag and set it down near your paper towel. Carefully lift the corners of the paper towel so the mercury gathers in the center and doesn’t spill out the sides. Set the paper towel inside of the bag and close it as soon as you can so the vapors can’t escape. [9] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source You can also put any glass shards from the thermometer in the resealable bag. Double-layer zip-locking bags if you want additional protection from tears or spills."

      "content": "Pick up small fragments and leftover mercury with duct tape. Wrap a piece of duct tape around your hand so the adhesive side faces out. Lightly press on the area where you broke the thermometer and slowly peel the tape back so the beads of mercury stick to the adhesive. After you remove any remaining mercury and glass, put the tape in the zip-locking bag so it doesn’t spill.

      "content": "Seal all the material you used in a trash bag and store it outside. Put the zip-locking bag with the mercury and thermometer pieces inside a large garbage bag for an additional layer of protection. Throw away the gloves you used as well as any other supplies that came into contact with the mercury. Label the bag “Contains Mercury” so you don’t mistake it for regular trash. Store the trash bag in a secure area outside, such as a shelf in your garage, until you can get rid of it . [11] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you spilled mercury on your shoes or clothing, throw them away as well since you could spread the mercury to other areas. Check online for your nearest hazardous waste disposal site to see if they accept mercury products. If they do, take your broken thermometer to the drop-off site."

      "title": "Ventilate the area for 24 hours after the spill.",
      "content": "Ventilate the area for 24 hours after the spill. Keep the windows open and turn on any exhaust fans in the room where you broke the thermometer so the vapors go outside. Keep the area ventilated for at least 24 hours so the vapors have time to escape.
