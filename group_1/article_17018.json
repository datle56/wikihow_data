      "content": "Come out. Coming out with your sexuality will relieve you of a burden. It is a lot harder for you to meet others if no one knows your situation. Coming out conveys your confidence, and for many this is attractive. This can be an incredibly difficult task for some. Seek out a close friend who knows the truth and ask for their support. Some conservative families do not support this, and it can be painful. Consider coming out to a select group before talking to your family, if you're in this scenario. Always consider if it will be more harmful than helpful."

      "title": "Consider others who are out.",
      "content": "Consider others who are out. It is easier to track down someone who has already come out as opposed to searching through a haystack. Even if you don't want a relationship, getting to know this person could help introduce you to others."

Even sites that have high success with straight couples, like OkCupid, have a thriving community for guys looking for guys. Some sites are notorious for hook ups (like Grindr and Tinder) and not as known for lasting relationships. If you consider a site like this, be honest in your profile."

      "title": "Pick a dating spot.",
      "content": "Pick a dating spot. Once you match with someone and agree to meet, you should offer where to meet. It's a good idea to go on a walking date for a first date. Walking through a park is good. It isn't causing you to feel claustrophobic or exposed in way a coffee shop might. Don't let someone waste your time—once you've been chatting for about a week, ask them if they'd like to meet up. If they give you a vague answer, they might not be ready for a relationship.

      "title": "Don't go too fast!",
      "content": "Don't go too fast! This cannot be stressed enough. Even if he is putting out signs that he may like you, hold off a bit. That just may be his natural tendency. You want to be able to feel out the situation before becoming committed. If you think he likes you, your gut is probably right. You can tell by the way he looks at you. Eye contact is the best indicator for attraction. Other things you could look for is if the guy gives you a lot of attention in real life, flirts on social media by posting a lot onto your Facebook, or simply calls or texts you out of the blue."

      "title": "Give him space.",
      "content": "Give him space. Try not to hang around him all the time. Sometimes it can be hard to read someone you like. You don't want him to think that you are dependent on him or that you are desperate. Play it casual at first and only shower him with attention when on a date. After a while, you'll get really comfortable around him. Whatever you do, don't make him your \"best-friend-in-the-world!\" You're not looking for that kind of relationship. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Have a relationship conversation. If you are confident that he likes you, go to a neutral place where you can talk like a coffee shop. Be honest to him about your feelings. Tell him what you want out of the future. Try saying something like: ”I know we’ve been hanging out for awhile now, and I wanted to tell you that I like you.” ”After getting to know you the last couple of weeks, I’ve begun developing feelings for you” ”Stevie, I like you and was wondering if you’d like to take our relationship further.”"

      "title": "Keep your calm.",
      "content": "Keep your calm. When asking him out, don't get too nervous. If you do, try to hide it. It is natural to get nervous, and it shouldn't matter if you are. He is probably as nervous as you are."

      "content": "Respond to his decision. It can go in two ways, but regardless you should be proud of yourself. Making it this far is not easy for everyone to do. If he says yes, celebrate! You guys are now free to be in a loving relationship that you will cherish. If he says no, don't sulk. Try to initiate a conversation about how you want to be friends.
