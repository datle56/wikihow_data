      "title": "Melt 1 Tbsp (15 ml) butter in a large skillet.",
      "content": "Melt 1 Tbsp (15 ml) butter in a large skillet. Heat the butter over medium-high heat, long enough for it to melt.For a stronger flavor, consider using tallow, which is a rendered form of beef fat, or lard, which is a rendered form of pig fat. Vegetable oils can also be used."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brown the steaks in the butter.",
      "content": "Brown the steaks in the butter. Add the steaks to the hot, melted butter and cook for roughly 3 minutes per side or until both sides are brown. Once brown, remove the steaks from the skillet and put them on a plate with a shallow rim. This rim is necessary since it prevents any juices from running off the side of the plate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Melt the remaining butter in your skillet.",
      "content": "Melt the remaining butter in your skillet. Add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to the skillet and heat over medium-high until the butter melts. As before, consider using tallow or lard instead of butter to enhance the flavor. For a healthier alternative, replace the butter with a vegetable oil."

    {
      "title": "Cook the onion and garlic in the butter.",
      "content": "Cook the onion and garlic in the butter. Add the onion to the skillet and sauté it in the hot butter, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 1 minute, again stirring frequently. [1] X Research source The onions should be tender and fragrant when done. The garlic should be toasted and fragrant when ready. Garlic cooks faster than onion, so the two should not be added simultaneously. Moreover, garlic burns easily, so you will need to keep a close eye on it to prevent that from happening."

    {
      "title": "Stir in the sauce ingredients.",
      "content": "Stir in the sauce ingredients. Add the tomato sauce, maple syrup, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes (if desired) to the skillet. Stir well, then add the beef broth, and stir again. It is a good idea to combine the sauce ingredients before returning the steak pieces to the skillet. If the steak remained in the skillet, they would create an obstruction, and you would have a harder time blending the sauce ingredients together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Return the steaks to the skillet.",
      "content": "Return the steaks to the skillet. Bring the mixture to a boil before dropping the heat to low or medium-low, letting the mixture reach a steady simmer. Make sure that you also return to the skillet any juices from the steak that seeped out onto the plate. These juices are valuable, both in terms of moisture and flavor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook until tender.",
      "content": "Cook until tender. Cover the skillet and cook for 60 to 90 minutes. During the last 20 minutes, uncover the skillet. Stir the contents of the skillet occasionally as the steaks cook. Uncovering the skillet during the final part of the cooking process will allow the sauce to reduce and become thicker. Slow braising is an ideal cooking method for round steaks, which tend to be fairly lean and not very tender. The slow cooking process helps the meat break down more, and the liquid involved in braising prevents the beef from drying out."

[2] X Research source If you have a large, heavy-bottomed, oven-proof skillet, you do not need to prepare a separate baking dish. The entire meal can be prepared in this oven-proof skillet."

      "content": "Flatten the beef. Sandwich the cut steak in between two layers of wax paper or parchment paper. Use a meat tenderizer to pound the steak until it reaches a thickness of about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm). Tenderizing and flattening the beef helps the final product to have a less chewy, less tough texture."

      "content": "Combine the flour and salt. Mix the flour and salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Place the ingredients in the bag, zip closed, and shake quickly to distribute the salt evenly throughout the flour. Alternatively, you could combine the flour and salt in a wide bowl with shallow sides. Make sure that the bowl is shallow enough and wide enough for you to place a piece of steak in. Sift the ingredients together to ensure that they are well-combined."

      "title": "Dredge the steak in the flour mixture.",
      "content": "Dredge the steak in the flour mixture. Add the steak to the flour and salt in the plastic bag and seal the bag closed. Give it a good shake so that all sides of the beef are coated in flour. If using a bowl instead of a bag, add the steak pieces to the seasoned flour in the bowl and turn them over a few times, dredging all the sides completely."

      "content": "Add tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce. Pour the ingredients in the pan and bring to a boil. After the contents reach a boil, drop the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 5 minutes. After this addition, you should stir the contents of the pan to loosen any browned bits and pieces stuck to the bottom. These bits are valuable because they contain a lot of flavor. As the mixture simmers, keep the skillet uncovered."

You could add more cheese than the recipe calls for, if desired, but adding more cheese may increase the amount of cooking time since a thicker layer will require more time to melt."

[4] X Research source You may also want to prepare your slow cooker by coating the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray or by inserting a special slow cooker liner. This is not strictly necessary, but without taking either precaution, the steak pieces may end up burning and sticking to the slow cooker, making cleanup a mess."

      "content": "Brown the steak in the hot, melted butter. Add the steak to the hot butter and cook for about 3 minutes on both sides, or until both sides of the steak turn brown on both sides. You could skip the skillet steps from a technical standpoint, but they are strongly recommended. Browning the steak before cooking it in a slow cooker enhances the flavor. Once brown, remove the steak from the skillet and place the pieces directly in the slow cooker."

Add any remaining flour, as well. Bring to a slow boil, stirring continuously with a whisk, for about 5 minutes. Cooking the sauce in a skillet beforehand is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea. Adding the liquid ingredients to the pan and stirring the contents allows you to deglaze the bottom and pick up all the brown, flavorful bits previously stuck to the pan. The flour can also cause the sauce to thicken once it boils."

Round steaks tend to be fairly lean and not very tender, and the ultra slow cooking provided by a slow cooker helps the meat break down more, making it very tender when done. The liquid it cooks in prevents the beef from drying out, as well."
