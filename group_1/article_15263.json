      "content": "Dystopian fashion has a unique look. Depending on the lore of the dystopian universe, the fashion might be more retro (like in Fallout) or more futuristic (like in Dune). However, there are a few key themes when looking at dystopian fashion: Utilitarian and/or militaristic: Since dystopias tend to be dangerous, your clothes need to protect you from the elements or other people. Loose-fitting: Many dystopian outfits are loose to allow for ease of movement, and to keep you cool in a wasteland-type setting. Capes and cowls: Capes and cowls are a common element in many dystopian outfits. Leather: Leather is a popular fabric choice. Asymmetrical hems and lines: Many dystopian fashion outfits are asymmetrical, most likely because it looks \"different\" from the fashion norms of today. Goggles: Goggles are featured in a lot of dystopian outfits, both for their utility as eye protection, and because they look pretty cool."

Similar to the ponytail style, having hair in braids will help keep it tidy and out of your face. Hair down. You might opt for a hair down look if you're wearing some kind of hat. Choose a style that is more straight and plain versus one that looks heavily styled. Something wispy. A wispy style makes you look a little windblown, which can help make your dystopian look more convincing."
