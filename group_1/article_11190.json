      "title": "Choose the clipper number.",
      "content": "Choose the clipper number. Typically, the lower the number, the shorter the haircut. Each number clipper corresponds to the length of hair that will be left after you use the electric clippers. For example, zero is a skin level, and number two is a sort of shorter medium length. Look on the instructions to your clippers to determine which clipper extension corresponds to which hair length. [2] X Research source If the boy has thin or fine hair, you probably do not want to use clippers. Toddlers, unless they have thick, dark hair, probably also should not get a haircut with electric clippers. If the boy has thick hair or dark hair, clippers are probably a good choice for him."

      "title": "Decide where you want to clip to.",
      "content": "Decide where you want to clip to. Many traditional boys’ haircuts are cut with clippers on the sides and then scissors on top. However, some haircuts use clippers on the entire head. This will be a more uniform look than clipping around the sides and scissoring on the top. If you plan to use scissors on the top, choose the place where you want to stop clipping. Pick a point where you want the clipper cut to transition into a scissor cut. Right above the occipital bone is a common place. [3] X Research source Be consistent about how high on the head you want to stop clipping. Mark the place where you will stop using the clippers with a washable marker, or just be careful to go to the same height every time. It is also possible to use different clipper settings to create a fade."

      "content": "Start from the bottom of the hairline. Place the clippers at a ninety degree angle from the boy’s head. Clip from the base of the neck straight up. You always cut from the bottom up. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Continue around the whole head.",
      "content": "Continue around the whole head. Make sure that you’re using smooth, even cuts and are not missing any little strips along the way. Start from the bottom of the head and move upwards, still holding the clippers at a 90 degree angle."

      "content": "Take the number attachment off of the clippers. You can now use the attachment-less clippers to “clean up” the area around the boy’s hair. You can use the clippers now on the stray hairs on his neck and around his ears and sideburns. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Think about how much hair you want cut off from the boy’s head.",
      "content": "Think about how much hair you want cut off from the boy’s head. You should start with a small amount. You can always take off more if you still think it’s too long. A good amount to start with, unless the boy has really long hair, is probably about an 1/8th of an inch. When using scissors you should go slowly and not cut off too much too fast. Make sure that the hair is dry when you cut it. Cutting wet hair is more challenging, and cutting with dry hair will ensure that you know exactly what it will look like while you’re cutting it."

      "content": "Choose your guide cut. This cut determines how long you want the rest of the hair to be. Comb the front most part of the boy’s hair back, about enough to hold between two fingers, with the comb and then transfer the hair to between the index and middle fingers of your nondominant hand."

      "title": "Cut the hair straight across, parallel to your fingers.",
      "content": "Cut the hair straight across, parallel to your fingers. Try to make the cut even, but you can always go back later and trim unruly hairs. This should leave the front-most section of the boy’s hair a little bit shorter than the rest."

      "title": "Pull back the section of hair right behind the front.",
      "content": "Pull back the section of hair right behind the front. Include a little bit of the guide cut to show you how much hair to cut. Continue this process, working back towards the back of the head. Always include a little bit of the cut you just did to guide you. [6] X Research source You should be able to make your way all the way to the back of the head with this process. If you are cutting with scissors on the sides, too, use this same method. Start from the front and move backwards, using your guide cut. However, if you would rather make your guide cut in the back, you can also start in the back and gradually move to the front. [7] X Research source Always grab a little bit of the cut you just did in your new cut so that you know how much you should cut off."

      "content": "Comb a small section of the boy’s hair. You should be combing it out to the side, so that the comb is perpendicular to the floor. Incorporating both the section done with the clippers and the section with the scissors, comb the boy’s hair out to the side with your nondominant hand. On the boy’s haircut right now, there should be the clipper cut on the bottom and the scissor cut on the top. There will be a line where the clipper cut ends and the scissor cut begins. The middle of your comb should be at this line."
