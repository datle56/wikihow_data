Hemoglobin also transports oxygen through our bodies, so spiders rely on a similar compound called hemocyanin.

So, how do they move through water if they don’t swim? Due to their buoyant body composition and immense muscle power, hippos are able to walk on the bottom of the water and push themselves off the ground, which resultantly propels them forward.

Well, when an O. unilateralis spore attaches to a healthy ant, it feeds on the ant’s insides and spreads throughout its body.

Scientifically known as Turritopsis dohrnii, this species of jellyfish is smaller than the nail on your pinky finger but it’s one of the most fascinating creatures on the planet. When the immortal jellyfish is physically damaged, starved, or otherwise facing what would normally cause death, it instead shrinks in on itself. It reabsorbs its tentacles, loses the ability to swim, and settles on the seafloor as a tiny blob. [14] X Research source Within the next 24-36 hours, the blob becomes a new polyp (a jellyfish baby, basically). Once the polyp matures, it reproduces asexually through a process called “budding,” where it basically clones itself to create multiple medusae (or adult jellyfish). These medusae then begin to bud off the polyp and swim away to start their life cycles all over again. This entire process is known as transdifferentiation or life cycle reversal. Transdifferentiation is extremely rare, but it is also experienced (in part) by newts and frogs, who use it to regenerate their damaged limbs. [15] X Research source"

Well, a huge part of human communication occurs through our eyebrows, so dogs with expressive eyebrows that allow us to “read” their faces and (assumed) emotions have an evolutionary advantage. [18] X Trustworthy Source National Geographic Website of the National Geographic Society Go to source Over time, it seems that dogs have developed tiny muscles that allow them to move their eyebrows and appear more human-like. These muscles are not significantly present in wolves and ancient dog breeds. However, it’s important to note that scientists don’t believe that this evolution happened due to humans intentionally selecting certain dogs for survival over others. Instead, dogs with moving eyebrows just had a natural advantage when interacting with humans."

However, Mike refused to die. He was up, walking around, kicking, and running without any signs of slowing down. Once word spread, the farmer and his wife (Lloyd and Clara Olsen) took Mike on a tour of different towns and universities so that the bird could both be studied and marveled at as a sideshow attraction. [19] X Research source Mike lived for another 18 months, eventually suffocating after the Olsens misplaced the syringe they typically used to clear mucus from his throat (since his head wasn’t around to do so). So why was Mike able to live so long? Most of a chicken’s brain is concentrated at the back of its skull. So, scientists posit that while Mike’s beak, face, eyes, and ears were removed, the majority of his brain and brainstem remained untouched. What actually puzzles scientists even more is how Mike managed not to bleed out and die that way. For that question, we don’t have an answer (yet!)."

      "content": "Vlad the Impaler was a Romanian ruler during the 15th century. The legendary blood-sucking figure wasn’t just invented by Bram Stoker for his 1897 vampire novel—he actually borrowed the character from the real-life Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia. Better known as Vlad the Impaler, the Transylvanian-born ruler (with the surname Dracul, meaning “dragon”) was known for disposing of his competitors in a very violent manner. [50] X Research source To keep things on the lesser side of grotesque, here’s what we’ll say about how Vlad earned his nickname: he killed about 80,000 of his enemies during his rule, with his preferred method being impaling and displaying these unfortunate individuals on stakes. According to legend, Vlad would also eat among and dip his food in the blood of his victims—but this extra creepy addition to the story has not been confirmed."

      "content": "Ancient fingerprints have also been recovered from Egyptian artifacts. Historians have been able to accomplish both of these feats—but how? Well, mummification involves the drying out of soft tissue in order to preserve the body (including its fingerprints). In order to recover the fingerprint impressions, experts soak or inject the mummified hands with hydrating solutions in order to plump them up. Then, the fingertips are inked and copied in the same manner as modern fingerprints. [51] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source But what about fingerprints on objects, you ask? Some fingerprints can be found on ancient objects and artifacts—for example, a group of English researchers found prints on the internal lid of an Egyptian coffin. Most likely, they were left behind by a craftsman who handled the lid before the varnish had fully dried. [52] X Research source Of course, the fingerprints don’t help us to track ancient peoples or learn more about their identities. However, it certainly helps us to feel a further degree of connection to those who came before us."

In the study, each person wore virtual reality (VR) goggles and looked down at their feet, with the headset being programmed so that each wearer would be staring down at nothing. Then, a researcher would touch the participant with a paintbrush while also touching the same place in the participant’s empty space view. The participants could feel the brush but could also look down and see that nothing was there.

It may also contribute to research on phantom pain or improved prosthetic limbs for amputees. [55] X Research source"

So, they actually tinted the coats of the horses with lemon, cherry, and grape flavored JELL-O, an approach that allowed the horses to show up in Technicolor without harming the animals at all.

      "content": "The 1518 “plague” caused 50–400 people to dance incessantly for weeks. In July of that year, inhabitants of the city were suddenly struck with a seemingly uncontrollable urge to dance. Physicians believed they could \"dance it out,\" and so a stage was constructed and a band was hired. However, many dancers soon collapsed from sheer exhaustion, while others died from strokes and heart attacks. Eventually, the dancers were taken to a mountaintop shrine where they prayed for absolution, seemingly ending the plague. [63] X Research source Historians still don’t know exactly why this dancing plague happened. At the time, physicians blamed it on “hot blood” that could be cured by continuing to dance. Today, however, theories suggest that the dancers were members of a religious cult or that they ingested a toxic mold that grows on damp rye (“ergot”) and is known to cause spasms and hallucinations. Others believe that the dancing was the result of mass hysteria. The pious townspeople may have believed strongly in St. Vitus, a Catholic saint believed to have the power to curse people with a dancing plague. As disease and famine also tore through Strasbourg in 1518, it’s possible that the St. Vitus superstition led to an episode of stress-induced mass hysteria. Similar dance “attacks” actually occurred in Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands, although known were as large or deadly as the Strasbourg event."

It should, since many of the details of Futility by Morgan Robertson match up with history’s most famous maritime disaster. However, the novella was published in 1898—14 years before the construction and sinking of the HMS Titanic . [64] X Research source What other similarities were there between Robertson’s book and the future event? The ships shared similar names: Titan and Titanic . Both ships were also described as the largest and fastest vessels that had ever sailed. Further, both ships were only equipped with the minimum number of lifeboats under safety standards of the time. After all, they were both also described as “unsinkable.” Just like the real-life ship, Robertson’s fictional Titan crashed into an iceberg in a disaster that claimed the lives of nearly all of the 3,000 passengers on board. While much research has been conducted into Robertson’s life, he passed away three years after the Titanic’s sinking. His reaction to the disastrous event remains unknown."
