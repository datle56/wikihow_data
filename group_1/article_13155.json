Wash your hands of any remaining acetone after handling cotton balls. If the cotton balls are saturated in nail polish remover, remember to wring them out into a separate container with a secure lid. Throw out that container as a hazardous waste . [1] X Research source Use trashcans with self-opening and closing lids to avoid exposure to acetone and other hazardous wastes that you throw away.

If you have bottles of nail polish and remover your salon no longer wants, put these in separate containers from the rest of your recycling. Bring those containers to a hazardous waste, treatment, disposal, or recycling facility, or Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (TSDR). [3] X Research source You can find a TSDR facility through the EPA’s RCRAInfo search by searching specific geographic locations, zip codes, or a facility name if you know it. Don’t pour acetone nail polish remover in the drain or toilet. Avoid putting large amounts of acetone in the regular garbage."

Acetone is combustible, so keep it away from hot surfaces and open flames. [4] X Research source If you use acetone to clean coins, you can strain any solids out and reuse it. You can also dispose of it at a hazardous waste facility in the proper containers."

If it’s a bottle of nail polish remover, make sure the cap is screwed on tightly enough so it doesn’t leak out. [6] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source Reduce your exposure to acetone fumes by wearing a special mask with an air filter in it. The mask must be NIOSH approved. One type of mask is the N95 which filters out some acrylic powders, dust, germs, and some chemical odors. However, it doesn’t filter every chemical. [7] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source Another type of mask to wear is a half-mask respirator. This will filter out acetone fumes, as well as all other harmful toxic odors."

If you work in a university laboratory or art department, the guidelines require that you put acetone-covered rags in hazardous waste drums, pails, and red safety cans. Acetone is flammable, so if you have rags soaked with acetone paint thinner, place them in a tightly sealed container with water. Hammer the edges of the lid to seal it tightly. [8] X Research source You can purchase this type of container at any home improvement store. If possible, dry the rags in a well-ventilated area with no wind to blow them away. After they’re dried, put them in a fireproof pouch to transport them to the hazardous waste center."
