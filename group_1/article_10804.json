      "title": "Design a costume for your superhero.",
      "content": "Design a costume for your superhero. Make sure the colors, style, and accessories are all appropriate to both the character’s powers and personality. Consider the central weapons your hero might rely on, and if your hero might have a signature weapon they created and use. Think about what certain colors often imply. For example, white can imply innocence, while black might be more associated with darkness or evil. [1] X Research source This is also a great time to think about your superhero's gender and body type. People come in all shapes and sizes, and superheroes are no different!"

    {
      "title": "Give your superhero a trademark.",
      "content": "Give your superhero a trademark. A symbol or logo, for example, makes superheroes more memorable and helps make their costumes complete. Think of the big “S” on Superman’s chest, and the skull painted on the Punisher’s shirt. A catchphrase might also be useful, but remember to make it catchy, not long or cheesy. If it’s appropriate for the character’s power, consider giving them a trademark pose, weapon, vehicle, or other tool. Be sure to name these items and give them a special place in the story arc."
    },
    {
      "title": "Name your superhero.",
      "content": "Name your superhero. The name of your superhero will essentially be the “hook” for getting people interested. Of course, it’s the stories and character traits that make people love the superheroes, but it’s their names that are memorable and make the reader interested in the first place. Try different naming techniques. There’s the noun + noun technique, in which you use two nouns and make a compound word, like Spider-Man. Or, you can try the adjective + noun technique, like in Superman and Black Widow. [2] X Research source A name can have something to do with the hero’s powers, their personality, or who they are. Since you’ve already thought out their origin story and what powers they have, these things should help you come up with a good name."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide if you want to give your hero a sidekick.",
      "content": "Decide if you want to give your hero a sidekick. Also, you might consider making your hero part of a team. Think of well-known teams and pairings like the X-Men, Justice League, and Avengers. They often come together as a team, but also have separate stories of their own. Develop the sidekick/team the same way that you’ve developed the superhero thus far, then create a backstory as to how they met or came together. Consider these questions: is the sidekick useful or do they make lots of mistakes? Were they once enemies? Were they scarred by the same event?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your superhero’s powers.",
      "content": "Choose your superhero’s powers. Since super heroes are generally identified by their powers, it makes perfect sense to think of the powers first and then shape the character to fit them. A huge number of superpowers have already been claimed by other characters, so try to come up with something unique. Consider giving the hero multiple powers, like flight and super strength. A mix of powers might help differentiate your new hero from other ones that already exist. Some superheroes don’t have supernatural powers and instead rely on gadgets and training, like Batman and Black Widow. Their dedication commands respect, but also makes them more vulnerable—and possibly more interesting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your superhero a tragic flaw or weakness.",
      "content": "Give your superhero a tragic flaw or weakness. A tragic or “fatal” flaw is essentially a character trait or quality that your hero grapples with on a regular basis. An invulnerable hero can get old fast. By giving him or her a fatal weakness, you make battles more interesting and make fans more invested in the character. [3] X Research source For example, Superman's weakness is kryptonite, while Batman’s tragic flaw is his obsession with seeking justice after seeing his parents murdered. Flaws or weaknesses can be emotional, psychological, or physical."

    {
      "title": "Flesh out your character’s personalities.",
      "content": "Flesh out your character’s personalities. Your super hero might have two separate identities: his everyday identity, and his hero identity. These two lives might entail separate personalities and traits. Work out what traits your hero possess in each form. [4] X Research source Consider diving your superhero an alter ego, (i.e. Superman and Clark Kent). This can add dimension and make your character more interesting to readers."

    {
      "title": "Avoid copying other existing characters.",
      "content": "Avoid copying other existing characters. It’s doubtful you’ll be able to find traits or powers that haven’t already been taken by someone somewhere, so just be sure to tweak it enough that you don’t directly rip off another character. For example, if you want to give your hero Superman’s powers, give him a different name and a different backstory. That way, your hero is different and original."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try making your hero different from other superheroes.",
      "content": "Try making your hero different from other superheroes. If you’re creating your own superhero, you are probably pretty familiar with the standard traits and qualities of popular superheroes. Rather than making yours just like the ones that already exist, break the mold and try to be original. Give your hero a unique combination of powers or traits. You can be original in all aspects of creating your superhero. Maybe their power puts them at a disadvantage, or maybe they are too scared to use their powers. Use popular superhero characters as reference points. When you think of a traditional hero, what comes to mind? How can you make your hero different from these tropes?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Come up with a backstory for your hero.",
      "content": "Come up with a backstory for your hero. In the superhero world, backstories are often called origin stories. They offer insight into the life your hero had before he really became a hero, and even how he became one. This story will give us a look into the more “human” side of your hero, and make him a more sympathetic and relatable character. [5] X Research source Many superheroes have experienced tragedies that inspired and motivated them to enforce and serve justice. For example, Bruce Wayne wants to serve justice because he saw his parents murdered. Conflict and inner-turmoil can help shape the character and their story. When coming up with their backstory, think about conflicts or problems they may have faced that shaped them into the hero they are now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about how the superhero’s powers evolved.",
      "content": "Think about how the superhero’s powers evolved. Once you’ve determined your hero’s backstory, you know whether or not he was born with the powers he has, or if he came into them later in life. Deciding how he discovered or came into his powers is an important part of his story and who he is. Consider some questions: what was their initial reaction to their abilities? Are they necessary for survival? How often do they use their powers, and are they proud or ashamed of them? Make the superpowers a journey in and of themselves. A character who has a static relationship to their own abilities won’t generate a lot of interest. Some trial and error, or even some internal conflict with how to use the powers are both good options."

    {
      "title": "Determine the community’s relationship to the character.",
      "content": "Determine the community’s relationship to the character. Some superheroes are disliked or feared by the communities they exist within. Batman and Spider-Man, for example, were both seen as menaces initially, before the community came to see them as helpful. Decide what kind of relationship you want your hero to have with his community. Anti-heroes, like Deadpool, are loved by many audiences, even if they are disliked or feared in their comics or movies. This approach could be a fun experiment in storytelling and character evolution."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create rivals or enemies for your hero.",
      "content": "Create rivals or enemies for your hero. Any good superhero needs a villain or two to fight against. Flesh out the enemies the same way you did the superhero. However, don’t answer too many questions about the villains right off the bat. Taking time to reveal their backstories, true natures, and motivations will make them more engaging and mysterious. The villain’s backstory could tie in with the superhero’s, even if the hero doesn’t know it. They can find out about the connection as their story unfolds. This can add new layers to the story and the characters. People love a good villain and are interested in their backstory, whether it’s to place blame or to understand their motivations. Great examples include the Joker and Loki. When creating your villain, consider making him the opposite of your hero. For example, his superpower could conflict with your hero's power. This will give the two a reason to be at odds."
