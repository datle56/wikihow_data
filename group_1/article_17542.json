      "content": "Watch your form in the mirror as you exercise. Sometimes, a muscle imbalance can be caused by exercising improperly. When you workout, try to do it in front of a mirror so you can see your arms, and check to see if you are working both in the same way. [1] X Research source For example, when you do dumbbell curls, you could be leaning over too much on one side. This can create an imbalance in your muscle tone. When you lift barbells, you could be lifting one side higher than the other. This could make one arm stronger. If you are feeling pain or discomfort as you work out, it could be a sign that your form is off."

      "content": "Focus on your weaker side when you are doing bilateral movements. When you use barbells or other equipment that works both of your arms at the same time, make sure you engage your weaker arm as much as you are engaging your stronger one. Really think about how your muscles feel and if you are spreading out the weight over both your arms. [2] X Research source Being mindful while you exercise can also help you avoid potential injuries."

      "title": "Avoid twisting or rotating your body as you work out.",
      "content": "Avoid twisting or rotating your body as you work out. When one arm is weaker than the other, your body could be compensating by twisting your core or shoulder when you do your reps. Focus on holding your body straight and not letting your torso twist or bend as you workout. [3] X Research source For example, when you do shoulder presses with a dumbbell, make sure your posture remains upright."

      "content": "Work with a personal trainer to make sure your form is correct. Talk to a professional about your uneven muscle tone and work with them to create an exercise program that’s right for you. You can usually find personal trainers at your local gym or fitness center. Personal trainers are certified in physical training and exercise, so they know how to create safe, healthy workout plans that are right for you."

      "title": "Stretch your arms after you work out.",
      "content": "Stretch your arms after you work out. Sometimes, uneven muscle tone can be caused by flexibility issues. After you work out, do some basic arm stretches to cool down your muscles and improve your mobility. [4] X Research source Pull one arm across your chest and hold it for about 30 seconds, then repeat that on the other side. Try pushing your arm behind your head and holding it for 30 seconds, then repeat that on the other side."

      "title": "Work out each arm muscle equally.",
      "content": "Work out each arm muscle equally. Instead of focusing on just your biceps, be sure to include your triceps and your shoulders as well. You can do tricep pushups, tricep dips, and shoulder presses to include these muscles in your workout. [5] X Research source To do tricep pushups, get into a normal push up position but keep your arms close to your shoulders. Lower your body down while keeping your arms parallel to your torso. To do tricep dips, get into a crab walk position with your hands behind you facing towards you and your torso facing upwards. Lift your rear off the ground and then bend your arms to do a reverse pushup motion. To do a shoulder press, grab a barbell or 2 dumbbells. Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart and your back straight, and raise your weights directly above your head. Then, lower them down so the weights are next to your head."

      "content": "Vary your workout routine to strengthen different muscles. If you’ve found a workout routine that you love, it can be hard to switch it up. Try to incorporate different exercises into your routine so you can vary which muscles you are working out. [6] X Research source For example, if you always do bicep curls during your arm workout, try switching to pushups instead. Try doing dynamic exercises, like a curl and press. [7] X Expert Source Adam Shuty Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 25 June 2021. Single arm exercises are a great way to strengthen your non-dominant arm.

      "title": "Use your weaker arm to do daily activities.",
      "content": "Use your weaker arm to do daily activities. Often, your non-dominant arm is the one that’s weaker since you use it less. Try using your weaker arm to brush your teeth, eat food, make coffee, and do your daily activities to strengthen it incrementally. [9] X Research source Perform the same exercise with both arms to see how much stronger your non-dominant arm is. For instance, if you can do 10 reps of an exercise with your dominant arm and only 6 reps with your other arm, your strength gap would be about 4 reps.

      "title": "Workout with dumbbells more often than barbells.",
      "content": "Workout with dumbbells more often than barbells. Dumbbells help to focus the weight on one arm instead of spreading it out over both of your arms. Try using dumbbells as much as you can so you can really focus on strengthening your weaker side. [11] X Research source You don’t have to give up barbells completely, but it is much easier to focus on one arm when that’s the only one you are working out. For example, instead of doing bicep curls with a barbell, try doing them with a dumbbell instead.

      "content": "Add a few more reps of every exercise to your weaker side. To really bulk up your muscles, you can work out your weaker arm more than your stronger one. Try adding 4 to 5 more reps of each exercise to your weaker arm after you’re done. [13] X Research source For example, if you did 10 bicep curls on each arm, do 5 extra on your weaker arm. Use caution when you work out your weaker arm more, as you could actually make your weaker arm stronger than your other arm. Try taking at least 6 weeks off your usual workout routine to correct your muscle imbalance. You'll need at least 6 weeks to see strength gains and muscle growth in your weaker arm.

      "content": "Take pictures of your arms once a week to track your progress. If you’ve noticed your muscles look bigger in one arm, take a photo with a date and time stamp. Keep taking photos of your arms once a week to see how your muscles in the weaker side are developing. It can be hard to track changes in yourself since you look at yourself every day. Taking pictures can help with that."
