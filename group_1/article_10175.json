You will not have to talk to your friend as much. If your friend starts being annoying, you will still have other people you can talk to. Make sure that other people are around when you hang out with your annoying friend. For example, make plans with some other friends and then invite the annoying friend to come along or eat lunch with a group of people instead of just you and your friend. If your friend invites you to go somewhere and you know it will only be the two of you, decline the offer or ask if you can bring someone else along."

This way you can keep the conversation short. For example, you could call and say, \"Hey, I saw your missed call. I'm about to eat dinner with my family, what's up?\" Setting boundaries is a good, important thing to do in your friendship.
