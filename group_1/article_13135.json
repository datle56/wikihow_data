      "title": "Viewers believed a Lion King scene hid the message “S-E-X.”",
      "content": "Viewers believed a Lion King scene hid the message “S-E-X.” In the scene, Simba, Timon, and Pumba are looking at the stars. Simba moves, causing a dust cloud to form. When paused at the right moment, the dust wisps appear to spell the word “sex.” [1] X Research source Animator Tom Sito, who worked on the film, confirmed the dust was meant to spell S-F-X as a nod to the special effects department. [2] X Research source Thus, the subliminal message is considered debunked—simply a misunderstanding."

      "content": "An eye chart in a DuckTales scene mentions the Illuminati. In “Yuppy Ducks,” the thirteenth episode of season three of Disney’s DuckTales , there’s a subliminal message about the Illuminati. When Scrooge McDuck goes to the doctor’s office, an eye chart in the background reads “Ask About Illuminati.” However, it changes a few frames later. The Illuminati is a historical secret society that’s been the subject of numerous conspiracies. [3] X Research source These conspiracies usually suggest that members of the Illuminati secretly control the world."

      "title": "A nude image appeared in a few frames of The Rescuers.",
      "content": "A nude image appeared in a few frames of The Rescuers . About 38 minutes into the original home-video version of the movie, viewers spotted a photograph of a topless woman in the window of a building in the background. The image only appeared in two non-consecutive frames, which explains why it went unnoticed for decades. [4] X Research source Disney recalled the home-video version of the film in 1999 after it came to public attention, claiming it had been placed there in post-production—not by their animators. Supposedly, this subliminal imagery appeared in almost every version of The Rescuers from its 1977 release until the 1999 recall."

      "title": "Viewers claimed to hear Aladdin tell teenagers to get undressed.",
      "content": "Viewers claimed to hear Aladdin tell teenagers to get undressed. In 1993, a rumor spread that Aladdin said, “Good teenagers, take off your clothes.” The supposed subliminal message could barely be heard in a scene in Aladdin where Aladdin steps onto Jasmine’s balcony and her tiger Rajah growls at him. Disney debunked this in 1995. [5] X Research source In a 1995 Associated Press article, a Disney spokesman explained the line is actually “Scat, good tiger, take off and go.” In a 2015 interview with HuffPost, former Disney animator Tom Sito claimed the animators of the sequence were religious and would not include such a message.

      "title": "Several Pixar films feature subtle Apple references.",
      "content": "Several Pixar films feature subtle Apple references. In Monsters, Inc. and WALL-E , there are multiple subliminal references to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Apple products. This is likely because Steve Jobs was an early investor in Pixar Animation Studios before he sold it to Disney in 2006. [7] X Research source When WALL-E the robot recharges in the film, the Mac startup sound plays. Old Apple mice appear in the movie as part of a joke about mice (rodents) in the future. WALL-E watches the movie Hello, Dolly! on an iPod early in the film. In Monsters, Inc. , the slogan “Scare Different” is a riff on Apple Inc. campaign slogan “Think Different.” [8] X Research source"

      "content": "People spotted a phallic castle spire in The Little Mermaid artwork. In the mid-1990s, a rumor caught on that a disgruntled artist at Disney had hidden a phallic symbol in the castle on the cover of The Little Mermaid ’s videocassette case. However, the artist did not work directly for Disney, denies being disgruntled, and says the shape is a coincidence. [9] X Research source The artist shared with Snopes that he didn’t notice the inappropriate resemblance because he was rushing to complete the project on time."

      "content": "Fans think Rapunzel’s hair spells out “sex.” On the movie poster for Disney’s 2010 film Tangled , some Internet sleuths believe there’s a subliminal message. They claim the shape of Rapunzel’s hair wrapped around Flynn Rider’s body spells the letters “S-E-X.” However, this is probably just a coincidence and not an intentional subliminal message.

      "content": "Some believe Simba’s face hides a topless woman. Conspiracy-minded fans theorize that the poster for Disney’s The Lion King hides a subliminal symbol. An image circulated online outlines the area above and below Simba’s nose on the poster, revealing what looks like a topless woman bending away from the viewer. [11] X Research source This inappropriate image is probably just a coincidence, and isn’t really visible in the poster without the outline."

      "content": "The design of one toy in the Pixar movie is a subtle innuendo. In the film Toy Story , a character named Sid fuses pieces of toys together. One of his creations is a pair of doll legs with a hook suspended between them. Fans, including Cardi B, noticed this could be interpreted as a hooker, although it’s unclear if this is a coincidence or an intentional subliminal message. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Some people claim the Disney logo references the Antichrist. They point to the curly font in The Walt Disney Company logo, suggesting there are three hidden 6’s that subliminally form the number of the beast, “666.” This number is associated with the Christian Antichrist. This is a coincidence—the logo is simply a recreation of Walt Disney’s handwriting. [13] X Research source Conspiracists claim the 6’s appear in the left of the “W” in “Walt,” the swirl over the letter “i” in “Disney,” and the swirl in the letter “y” in “Disney.”"
