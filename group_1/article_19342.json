      "content": "Buy Nair, Veet, Nad's, or a similar hair removal cream. Hair removal cream is similar to shaving, since the effects last a short amount of time, but does not use a razor or shaving cream. The Nair cream is applied to the hair for specific amount of time, which dissolves the hair, and then is scraped off.These creams chemically remove hair without pain; results can last up to two weeks. This is bought at most drugstores such as Walmart, RiteAid, or Target. This is done in the comfort of your own home as well, but is slightly more time consuming than shaving. This method is easier if you're prone to accidental cutting from razors, or have trouble shaving. There are some limitations to this method. You can't put them anywhere near your face, breasts (women) or genitals. Some people have an allergic reaction to the chemicals which may result in a rash, extreme tingling sensation or general discomfort to the area. If any of these occur, you should seek medical advice. [1] X Research source Hair removal creams are one of the safest options providing you don't have an allergy to them. To check if you do have an allergy you can start by applying a small amount to the back of your hand, waiting five minutes and noting if any symptoms occur (Itchiness, Rash, Redness, Irritation, inflammation etc.). If you do get symptoms, maybe hair removal cream isn't your best option."

Wet your skin down, apply the cream and lather it up, wait for up to 10 minutes (5 normally does it), then scrape the cream off. Most creams come with a soft plastic scraper, don't let it intimidate you, just press it to the skin and glide. Afterwards you can rinse the rest of it off with water as it may leave the area feeling sticky/slimy. Don't leave the cream on your skin for longer than the specified time. Wash yourself thoroughly with warm water and mild soap, and rinse twice according to the directions."

You can buy a razor and shaving cream in most grocery stores, pharmacies, and even gas stations. Shaving is a fast and painless way to get rid of hair, however it doesn't prevent hair from growing back. Unlike waxing, shaving does not hurt, but because of the sharp blades from the razor, you can cut yourself frequently. Shaving only lasts for up to a week, until the hair is visible again. Some hair grows back within 1-2 days."

Hair removal wax comes in two forms, a wax that you apply then press paper strips to, or strips with wax already stuck to them. This is often done at a salon, but you can buy at-home waxing kits as. Waxing is another relatively safe way to remove hairs, though it is not recommended around sensitive areas of skin as it can cause injuries, rashes and discomfort. Waxing is generally done on the chest, arms, legs and armpits. [6] X Expert Source Karina Villalta Certified Esthetician Expert Interview. 19 August 2020.

In general, the strips are much cleaner and easier to use, though they are less precise. Consider sugar waxing . Sugar waxing is much like waxing, although it is applied in the opposite direction of hair growth, then torn in the direction of growth. This causes the hair removal process to be less painful than waxing, but still may cause redness after treatment. This is often done at salons, but you can make your own sugar wax from sugar, water, salt, and lemon."

Ibuprofin before hair removal can also alleviate pain and swelling. Heavy exercise immediately after waxing is not recommended as it can irritate the skin. Swimming should wait at least 24 hours.

An epilator is made of many many tweezers that pluck out the hair, and can remove your hair for up to two weeks on average. Epilators are painful and more time consuming than shaving, but because it removes the entire hair follicle the results will last much longer. Instead of cutting the hair, an epilator has grooves and small indents where, as you run it up your body it grips the hair and pulls it out at the root.
