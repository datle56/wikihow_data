      "content": "Take plenty of time to rest. One of the quickest ways to end up back in a sickbed is to push yourself to be active too soon. Yes, you probably have a lot to do and might be missing school or work, but letting your body recuperate from an illness is extremely important. Don’t try to do too much until all of your symptoms have subsided. Relaxing and getting lots of sleep should be #1 on your priority list until you feel like you are 100% better. Healthy adults need between 7.5 and 9 hours of sleep every night, and someone who is sick will need a great deal more. Make sure you are allowing yourself adequate time to rest, whether this means calling in sick to work or school, canceling plans, and/or going to bed early. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay hydrated. Being sick can take a lot out of you; it is always an exhausting experience, both mentally and physically. Help your body bounce back faster by drinking plenty of fluids. [2] X Research source Be sure to drink an 8 fl oz (240 mL) glass of water every few hours throughout the day to replace fluids lost during your illness. You should also drink a nutrient-rich drink like bone broth, vegetable broth, or coconut water a few times per day even after you feel better."

      "content": "Eat healthily. Getting back into the swing of eating after a bout of illness can be unappealing at best. However, it is very important to revive your body with much-needed nutrients and sustenance so you can keep getting better. Since you have probably only eaten crackers, dry toast, or broth for the few past days or weeks, start reintroducing some healthy, nutrient-rich foods into your diet again. [3] X Research source Some tips: Avoid eating any rich, processed, or fatty foods. Eat smaller, lighter meals more frequently throughout the day instead of 3 main meals. Try eating a green fruit and vegetable smoothie once a day. It will help you to ingest a lot of nutrients that are key to getting you back on your feet. Soups, in particular chicken bone broth with vegetables, tom yum, pho, and miso soup, are a great way to reintroduce proteins and vegetables back into your diet."

      "content": "Ease your muscle aches with gentle heat. Part of feeling better after you’ve been sick is dealing with associated symptoms like soreness and muscle aches. You might not be coughing every 5 minutes anymore, but your back might hurt still from all the hacking. One good way to alleviate any associated soreness once you start feeling better is with heat treatments. For example: [4] X Research source Relax in a nice long bath. Try adding 1 cup (1.7g) of Epsom salts or a few drops of relaxing, anti-inflammatory essential oils like eucalyptus, peppermint, or lavender to promote additional healing and relaxation. Try using a heat pad to help with site-specific pain. For example, if you’re having lower abdominal cramping post-stomach flu, you can heat the pad up and place it on your abdomen for some relief. Carefully massage a pain-relieving ointment like Tiger Balm or Icy Hot wherever you feel sore. For example, apply a dab to your temples for any associated headaches. Just be sure to wash your hands afterward, as these rubs are very potent and whatever skin it touches will heat up!"

But wait until you are completely fever-free to begin exercising. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you haven’t had a fever, avoid intense workouts and give yourself 2 to 3 weeks before you start doing any heavy exercising. Get back into working out slowly, and start with short, light workouts, such as walking, gentle stretches, and restorative or slow yoga. Wait at least a week after being sick before moving to more moderate exercises, like jogging. You could also ease back into exercising with a hot yoga class, which can support your immune system and help clear out any remaining congestion. Just remember to stay hydrated, listen to your body, and take it slow! Get plenty of rest after doing any kind of exercise."

Once you’ve started taking care of the inside of your body, turn your attention to your neglected skin. [9] X Research source Purchase a moisturizer that has lanolin in it and dab it onto areas like your nose for instant relief from painful, chapped skin. Consider also purchasing a lip balm that contains ingredients like coconut oil or argan oil, which are excellent for chapped lips. Sesame and almond oil are also great for moisturizing chapped skin.

You sweat a lot more when you’re sick and your sheets are covered in unhealthy germs, so killing the bacteria on your bed is very important. Strip your entire bed, including pillowcases, and wash them in hot water with color-safe bleach. Treat any stains with a stain remover before washing. Let your mattress breathe for a few hours before putting any new sheets on. While you’re sick, wash your sheets and pillowcases in hot water every few days to kill germs and viruses, especially if you share a bed with someone else. [10] X Research source"

Whether you were just there to grab more tissues or slept in there for 2 nights vomiting, giving your bathroom a deep clean is another top priority after being sick. [11] X Research source Here are some tips for sanitizing your bathroom: Wash any bath towels, hand towels, rugs, robes, or other fabrics in hot water with color-safe bleach. Disinfect all surfaces, focusing mainly on the countertops and the toilet. You can use a store-bought product with bleach, or you can make your own disinfectant with 1 part water to 1 part rubbing alcohol or full-strength vinegar. Empty the trash can, and then disinfect the trash bin. Replace your toothbrush or soak your toothbrush head in hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria. If you used a sponge to wipe everything down, throw it out when you’re done. If you use a cloth wipe, wash it with the towels when you’re finished. Add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to your cleaning solution when you mop the floor. The scent will soothe your airways, and the oil may help kill lingering germs and viruses.

Just be sure to use disinfecting products that are safe for use on a variety of surfaces, such as electronics.

Now that your bed, bathroom, kitchen, and points of contact are clean, you have to remove the last location of your sick germs: the clothing you wore. Take all of the pajamas, sweaters, and comfy clothes you recuperated in over the past days or weeks and do one last load of laundry using hot water and color-safe bleach. Then, dry the clothes on a high-heat setting. [14] X Research source This will ensure that you have killed all the viruses and bacteria you possibly can and will have a clean, healthy slate. If you share a home with someone else, wash your clothes separately from theirs to prevent them from getting sick. Run a wash cycle with bleach after you’ve cleaned your clothes to disinfect the washing machine."

Open any windows and let a cross breeze move some fresh air in and around your house for a little bit. Replacing the stale, sick air in your home with fresh air will get rid of any airborne particles and it will leave you feeling refreshed and energized. If it’s really cold outside, only do this for a minute or 2; otherwise, keep the windows open for as long as you like!"
