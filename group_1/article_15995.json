    {
      "title": "Assess the writer’s background.",
      "content": "Assess the writer’s background. Before you can assess a person’s writing skills, you must take their background into account. For example, you would not evaluate an ESL student’s writing the same way you would if they were a native English speaker. Consider such factors as: The writer’s age and developmental level. Their educational background and experience. Their familiarity with the language in which they will be writing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Target your evaluation to the writer’s experience level.",
      "content": "Target your evaluation to the writer’s experience level. You will need to adjust your expectations depending on the writer’s background. Keeping in mind their age, experience level, and language proficiency, design a test that is appropriate for the individual. For example, if you’re evaluating an ESL writer’s skills, you may wish to focus mainly on linguistic accuracy (e.g., correct use of grammar, syntax, word forms, and vocabulary). If you are evaluating the writing of children, keep their age and grade level in mind. For example, you should expect an 8th grader to have a more complex understanding of verb moods and tenses than a 4th grader. Use a chart like this one to determine what skills are appropriate for the child’s grade level: https://www.cde.state.co.us/sites/default/files/documents/coreadingwriting/documents/rwc_gle_at_a_glance.pdf . For professional and academic writing, basic technical proficiency may be less of a concern than style, content, organization, and proper citation techniques. However, you should still evaluate technical proficiency, as it's an important part of the writer's skills. Think of your evaluation as having a broader approach as the writer's educational background advances."

      "title": "Keep your assignments relevant to the writer’s needs or the skills you're improving.",
      "content": "Keep your assignments relevant to the writer’s needs or the skills you're improving. Writing a formal academic paper requires a very different skillset from writing a letter or a screenplay. Before you create a test or assignment, consider whether it reflects the types of writing skills you want to evaluate. [1] X Research source For example, if you are testing the writer’s ability to use descriptive language, you might ask them to describe a piece of art in a few paragraphs, or to describe a photo of the countryside. If you want to assess their ability to convey information concisely, you could have them complete an assignment in a specific number of words or paragraphs. You may not be addressing the writer's immediate needs, especially if they're in a class you're teaching. However, you should be helping them work on a specific skill."

    {
      "title": "Determine your assessment criteria.",
      "content": "Determine your assessment criteria. There are many different types of writing skills, so you will need to select a few to focus on. Decide exactly which skills you want to evaluate, since this will determine the nature of the assignment and how you evaluate it. [2] X Research source For example, you might focus on: The use of proper writing conventions, such as good spelling, grammar, syntax, capitalization, and punctuation. The writer’s mastery of written vocabulary. The clarity and fluency with which the writer presents their arguments. The use of clear and logical structure within the text."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a scoring rubric",
      "content": "Create a scoring rubric . A rubric is a way of quantifying whatever it is you are trying to evaluate. This might involve assigning a letter grade based on your overall impression of the work (a holistic rubric) or giving points based on the degree to which the work meets specific criteria (an analytic rubric). [3] X Research source Rubrics allow you to score students with different needs and backgrounds using a different scale. Consider the writer's background and current skill level when creating your rubric so you can differentiate your evaluation process. For example, an ESL student will have a different rubric than a native speaker who is also an honor student. If you’re not sure where to start, do an online search for example writing rubrics. This site offers a variety of rubric templates: http://rubistar.4teachers.org/index.php . A holistic rubric might assign a letter grade based on the overall clarity, organization, and technical proficiency of the writing. For example, you might say, “An ‘A’ paper will present the main argument clearly and support it with specific facts. It will also be free of grammatical and spelling errors.” In an analytic rubric, you will need to develop a numerical scoring system for the different criteria you will be looking at. For example, you might subtract 1 point for every grammatical error, or assign a range of points (0-10) for organization, fluency, or the degree to which the writing addresses the assignment topic."

    {
      "title": "Set clear parameters for your assignment.",
      "content": "Set clear parameters for your assignment. The writer will need to know exactly what is expected of them as they are completing their assignment. Tell them what you will be looking for in as much detail as possible, and invite them to ask questions if they have trouble understanding the assignment. Provide both written and verbal instructions to accommodate different learning styles. Give them information such as: [4] X Research source How much time they have to complete the assignment. Approximately how long the text should be (e.g., 5 paragraphs, 10 pages, or 300-500 words). The purpose of the assignment (e.g., to assess their ability to present a persuasive argument). The topic (or range of topics) you would like them to write about."

    {
      "title": "Keep re-evaluating throughout the writing process.",
      "content": "Keep re-evaluating throughout the writing process. Building writing skills is a process, and so is evaluating those skills. You will get a better idea of the writer’s abilities if you check in and provide feedback at multiple points during the writing process and assess how their writing improves and develops over time. [5] X Research source For example, you might offer to provide feedback on drafts, and then look at how well they incorporate your suggestions into the final product. If you can, offer multiple assignments over a period of time, and provide feedback that encourages improvement and development."

      "title": "Check the writer’s spelling.",
      "content": "Check the writer’s spelling. Writing conventions are the basic technical skills that make writing coherent and understandable. Good spelling is a key element of clear and professional writing. [6] X Research source When assessing spelling, keep in mind such issues as: The overall number of spelling errors (e.g., what percentage of words are spelled correctly vs. incorrectly?). The writer’s understanding of basic spelling rules and patterns (e.g., the use of silent letters, the softening of certain consonants before certain vowels, etc.). The prevalence of common spelling errors in the writer’s work (such as mixing up commonly confused words, like “stationary” and “stationery”)."

      "title": "Look at the writer’s punctuation.",
      "content": "Look at the writer’s punctuation . Proper punctuation is also essential for clarity of writing. Check the writer’s work to make sure that they: [7] X Research source Use appropriate punctuation when indicating the use of direct quotations. Use proper punctuation to mark the ends of sentences (e.g., periods, question marks, and exclamation points) and clauses (e.g., commas, colons, and semicolons). Indicate contractions and possessives with the correct use of apostrophes."

    {
      "title": "Examine their capitalization.",
      "content": "Examine their capitalization . A skilled writer should know the conventions of capitalization. [8] X Research source Look over their writing and make sure that they follow such conventions as: [9] X Research source Capitalizing the first words of sentences. Capitalizing proper nouns and adjectives, including personal names, place names, and titles before proper nouns (e.g., Governor Johnson). Using correct capitalization when writing titles of works, such as books or articles."

      "title": "Evaluate their grammar.",
      "content": "Evaluate their grammar. Using correct grammar is one of the most complex elements of writing. When looking over the writer’s work, you might look select a handful of grammatical issues to focus on based on factors such as their age or experience level. For example, you might check that the writer is able to: [10] X Research source Use correct verbal forms (e.g., proper tense, mood, voice, person, and number). Understand grammatical cases and use appropriate forms (e.g., distinguish between subjective, objective, and possessive forms of pronouns). Show agreement between grammatical forms (e.g., nouns and pronouns match in number and gender)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assess their use of syntax.",
      "content": "Assess their use of syntax. Syntax refers to the ways sentences are put together. For a sentence to be syntactically correct, both individual words and entire clauses must be arranged in an order that makes sense. In English, word order is especially important for establishing clear meaning and correct syntax. [11] X Research source Look for: Clear and correct word order. The use of conjunctions to link coordinating clauses within a sentence. Use of a variety of sentence structures (e.g., simple declarative sentences, interrogative sentences, and compound sentences)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a clear beginning, middle, and end.",
      "content": "Look for a clear beginning, middle, and end. A well-organized piece of writing should have a clearly-defined structure. While the nature of that structure will vary depending on the type of writing, most written works should have: An introduction that briefly summarizes the topic or introduces the theme of the piece in some way. A body, in which the major points of the text are laid out. A conclusion, which wraps up the text and ties up any loose ends."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assess their use of paragraphing.",
      "content": "Assess their use of paragraphing. Paragraphing refers to the arrangement of sentences into coherent groups. Each paragraph should focus on a single theme or idea, and should be visually separated from the previous paragraph with an indentation or an extra line space. A strong paragraph should include: [12] X Research source A topic sentence, clearly expressing the main idea of the paragraph. A few sentences supporting, explaining, or elaborating on the main theme. Some type of transition that links the current paragraph to the theme of the next paragraph."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure their ideas are ordered in a logical way.",
      "content": "Make sure their ideas are ordered in a logical way. A good piece of writing should present its points in an order that makes sense. While there is no single right way to order a piece of writing, the writer should at least have some kind of clear organizational scheme in place. For example: [13] X Research source In a narrative, the writer might present events in chronological order from earliest to latest. For an argumentative essay, the writer might start by presenting their strongest evidence and end with their weakest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for clear transitions between ideas or sections.",
      "content": "Check for clear transitions between ideas or sections. In order for a piece of writing to be coherent, there must be a logical flow of ideas from one clause, sentence, paragraph, or section to the next. Transitions are used to clarify variety of links between ideas, such as causative relationships, temporal relationships, or similarities and differences. Transitions can also be used to link a topic to supporting examples or evidence. Look for the effective use of transitional words and phrases, such as: “Therefore” “On the other hand” “However” “Furthermore” “Likewise” “For example” “In conclusion”"

      "content": "Evaluate word choice and vocabulary. The words that a writer chooses can have a major impact on the tone, clarity, and quality of their writing. When looking at the writer’s work, consider factors such as: [14] X Research source Whether the words they use clearly express the desired meaning. Whether the words they use are appropriate for the tone of the article (e.g., do then need to be more formal or casual?). Whether the vocabulary is varied enough to keep the reader’s interest. Whether words are being used correctly and at a level appropriate to the writer’s age, developmental level, or experience level. Whether the word choice is appropriate for the intended audience of the piece."

    {
      "title": "Look for originality and a clear voice.",
      "content": "Look for originality and a clear voice. A writer’s “voice” is what makes their work distinctive and interesting. Try to get a sense of whether the writer’s work conveys a tone that reflects their personal style or unique viewpoint. This might include factors such as: [15] X Research source The use of distinctive words, phrases, and metaphors instead of clichés and stock phrases. A unifying and consistent mood or tone. Confident “ownership” of opinions and viewpoints."

    {
      "title": "Determine if the style is appropriate for the type of writing.",
      "content": "Determine if the style is appropriate for the type of writing. The tone and style of a written work should fit the format and context of the piece. When you are evaluating a writer’s work, keep the purpose of the piece in mind. For example: If the work is intended for a general audience, a chatty and informal tone might be appropriate. For an academic essay, the tone and word choice should be formal and technical. The passive voice is also more appropriate in academic writing than in other types of writing. [16] X Research source While good advertising copy might appeal to the reader’s emotions, an informative essay on a technical topic should be written in a more objective and impartial tone."

      "title": "Watch for concise, straightforward language.",
      "content": "Watch for concise, straightforward language. Asses the writer’s ability to express ideas clearly without excessive padding or wordiness. In addition to individual sentences, look at the overall structure of the piece. [17] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Are there unnecessary tangents and redundant sentences or paragraphs? Does the piece contain unnecessary background information (i.e., information that is already obvious to the reader)?"

    {
      "title": "Assess the format and presentation of the writing.",
      "content": "Assess the format and presentation of the writing. If the writer needs to be able to use a particular house style or citation format, take this into account when evaluating their writing. Make sure that they follow any guidelines regarding things like: Page length or word count. Fonts and special characters. Formatting for sources and citations. Line spacing, margin sizes, and headers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be specific in your feedback.",
      "content": "Be specific in your feedback. Your evaluation will benefit the writer the most if you provide clear and specific notes on what works and what needs improvement. Take time to talk to them in detail or write thoughtful comments about their strengths and weaknesses. Make sure that your comments are easy to understand and clear. If they aren't, you should explain them clearly to the student. [18] X Research source For example, instead of “Grammar needs improvement,” you might say something like “Your understanding of tense is strong, but I’m noticing you have a tendency to mismatch your subjects and modifiers.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Offer suggestions on how to improve.",
      "content": "Offer suggestions on how to improve. Instead of just telling the writer what they need to fix, give them some specific ideas about approaches they might take to making their writing stronger. This might mean telling them to be more mindful of a particular issue in their writing (e.g., lack of strong transitions between ideas) or giving them a specific idea about how they might improve a particular passage. For example, instead of just saying, “I’m having a hard time understanding the main point of this paragraph,” you could add, “It might be clearer if you started with a topic sentence.”"

    {
      "title": "Keep your comments relevant to the skills you’re evaluating.",
      "content": "Keep your comments relevant to the skills you’re evaluating. If you give the writer too much feedback on too many different aspects of their writing, they will feel frustrated and overwhelmed. Avoid getting hung up on issues that aren’t necessarily critical to the writing task at hand. [19] X Research source For example, if you’re mainly interested in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, don’t spend a lot of time making comments on vocabulary choice. Keep your commentary appropriate to the writer’s experience level, as well. For example, if you’re evaluating an 8-year-old’s writing, it might be best to focus on their basic technical skills rather than correcting stylistic issues."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide feedback as an audience rather than a critic.",
      "content": "Provide feedback as an audience rather than a critic. Good feedback should help the writer understand their work from a reader’s perspective. This will get them into the mindset of evaluating their own writing objectively. Instead of simply making qualitative statements (e.g., “This doesn’t make sense”), explain your reactions and thought processes as a reader. [20] X Research source For example, “As a reader, I’m not sure where this idea is coming from in paragraph 2. I think it might make more sense to me if you introduced some evidence for your statement in the previous paragraph.”"
