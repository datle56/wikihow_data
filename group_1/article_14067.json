      "title": "Double curve in Kibbe is when your silhouette has two equal curves.",
      "content": "Double curve in Kibbe is when your silhouette has two equal curves. A common way to describe it is that the outline of your figure has two circles sitting on top of one another (one at the bust and one at the hips). Unlike an hourglass figure, which has a narrow gap between the upper and lower curves, a double curve has no distance between the curves. [1] X Research source Because of the lack of space between the curves, double curve is associated with petite frames (under 5’5” (167 cm)). Double curve is an accommodation, also known as a dominant feature. If you’re dressing to best flatter your body type according to the Kibbe system, you have to accommodate your dominant features."

      "content": "Only Romantic and (rarely) Soft Gamine Kibbe types have double curve. The double curve accommodation is associated with the Romantic and Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body types—most Kibbe practitioners believe that all Romantics have the double-curve accommodation. [2] X Research source Soft Gamine types can also have the double-curve accommodation if they don’t have the vertical accommodation. [3] X Research source In Facebook groups, David Kibbe (creator of the Kibbe system) states that the curve accommodation can accompany vertical, width, or balance accommodations. However, he suggests double curve accompanies only the petite accommodation."

      "content": "Double curve is one of six accommodations in the Kibbe system. In 1987, stylist David Kibbe published a book called David Kibbe’s Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle as Only You Can where he outlined 13 body types. Each body type has accommodations, or dominant features, that have to be accounted for when dressing yourself. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Double curves have a defined waist.",
      "content": "Double curves have a defined waist. Because your curves extend past the lines of your silhouette (from armpit to feet), your waist is defined. This is especially noticeable when you’re wearing form-fitting tops or dresses that cling to your curves. However, unlike an hourglass figure which involves a vertical accommodation, your waist is probably short and petite."

    {
      "title": "People with double curve have balanced curves.",
      "content": "People with double curve have balanced curves. This means the curves of the top and bottom halves of your figure are equal in roundness and width. If one curve is noticeably wider or more pronounced than the other, this could be an indicator that you actually have the (single) curve accommodation."

      "title": "If you’re a double curve, you typically have soft lines.",
      "content": "If you’re a double curve, you typically have soft lines. Curves are the opposite of angles—they’re round instead of sharp, creating a sense of softness in your silhouette. Complement these soft lines in the way you dress by avoiding structured garments and angular apparel like V-neck or square-neck tops."

    {
      "title": "Double curves can be any size.",
      "content": "Double curves can be any size. In the Kibbe system, curviness isn’t about size or weight. It’s about the way your flesh sits on your bones, the vertical length of your torso, and the width of your bust and hips. Any size can be a Romantic Kibbe type with double curve. Double curve is more common among petite individuals. This is because the curves have to be close together to be more of a dominant accommodation than the vertical accommodation."

      "content": "Take our wikiHow Kibbe quiz to determine your body type. In the 1987 book that first outlined the Kibbe system, David Kibbe included a three-part quiz readers could use to determine their body type. While the book is out of print and hard to find, we’ve created a “What is My Kibbe Body Type?” quiz that can help you discover your type. Remember, if you’re a Romantic type, you have the double curve accommodation. The questions have to do with bone structure, flesh, and your facial features. Flesh is specifically about the way your skin drapes or sits on your bones, not your body weight. While taking the quiz, reference your features in a mirror or in pictures where you’re wearing unobstructive clothing, such as a bathing suit or fitted workout attire."

      "content": "Create a line drawing of your body and check for double curve. First, take a full-body picture of yourself. Face the camera straight-on. Wear a swimsuit or leggings and a fitted tank top. Next, use your phone’s drawing feature to outline your silhouette two ways (with lines and with shapes). Outline your body by drawing two lines total, from your armpits down to your feet, curving if necessary to trace your silhouette. Draw two total circles or ovals (whichever fits better) around the curves of the top and bottom halves of your body—from shoulders to below the rear. [5] X Research source If the two lines have to curve outward at the bust and hip areas, this indicates you may have the double curve accommodation. The amount of curve should be equal—otherwise, it could be width or (single) curve is a more accurate accommodation. Check to see if the circle or oval shapes are pretty much equal in size (otherwise, you may have single curve or width accommodations instead) and if they’re close together (otherwise, you may have the vertical accommodation instead).

      "content": "Wear rounded silhouettes to highlight the femininity of your shape. Clothing and details that are round in shape (as opposed to angular or sharp) complement the soft femininity (or “yin”) of Romantic Kibbe types. Examples of clothing with rounded silhouettes include A-line skirts, harem pants, and batwing sleeves. [9] X Research source These silhouettes complement the double curve by matching your body’s natural line instead of clashing with it. [10] X Research source Look for clothing with rounded details, as well—for example, bows, florals, polka-dot patterns, and cap sleeves. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Accommodate your curves with soft, flowing outfits that cinch at the waist. David Kibbe recommends dressing in soft clothing that’s lightweight and flowing to flatter a Romantic or Theatrical Romantic body type. However, defining your waist is important—you want to highlight your curves instead of hiding them. [12] X Research source Two example tops that accommodate a double curve are off-shoulder tops that fit at the waist (but flare out below it) and square-neck tops with cap or puff sleeves. Corset-style tops may also work if they’re made of a delicate material like linen or organza. [13] X Research source Bottoms that accommodate a double curve include high-waisted pants, straight-leg jeans, and midi-length skirts that are fitted at the waist and hips."

      "content": "Flatter your height and curves with mid-length dresses and ornate details. Wear dresses that hit above the knee or at midi length to avoid overwhelming your petite frame. Look for details like ruching, delicate ruffles, or belted waists that will cling to your curves and define your waist. Lean into the romance of the Romantic Kibbe type by highlighting your figure in classic feminine styles like floral or polka-dot patterns. [14] X Research source Look to Romantic Kibbe type celebrities like Selena Gomez or Marilyn Monroe for inspiration for formalwear."

      "content": "Wear intricate, delicate accessories and jewelry. While accessories and jewelry don’t directly affect your silhouette like clothing does, you can use them to accentuate the roundness and femininity of your Kibbe type. Look for necklaces or earrings with round gem cuts, as well as delicate chains, purses, and belts. [15] X Research source When it comes to footwear, Kibbe practitioners advise Romantic types to stick to lightweight, slender footwear like flats and stilettos. Wide or clunky shoes can clash with your outfit by being too angular or sharp compared to the rest of your features. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Vertical",
      "content": "Vertical Many people mistakenly think that the vertical accommodation is about how tall you are. But short individuals can have the vertical accommodation in the Kibbe system, and tall individuals can lack it. If you would describe your torso or legs as elongated, or feel like you look tall compared to others of the same height, you likely have the vertical accommodation. The first question of the original Kibbe quiz asks how tall you appear to be, not your actual height. [18] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Width",
      "content": "Width According to the Kibbe system, width means having a frame that’s more dominant than your flesh. In other words, your silhouette tends to be square and angular, particularly at the shoulders. Width is also associated with bones that are blunt and angular. You may also have a wide rib cage. [19] X Research source If you’d describe your shoulders as sloped or rounded or your overall frame as narrow, you probably don’t have the width accommodation."

    {
      "title": "Balance",
      "content": "Balance Balance is a Kibbe accommodation that’s a little less straightforward than vertical or width. When you analyze your body type, you may feel like you have a little of a vertical aspect and a little of width or curve. However, no one feature stands out as dominant compared to the rest. This means you probably have the balance accommodation, as your features neutralize one another without any one being dominant. [20] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Petite",
      "content": "Petite In the Kibbe system, petite is about appearing tiny—especially compared to your clothes. Things might fit loosely no matter what you wear, or you may be short and struggle to find pants or sleeves that hit at your wrists and ankles. If this sounds like you, you likely have the petite accommodation and need to account for your perceived smallness in the way you dress. [21] X Research source If you’re tall, but have a very narrow build, you could have the petite accommodation in spite of your height."

It’s not the same thing as just having curves in the traditional sense, though individuals with the curve accommodation often have curves. In the Kibbe system, Soft Natural, Soft Classic, Soft Gamine, and Soft Dramatic types have the curve accommodation. [22] X Research source"

      "title": "Double Curve",
      "content": "Double Curve Double curve is when your silhouette is rounded on top and bottom in a way that’s pronounced, equal, and more dominant than other features. Think of it this way: if you drew circles over your body that outlined your bust/shoulders and waist/hips, they would be touching like an “8” or even overlapping like a Venn diagram. Neither circle would be wider or taller than the other. [23] X Research source Sometimes, Kibbe practitioners lump curve and double curve together as variations of one accommodation.
