      "title": "Let the pimple heal by itself without touching or popping it.",
      "content": "Let the pimple heal by itself without touching or popping it. Most pimples go away entirely on their own—no need to treat them! Do your best to keep the area clean and dry, and let your body heal. Scratching and popping pimples (especially on your pubic area) may cause an infection, permanent scarring, or cause the bacteria to spread and form more pimples, so leave your pimples alone as best you can. Many pimples go away by themselves within 3 to 7 days, though deeper pimples (which don’t have a head and feel hard to the touch) may take a few weeks to heal. You may be wondering, “Is it possible or normal to get a pimple in my pubic area?” The answer is: absolutely. Pimples can form anywhere you have skin pores, and they’re extremely common. That means pimples can appear anywhere on your body, from your scalp underneath your hair to your pubic area—regardless of gender."

      "title": "Take a shower every day (especially after working out).",
      "content": "Take a shower every day (especially after working out). Regular showers remove any sweat and oil that has built up on your skin. The less oil and sweat on your skin (including your pubic area), the less likely you are to develop pimples there. While showering, gently scrub your pubic area with a loofah to clear away the dead skin cells there; this can unclog your pores and prevent future breakouts. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source It’s particularly crucial to shower right after working out since sweat easily forms while you’re exerting yourself."

      "content": "Wash the area with gentle antibacterial soap twice per day. Regardless of your normal shower schedule, it’s important to wash your pubic area and the particular spot where a pimple is forming twice per day. Use warm water (not too hot) and antibacterial soap to wash your pubic area. Make sure the soap you use is labeled antibacterial; regular cosmetic soaps may cause more inflammation. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source After you’ve washed your pubic area, rinse the soap away completely to avoid skin irritation. Then, be sure to gently but thoroughly dry the pimple and the affected area since dry, clean skin is less likely to develop pimples."

      "title": "Wear underwear made with cotton rather than synthetic materials.",
      "content": "Wear underwear made with cotton rather than synthetic materials. Cotton is a super breathable material, allowing for easier air exchange, which is ideal for underwear. Cotton underwear prevents moisture from getting trapped around your pubic area, which in turn makes pimples less likely to form there. So, the next time you buy underwear, look for options made from cotton and steer clear of synthetic materials. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Synthetic materials to avoid include polyester, nylon, acrylic, rayon, and spandex. Synthetic fabrics are man-made materials created via a chemical process (as opposed to natural fabrics, which don’t require any chemical manufacturing)."

      "content": "Take an acne medication orally if your doctor approves it. While most pimples can be treated with acne medicines and creams (usually containing either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid), the skin around your pubic area is much more sensitive. Normal over-the-counter acne creams could cause a rash, so if you feel you need medication, ask your doctor about an oral antibiotic to clear away the bacteria contributing to pimple outbreaks. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Alternatively, ask your doctor about Isotretinoin, which is a prescription medication usually taken for severe acne."

      "title": "Most pimples look like raised red spots, sometimes with a white head.",
      "content": "Most pimples look like raised red spots, sometimes with a white head. When you touch a pimple, it’ll typically feel like a hardened bump—and it may be tender to the touch. Some pimples just look like red spots, while others develop a “head,” which enables clogged sebum (oil), skin cells, and bacteria to get out of your skin as the pimple heals. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Blackheads are pimples with black centers. They develop when a skin pore gets clogged with sebum and undergoes a chemical reaction; as the sebum is exposed to air, it gets oxidized and turns black. Whiteheads are pimples with white, protruding centers. They develop when a skin pore gets clogged with bacteria, but air can’t reach the bacteria, so it doesn’t undergo any chemical reaction. Alternatively, some pimples fill with pus. Normally, the pus drains away on its own. If you’re concerned, talk to your doctor about having it drained."

      "title": "All pimples are the result of a clogged pore in your skin.",
      "content": "All pimples are the result of a clogged pore in your skin. Pores are small openings around your hair follicles and sweat glands. They mainly help gasses and liquids move through the surface of your skin. However, when a pore gets clogged—with oil, dirt, dead skin cells, or a mixture of all three—a pimple often forms in response. So, if you find a pimple on your pubic area, it’s because a pore on your skin is clogged. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may be more at risk of developing pimples if you: Skip showers Live in a humid climate Have oily skin Shave your pubic hair Wear tight-fitting underwear However, not every bump you might find around your pubic area is necessarily a pimple, so if it doesn’t fit the usual description, look for other causes of pimple-like bumps below."

      "content": "Razor burn Shaving with a razor can easily irritate your skin, especially the sensitive skin around your pubic area. Razor burn results in reddened, irritated skin (sometimes with minor cuts from the razor) and may also cause bumps to form around the site of the rash. This is because shaving with a razor sometimes causes ingrown hairs to form, which in turn causes bumps to form. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ingrown hairs are hairs that grow back into your skin instead of out, like they’re supposed to. They’re very common after both waxing and shaving. Razor burn often heals on its own, but it may also help to soothe the affected skin with an oatmeal-based body lotion in the meantime and use a fresh razor to avoid razor bumps ."

      "content": "Folliculitis When one of your hair follicles (the structures within your skin that grow hair) becomes inflamed, it can cause red, pimple-like bumps to develop in the area called folliculitis. Folliculitis is itchy and sometimes painful, but mild cases often resolve on their own without treatment. If your folliculitis is persistent or keeps recurring, talk to your doctor about treatment. [8] X Research source Folliculitis treatments typically involve using a topical antimicrobial product to clear away the existing bumps and prevent inflammation in the future."

Symptoms of jock itch include itchy red patches with scaly borders around the groin (though not directly on your genitals), and the people at the highest risk for jock itch include athletes, overweight individuals, and those with diabetes. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It's relatively easy to treat jock itch and often involves applying a topical antifungal cream to the affected area.

They typically appear as small spots that are white or yellow, and you may spot them around the frenulum (the small tissue folds underneath the penis) in particular. However, Fordyce spots are completely harmless and don’t require treatment. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Fordyce spots often form in clusters of around 50 to 100 at a time. Fordyce spots can also form in your mouth. If you know what they look like from having them in your mouth before, you may be able to identify them in your pubic area as well. While they’re completely benign, Fordyce spots can be removed using certain dermatologic procedures, like laser therapy."

They’re often painful and itchy and may also develop around your mouth. Genital warts are small, white, or flesh-colored bumps that tend to show up in the pubic area and vary in size, though they’re often cauliflower-shaped. They tend to disappear on their own but can also be treated with freeze and heat therapy. Syphilis presents as white or red ulcers, though the ulcers are usually painless.
