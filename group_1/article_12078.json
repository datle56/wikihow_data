      "content": "Let yourself feel your emotions. Don’t try to fight or hold in what you’re feeling. Try to open yourself up to the anger, sadness, confusion, or feelings of abandonment as they arise. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and it’s okay to feel any or all of these emotions. As time passes, you’ll likely begin to heal and feel better. Just remember, grief isn’t linear, and there’s no time frame in which it ends, so it’s perfectly fine to experience these emotions for as long as it takes to heal.

Go to source Regardless of age, some grandchildren may take a grandmother's death harder due to the duration and closeness of the relationship, the cause of death, or how other family members are reacting. Even if you experience your grief differently from the rest of your family, remember your feelings are still valid. If you’re an adult, try to demonstrate authentic grief so any children or adolescents in the family know that it's okay to cry or be sad."

      "content": "Attend the memorial, if there is one. Funerals can be tough when you’re grieving, but they’re intended to celebrate the life of the deceased and bring comfort to the family. Attending the memorial service is a great opportunity to say goodbye to your grandmother, get closure, and offer support to other family members. If your family isn’t having a funeral or memorial, consider doing something special to honor her memory instead, like looking at old photographs or listening to her favorite music. [2] X Trustworthy Source Child Mind Institute Nonprofit organization providing evidence-based care for children with mental health and learning disorders and their families Go to source If you’re a minor, it will depend on your age and be up to your parents to determine whether you’re allowed to attend the funeral or memorial service. If you have a desire to attend, express your opinion to your parents. They can explain what will happen at the service and determine if you will feel comfortable attending. If you can’t attend the service for whatever reason, don’t feel guilty. Your grandmother knows you love her, and she would understand why you couldn’t be there."

      "content": "Try to come to terms with her death. Sometimes, it’s hard to accept that our loved ones are really gone, but doing so is an important step to healing and coping. For some, this may be something that happens naturally over time. Others may find it helpful to ask questions about their grandmother’s passing or about death in general. It may also help to take a moment and think about how your life will be different moving forward. [3] X Research source If you’re an adult, it may be up to you to explain death to children so they can accept their grandmother’s passing. While older children (above the age of 9 or so) will likely understand the finality of death and that everyone dies, really young kids, around 5 or 6, often think in literal terms. It may be best to avoid saying something like “Grandma went to sleep,” as this could make them worry that the same thing will happen to them when they go to sleep. [4] X Research source If you’re a parent, reassure kids that they were not responsible for their grandma’s passing, as some children fear a death happened because of something they did. For example, the child might think Grandma died because they didn’t visit her often enough."
