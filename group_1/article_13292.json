      "content": "Check for negative numbers and ones. This method covers problems in the form log b ⁡ ( x ) log b ⁡ ( a ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\log _{b}(x)}{\\log _{b}(a)}}} . However, it does not work for a few special cases: [1] X Research source The log of a negative number is undefined for all bases (such as log ⁡ ( − 3 ) {\\displaystyle \\log(-3)} or log 4 ⁡ ( − 5 ) {\\displaystyle \\log _{4}(-5)} ). Write \"no solution.\" The log of zero is also undefined for all bases. If you see a term such as ln ⁡ ( 0 ) {\\displaystyle \\ln(0)} , write \"no solution.\" The log of one in any base ( log ⁡ ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\log(1)} ) always equals zero, since x 0 = 1 {\\displaystyle x^{0}=1} for all values of x . Replace that logarithm with 1 instead of using the method below. If the two logarithms have different bases, such as l o g 3 ( x ) l o g 4 ( a ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {log_{3}(x)}{log_{4}(a)}}} , and you cannot simplify either one into an integer, the problem is not feasible to solve by hand."

      "content": "Convert the expression into one logarithm. Assuming you did not find any of the exceptions above, you can now simplify the problem into one logarithm. To do this, use the formula log b ⁡ ( x ) log b ⁡ ( a ) = log a ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\log _{b}(x)}{\\log _{b}(a)}}=\\log _{a}(x)} . [2] X Research source Example 1: Solve the problem log ⁡ 16 log ⁡ 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\log {16}}{\\log {2}}}} . Start by converting this into one logarithm using the formula above: log ⁡ 16 log ⁡ 2 = log 2 ⁡ ( 16 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\log {16}}{\\log {2}}}=\\log _{2}(16)} . This formula is the \"change of base\" formula, derived from basic logarithmic properties."

Remember, to solve log a ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\log _{a}(x)} , think \" a ? = x {\\displaystyle a^{?}=x} \" or \"What exponent can I raise a by to get x ?\" It's not always feasible to solve this without a calculator, but if you're lucky, you'll end up with an easily simplified logarithm. [3] X Research source Example 1 (cont.): Rewrite log 2 ⁡ ( 16 ) {\\displaystyle \\log _{2}(16)} as 2 ? = 16 {\\displaystyle 2^{?}=16} . The value of \"?\" is the answer to the problem. You may need to find it by trial and error: 2 2 = 2 ∗ 2 = 4 {\\displaystyle 2^{2}=2*2=4} 2 3 = 4 ∗ 2 = 8 {\\displaystyle 2^{3}=4*2=8} 2 4 = 8 ∗ 2 = 16 {\\displaystyle 2^{4}=8*2=16} 16 is what you were looking for, so log 2 ⁡ ( 16 ) {\\displaystyle \\log _{2}(16)} = 4 ."

You'll need a calculator if you need the answer for a practical purpose. If you're solving problems in math class, your teacher most likely expects you to leave the answer as a logarithm. Here's another example using this method on a more difficult problem: [4] X Research source Example 2: What is log 3 ⁡ ( 58 ) log 3 ⁡ ( 7 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\log _{3}(58)}{\\log _{3}(7)}}} ? Convert this into one logarithm: log 3 ⁡ ( 58 ) log 3 ⁡ ( 7 ) = log 7 ⁡ ( 58 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\log _{3}(58)}{\\log _{3}(7)}}=\\log _{7}(58)} . (Notice that the 3 in each initial log disappears; this is true for any base.) Rewrite as 7 ? = 58 {\\displaystyle 7^{?}=58} and test possible values of ?: 7 2 = 7 ∗ 7 = 49 {\\displaystyle 7^{2}=7*7=49} 7 3 = 49 ∗ 7 = 343 {\\displaystyle 7^{3}=49*7=343} Since 58 falls between these two numbers, log 7 ⁡ ( 58 ) {\\displaystyle \\log _{7}(58)} has no integer answer. Leave your answer as log 7 ⁡ ( 58 ) {\\displaystyle \\log _{7}(58)} ."
