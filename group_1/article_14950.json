      "content": "Take a wide stance. The further your feet are apart from one another the more range of motion you will have. [2] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview. 24 February 2022. This large range of motion will translate into power behind your swing.

      "content": "Grip the club high. Use leverage to put more power behind your shot. Hold the club higher up, towards the end of the grip, to maximize this leverage. [4] X Research source Gripping the club up high allows for power at the cost of accuracy. Make adjustments to your own body and club size to find the best grip."

      "content": "Put the ball low in your stance. Stand so that your golf ball is only a few inches behind your left toe. Placing the ball here will result in less swing range and more control.
