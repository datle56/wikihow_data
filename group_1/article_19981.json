      "content": "Wait for any temporary bans to resolve themselves. It actually appears to be pretty rare that Facebook permanently bans users from Facebook Dating. If you’ve been hit with a 1-, 3-, 7-, or 30-day ban, the best option is to simply wait it out. [2] X Research source In the meantime, a short pause on Facebook Dating could represent a good opportunity to try out Tinder , Hinge , or some other dating platform!"

Poke around and look for the “Appeal” button (it appears to be in a different location depending on the browser/platform). Select that and fill out the form to request an appeal for your Facebook Dating ban. [3] X Research source You can also try emailing appeals@fb.com. Explain your case and ask for an appeal to your ban. If your ban is due to content you shared, follow Facebook’s guide on appealing to the Oversight Board here ."

[4] X Research source You may think that it’s okay to delete or deactivate your normal profile, since your Facebook Dating profile is actually a totally different profile/account, but Facebook will automatically cut you off from its Dating platform if you do that. [5] X Research source If you’ve reactivated your profile, you’ll see that you’re still banned from Facebook Dating. Don’t worry! This is a temporary ban and you’ll regain access soon."

Just make sure you use a slightly different name (turn John into Johnny, for example) and don’t use any photos that appear on your other profile.

We have no clue why this appears to work, but it looks like some users have had success getting around Facebook Dating bans by changing the phone number associated with the account. Go into your Facebook account and click on your profile on the top right. Select “Settings” then “Mobile.” Add a new phone number and try deleting your old one. If you don’t have a second phone number, you can try downloading an app (like Sideline or 2ndLine) that will provide you with a second number exclusively for situations like this."

Again, it’s unclear why this works, but some users have gotten around Facebook Dating bans by simply logging into their account from a new phone (this likely works in scenarios when you’re shadowbanned, but we’re not sure about full account bans). If you have a second phone you can borrow it’s worth testing this out! If you’re due for an upgrade with your phone carrier, now is as good a time as any to get a new phone!"

Members of Meta Verified get access to live customer support chat (which normal Facebook members do not), so you can plead your case to an actual agent. It might work, it might not, but it’s basically your only shot at this point."
