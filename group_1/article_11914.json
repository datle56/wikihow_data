      "content": "Choose the right time and place to talk. Talking about relationship problems is never easy. If your boyfriend is becoming obsessive, however, it's important the issue be addressed. Let your boyfriend know you want to talk. Make sure to pick a time and place that will help a conversation run smoothly. [1] X Research source If possible, choose a neutral setting. You don't want anyone to feel they have the home team advantage. A quiet coffee shop may be a good place to talk. Choose a time free of outside constraints."

      "content": "Plan what you need to say. Going into the conversation, you should get a sense of what you want to communicate. It may help to jot down your thoughts or talk them over with a friend or family member. Have a few sentences ready to go that best express your frustrations and concerns. [2] X Research source Do not over plan, however. Leave some room for flexibility. If you write down everything you want to say word-per-word, you risk sounding scripted. Plan a few sentences that express what you need to express. However, go into the conversation without strict expectations. You can also try practicing what you want to say while looking into a mirror."

      "content": "Make it clear to your boyfriend what behaviors are inappropriate. It's vital to set boundaries when dealing with an obsessive boyfriend. Lay out, with no uncertainty, what behaviors you feel are inappropriate. You boyfriend needs to know where the lines are in the relationship. Behaviors that make you feel unsafe are especially important to address. Make it clear to your boyfriend you will not stay in a relationship where you are habitually made to feel unsafe. Behaviors that make you feel frightened or uncomfortable are not okay in a romantic relationship. Let your partner know that, while you understand he has issues with trust or jealousy, he needs to find appropriate means to express these issues. Figure out what behaviors bother you, and tell him they are no longer acceptable. Keep in mind that obsessive behavior is often present along with other abusive behavior patterns."

      "title": "Use \"I\"-statements.",
      "content": "Use \"I\"-statements. \"I\"-statements are statements phrased in a way that minimizes blame. When you use an \"I\"-statement, you focus primarily on your own feelings, and how a person's behavior affects your feelings. Rather than saying a behavior is objectively right or wrong, you're telling someone how that behavior affects you on a personal and subjective level. [3] X Research source An \"I\"-statement has three parts. It begins with \"I feel,\" after which you immediately state your emotion. Then, you explain the behavior that led to that emotion. Lastly, you say why you feel the way you do. Without \"I\"-statements, certain sentiments can sound accusatory."

Work on setting new boundaries that respect both you and your boyfriend's emotional needs. Be willing to compromise in areas that don't violate your needs. For example, you could agree to allow your boyfriend to accompany you to certain social events if it doesn't bother you. Encourage your boyfriend to take steps to be a better partner himself, like asking him to seek the help of a therapist."

      "content": "Consider your boyfriend's concerns. Empathy, or at least some understanding, can help a conversation run smoothly. Think about what your boyfriend may want from you, and what you're willing to give. What expectations does he have that feel like reasonable requests? Where do you need him to meet you halfway? Recognize what you're not willing to give. You should never give in to a request that violates your sense of integrity and security. If something makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, your boyfriend needs to cease that behavior. However, there may be things you can do to help assuage your boyfriend's worries, like checking in more frequently and allowing him to occasionally come with you to events."

      "content": "Consider how much contact you have with family and friends. Obsessive boyfriends, particularly those that are emotionally abusive, want their partners all to themselves. If your boyfriend is limiting your contact with others, this is not a healthy relationship. [5] X Research source Does your boyfriend not like you to be on the phone or Facebook when he's around? Does he denigrate your personal relationships? Does he try to exert control over who you do and do not see? Your boyfriend may try to make it sound like he has your best interests at heart when trying to limit your contact with others. For example, he may say things like, \"I'm not sure Alyssa is a good friend for you. She's really wild, and I feel like she'll get you in trouble.\" In a loving and healthy relationship, partners support one another's friendships. Your boyfriend should want you to have positive relationships with a variety of people outside your romantic relationship."

In a new relationship, it's normal to spend a lot of time together. You may not see your friends as frequently during the first few months of a romantic relationship. However, if your boyfriend expects this intense level of contact longer than a few months, it may be a bad sign. Your boyfriend may try to romanticize this attachment. He may say things like, \"You're my everything\" or \"You're my world.\" While such statements sound sweet and romantic, they are not necessarily healthy or sustainable long-term."

Your boyfriend may be bringing issues from the past into his present relationship. Ask him if he's been hurt in the past, and if there's anything you can do to help him move forward. [7] X Research source Ask your boyfriend what his home life was like growing up. If there was a lot of instability in his household, he may seek stability in a romantic relationship. Ask about past relationships. If your boyfriend was with someone who cheated on him or abandoned him in the past, this may be driving his future obsession. Remember, while your boyfriend's past can help you have more empathy, it does not justify his behavior. Make it clear that, while you understand where he's coming from, he needs to change his behavior. Say something like, \"I get that your father abandoned you as a child, but you need to accept I'm not your father and our relationship is different.\""

      "content": "Take your power back. Once you've evaluated the relationship, and had a frank talk with your boyfriend, you need to take some of your power back. Do not make decisions out of fear of your boyfriend's reaction. Decide what you need to do for yourself and your own sense of fulfillment. Reassert your boundaries when necessary. If your boyfriend gives you a hard time about answering a text in front him, say something like, \"We talked about this. It's important I have my space and you need to respect that.\" Be ready to walk away from the relationship if things don't change.
