      "content": "Wait for your symptoms to go away on their own. In many cases, lichen planus will go away on its own over time. Most people will only have outbreaks for a year or 2 and then will have no further symptoms ever. Because the cause of this disease is still relatively unknown, most people have to simply wait for the symptoms to go away on their own.

Steroids should only be used for 2-4 weeks."
