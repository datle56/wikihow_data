      "content": "Make sure you have an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence is an ordered series of numbers, in which the change in numbers is constant. [1] X Research source This method only works if your set of numbers is an arithmetic sequence. To determine whether you have an arithmetic sequence, find the difference between the first few and the last few numbers. Ensure that the difference is always the same. For example, the series 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 is an arithmetic sequence, because the difference between each term is constant (5)."

Otherwise, if you know the first term, last term, and common difference (the difference between each term) you can use a formula to find the number of terms. Let this number be represented by the variable n {\\displaystyle n} . [2] X Research source For example, if you are calculating the sum of the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, n = 5 {\\displaystyle n=5} , since there are 5 terms in the sequence."
