      "content": "Fill out a deposit slip . There should be a stack of slips along with pens at a table. Deposit slips are about the same size as a check. You can also request a deposit slip from the teller, but the process will move more quickly if you fill out the deposit slip ahead of time. Write in your account number and the amount of the check on the deposit slip. There should also be space for requesting cash back."

      "title": "Endorse",
      "content": "Endorse your check. You can endorse a check by signing on one of the gray lines on the back. The back of most checks say “Don’t write below this line” because the bank documents the transaction beneath this line. If two names are on the face of the check, then one or both of you might need to sign. When the names are joined by an “and,” then both will sign. If the names are joined by an “or,” only one person needs to sign. [1] X Research source Sometimes, the bank teller might just take one person's name and deposit the check into their account and then wait for the other person who wrote the check to dispute any fraud charges (should it not be the right person)."

Don’t leave until you receive proof of deposit. Keep in mind that it can take 3-5 business days (or even up to 2 weeks) before you receive the money from your deposit. Banks sometimes decide to hold onto money for longer because they make interest for each day that they hold onto it, or because a large amount was deposited (and they have to ensure that it's not fraud)."
