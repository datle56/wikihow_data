      "title": "Keep calm.",
      "content": "Keep calm. [1] X Research source In communicating with a condescending person, try not to lose your temper, since this can make the situation worse. Before replying to the person, pause for a moment and take a deep breath. Tell yourself something like “I’m trying to point out a problem, but I’m going to stay calm and be civil.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest.",
      "content": "Be honest. If someone says something to you that is condescending, even in an offhand kind of way, don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself. [2] X Research source Let the person know that you feel talked down to, and that the condescension was uncalled for. Being honest is crucial if you want to deal with the situation. Otherwise, the person may not even realize that he or she is being condescending."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch your tone of voice.",
      "content": "Watch your tone of voice. Condescension is often primarily about one’s tone of voice. [3] X Research source In other words, it’s not always what a person says, but how it is said that matters. Be careful not to reply to a condescending person with more condescension. This means avoiding sarcasm, muttering things under your breath, raising your voice, etc."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice non-defensive communication.",
      "content": "Practice non-defensive communication. [4] X Research source To deal with difficult people, you have to choose your words very carefully. Avoid saying things that are defensive, since that can validate the condescending person and ruin the chances of resolving the situation. Luckily, you can usually turn defensive statements into more constructive ones. For instance: Suppose someone says something condescending to you, such as “Well, if I were you, I’d just settle on a career and move on with my life.” You might be tempted to respond with something like “You’re wrong! And stay out of my life.” Instead, try saying something more productive, like “I understand you see it that way. Let me explain why it’s more complicated than that…”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Determine what kind of relationship you have with the person.",
      "content": "Determine what kind of relationship you have with the person. [5] X Research source If you are dealing with a person who has a consistent habit of saying condescending things to you, stop and consider your relationship with that person in general. Try to determine why it is that you find the remarks condescending, based on the kind of relationship you have. With this knowledge, you will be able to communicate more effectively. For instance, if you have a relationship where you feel like you owe a debt to the other person, the pressure of the debt may cause the feelings of condescension. Settle the debt, or be open with the other person about how you feel."

    {
      "title": "Recognize emotional blackmail.",
      "content": "Recognize emotional blackmail. [6] X Research source Sometimes, people will use condescension to manipulate others into doing something for them. If a friend or partner says belittling things to you, for instance, he or she might actually fear losing you. The condescending comments would be meant to make you feel inferior and therefore dependent on that person. If you recognize this kind of behavior, communicate calmly and openly communicate with your friend/partner about it."

      "title": "Nod and smile, when all else fails.",
      "content": "Nod and smile, when all else fails. [7] X Research source Sometimes, the quickest and easiest way to deal with a condescending person is just to move on.

      "title": "Seek professional help, if necessary.",
      "content": "Seek professional help, if necessary. If someone’s condescending comments are causing serious damage to a relationship that you value, don’t be afraid to ask for help.

    {
      "title": "Recognize condescending behavior when you see it.",
      "content": "Recognize condescending behavior when you see it. Things like shouting, yelling, belittling comments, are all obvious signs of condescension. In the workplace, however, people are sometimes condescending in more subtle ways, such as talking about people behind their backs or trash talking in the form of jokes. If you recognize this behavior, point it out. You can also help to avoid it in the workplace by fostering an environment that discourages gossip, making jokes about coworkers, etc."

      "title": "Ignore it and move on.",
      "content": "Ignore it and move on. [8] X Research source If a person makes a condescending comment without it being part of a pattern of behavior, the most efficient and effective thing to do may be to just move on. Everyone says stupid things now and then, or has a bad day, or unintentionally lashes out at someone. If the condescending comment was just an isolated comment, try to be forgiving and get on with things.

[11] X Research source To deal with a condescending coworker or supervisor most efficiently and effectively, ask to set up a personal meeting to discuss the issue.

      "content": "Speak up. [12] X Research source If someone's condescension is interfering with your ability to do your job, then you need to call the person out. Without anger, courteously but directly respond to the behavior. Try something like, \"I really appreciate your input, I know you have a lot of experience in this area.
