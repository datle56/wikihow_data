      "content": "Submerge your finger for up to 20 minutes for pain relief. A bruised finger can be super painful, but you can get some relief simply by cooling it down. Fill a bowl with cold water and stick your hand in it for up to 20 minutes at a time. You can soak your injured finger as many times as you like, but try not to do it for more than 20 minutes at a time to avoid constricting your blood flow too much.

      "content": "Icing your finger can help reduce the pain and swelling. Wrap the ice pack in a clean cloth so it’s not in direct contact with your skin, which could damage it. Hold the ice pack gently against the injured area to help relieve your pain and reduce any swelling, which can speed up the healing process.

      "title": "Elevation can help reduce pressure and swelling in your finger.",
      "content": "Elevation can help reduce pressure and swelling in your finger. Try to rest your injured finger as much as you can to avoid further injuring it. Keep it raised above the height of your heart, which can limit the amount of blood that flows to the region to keep the swelling from getting worse. [3] X Research source For instance, you can prop up your hand on a pillow when you lie down."

      "content": "Your finger may start to swell. Though it may not start to swell at first, if you slam your finger hard enough, it’s very likely that it will later. If it swells up too much, it could be difficult to remove any rings you’re wearing, so it’s best to remove them as soon as you can. [5] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital.

      "content": "Take a walk, think about something else, or do whatever you can. If you’re really frustrated after injuring your finger, you can reduce the pain by taking your mind off of it for a bit. Do whatever works for you. You can take a short walk around the block, focus on something you need to do later, or whatever you can use to distract yourself. It may help settle your mind."

If you slammed your finger so hard that it actually split the skin and started bleeding, you need to address the bleeding first. Take some sterile gauze and apply it directly to the bleeding area. Keep applying firm pressure for at least 10 minutes or until the bleeding stops. [6] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital.

Wash the wounded area with nice, warm water and soap to clean it up well. [7] X Research source It may sting to wash any cuts on your fingers at first, but it’s really worth it in the long run."

      "content": "It can help prevent infections and protect the wounded area. Use a simple, over-the-counter (OTC) antibiotic ointment and apply it generously to the open wound. Then, take a bandage (like a Band-Aid) and wrap it securely, but not too tight over the area to keep it protected and to help it heal. [8] X Research source You don’t need to use an antibiotic ointment or a bandage if you don’t have any cuts or scrapes. If the skin is open and won’t stop bleeding you need to see a doctor."

Before you react with anger or start shouting, take a quick moment to just breathe. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold the breath for a few seconds, then slowly release it. Take a few more breaths to calm yourself down before you address the injury.

For instance, you can picture the word “calm” or “relaxed” in your mind while you take your big breaths."

Your doctor will be able to examine your finger to see how serious the damage is. They may splint your finger and prescribe pain medication.
