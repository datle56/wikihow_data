      "content": "Have a discussion with your partner. All relationships — long-distance or not — benefit from open communication. Before committing to be long-distance, you and your partner should have a serious discussion about how the relationship will work. What are your hopes and expectations for the relationship? What are your fears? How often do you expect to check in with each other? Do you expect to communicate with each other in some way every day? How often will you visit each other in person? What's realistic given your budget and responsibilities (i.e. school/work schedule)? Will you see other people while you're apart, or will you be monogamous? How will you satisfy your physical needs/desires from afar?"

      "content": "Ensure that you both feel secure in your relationship. You can do this by talking about your relationship but also through daily actions. One great way to do this is to keep your partner updated on your everyday life, including the people you interact with. Keeping your partner updated on your daily life will help them feel more involved in your world and your daily life. This will help them feel more secure in the important role they play in your life. [1] X Research source Consider your partner's feelings when making choices. For example, going out for late-night drinks with a cute member of the opposite sex or an ex when your partner is halfway across the world might make even a secure partner a bit nervous."

      "content": "Figure out your end game. Chances are that you ultimately hope to be in the same place as your partner. Being clear about your end goals will help keep you and your partner committed to the relationship. Discussing the end game of your relationship will also help ensure that you and your partner are on the same page. Maybe you're hoping to get married in a few years if all goes well. If you're both just enjoying an international fling, that's okay too. It's just important that you both know that, otherwise you might have one person pining over the other while the other is happily dating around, which isn't fair."

      "content": "Make plans. Even if these plans don't go ahead, talk about your future. Where would you like to visit with your partner and what would you like to do when you're there? Talking about the future can break the distance and make you feel more positive that the relationship is heading somewhere. Planning a trip together can be a lot of fun. Make a shared Google doc or a Pinterest page detailing the things you'd like to do on your trip. You might even put together an Itinerary together."

      "content": "Establish your methods of communication. People in long-distance relationships are no longer limited to snail mail and pricey telephone calls. Here are some apps that make keeping in touch easier and more affordable: [2] X Research source WhatsApp, Viber, and Skype allow you to send messages and files, and call each other from anywhere in the world as long as you have an Internet connection. Couple, Avocado, and Kahnoodle also allow you to chat and send pictures and videos, but their focus on romance sets them apart from other apps. You can “thumb kiss” your partner with Couple, send virtual hugs and kisses with Avocado, and “fill your partner's love tank” with affectionate acts on Kahnoodle. HeyDay allows you to keep a journal as you go about your day. You can take photos and add captions, and can even track where you've been through the day, then share your day with your partner to help them feel more like they were there with you."

Things will be different for each relationship, but this advice seems to be unanimous: at the very least, say good morning and good night to your partner each day. [3] X Research source It doesn't have to be long chats — just a simple “Good morning beautiful!” or “Night night!” is perfect. It's just important to schedule some time each day to be virtually close with each other, no matter how long that time is. [4] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 1620 wikiHow readers how they’re most likely to get to know their long-distance partner, and only 8% said by imagining being my partner .

      "content": "Make sure you have a good support network. Talk to the people you're close to, namely your friends and family. Let them know about your situation, and tell them how you feel about it. Maintaining a good support network will help you stay strong when you're feeling sad and lonely, and missing your partner. You can even talk out some of your insecurities with your closest friend or family member when you're feeling low. It's okay to talk to your partner about your insecurities too, but try to avoid it unless they've done something to make you feel insecure. This will help keep things lighter and more positive when you talk to your partner, which is important since you have limited time with each other."

Here are some keys attributes of high-quality, stable long-distance relationships: The people in them have a positive attitude towards long-distance relationships and do not feel that their relationship is automatically doomed just because of the distance. People in them worry less and focus on the positive. People in them feel more certain about their relationships. Greater distances seem to result in higher long-distance satisfaction, too.

      "content": "Come to terms with your new relationship. Whether your partner has to move away due to work or it's a new relationship that has formed via the Internet, you need to realize that you are separated by distance, for now. Take some time to reflect upon this. The most difficult thing to deal with is the fact you can't see or touch your partner whenever you want to. It might hurt, but you need to come to terms with it, otherwise you'll just be unhappy all the time, making for an unhappy relationship."

      "content": "Accept what you have. If you love your partner just be thankful at the fact that you have them, even if they aren't physically with you right now. Find things to be grateful for, rather than focusing on the negative (namely, the distance). For example, maybe you're building stronger communications with your partner, and getting to know them on a deeper level. By focusing on the positive things about your partner and your relationship, you'll feel more in love with them and more positive about the relationship, meaning you'll boost your chances of staying together despite the distance. [7] X Research source Let the security of your relationship help you focus on other areas of your life, such as work, school, or personal goals.

Being positive means keeping things light when you talk to your partner — talking about the little things that happened throughout your day, for example. [8] X Research source It's okay to talk to your partner about any real concerns you have. You should be positive, but you shouldn't pretend things are okay when they aren't. If your partner does something to hurt your feelings, it's important that you let them know so that you both can work out a plan to avoid that happening in the future. Be positive about yourself, too. Studies show that people feel happier and more satisfied in relationships where their partners keep their doubts about themselves and the relationship to themselves.

Being realistic about what you can and can't do in the relationship will keep things healthier in the long run. [10] X Research source As an example, if you know you can't afford to see each other more than twice a year, be honest and upfront about this, otherwise it might become a problem later in the relationship. Being realistic also means accepting that there will be times you'll miss your partner, or times when you won't be able to talk to them when you really need to. Being realistic will help you feel less helpless in such situations. This is where having a good support network will come in handy."

[12] X Research source Studies of “adult attachment style” show that if you feel secure in your relationship, you are more likely to feel comfortable in a long-distance relationship whereas if you feel insecure, you'll be more vulnerable to the negative effects of distance. [13] X Research source If you're always around your partner, you might not even realize you're insecure in your relationship until they go away. If you're not securely attached, you'll feel so anxious and depressed when your partner is not around, that you may even find it difficult to go about your daily tasks. [14] X Research source"

Keeping busy will also help you dwell less on what your partner is doing/how you aren't together. Being in a long distance relationship can improve the overall relationship over time because it helps both partners learn how to live independently while also being in a relationship. Even after you're in the same place, both of you will know how to be an individual who happens to also be in a partnership."
