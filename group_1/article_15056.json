      "content": "Use oil paints made from iron oxides for earth tones. Certain minerals used in oil paints dry faster than others. If you need to complete a painting in a short time frame, try using earth tones. Many earth colors use paints made from iron oxides, which can dry up to several days faster than other pigments.

      "title": "Look for paints made with linseed oil.",
      "content": "Look for paints made with linseed oil. The drying time of oil paints can vary based on the oil which was used. Linseed oil dries faster than walnut oil, which itself dries faster than poppy oil. Paints made from linseed oil can speed your painting's drying time significantly, and they're easily found at most art supply stores."

[4] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. Glue chalk gesso is good for oil paintings because it will absorb some of the oil from the base layers, helping the painting to dry faster. Dip a primer or sponge brush into the gesso and apply it to the canvas in a thin layer. Allow it to dry thoroughly before moving on to oil paint."

      "content": "Combine linseed oil with the paint on your palette. Since linseed oil dries faster than other kinds of oil, mixing a little extra linseed oil with the paint on your palette can help speed the drying time of your painting."

      "title": "Mix your paint with a solvent like turpentine or Liquin.",
      "content": "Mix your paint with a solvent like turpentine or Liquin. There are a number of products available which are designed to thin oil paint and help it to dry faster. Turpentine is the most traditional drying medium, but alkyd mediums such as Liquin are also popular. Different solvents may produce slightly different textures to your paint, so experiment to see which one you prefer. Solvents can be hazardous, so be sure to follow any label instructions and handle these products with care."

      "title": "Paint on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Paint on a flat surface. When you paint on a textured canvas, the oil paint can build up in the crevices, creating a thicker layer that takes longer to dry. Look for a canvas with a smooth surface, or paint on another surface like a board. If you're looking for a creative project that will still dry quickly, try applying oil paints to a copper pot. Oil paints oxidize more quickly on copper, although it will give a slightly green look to your painting.

      "content": "Apply a base layer in a fast-drying paint. Using a fast-drying paint for your base layer can help all the rest of the painting dry more quickly as well. Paints containing metal irons like lead, cobalt, and copper tend to dry the fastest.

      "content": "Paint quickly using thin layers. Oil paint is best applied in layers, but if you apply a thick layer first, it can increase the drying time for each subsequent layer. [8] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. Instead, build up your painting from the thinnest layers to the thickest. For instance, if you have a cat in your painting and you want to use thick paint to make its fur look more realistic, you would apply that last."

      "title": "Minimize the number of layers you use.",
      "content": "Minimize the number of layers you use. If you're really on a time crunch and you need your painting to dry fast, choose a simple subject that you can paint by applying just a few thin washes, or layers, to your painting, with detail added in at the end. The more layers you apply, the longer the paint will need to oxidize."

      "title": "Finish the painting with a heat gun.",
      "content": "Finish the painting with a heat gun. Heat guns can help bake the oils in your painting to help it to dry faster. However, if the heat is too high, the paint may crack or turn yellowish. For best results, keep your heat gun set to no more than 130 째F (54 째C). Hold the heat gun a few inches away from the painting and move it slowly so the heat can penetrate the paints. The nozzle of the heat gun gets very hot, so be sure not to touch it or to allow it to touch the painting."

      "title": "Allow your painting to dry in a large, well-lit room with low humidity.",
      "content": "Allow your painting to dry in a large, well-lit room with low humidity. Oil paints need time to oxidize, which is a process in which the paint reacts with air to harden. Other paints dry when the water in them evaporates, but oxidation is actually a change in the paint's chemistry. Oxidation best occurs in a room with plenty of natural light, low humidity, and good air circulation.

      "title": "Use a dehumidifier",
      "content": "Use a dehumidifier if you live in a humid climate. Oil paint will oxidize faster in dry air. If you live in a humid climate, get a small dehumidifier and place it near your painting. This will remove excess humidity from the air, helping speed the drying time of the oil paint."

      "title": "Circulate the air in the room with a fan.",
      "content": "Circulate the air in the room with a fan. Pointing a fan at your oil painting won't help significantly speed the drying time in the same way as it would a watercolor painting, but having good circulation in the room will help the oxidation process to happen more quickly. This is because oils actually take oxygen from the air during oxidation, so circulating the air provides the paint with the oxygen it needs to dry. You can use either a box fan or a ceiling fan, and a low or medium setting should be adequate.

      "title": "Keep the room warm.",
      "content": "Keep the room warm. Oil paints dry faster in a warm atmosphere. The temperature in the room where your painting is drying should be at least 70 째F (21 째C), but the warmer you can get it, the better. Keep track of the temperature in the room by using a thermostat or by placing a digital thermometer near your painting. There's not really a temperature that's too hot for oil paints, but try to keep the room as warm as you can while still keeping yourself comfortable."
