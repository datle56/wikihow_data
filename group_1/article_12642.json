      "content": "Collect your tools. Since the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the shadows it casts will always move in the opposite direction, and you can observe their motions to determine directions. For this method, you will need: [1] X Research source A straight stick that’s between two and five feet long A straight stick that’s about one foot long Two rocks, stones, or other objects (heavy enough that wind won’t blow them around)."

      "title": "Connect the dots.",
      "content": "Connect the dots. Either draw a straight line on the ground between the two marks or use the other stick to connect the dots and make a straight line. The shadow moves in the opposite direction of the sun, so this line denotes the east–west line: the first dot represents west and the second dot represents east. Note that this method is only approximate, and can be off by 23 degrees or so at the equator on the first day of winter or summer. The variance will be more the farther you get from the equator. For instance, the sun will rise about 33 degrees north of east on the first day of summer at 42 degrees latitude in the northern hemisphere and 33 degrees south of east on the first day of winter. It rises due east on the first day of spring and fall all over the world. [2] X Research source"

This method is similar to the stick method, but it’s more reliable partly because it uses a longer observation time, but mostly because it uses equal times before and after local noon.

At noon, the sun can point you in the general direction of north and south, and consequently east and west, but it will not tell you due north or due south. In the Northern Hemisphere, walking directly toward the sun at noon will lead you south, while walking directly away from the sun will lead you north. In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite is true: toward the sun will lead you north, and away from the sun will lead you south."

Face the sunset and you are facing west; north will be on your right and south will be on your left. The location of sunrise and sunset only provide an approximate idea of direction 363 days of the year, because the sun rises due east and sets due west only on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (the first day of spring and fall).

      "content": "Look at how vegetation is growing. While using vegetation to determine direction isn’t an exact science or a precise method, oftentimes it can give you a basic idea of which direction’s which. Living north of the equator, the sun is usually in the southern part of the sky, and the opposite is true south of the equator. This means that leaves and foliage will tend to be thicker and denser on the southern side of a tree or bush. [5] X Research source The opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere, where vegetation will be more lush on the northern side. Many guidebooks will note that moss only grows on the north side of a tree in the Northern Hemisphere, but this is not true. However, while moss can grow on all sides of a tree, it is true that it will often be denser on the side that is shadier (the north in the Northern Hemisphere and the south in the Southern Hemisphere)."

The sun can be used in conjunction with a non-digital wristwatch to provide an approximate idea of the cardinal directions if you find yourself lost in the woods but at least have a wristwatch. In the Northern Hemisphere, point the hour hand on your watch at the sun. South will be halfway between 12 o’clock and the hour hand. In the Southern Hemisphere, align 12 o’clock on the watch with the sun, and the midway point between that and the hour hand will point north. [6] X Research source When you are facing north, east is on your right and west is on your left. When you are facing south, east is on your left and west is on your right. During daylight saving time, use one o’clock instead of 12 o’clock on the watch. [7] X Research source For this method to work, your watch must be set for the correct time. It can also have a margin of error of about 35 degrees, so this method is only reliable for an approximate idea of direction. [8] X Research source"

Polaris, or the North Star, is not one of the brightest stars in the night sky (it clocks in at 48th brightest). It is, however, the brightest star between the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia. Because it’s located in the sky around the North Pole, it doesn’t move around much, meaning it’s useful and accurate for navigating."

When you reach the terminus of that imaginary line, draw another imaginary line that extends to the ground. This is, in general, the direction of south. When the cross is lying horizontal, the \"four and a half times\" mark will be less than one degree from true south.

Many websites and books say that you can magnetize a metal needle by rubbing it with wool or silk, but that will only create static electricity, not magnetism."

These devices are also the most accurate, making them the most reliable methods. But, it’s important to note that when your compass points north, for instance, it’s pointing you in the direction of magnetic north, which is different from true north (the same goes for magnetic south versus true south). [13] X Research source As you spin around in different directions, the compass needle will spin as well, indicating which direction you are facing. A compass will give false readings around metal objects like keys, watches, and belt buckles. The same is true for magnetic objects, such as certain rocks or power lines."

[14] X Trustworthy Source Federal Aviation Administration U.S. government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation Go to source A GPS must be charged and have a working battery to be functional. It should also be initialized before use, so that it orients itself (knows where it is) and downloads the most current and accurate maps. Turn on your GPS, and allow it to load and acquire signal. Not only will the GPS have a compass you can use to determine which way is east, west, north, or south, but on its map it will also have an arrow that points in the direction you are facing. Your coordinates will appear at the top of the screen, also giving you your longitude and latitude. Because a GPS navigates using satellites, tall buildings, large trees, and other geographic structures can interfere with its signal."
