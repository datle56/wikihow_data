      "content": "Gather your checkbook. Then, look to the very back of your checkbook, behind all of your checks. That's where you'll find your slips. The deposit slip pages are usually of a different color than your checks, and have Deposit Ticket/Slip written above your name and address. If for some reason you can't locate your deposit slips, or you simply don't have any, go to your bank and ask a teller for more slips."

The same information should be present on your deposit slips. Look to the upper left side corner of your slips to make sure your information is displayed correctly. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Locate your account number.",
      "content": "Locate your account number. Much like your name, address, and sometimes phone number, your deposit slips should have your account number printed on them. Look to the bottom of the slip, and locate two separate strings of numbers. The first set of numbers is your routing number, and the second set is your account number. [2] X Research source If your information isn't already displayed on your deposit slip, you need to fill it in. Follow the next step."

      "title": "Write your name, account number and date.",
      "content": "Write your name, account number and date. It's unlikely that your slip won't already contain this information. But if it doesn't, or you got a blank slip from your bank, make sure to fill in this information. You'll see a few blank lines on the upper left side corner. Fill in your name, the date, and your account number. [3] X Research source If you're unsure about your account number, you might be able to look it up online through your bank's site. You can also go to your bank, and ask a teller to provide that information. Use black or blue ink, rather than a pencil or colored ink."

      "title": "Fill in the date.",
      "content": "Fill in the date. If you've already taken care of writing the date on the slip, you can skip this step. If your deposit slip already contained your personal information, look to the left side of the slip. Write the date of when you wish to use the slip in the space provided, next to Date.

      "title": "Sign the slip.",

These lines might be labeled as Checks with blank lines in front of the box lines, or not at all. In any case, the lines following the Cash space are reserved for deposits made in the form of a check. [6] X Research source Write the check number(s) in the blank lines, and the amount in the box lines. It can help to list your checks in ascending or descending order."

      "title": "Fill in the subtotal.",

This is where you write down your cash deposit amount plus your combined check deposit amount. Add the sums up, then write it down next to Subtotal. [7] X Research source Double-check your math to make sure that your balance equals the balance on the deposit slip. The bank teller isn't going to do the math again for youâ€”the back end of the bank is going to make the adjustment, which makes things complicated."

If you entered cash to receive from the deposit, subtract that amount from the Subtotal. Then, write down the amount on the very last line labeled as Net Deposit."
