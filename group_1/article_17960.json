      "title": "Lay the shirt on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Lay the shirt on a flat surface. Find a flat, smooth surface, like a laundry table. [1] X Research source Position the shirt in the middle of the surface with the button-side (front) facing down. Stretch out the sleeves to each side. Make sure that the edges of the shirt do not fall off the sides of the surface. [2] X Research source Fully button up the shirt from top to bottom. Button up the cuffs as well. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the sleeves back.",
      "content": "Fold the sleeves back. Grab each sleeve and fold it to the middle of the back of the shirt (the button-free side that is currently facing upwards). Try to keep each sleeve horizontal. This will make the cuffs overlap in the middle center of the shirt. [4] X Research source As you adjust the sleeves, be careful not to pull the side seams of the shirt towards the back. You are just folding the sleeves in at this point, not the core of the shirt. If you have a short-sleeved polo, you will still fold the sleeves toward the middle of the back of the shirt. However, the sleeves will not overlap in the middle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smooth the shirt out with your hands.",
      "content": "Smooth the shirt out with your hands. The key to folding any shirt, including polo style, is to run your hands over the fabric after every fold. This helps to smooth out the wrinkles and to ensure tight, secure folds. If you come upon a heavy wrinkle in the fabric, make minor adjustments until it disappears. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold in the sides of the shirt.",
      "content": "Fold in the sides of the shirt. With the front of the shirt still facing down, gently grasp one side of the shirt with both hands. Fold this side inwards until it touches the middle of the shirt’s back. Do the same thing with the other side. If you do this correctly, you should see a “V” at the top back of the shirt right below the collar. If you have a short-sleeved polo, this fold will help to keep your sleeves in place moving forward. Make sure to hold your sleeves in place as you complete this step or they may move around as you lift the sides to fold inwards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the shirt in half.",
      "content": "Fold the shirt in half. Keep the button-side of the shirt facing down. Grasp the bottom edge of the polo shirt. Fold the edge upwards until the shirt is essentially at half of the full length. When you are finished you want the bottom edge of the shirt to rest right at the lower edge of the collar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do an extra fold depending on the shirt’s length.",
      "content": "Do an extra fold depending on the shirt’s length. If your shirt is extra large or extra long, then a single bottom fold may not be enough. You may need to divide the length of the shirt into thirds or fourths, adding in 1 or 2 additional folds. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip and store.",
      "content": "Flip and store. Grab your folded shirt and flip it over. The collar should now face upwards. This is a great way to store your polo shirts, as it keeps the collars and sleeves crisp. It’s even safe to stack multiple shirts on top of one another for storage, as the pressure will keep any wrinkles at bay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Save space by rolling.",
      "content": "Save space by rolling. If you have a small closet or just a single drawer to use, then rolling is a good option. Many people also prefer to roll all of their clothes when packing suitcases, as it makes it easy to select outfits quickly. The downside of rolling is that it can leave polo shirts a bit wrinkled. Address this problem by giving yourself some time to steam a shirt after unrolling it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the shirt in from the bottom.",
      "content": "Fold the shirt in from the bottom. Lay your polo shirt on a flat surface with the buttons facing up. Grasp the bottom edge of the shirt and fold it upwards about 4 inches (10 cm). This will shorten the total length of the shirt and help you to create a tighter roll."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold in the sides.",
      "content": "Fold in the sides. Grab one side of your polo shirt, place the sleeve facing outward, and fold the fabric inward toward the center. Do the same thing with the other side of the shirt. This means that the outer edges of your shirt will now meet in the center with overlapping sleeves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start rolling from the collar.",
      "content": "Start rolling from the collar. Grab the collar in both of your hands and begin rolling downwards. Try to keep your hands firm on the fabric, so that the final roll is tight and secure. When you reach the bottom of the shirt, press lightly against the sides of the roll. The final roll should be around 6 inches (15 cm) in width."

    {
      "title": "Wash the shirt according to the instructions.",
      "content": "Wash the shirt according to the instructions. Locate the tag on your polo. It will probably be at the collar or on the inner side-seam. Read how to wash your polo and follow these directions exactly. For 100% cotton polos, this will usually mean washing them on a warm water setting. For mixed fabric blends, it is usually safer to go with a cold water setting. [7] X Research source It’s also okay to hand wash most polos, as long as you stick with the same suggested water temperature."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the shirt.",
      "content": "Dry the shirt. You really want to avoid shrinking your polos, so make sure that you follow the drying instructions as well. If you machine dry your polos, use the lowest heat setting. It’s better, though, to hang your polo shirts up on a drying rack until they are fully dry. This will keep your shirts looking the best for the longest period of time. [8] X Research source Be aware that drying your polos on a rack might make them look more wrinkly. However, this can be quickly fixed with a round of steaming or ironing."

      "title": "Remove any wrinkles with steaming or ironing.",
      "content": "Remove any wrinkles with steaming or ironing. Get out your ironing board and set your iron to a medium or low heat setting. Go over your polo with the iron, keeping it moving to prevent burning the fabric. Look at the tag for any additional instructions. Some polos need to be turned inside out before ironing. [9] X Research source You can also hang up your polo and use a steam machine to work out any wrinkles. Pass the steamer wand close to, but not touching, the fabric until it smooths out. Polo shirts have a tendency to get particularly wrinkly around the collar, so pay additional attention to this area. Also, make sure to reinsert any collar stays after you are finished steaming or ironing your shirt. [10] X Research source"
