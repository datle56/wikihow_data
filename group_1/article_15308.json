      "title": "Sharpie ink is soluble in alcohol.",
      "content": "Sharpie ink is soluble in alcohol. A great removal liquid is rubbing alcohol, says Mendes. Simply add a dab of the rubbing alcohol (or isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, if you have it) on a cotton ball or tissue and rub the stained surface until the Sharpie stain is gone. [1] X Research source Use on : Most surfaces, like plastic, glass, metal, wood, ceramic, and laminate. Always spot-test a bit of alcohol on the surface before using it all over—it can potentially damage delicate surfaces that react to alcohol. Warning : Alcohol is flammable, so use common sense and only apply it in small quantities and away from open flames."

      "content": "This is one of the easiest ways to remove Sharpie. And as a plus, it doesn’t require any chemicals. Simply scribble over the Sharpie mark with the dry erase board marker . Then, rub it off with a dry paper towel. All of the dry erase board marker remnants will be gone, and the Sharpie mark should start to disappear. [2] X Research source Use on : Smooth, non-porous surfaces like glass, ceramic, metal, and dry erase boards. Let the Sharpie mark dry before going over it with the dry erase marker. It may seem odd, but it helps to prevent smearing. It may take more than one application to remove all of the Sharpie. After about 3-5 times of repeating this, the mark should be entirely removed. Most dry erase markers are made with an alcohol-based solvent, which will help dissolve the Sharpie mark."

      "content": "Abrasive melamine sponges, like Magic Erasers , scrub off Sharpie ink. Mendes agrees that Magic Erasers are great for removing Sharpie stains. Simply dampen the sponge with water. Then, gently scrub the Sharpie stain with the sponge. Just keep scrubbing until the ink stain is gone. [3] X Research source Use on : Walls, tiles/ceramic, wood, plastic, and glass. Just be very gentle, as the sponge can lift the finish or seal from surfaces. You might also try using an ink pen eraser ."

      "content": "Hand sanitizer contains alcohol that can remove permanent marker. Simply get a tissue, paper towel, toilet paper, or cotton ball and add a squeeze of hand sanitizer on it. Ball up the paper (this spreads the sanitizer to almost all parts of the paper) and then scrub the Sharpie stain. [4] X Research source Use on : Most surfaces, like plastic, glass, metal, wood, ceramic, laminate, walls, and counters."

      "title": "Nail polish remover",
      "content": "Nail polish remover contains solvents that remove Sharpie ink. According to Mendes, nail polish remover works similarly to rubbing alcohol. She says to “dampen a cloth” or cotton ball with the nail polish remover and then “gently rub the stained area until the marker starts to lift” off. Use on : Most surfaces, like glass, wood, ceramic, laminate, metal, walls, and counters."

      "title": "Oily products, like WD-40 and Goo Gone, can remove tough stains.",
      "content": "Oily products, like WD-40 and Goo Gone , can remove tough stains. For stubborn Sharpie marks, Mendes suggests using WD-40 or Goo Gone. These products contain solvents and oils that help lift off ink stains. Simply spray the stain with either product and then wipe it with a cloth, paper towel, or cotton ball. Use on : Glass, ceramic, walls, counters, metal, and concrete. Other options include : Barkeepers Friend , Kleen King , paint or lacquer thinner , or carburetor cleaner . Even plain old cooking oil sometimes works. Always spot-test the product on a hidden part of the surface to make sure it doesn’t cause damage. If you only get partial results, leave the product on for several days or weeks. Then, go back and repeat everything you did the first time, as the marks tend to oxidize or deteriorate to some extent, which gives you a better chance of getting rid of them."

      "title": "Toothpaste is a great alternative to stronger chemicals.",
      "content": "Toothpaste is a great alternative to stronger chemicals. Put a small amount of toothpaste onto a rag or sponge that you don't mind getting stained, says Peters. Then, “rub the area with small circles” until the Sharpie marks are gone. Use on : Primarily wood—Peters says “it works well for both finished and unfinished wood.” Toothpaste also works on walls, ceramic, plastic, glass, and metal. Remove the toothpaste with a damp cloth. Peters says to add more toothpaste as needed until the Sharpie is gone. Peters advises using toothpaste that’s made with baking soda. He says to “avoid gel toothpastes, since they won’t work at all.” According to Peters, “while toothpaste is pretty mild, you’ll still want to test in a hidden area first” to make sure it doesn’t damage the surface."

      "content": "The alcohol in hairspray helps lift off Sharpie marks. Spritz the Sharpie stain with hairspray. Then, wipe it away with a cloth or paper towel after no more than 5 seconds. If you leave the hairspray on too long, it might stick. [5] X Research source Use on : Plastic, wood, walls, ceramic, and metal. Scrub the Sharpie stain until it rubs off. You might have to reapply the hairspray several times. If you don't have hairspray, perfumes and body sprays work well, too. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "The abrasive qualities of baking soda can scrub off Sharpie. Mix equal parts baking soda and water into a thick paste. Then, use a toothbrush to scrub the paste into the Sharpie stain. Simply wipe off the baking soda with a damp cloth once the marker is gone. [8] X Research source Use on : Brick, concrete, plastic, glass, and ceramic. If the stain is on ceramic or glass, add 1 part toothpaste to 1 part baking soda, and see if it will rub off."

      "content": "The essential oils in orange peels work as a cleaner. Don’t have any chemical products around or don’t want to expose yourself to them? Try using oranges: [9] X Research source Before you start, make sure you rub the orange peel; this is known to bring out the essential oils that you will need. Using “elbow grease,” start rubbing the stain with the peels. Use on : Walls, wood, ceramic, and glass."

      "title": "This sounds counterintuitive, but it’s no joke!",
      "content": "This sounds counterintuitive, but it’s no joke! With the new Sharpie in hand, firmly draw directly on the old mark. Then, immediately wipe it with a cotton ball, tissue, or cloth. The fresh coat of marker will re-liquefy the old ink, allowing you to wipe it off. Use on : Smooth, non-porous surfaces like glass and dry erase boards. Have an alcohol bottle on the ready, too, to help re-liquify and remove the ink (some in a spray bottle is better than the rag approach). You need to wipe the Sharpie off immediately following the fresh application, so a two-handed approach may work best for you."

      "title": "The pen contains both the ink and solvent.",
      "content": "The pen contains both the ink and solvent. One of the simplest ways to remove permanent marker quickly from a smooth surface is with another brand of permanent marker and a rag. Color over a small part of the mark quickly, so that it becomes wet, then wipe it away immediately. Use on : Smooth, non-porous surfaces like glass and dry erase boards. You might want to use a cotton ball to remove the marker, instead of a rag or paper towel. The small size of the cotton ball makes it ideal for removing marker without smearing it around more of the surface."
