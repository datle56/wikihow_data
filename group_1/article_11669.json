Avoid giving advice or criticizing. Try to listen to your loved ones without telling them what to do or judging them. For example, if you sister tells you she is having trouble with her husband, don’t try to offer her advice or criticize her for marrying him. Just listen to what she says and offer your support. Steer clear of critical sounding phrases such as, “You should have…” or “I would have…” Instead, try saying something like, “I am sorry you are having these problems.” Avoid trying to think of your response as your friend talks. If you are focused on what you are going to say next, then you will not be able to give your full attention. Focus on your friend’s words, not on what you want to say in response. Ask questions if you don’t understand. If your loved one says something that is unclear, then ask for clarification. Try saying something like, “I think that what you are saying is ___. Is that right?” Reflect back what they say. Echoing your loved one’s words can help them to feel heard and it can also keep you focused as you listen. Try echoing by repeating a short phrase out of a sentence your loved one speaks now and then. For example, if you friend says, “I had to go to the doctor before work this morning to get a tetanus shot,” then you might echo by saying something like, “Oh, a tetanus shot.”"

For example, if your friend asks you to help her move over the weekend, but you have already made plans to go out of town with your boyfriend, then you have the right to tell your friend no. Try saying something like, “I can’t. I already have plans. Maybe you can ask your brother to help you?” Keep in mind that you also have the right to just say no if someone asks you to do something you don’t want to do. For example, if a friend asks you to complete some of his homework for him, then you can simply say, “No.” You do not have to offer an explanation."
