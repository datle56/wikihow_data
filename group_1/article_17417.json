      "title": "Find a spot in your car to collect fibers that match the seat.",
      "content": "Find a spot in your car to collect fibers that match the seat. Choose an inconspicuous place such as under your seat. You can also get fibers from the carpet that is hidden underneath plastic paneling. To expose carpet, inspect the paneling first. Check if the weather stripping is covering the area where the panel meets the door. If so, gently pull back the weather stripping in this area only. Try to locate the fastener clips. These are located between the panel and the door, usually near creases where two panels meet. Use your fingers or a panel pop tool to gently pry off the panel at the fastener clips, where the plastic is reinforced. If you canâ€™t find the fastener clips, try wiggling and prying the panel from the bottom. Be careful not to bend the plastic permanently. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Reinstall your paneling now if it was removed. The fastener clips should snap easily back into place. If you pulled back your weather stripping, restore it by guiding the strip back into place and applying pressure. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Alternatively, you can fill the bottom of the burn hole with a small piece of foam. Cut the piece of foam to fit the hole. Apply fabric glue to the bottom of the hole and insert your foam. Allow it to dry. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply some glue underneath the edges of the hole. Use a toothpick to apply the glue for small holes or a palette knife for large holes. Press down firmly on the outer edges of the hole to firmly adhere the subpatch to the leather. Allow to dry completely. [8] X Research source You may use a hairdryer to speed up the drying process."

Repeat this process until the hole is completely filled. [9] X Research source If using a hairdryer to dry the layers, position the dryer so that the air blows across the glue or filler instead of directly onto it to prevent heat and moisture buildup.

      "title": "Sand the final layer so that it is level with the edges.",
      "content": "Sand the final layer so that it is level with the edges. Gently sanding the layer will smoothen the dried glue or filler so that its texture more closely matches the surface of the seat. [11] X Research source Do not apply too much pressure while sanding. If the repaired layer dips beneath the surface of the hole, you will need to add another layer and allow to dry before sanding again."
