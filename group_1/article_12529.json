      "content": "Fill your kettle half-full with equal parts vinegar and water. Distilled white vinegar works best as a natural descaler for your tea kettle. Pour the water and vinegar directly into your kettle and swish it around so it’s thoroughly mixed. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you can make a cleaning solution by mixing lemon and vinegar. Lemon reduces the odor of the vinegar. Fill a quart-sized glass jar with lemon rinds. Cover with white vinegar. Let it sit for 1 to 2 weeks. Strain the lemon rinds out using a cheesecloth or strainer into a glass spray bottle. If you want a weaker cleaning solution, add filtered water to the product after straining. If you’re cleaning an electric kettle , make sure it's unplugged before pouring in the water and vinegar. If your kettle has a filter near the spout, pull it out before cleaning it. If there’s limescale stuck on the filter, put it in a small bowl with equal parts vinegar and water. Check the owner's manual for your kettle to make sure that it's safe to add vinegar to the interior. Vinegar may be too harsh of a cleaner for some electric kettles."

Heat the solution up until it comes to a rolling boil for about a minute. [2] X Research source Feel free to use a high heat setting to bring the solution to a boil as quickly as possible. It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes to get it boiling. Turn on an exhaust fan or open a window since the vinegar will create a pungent odor once it starts boiling. If yours is an electric kettle with an automatic switch-off feature, listen for it to turn off on its own instead of watching to see when it boils."

The heat and the acidity from the vinegar will help loosen up all of the limescale deposits in your kettle so they’re easy to remove. [3] X Research source"

Thoroughly rinse the inside of the kettle under your sink faucet to get rid of any leftover vinegar solution and loose limescale. For best results, rinse out the kettle 2 or 3 times to get as much of the vinegar out of the inside as possible. [4] X Research source If your kettle has a removable lid, take this lid off to make it easier to rinse out the interior. You can rinse the lid by itself to make sure it's also clean."

Even if the vinegar didn’t break down all of the limescale, any build-up still inside your kettle will be easy to remove by hand. Rub the insides with a damp cloth to scrub the loose residue from the kettle. Be sure to scrub around all of the edges and corners of the kettle to descale it. [5] X Research source If a damp cloth isn't cutting it, add a sprinkle of baking soda to a damp sponge and use that to clean out the inside of the kettle. If there’s still stubborn limescale stuck inside your kettle, then boil more vinegar and water solution to break it apart. You may need to run vinegar through your kettle a few times if it’s really dirty."

[8] X Research source If you don’t have a lemon, you can use 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of store-bought lemon juice instead.
