When it is in the middle position, your device is in standard mode. When it is in the upper position, your device is in Pulse Mode. [1] X Research source To swap settings on your Geek Bar Pulse, move the tab on the bottom of your device to the middle or upper positions. “Pulse” is written above the upper position to assist in switching settings. Pulse Mode offers stronger puffs than standard mode, but it also offers fewer puffs, so keep that in mind when choosing your preferred setting."

      "content": "Recharge your Geek Bar Pulse using the USB-C cord. When your Geek Bar Pulse battery gets low, insert the USB-C cord into the port on the bottom of the device to recharge. The screen will glow, and the charge percentage will begin to appear. When your device is in standard mode, you can get a half a day of use before you need to recharge if you’re a moderate vaper. [3] X Research source The Geek Bar Pulse takes around 55 minutes to charge fully."

      "title": "Standard mode uses a single coil and offers 15,000 puffs.",
      "content": "Standard mode uses a single coil and offers 15,000 puffs. This mode is similar to other disposables. Since it alternates between two coils (the heating elements), your puffs will be lightly flavored and hit soft. With the standard mode, you receive a mild experience that lasts longer than other disposables. [4] X Research source You get more hits with this mode than with other disposable vapes, which usually offer around 600 puffs. Activate this setting by pushing the bottom tab into the middle position."

      "content": "Pulse Mode uses both coils for 7,500 stronger, more flavorful puffs. This configuration is the first of its kind. The Pulse Mode activates both coils for stronger, more flavorful hits. Since the puffs are stronger, you only get 7,500 instead of 15,000. Activate this setting by pushing the bottom tab into the upper position. [5] X Research source If there is a rocket ship on the screen of your device, that means it is in Pulse Mode."

      "title": "The Geek Bar Pulse introduced dual-coil configuration and a smart screen.",
      "content": "The Geek Bar Pulse introduced dual-coil configuration and a smart screen. The dual-coil configuration helps it last longer than other disposables, as it switches coils every time you take a puff in standard mode. It also solves the issue of juice and battery display. You can’t check your battery and e-liquid levels on older disposables, but the Geek Bar Pulse has a smart screen that displays both. [6] X Research source The dual-coil configuration has been implemented into other disposable vapes, but the Geek Bar Pulse was the first to introduce this technology. The 650mAh battery, 16mL liquid capacity, and USB-C charging port make the Geek Bar Pulse last longer than other disposable vapes."

      "content": "The screen shows the battery, mode, and e-liquid level when you puff. Check the battery by looking for the lightning bolt icon at the top of your screen. The five segments and the number next to them indicate your battery level. An empty open circle in the middle of your screen means your device is in standard mode. A rocket ship means your device is in Pulse Mode. [7] X Research source The e-liquid level is displayed at the bottom of your screen with five segments, numbers, and a droplet icon."
