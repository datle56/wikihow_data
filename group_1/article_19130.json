      "title": "Just skip that class.",
      "content": "Just skip that class. The way to get out of class with the most likely consequences but the least amount of effort and planning on your part is simply to skip. During passing period (in between class periods), just leave school, if you want to skip the rest of the day, or head to the bathroom to hide out, or just wander the hallways for the rest of the class period until that class is over, then go to your next like nothing happened. Hide from prowling teachers! If you're in elementary school and never have a passing period, you'll need to do a bit more planning since you'll probably need a parent to come to get you and won't be able to just skip. Go on to the next step for other tips."

      "title": "Fake sickness.",
      "content": "Fake sickness. Tried and true, but probably the most reliable way of getting out of class is with an illness. A good actor can pull off a convincing sickness that no teacher or administrator will try to question. It's usually in their best interest to just go with it and let you leave, as long as you do it right. When you walk into class, really start laying it on thick. Have a deeply frowning face, and move slowly, your head down as if you had a headache. Hold your head in your hands and wait a few minutes to approach the teacher. Ask to go to the nurse. You can either actually go to the nurse and just nap for the rest of the hour, try to get sent home, or just skip going to the nurse and wander until class is over. It's important to be a good actor. If you come into class grinning and joking with your buddies, the teacher won't believe you if thirty seconds later you're suffering from the black plague."

      "title": "Fake an injury.",
      "content": "Fake an injury. While this might be more common or effective in something like gym class, if you can fake a sprain or another type of non-serious injury, you could potentially even get a friend out of class to help walk you down to the nurse's station. It's a pretty decent way to get out of class, again, if you're a good actor. Usually the best way of doing this is to not try to fake an injury by falling or doing something else ridiculous in class, but come in selling the injury already. Walk with a limp, or hold your head in your hands to fake a head injury. Tell the teacher you hurt yourself at recess, or during gym class, or that you fell outside in the hallway and you want to go see the nurse. Again, you can usually get out of class for long enough at the nurse's station by \"resting\" or you could just wander and go to class later."

    {
      "title": "Go to the bathroom and don't come back.",
      "content": "Go to the bathroom and don't come back. Another way to skip school that has quite a bit of potential for getting in trouble, but requires little planning on your part is to go to the bathroom, then disappear, or leave school completely. This can only work if you're not a consistent trouble-maker, and if you've been behaving relatively well during the rest of class. If you've been getting in trouble all day, or giving the teacher a hard time, then want to go to the bathroom, you're likely to get shut-down. Pull the \"emergency\" card and make a concerned look with your face. No teacher wants to have a mess on their hands in class, and they'll be likely to just let you go. Get a friend in class to collect your things for you, so you won't have to return to the scene of the crime later."

      "title": "Stay out of sight.",
      "content": "Stay out of sight. If you elect to wander the halls for the rest of the class period, it's important to avoid getting caught, or asked for a hall pass by someone who expects you to be in class. Whatever you choose to do with your freedom, you've got to lay low and stay out of sight. Hide in the bathroom. Maybe the easiest way to lay low is to hide out in the bathroom. It may also be smelliest way of hanging out, so you might as well get back to class, but it's also usually safe. If you can, try to finish the assignment you're skipping out on while you hide. Wander the quietest wings of the school. Avoid the gym area, the band and choir wings, and other high traffic areas. Maybe go somewhere the teachers don't know you at all, like another grade's floor. If you're older and have transportation, you could always just leave and go do something more fun with your time."

      "title": "Always wait until after your teacher takes roll.",
      "content": "Always wait until after your teacher takes roll. If you skip class completely, you'll be marked absent, for sure. But if you leave class and never come back, it's half-likely that your teacher, who is busy and probably overworked, will forget to go back and mark you absent after the fact. It's easy for stuff like that to slip the mind, and you might be able to get away with it, even if your teacher does notice, so it's good to wait a few minutes before you try to escape."

    {
      "title": "Intercept the communications.",
      "content": "Intercept the communications. If you miss one or more classes in a day, most schools will make calls home, usually at the end of the day. The best way around this is to be a hawk by the telephone when you get home, or to come clean to your parents ahead of time and come up with a good excuse to get away with it. \"Mr. Jones messed up attendance today, he told us to tell you that everyone would be getting those automated calls, but that I was in class.\" If your parents have work, you can delete the call from the school telling your parents that you werenâ€™t in class and if you delete the call, no one will notice. At some schools, they may actually email or contact your parent in other ways, so try to find out the procedure before you do this."

      "title": "Schedule an appointment for that class.",
      "content": "Schedule an appointment for that class. The best ways of getting out of class are always the most legitimate ways. Next time you have to go to the doctor, the dentist, or make some other kind of appointment, make sure you schedule it for the day and the time of the class you hate the most, so you'll be able to miss it. You won't have to sneak around if it's for real. If your parent usually schedules appointments for you, go ahead and do it yourself before they give you the chance to go back out to the waiting room. Then make like everything's already taken care of."

      "title": "Get a pass from another teacher.",
      "content": "Get a pass from another teacher. In middle and high school, some teachers will write up passes for students to work on group projects in their classroom, especially during study hall, or other break periods, if the project is especially important. In some cases, you might be able to convince one teacher that your break period is actually during another time than it actually is, and get them to write a pass for you to leave the class you don't like. Then just leave. This can be dangerous, if you have teachers who talk a lot. Try to get teachers from different departments, like a shop teacher and a math teacher, who may not be likely to communicate with one another."

      "title": "Ask to go to the library.",
      "content": "Ask to go to the library. Depending on the class you're trying to get out of, you may have a more legitimate reason to leave than you originally thought. If you're annoying about being in a particular class, tell your teacher that you do better work in the library, and ask if you can go study there instead some day. Teachers are likely to be surprised by this, and you might win a free hour in the library, without having to beat around the bush about it."

      "title": "Ask to see the guidance counsellor.",
      "content": "Ask to see the guidance counsellor. If you're upset about something, or if you feel like you need to be missing class for a more serious reason, ask to go talk to the guidance counsellor. It doesn't have to be anything big: maybe you're just feeling stressed about school and about your ability to handle the pressure. That's what guidance counsellors are there for. Tell your teacher that you're really upset, but be vague. Talk quietly and seriously, right before class, and ask if they'll allow you to go talk to the guidance counsellor instead of coming to class today. If you have to come up with an excuse, try to think of something they'll be unable to verify. No dead grandmothers. Try something like, \"I think I might be having a panic attack,\" instead."

      "title": "Have your parent call you in.",
      "content": "Have your parent call you in. Maybe you've got strict parents, but you never know until you ask. If you've got a real bummer of a class period coming up, ask one of your more lenient parents if they'll call you out for a class period sometime. You might get lucky once or twice. Sometime, try doing a little research by asking one or both of your parents if they ever cut class when they were younger. Dig up some good stories, then use this for leverage later. If you find out your dad used to cut all the time because his math teacher was totally boring, start playing up how dull your math teacher is, and how you wish you could just come home and spend time cleaning up instead of going to class. Boom. Easy call-out."

      "title": "Call yourself a pass out.",
      "content": "Call yourself a pass out. The morning before you go to school, put on a good fake voice, call the office, and call yourself a pass to leave school that day for an appointment of some kind. Pose as your mother or father, and use the specific date and time that you need to be absent from school. In the morning, pick up the hall pass and leave at the time. Scot-free. Better yet, get someone else to make the call for you. Older siblings, cousins, or friends are all good bets. Make sure the office workers don't know your parents very well, or they're likely to recognize your voice and figure out that it's not them."

      "title": "Use a phony pass or slip.",
      "content": "Use a phony pass or slip. The next time you get a hall pass for real, take it home and make a Photocopy. Use white out to change the info date, and then re-photocopy the blank one to have a cache of fakes that you can use, and give to other kids. Be sure to use the same color and style of pen or pencil in the original color that the note was written. If you have a friend who does not know your teacher then have them use the \"bathroom\" and deliver it from the \"office\" at some point to make it extra convincing."

      "title": "Fake a seizure.",
      "content": "Fake a seizure. If you've got to get into serious anti-class warfare, then you can still keep a few serious tricks up your sleeve. Faking a seizure should only be used in the case of serious moments, like if you've totally forgotten to study for a test, or have forgotten a project that's worth a life-time of points, or something. To fake a seizure, try the following, at your own risk: Subtly complain about feeling \"faint\" or \"weird\" just before class. Breathe heavily and go to the bathroom before class starts to wet your head slightly, giving yourself a very sweaty look. Wait for awhile then give a spaced out look if you're going to pass out. Go gradually limp if you are going to pass out then fall down to the floor, as realistically as possible. If you are doing a seizure, fall to the ground and start convulsing and doing random uncontrolled movements. Drool on yourself. Most seizures won't last long, just a minute or two, but it's still important to not over-sell it so you'll start laughing or otherwise give yourself away. When you're done, grunt and make your eyes go wide as if you're in pain. When everyone looks at you, all freaked out, say, \"What happened?\" You may end up headed to the doctor, but they'll likely call your parents first and you might be able to end up head home."

      "title": "Never break serious rules or laws to get out of class.",
      "content": "Never break serious rules or laws to get out of class. It's commonly thought that pulling fire alarms or making anonymous threats to the office are good ways to get out of school, but you should never try these methods, because they are not only dangerous at school, likely resulting in expulsion or suspension, they're extremely illegal. You will be facing fines and serious penalties for your actions. Never, under any circumstances, should you take such drastic measures. Talk to a counselor if you're really struggling at school and feel like you need to be absent for a serious reason. Talk about it and get help. Skipping school can get you in lots of trouble and besides, if youâ€™re being bullied at school or something, running away from those problems wonâ€™t help those problems go away."
