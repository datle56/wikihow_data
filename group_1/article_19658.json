      "content": "Rest and protect your leg. The first thing you should do if you think you have a pulled thigh muscle is to stop whatever activity you are doing. Continuing to work out or use a pulled thigh muscle can cause more damage. You should rest your leg from any physical activity that requires the use of your thighs.

      "title": "Ice the injury.",
      "content": "Ice the injury. The next step is to apply an ice pack to your injured thigh. Applying cold to an injury helps reduce blood flow, which can help alleviate pain. This also reduces acute swelling and inflammation. [2] X Research source Apply it for 10 to 15 minutes at a time every hour during the first 24 hours of the injury, except for when you're sleeping. After the first 24 hours, you can repeat the icing four to five times throughout the day, or every two to three hours. You can use either commercial ice packs or bags of frozen vegetables, like frozen peas. Peas are small enough to conform to the shape of your leg easily. You can also fill an old long tube sock with rice and keep it in the freezer for when you may need it. Never place ice directly on the skin. Always wrap it in something (like a towel or t-shirt) to protect the skin."

      "title": "Use compression.",
      "content": "Use compression. Wrap the injured area with a compression bandage or use compression shorts. The compression bandage or shorts helps to reduce swelling by limiting the swelling to that area. The compression also provides support to the injured area. The bandage should be wrapped tightly enough to apply medium pressure, but not so tightly as to cause any bulging around the bandage or stop blood flow. Start wrapping high on your leg, above the injury. Once the swelling has gone, you don't need to wrap anymore. If the pain increases with a compression bandage, it is too tight and you should loosen it."

Running or exercise: Any activity will aggravate the injury and increase swelling and bleeding. Massage: Massage can be very helpful after the initial recovery period, but should be avoided during the first 72 hours. After 48 to 72 hours, you can try some of these methods."

Stretching exercises are especially helpful if you injure your hamstring (the back of the thigh) or have pain in your inner thighs.

Arch your back so that your belly drops and your butt is pushed back. If you are more flexible, you can lower yourself to your forearms. You should feel the stretch in your inner thighs. [7] X Research source For a good hamstring stretch, sit on the floor with one leg straight out and the other bent. Lean towards the straight leg, rotating at the hips. You should feel the stretch in the back of the thigh. Hold that for 30 seconds. Switch legs and repeat. You can also place both feet straight out in front of you and bend at the hip, reaching for your toes.

      "content": "Learn the cause of a pulled thigh muscle. Pulled thigh muscles can be very painful and most commonly occur while running, kicking, skating, and weightlifting; however, they can also be strained just by walking. A pulled thigh muscle can happen anytime there is a sudden stretching of these muscles and can occur anywhere along the length of the muscles. [9] X Research source It is very important to warm up and stretch the muscles in the thigh before any activity. If these muscles have not been adequately stretched, you are at a higher risk of straining and injuring the muscle."

[10] X Research source Many people also report hearing or feeling a pop. Within a short time, from minutes to hours, swelling, bruising, and tenderness at the area of the injury is common.

The greatest risk factors for thigh muscle strain is: [11] X Research source Participation in any sport that involves running, kicking, and sprinting, especially if enough time is not taken to stretch the muscles before participating. Dancing and other vigorous activities can put you at higher risk as well. A history of muscle strain. Previous thigh muscle injuries do weaken the muscle and make it more likely to happen again Starting physical activity while in poor shape or before the muscles are properly stretched. Muscle imbalance. Since the quadriceps and the hamstrings work together, along with the adductor muscles, if one group of muscles is much stronger than another, it can strain the weaker muscle group."

Most thigh pain will go away with the above methods; however, sometimes thigh pain may not be due to a sprain, strain, sore muscle, or cramp, but a symptom of a much more severe condition.

[12] X Research source If you experienced an injury that caused thigh pain, you may want to see your doctor if you believe it is severe. If you are unsure of the cause of your thigh pain, you can see your doctor as soon as it happens just to be sure."
