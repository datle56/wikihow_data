      "content": "Add salt, pepper, and vegetables. Add as much salt as you wish. If you want to add finely diced peppers, onions, mushrooms, or other vegetables, add 1 handful per egg. [2] X Research source You could also add a handful of diced ham or spinach per egg. Remember to add no more than 1 handful of additional material (meat or vegetables) per egg, otherwise the egg-to-vegetable or egg-to-meat ratio will be thrown off."

      "content": "Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into the kettle. Roll the kettle around so that the oil evenly coats the bottom. Turn on the heating element beneath the kettle and wait about 30 seconds. Drop a droplet of water into the kettle to test its readiness. If it is ready, the oil and water will make a loud hissing noise. [3] X Research source If it’s not ready, repeat the test every 30 seconds until it is."

      "content": "Pour the eggs and vegetables into the kettle and cook them. Reduce heat to low or medium. Use a long-handled wooden spoon to scrape the eggs around within the kettle. Stop cooking when the eggs appear fluffy and begin to smell cooked. [4] X Research source This recipe works best if you have a wide-mouthed kettle. Scoop the eggs out of the kettle and onto a plate or into a bowl. Top the eggs with salt, pepper, and ketchup, if you wish."

      "content": "Reheat canned soup. Normally, you’d heat soup in a pan, but if all you have on hand is a kettle, that will work just as well. Open the can of soup and pour the contents into the kettle. If the soup is condensed, add water or milk in the volume recommended by the directions on the label. Heat the soup for about 8 minutes on medium heat, then allow to cool for several minutes before consuming."

      "content": "Put your oats in a bowl. You can use rolled oats or quick oats. Quick oats, as their name suggests, cook faster than regular (rolled) oats, but they often end up mushier than rolled oats, and have less texture. If you wish, you could combine both types. [9] X Research source There is no “right” amount of oats you should use. If you are quite hungry for oatmeal, you’ll probably want 1 cup or more. If you are just having a snack, you’ll likely use about 1/2 cup of oatmeal."
