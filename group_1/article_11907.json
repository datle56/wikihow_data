      "title": "Stay away when your parent is drinking.",
      "content": "Stay away when your parent is drinking. It’s completely understandable to want to help your parent or “watch” them when they’re drinking, but they may not behave the same when they’re drinking as they do when sober. Some parents might start fights with their spouses or even the kids when they’re drinking. To minimize your chances of getting caught in the crosshairs, stay away. [1] X Research source Find a safe place you can go to when your parent’s drinking gets out of control, such as a treehouse, library, neighbor’s house, or local park."

      "title": "Don’t take responsibility for your parent’s condition.",
      "content": "Don’t take responsibility for your parent’s condition. At the end of the day, your parent’s behavior is their choice. They’re the adult and should be looking out for you, not the other way around. Don’t blame yourself for their alcoholism or claim total responsibility for “fixing” the problem. The only way an alcoholic can truly get better is by committing to rehab. You can’t do this for your parent; they have to do it on their own. [2] X Research source Even if you're an adult, you're still not responsible for your parent's addiction. They have to accept ownership for their situation in order to change."

      "title": "Talk to your parent about getting help.",
      "content": "Talk to your parent about getting help. Although you can’t control your parent’s choice to get help, you may be able to convince them. If you have siblings, plan to sit your parent down when they are sober and plead with them to get help. Showing your parent your concern may push them to finally get the help they need. If you're a teen, you might say, “Mom, we’re really worried about you. We don’t want to have to go live with foster parents. Can you please go see a doctor?” Adult children may say, \"Mom, I can tell your drinking has gotten worse. I want my kids to grow up knowing their grandmother, but if you continue down this path, I don't think they'll be able to. Will you please get help?\""

    {
      "title": "Tell another trusted adult about your parent’s alcoholism.",
      "content": "Tell another trusted adult about your parent’s alcoholism. If talking to your parent doesn’t make a difference, involve another adult. Turn to your other parent, an aunt or uncle, grandparent, a family friend, or a trusted adult at your school. Tell them what’s happening and ask them to talk to your parent on your behalf. Sometimes, people don't want to listen to close family members, such as kids and spouses. They may be more likely to listen to a non-family member. Consider choosing someone whose opinion your parent cares about, such as a close family friend."

      "title": "Seek help, if you’re in danger.",
      "content": "Seek help, if you’re in danger. Alcoholics may violently lash out at others when they’re drinking. If this happens to you or your siblings, seek help immediately. Call another family member or a neighbor for help. If you fear that your parent may hurt you, your siblings, or themselves, call the emergency department. Once you’re in a safe place, you might also call the National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-CHILD. [3] X Research source If you're an adult and your parent is being violent, contact emergency services."

      "content": "Develop strategies to fight stress. Your parent’s alcoholism can affect your own health and well-being. You might worry a lot about your parent’s health, their job, or their safety. Keep stress at bay by practicing relaxation techniques and self-care. [4] X Research source Try relaxation techniques like guided imagery, meditation , yoga, or deep breathing to fight stress. You might also do self-care activities like massaging away tension, taking a warm bath, or watching your favorite TV show."

      "title": "Set personal boundaries.",
      "content": "Set personal boundaries. An alcoholic parent may violate your personal limitations in many ways, such as constantly asking you for money, needing rides from you, or forcing you to lie for them. Know that you have a right to say \"no\" to this kind of behavior and enforce healthy boundaries. By keeping firm boundaries, you're letting your parent see the consequences of their drinking behaviors. It can help them realize that they need treatment. If law enforcement gets involved, treatment may be offered through the judicial system. For example, you might tell your parent, \"This is the last time I'm loaning you money.\" If they ask again, remind them of your rule and say \"no.\" [5] X Research source Another example of a boundary you might set is to refuse to spend time with your parent while they are drinking."

      "content": "Get enough sleep. Sleep is extra important when you’re dealing with a stressful home environment. Plus, if you're an adolescent, you need adequate sleep to support your growth and development. If you’re having trouble getting the recommended eight to ten hours per night, start a bedtime routine. [6] X Research source For instance, if you stay up late on your phone or computer, shut them off at least an hour before bed. Instead, do some reading, work on a crossword puzzle, or listen to soft music. If your parent’s drinking keeps you up often at night, tell another adult. You need to be able to sleep restfully through the night without worrying about your parent."

      "content": "Journal to express your thoughts and feelings. It can feel good to release all your frustrations about what’s happening at home with your parent. Write down what you’re going through in a journal. If you have a hard time journaling, write as if you’re explaining your day to a good friend. [8] X Research source This journal doesn't have to be pen-and-paper. You can keep one on the computer, a tablet, your phone, or even online. If writing doesn't help, try drawing what you feel instead. These can be comics, illustrations, or scribbles."

Before things start to unravel, reach out and talk to a counselor. This professional is trained to help you cope with stress and find better ways of managing in school or work. [9] X Research source If you are a student, you may be able to make an appointment with your school counselor. If you are an adult, get an appointment through your job by talking to human resources or ask your family doctor for a referral. Get support and ideas for coping by joining Al-Anon ( https://al-anon.org/ ) or Alateen, a nonprofit organization that offers support for people who care about someone with a drinking problem."

As upsetting as that may be, it may be the only way you can protect your health and well-being. If you're a child, see if you can stay with other relatives or friends for a few days. If you're an adult, limit your visits to give yourself a break from your parent's bad habits."

Make an extra effort in all your classes and schedule in time to study after school each day. If you are an adult with a job, try to focus on keeping your performance up to par. If you have trouble studying at home, visit a coffee shop or library. If your grades are falling, considering seeking out a tutor to help you.

The more productive things on your schedule, the less time you’ll have to sit around worrying. Plus, getting involved in sports, clubs, and organizations at your school or in your local community can keep you away from home a lot.

You might feel ashamed to share all the details of your parent’s drinking, but it’s important that you have social support. [12] X Research source Tell your closest pals a little of what’s happening and then gauge their reactions to decide how much more you might want to share. For example, you might start by saying, “I really don’t like being at home when my dad drinks. Can I come over your house?”"

For example, you might start writing stories or poems, playing a musical instrument, or babysitting for extra cash."
