      "content": "Set a project budget to determine what you can afford. Kitchen construction jobs can be very expensive. The materials and labor for this work can add up fast. Have a budget in mind for the entire project. Use this as a guide for choosing materials and designs for the cabinets. [1] X Research source There is a big range for how much a kitchen cabinet job can cost. If you build and install them yourself, total costs can be $5,000-10,000, depending on how many cabinets you build and what sort of materials you use. With custom made and professionally installed cabinets, the job can reach $20,000 or more. Consider saving up ahead of time to prepare for the project rather than relying on credit cards or loans. In the long-term, you'll avoid spending more money from paying interest."

      "title": "Pick a construction material for the cabinets.",
      "content": "Pick a construction material for the cabinets. You have several choices for what material you’ll use for your cabinets. All have different advantages and costs associated with them. [2] X Research source Plywood is the most common cabinet material. It is durable, affordable, and easy to work with. Plywood has a very plain color, though, so you’ll have to stain or paint the cabinets. Composite board is a cheaper option. It will save you a lot of money on materials, but won’t last as long as other options. Solid wood like oak, pine, or birch are common in cabinets as well. Solid wood tends to flex, however, so contractors don’t recommend it for humid environments. Solid wood is also more expensive than plywood. Wood substitutes like laminate can give you a natural wood look for a cheaper price. They are usually very durable. You usually can’t paint or stain laminate, so your options for customization are limited."

      "title": "Match your cabinet color to the rest of your kitchen.",
      "content": "Match your cabinet color to the rest of your kitchen. Whether or not you’ll paint your cabinets, consider the rest of your kitchen when deciding on a color. Think about what type of mood and atmosphere you want in the kitchen. If you’re going for a more modern look, black cabinets with stainless steel appliances would work together. If you want a more rustic look, natural wood colors might be best. Take all this into account when picking out a material or paint color. [3] X Research source In small kitchen spaces, use brighter colors. Dark colors usually make rooms look smaller. Make sure the colors you’re planning don’t clash. If your countertop is black, lime green cabinets wouldn’t look good next to that. If the wood you chose isn’t exactly the right color, you can apply a stain to match the color to your kitchen better. Consider speaking with an interior designer for tips on coming up with a style for your cabinets."

      "title": "Decide if you want a face frame for the cabinets.",
      "content": "Decide if you want a face frame for the cabinets. A face frame is an outer border on the front of cabinets. It adds an extra design to your cabinets. If you want something more than just plain cabinet doors, a face frame can add style. [4] X Research source You can design face frames into whatever shapes you want. They can be as simple as cutting a few strips of wood to make a square border the cabinet door. More complicated face frames have shapes and designs. This takes a lot of woodworking skill, so speak with a professional if you’d like this kind of design. Remember that building a face frame requires more material, and will therefore cost more."

      "title": "Envision any irregularly-shaped cabinets you might use.",
      "content": "Envision any irregularly-shaped cabinets you might use. At their most simple, cabinets are just boxes with doors and only require rudimentary skill to make. If you want more complicated or irregular designs, plan them out ahead of time. Think about how different angles might work in different corners of the room and how they would add to the room’s style. [5] X Research source Irregular cabinets are usually above stoves or other appliances because there is less room. Remember that if you have to fit a cabinet above your stove, it doesn’t need to have a difficult design. You could just make a smaller box."

      "content": "Speak to an interior designer if you don't know where to start. Interior designers are professionals who specialize in helping homeowners and businesses decorate spaces. If you know you want custom kitchen cabinets but don't know what will work in your kitchen, consider hiring a professional designer to help. They can show you all the options and make suggestions on what's best for you. [6] X Research source In the US, look for a designer certified by the Designer Society of America to know they are a professional. Ask for the price this designer will charge before hiring them. Avoid being surprised by a bill when the work is finished."

      "content": "Plan base cabinets that are 36 in (91 cm) tall and 24 in (61 cm) deep. This is the standard measurement for base cabinets because it’s the right height for an average adult to work at the counter without bending over or standing on their toes. Appliances like dishwashers are planned around this measurement as well so they reach the same height as the base cabinets. [7] X Research source This measurement is also helpful because an average sheet of plywood is 4 ft (1.2 m) x 8 ft (2.4 m). That means if you cut a piece of plywood in half widthwise, you have 2 cabinet sides of 24 in (61 cm). This reduces the amount of cutting you have to do."

      "content": "Design upper cabinets so they’re 12 in (30 cm) deep. This is a standard measurement for upper cabinets because they allow an average adult to work at the counter without the cabinets getting in the way. When taking measurements in your kitchen, plan on having upper cabinets that extend 12 in (30 cm) from the wall. [8] X Research source Upper cabinets are usually installed 18 in (46 cm) above the countertop. There is no universal measurement for how tall upper cabinets should be. Think about how much storage space you need and how much room you have under the ceiling to plan a height for the cabinets. 30 in (76 cm) is a common height."

      "content": "Draw a floorplan of your kitchen . [9] X Expert Source MacKenzie Cain Home Design Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2020. This floorplan shows you exactly how much room you have to install your cabinets. Start by measuring the total length, width, and height of your kitchen. Then measure around any appliances and subtract that number from your total available space. [10] X Expert Source MacKenzie Cain Home Design Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2020. Draw this floorplan out on a piece of graph paper. [11] X Research source For example, your kitchen wall may be 10 feet (3.0 m) long, but the refrigerator might be in the way and take up 3 feet (0.91 m). This means you have 7 feet (2.1 m) available for cabinets on that wall. Draw your floorplan to scale. If you use a piece of graph paper, use a guide like 1 box = 1 inch (2.5 cm). Keep this consistent so your floorplan is drawn to scale."

      "content": "Plan your cabinets around appliances and obstructions. With your measurements and floorplan done, start planning how you’ll position cabinets around any appliances. Design your cabinets so no appliances are in the way and you can open the doors or drawers without any obstructions stopping you. [12] X Research source For example, you can’t install base cabinets where your dishwasher is, so break this area into 2 subsections around the dishwasher. Measure the available space on each side of the dishwasher, then plan how many cabinets will fit in each subsection. Also account for the doors and drawers in cabinets when they’re open. Don’t plan for a cabinet that can’t open its door because an appliance is in the way."

      "content": "Calculate how many cabinets you can fit in your available space. After taking all the necessary measurements, determine the total number of cabinets you'll need. Add up the dimensions of your cabinets and divide that into your available wall and floor space to get a result on how many cabinets you can fit in your kitchen. [13] X Research source Calculate the wall and floor space separately. This way you can plan both the base and upper cabinets. For example, if you have 7 feet (2.1 m) of available floorspace for base cabinets in one area and are planning 24 in (61 cm) cabinets, that means you can fit 3 cabinets in this space. Do the same calculation for each area in your kitchen. Come to a total cabinet count to determine how much material you'll need for the project."

      "content": "Have a contractor measure your kitchen if you don't feel confident. If you don't think you can accurately measure your kitchen yourself, bring in a contractor to help. They will sketch a floor plan, take all the necessary measurements, and calculate how many cabinets you can build. This ensures that all the measurements are accurate. If you like the contractor, you can even hire them to do the whole job. Contractors often work with interior designers as well. This team can produce custom made cabinets just for you if you want them to."

[14] X Expert Source MacKenzie Cain Home Design Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2020. These programs can help you envision the project you're planning and make changes more accurately. [15] X Research source There are several design programs on the market, so do some investigating to find the right one for you. Look for a program that is especially good for kitchen cabinet design. Some design software is free and some is paid. Consider spending some money on a better program for more accurate results. Some software offers a free trial period before you have to purchase it. If possible, try to design your cabinets during this trial period."

Otherwise, scroll through the options and see what looks good in your kitchen. [17] X Research source Consider how much storage space you need. Tall wall cabinets might look nice, but if you have nothing to put in them then this is a big expense for something that you won't use. Look at the different designs that the program offers."
