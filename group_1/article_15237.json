Any coffee will work, but light or medium roasts won’t dye your hair as darkly and non-organic coffees usually have added chemicals and preservatives. [1] X Expert Source Mindy Nguyen Holistic Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. Make the coffee extra strong by adding more coffee grounds than you normally would (especially if you’re trying to cover gray hairs). The stronger the coffee, the darker it will make your hair. It will probably only darken it by half a shade or 1 full shade at most (coffee dye is most effective for those with light or medium brown hair). Brewing with a single-serve instant coffee maker might not make the coffee strong enough. Try a regular coffee machine or using the stove instead ."

The shampoo will clean the coffee from your hair and make the dye less effective."
