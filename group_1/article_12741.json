      "title": "Drink lots and lots of water.",
      "content": "Drink lots and lots of water. The most important thing for a regular kidney detox is to have a high intake of natural, clean water. Having around 8 glasses of water per day (or more if you sweat a lot or are athletic) helps to filter out the accumulated toxins. A good indication that you are getting enough water would be passing clear or pale yellow urine which is not very strong smelling. If the urine is anything deeper than a pale yellow, it means that it is concentrated (which is normal for the first urination of the morning). Passing clear urine is an indication of a clean filtering system. [1] X Research source Fluids in the form of colas, coffees, and carbonated drinks are not a good substitute for natural water. Some teas and juices may contain vitamins and minerals that are helpful for your kidneys. However, they may also contain high concentrations of caffeine or sugar, which can be harmful to your kidneys. You can drink detox teas to help cleanse your system. You can find them online here ."

      "content": "Fill up on potassium-rich fruit. Fruits and vegetables that are rich in potassium aid in cleansing the kidneys. Fruits like grapes, sweet limes, oranges, cantaloupes, bananas, kiwis, apricots, and prunes are all rich sources of potassium. [2] X Research source Milk and yogurt are also good sources of potassium. Including these fruits in your daily diet helps maintain the level of electrolytes in your blood, which then keeps the kidney functioning at its optimum. A glass of tart cherry juice consumed daily in the morning or afternoon is known to clear the build-up of excess uric acid, a by-product of kidney filtration. One must have a balanced intake of potassium rich food. Excessive intake of potassium can lead to a condition known as hyperkalemia, which can prove fatal and cause a cardiac arrest. People who have kidney problems like kidney failure cannot have too much potassium. A healthy person is allowed to have up to 4.7 grams of potassium per day. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Eat plenty of cranberries. Cranberries help in cleansing the kidney. Cranberries contain a nutrient called quinine which converts itself into hippuric acid through a series of metabolic changes in the liver. Hippuric acid clears the excess buildup of urea and uric acid in the kidneys. A cupful of cranberries is enough to cleanse the kidney each day. [4] X Research source Scientific studies have proven that cranberry is also very useful in treating as preventing urinary tract infections as it has antibacterial properties."

      "content": "Incorporate more barley into your diet. Barley is an excellent grain that is used to cleanse the kidneys. It may also help prevent damage happening in the kidney due to uncontrolled diabetes. Note that barley is not a cure, but it can be used along with other methods to maintain optimum functioning of the kidneys. Barley is a whole grain, and substituting barley flour in place of refined flours is a good way of including barley in your diet. Another way to get more barley is to soak a handful of barley in water at night and drink the same water first thing in the morning. This cleanses and repairs the buildup of kidney toxins. Regular consumption of barley may also help in maintaining the creatinine levels, or bringing them down to normal in the case of diabetics. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit your protein intake if your doctor recommends it. If you have kidney disease, eating a high-protein diet may make your condition worse. Unhealthy kidneys have a hard time filtering out the waste your body produces when it metabolizes protein. Ask your doctor if you should limit how much protein you eat to protect your kidneys. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For adults with kidney disease such as chronic renal failure, the National Kidney Foundation recommends limiting the daily protein intake to only 0.8 grams (0.028 oz) per 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of body weight. So, for the average 60 kg (130 lb) adult man, only 48 grams (1.7 oz) grams of protein is allowed per day. This is roughly equivalent to only 1 slice of pork chop and 1 slice of cheese! Talk to your doctor about this beforehand. Protein is a very important element of your diet and should not be avoided for most individuals."

      "content": "Experiment with uva ursi or bear’s grape. This is an excellent natural supplement for kidney detox. It helps to repair the inflammation and injury caused to the tissues in the kidney as a result of infections or stones. It contains a glycoside known as arbutin which has antimicrobial properties, thereby helping in treating urinary tract infections. It also has a muscle relaxant-like action which helps to bring down the swelling in the urinary tract or muscles. It neutralizes the acidic content of the urine, thereby alleviating the burning pain caused by infections. It is generally safe to take this supplement. However, you should not take it if you are on antipsychotic drugs like lithium. Uva ursi can interfere with the way the body gets rid of lithium. This could lead to a high level of lithium in the blood, which can be toxic or fatal."

In homeopathy, a mother tincture prepared from this herb, known as Berberis Vulgaris, may help relieve patients from renal colic. However, the size of the stones should be smaller than the diameter of urethra, otherwise a bigger stone can harm the epithelium of the urethra when it attempts to come out. 10-15 drops of the mother tincture mixed with a little water taken 3 times a day may flush out the stones within a few weeks."
