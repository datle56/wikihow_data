      "content": "Open the doors and windows and park your car in a covered area. Zani says “leaving the vehicle open” is a great way to get the carpet to dry, as it allows air to move through the car and evaporates the moisture. Simply open your car windows, doors, sunroof, and trunk and park your car in your garage or under a carport. If the weather has cleared up, dry your car outdoors in the sun. Be sure to dry your car in a secure location so no one can steal anything (or the car itself) while you leave it open to dry. If you can’t dry your car someplace safe , keep the windows and doors shut while running the AC to help suck moisture out of the car. If you live in a colder climate , Zani suggests turning your car’s heat on “with the windows down a quarter inch or so” to “turn the car into a little mini heater” and dry it out."

      "content": "Remove the mats and sop up water with a microfiber towel . Take out the mats under the driver and passenger seats, as well as any other mats in your car. Then, Zani suggests using a microfiber towel to pat down the carpet where the water is. Just firmly press the towel down with your hands to soak up as much water as possible. If your carpet is sopping wet , consider soaking up the water first before moving your car and opening all the doors and windows. Microfiber towels are made out of a synthetic material that absorbs more water than natural fiber towels. Unfold and refold the towel to use the dry side of the towel when one part gets wet. Ring out the towel when it’s completely soaked before continuing to pat the carpet dry. If you need to move your car and your seat has gotten wet, place towels on it to avoid getting yourself wet when you’re sitting down."

      "content": "Use a wet/dry shop vac to suck up excess moisture. A wet/dry shop vac is a special type of vacuum that you use to clean up liquid spills. Simply turn the dial to “Wet” before you begin vacuuming the carpet . Then, slowly run the vacuum’s hose over the carpet and any other areas that are wet, such as the seats. [1] X Research source Empty the shop vac’s canister when it gets full. You may need to do this several times depending on how wet the carpet is. Make sure to vacuum and dry out the electronics and buttons around the interior, especially the ones on the door, such as the window control buttons and the speaker. If you don’t have a shop vac , see if an appliance or hardware store near you rents them out."

      "content": "Lift up the carpet to dry the foam underneath. When car carpet gets wet, the water seeps through to the foam backing, which can grow mildew if it stays wet. To lift up the carpet, use a screwdriver to create leverage under the door sill and prop it up. Then, use something firm, like a brick or wooden plank, to hold up the carpet and create a pocket for air to travel through. [2] X Research source Zani says to towel up the excess water underneath the carpet or vacuum it up with the wet/dry shop vac. It can take several days for the foam to dry. There may be a plate along the bottom edge of the car door that you have to pry off before you can get to the actual carpet sill. [3] X Research source If the carpet was heavily soaked with water , take out the car seats and remove the carpet from your car to ensure it dries completely. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this yourself, contact a professional car detailer for assistance. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Place fans inside your open car to speed up drying. Fans help generate more airflow to evaporate moisture inside your car. Simply place several box fans or standing fans inside your car or right beside it, aiming the fans at the carpet. Then, leave the fans to run for at least 2 days, or until the water in your carpet has evaporated. [5] X Research source Move the fans around throughout the day so every damp area gets dried. Just make sure to check on the fans’ progress frequently to assess the drying progress. Optional tip : Place a dehumidifier inside your car with the fans to help absorb excess moisture, especially if you’re drying your car in your garage. Or, use the dehumidifier in place of the fans.

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda on the carpet to soak up moisture. Baking soda naturally absorbs moisture in the air and on surfaces. Simply sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda over the carpet or leave 1 to 2 open boxes of baking soda in your car. Let the baking soda sit for several hours or overnight, then vacuum it up. [7] X Research source As a bonus, baking soda also absorbs and neutralizes smells. [8] X Research source Place other moisture absorbers in your car in addition to or as an alternative to baking soda. For instance, leave silica gel packets or socks filled with kitty litter or rice in your car to help draw out the water. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Hang moisture-absorbing bags inside your car as an alternative. Moisture-absorbing bags, such as DampRid bags , suck up the moisture in the areas they’re placed. So, simply hang some bags from the handles above the car doors, your rearview mirror, or the headrests on the seats. Once the water reaches the fill line on the bag, toss it and replace it with a fresh bag. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your car to a professional car detailer if it isn’t drying. If it’s been several days and your car still isn’t dry, contact a car detailer near you to dry out your car. Car detailers have professional appliances and products to help dry out your car more quickly. They can also tell you if an issue might be preventing your car from drying. Depending on the severity of the water damage, going to a car detailer can cost you anywhere from $300 to $1,000, especially if the shop has to remove and replace the carpeting."

      "content": "Use a vinegar and water solution to clean mildew out of the carpet. Put on a respirator mask and gloves . Then, mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a bottle. Spray the solution on the carpet and let it sit for 20 minutes. Then, scrub the carpet with a brush and dry it with a towel or shop vac. [11] X Research source Zani recommends repeatedly spraying the vinegar solution until the mildew smell is gone from your car. White vinegar is an effective mold and mildew killer and less harsh compared to bleach. [12] X Research source Test the solution on a hidden part of the carpet before cleaning to ensure it won’t stain. Use regular dishwashing soap instead of vinegar. Or, make a tea tree oil and water mixture. Just add 10 to 20 drops of tea tree oil to water in a spray bottle. [13] X Research source"

Simply sprinkle the borax directly onto any mold or mildew stains and let it sit for around 10 minutes. Then, vacuum up the borax. [14] X Research source Add more Borax if the stains still remain. Borax is a safe solution to use on any surface of your car. Just make sure you vacuum up any you sprinkle around to clean."
