      "content": "Start at the open end of the sleeping bag (where your head goes). Begin rolling the material tightly, keeping it very straight and pressing out any air as you go. As you roll, use one knee to press down on the sleeping bag (in between the rolling motions). This will help to keep it nice and tight. Continue rolling until you reach the opposite end of the sleeping bag. One good trick is to place a tent pole or straight stick across the top end of the sleeping bag and roll the bag around it, instead of around itself."

      "title": "Once you get to the end of the roll, you need to secure it.",
      "content": "Once you get to the end of the roll, you need to secure it. This should be relatively easy as most sleeping bags come with cords or elasticated straps attached to the bottom edge. Keep one knee pressed tightly into the center of the sleeping bag while you pull the elasticated straps evenly over the rolled bag or tie the cords around it. If you're using the cords, you can use the same basic knot you use to tie your shoelaces. If the sleeping bag has no straps or cords, simply tie a loose piece of string around both ends of the rolled bag. Once the sleeping bag is secure, you can gently pull the tent pole or stick out of the middle (if used) and pop the perfectly rolled sleeping bag into its carrier bag."
