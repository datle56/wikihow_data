      "content": "Set aside alone time in your schedule. It’s normal to spend time with friends, family, and co-workers; socialization is good—but solitude is equally important. So, create time each week to sit quietly with your own thoughts and check in with yourself. Choose a time that works for you, and pick a spot where you won’t be interrupted. [1] X Research source For example, you might choose to spend every Sunday afternoon from 3 to 5 P.M. relaxing on your own. It might feel hard or awkward to be alone with yourself at first. That’s totally okay, but try to push through your discomfort. Once you get used to it, solitude can be very valuable!"

To start this process, make a list of questions to ask yourself—anything that comes to mind. Just answer them truthfully, and be honest about who you are (and aren’t). There are no wrong answers! Consider questions like: [2] X Research source What is your purpose? How are you working towards that purpose? What makes you happy? What would you like less of in your life?"

Ask yourself if you’re as considerate to yourself as you are to your friends, and if not, try giving yourself the same compassion that you give them.

Go to source For example, you might be really supportive of your partner and encourage them to achieve their goals, so think of ways to support yourself similarly. If you’re struggling to come up with anything, start with a daily affirmation. You might say something like, “I have what it takes to run a half marathon,” or “I’m a smart and capable person!”"

      "content": "Prioritize daily self-care. The goal of practical self-care is to do healthy things that support your mental, emotional, and physical well-being. So, find ways to make self-care a part of your everyday routine, whether that means de-stressing with a quick yoga routine, unwinding with a long, hot bath, pumping yourself up by dancing around your house, or massaging the tension out of a muscle.

      "content": "Take care of your physical health. Eat a nutritious diet, exercise, and get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night to feel your best and nourish your body. It’s easy to get wrapped up in caring for others and neglect yourself, so make time for a good night’s sleep, schedule exercise just like you’d schedule any other appointment, and fuel your workouts with a balanced diet of produce, whole grains, and lean proteins. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. You might walk, hit the gym, or do a workout at home. Choose something you enjoy so exercising doesn’t feel like a chore. Prepare balanced meals like farrow, chicken breast, and roasted veggies to give you the energy you need. Pick foods you like to eat instead of going along with everyone else. Don’t sacrifice your sleep, even when life gets hectic. It’s actually counterproductive; being tired can make you cranky, exhausted, and unfocused. Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day, and avoid phones and digital devices before bed. Those emails and social media updates can wait!"

Focusing on yourself means prioritizing your needs, so get comfortable with saying “no” and practicing turning down things that might overextend you or that you don’t really want to do. While not everyone may understand your newfound focus, boundaries can prevent you from falling back on any people-pleasing habits you used to have. [9] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source People might not be trying to encroach on your boundaries; they just aren’t aware of them. So, be clear about your needs and expectations of others. While you don’t have to justify your boundaries, it might help to give a reason for them. For example, explaining that you feel burnt out could help a friend understand why you don’t want to go out. However, if someone has a negative reaction to your boundaries, let them feel their feelings without taking it personally. You’re allowed to have boundaries, just as they’re allowed to have emotions about it. Don’t be afraid to do things that feel risky or scary, like cutting a toxic person out of your life or asking your partner to meet your needs. Advocate for yourself! Remember to set boundaries when it comes to work, too. You don’t have to work overtime or come in on your day off just because someone asked you to.

That means you don’t need to get upset when others succeed or judge yourself by their standards. Make a conscious effort to worry about yourself and not them. It’ll get easier to time and practice! When a co-worker gets promoted, instead of telling yourself you’re not as good as them, try replacing those thoughts with something more positive, like, “I worked hard, and if I get some advice from my new manager, I can be even better.” Celebrate your own achievements! Recognize your victories, even the little ones, and write about them in your journal. Reflect on why you self-compare and when you usually do it. Find the pattern in your thought processes, and make a list of things that cause you to self-compare so you can avoid those triggers. For example, maybe you find yourself getting super competitive when you work out, so you could go for a solo bike ride instead of hitting a spin class with a leaderboard."
