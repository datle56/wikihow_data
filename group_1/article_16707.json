      "content": "Keep digging. Diamonds are one of the rarest things in the game to find, and occur in less than 1% of the blocks in the lower levels. Finding diamonds is more of a game of luck than anything else, and patience is the most important thing to have when mining for them. If you are lazy and don't want to do this much work, set off some TNT or craft the Wither. It's best to go into Creative Mode before setting of any explosives. Also, using explosives can shorten your time mining, but you might destroy some valuable ores like gold ore or the diamond ore you came for.(The Wither destroys any blocks in its way.) Diamond tools are important in Minecraft because they allow the player to mine materials like obsidian and Ancient Debris. [5] X Research source Obsidian allows the player to create a portal to the nether dimension. Ancient Debris provides nephrite scraps that can be crafted into Netherite ingots. [6] X Research source These ingots can create Netherite tools and armor. When combined with the diamond version of the tool or piece of armor in a smithing table, they create the most durable and efficient tools and armor in the game. [7] X Research source A player must have diamonds to create an enchanting table, which allows the player to add upgrades to their tools and armor. [8] X Research source"
