      "content": "Write a dare or rule on each block of a Jenga set. First, dump those Jenga blocks out onto the table and get writing! Each block gets a dare, new rule, or mini drinking game, and there are 54 blocks, so it’s helpful to have a pal help out. [1] X Research source Or, save it for the party and let your guests make their own prompts. Of course, we’ve also compiled tons of prompts below, to make it easier. For example, one classic prompt is “Waterfall,” where every player has to waterfall (or drink without touching their mouth to their beverage) for 5 seconds. Pen or permanent marker works best for writing on the wood Jenga blocks. Just be sure you’re alright with defacing them. Write the name of the prompt on one side of the block, and the directions for the prompt on the other."

Then, lay 3 more on top of them, with this new trio rotated 90° from (or perpendicular to) the last. Keep building the tower until you run out of blocks. [2] X Research source"

Going clockwise around the table, each player takes a turn trying to finagle a Jenga block out of the tower (but not from the top 3 rows). If they’re successful, they read the prompt on the block aloud, then perform it. After, they stack the block on top of the tower in the typical fashion—perpendicular to the top row. [3] X Research source Play with as many players as you want, just keep in mind that the more players you have, the fewer turns each player will get to take. With huge groups, some players may not get to take a turn, but you can always play multiple rounds. Let the youngest player go first (just make sure they’re of drinking age)."
