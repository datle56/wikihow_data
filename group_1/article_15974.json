      "title": "Enter Elenwen’s solar from the Thalmor Embassy courtyard.",
      "content": "Enter Elenwen’s solar from the Thalmor Embassy courtyard. After Malborn lets you into the off-limits section of the embassy, your objective in the Diplomatic Immunity quest should be “Search for information about the dragons returning.” To do that, head to the back of the embassy and out the door into an outdoor courtyard area. You’ll find a guarded door leading to Elenwen’s solar at the other end of the courtyard. It’s up to you whether you want to sneak past the guards inside the embassy and courtyard or fight your way through them. Thalmor guards patrol both floors of the embassy. You can loot potions, ingredients, and simple supplies around the embassy before heading to the courtyard, but you may run into patrols. Note: If your Dragonborn is a High Elf (Altmer), you have an even easier solution: grab a set of hooded Thalmor robes and use them as a disguise! However, the disguise won’t work in Elenwen’s solar."

      "title": "Search the northwestern chest in Elenwen’s solar.",
      "content": "Search the northwestern chest in Elenwen’s solar. Once inside Elenwen’s solar, you’ll hear Rulindil (a Thalmor torturer) and Gissur (his informant) talking; their conversation will make it clear the Thalmor are just as clueless about the dragons as Delphine. You can fight Rulindil, Gissur, and the guard here, or let them finish talking and leave before looting the chest. [1] X Research source The chest in the northwestern corner of the room contains the Interrogation Chamber Key as well as Thalmor dossiers on Delphine, Ulfric Stormcloak, and the Thalmor dragon investigation. If you kill Rulindil before he goes downstairs, you can take the key from his body instead! In Rulindil’s office, you can also find elven daggers and some other lootable valuables."

      "content": "Enter the Thalmor embassy dungeon. Follow the Diplomatic Immunity quest marker to the dungeon door, which is located down a set of wooden stairs next to the main room on the first floor. The dungeon door itself is metal and requires a key (the one you took from either the chest or Rulindil) to open. [2] X Research source Remember, if you didn’t already kill Rulindil, he’ll be in the dungeon—so be prepared!"

    {
      "title": "Read Esbern’s dossier to trigger the next quest objective.",
      "content": "Read Esbern’s dossier to trigger the next quest objective. In the dungeon and interrogation chamber, loot the chest next to Rulindil’s desk (next to all the holding cells). Inside, you’ll find another Thalmor dossier on Esbern. Read it, and you’ll get the next Diplomatic Immunity objective: “Escape the Thalmor embassy.” [3] X Research source Before reading the dossier, consider looking around the dungeon. You can free Etienne Rarnis (a prisoner and member of the Thieves Guild) while you’re there. You can also interrogate Etienne to get the information about Esbern you need (if that’s more your style)."

      "title": "Take the Reeking Cave trapdoor key from the Thalmor guards.",
      "content": "Take the Reeking Cave trapdoor key from the Thalmor guards. After reading Esbern’s dossier, a pair of Thalmor guards will enter the dungeon with Malborn, who has been exposed as a mole and is about to be killed. The guards have the Reeking Cave key—labeled “Trap Door Key,”—so take them out (and try to save Malborn if you’re a heroic type of Dragonborn). [4] X Research source Loot the Thalmor guards’ bodies once they’re dead. One of the two will have the key! You can also try to pickpocket the guards and steal the key if you’re a master of stealth. If you caused a distraction with Brelas’ help at the party, you’ll get the chance to save her now (along with Malborn)."

      "title": "Escape through the Reeking Cave trapdoor.",
      "content": "Escape through the Reeking Cave trapdoor. After you get the key, head to the trapdoor across from the prison cells (when you get to the bottom of the stairs leading into the dungeon, it’s directly on the other side of the wooden wall to your left). Approach the trapdoor (“Reeking Cave”) and use the key to unlock it. Jump inside, and you’ll find yourself on an underground path. [5] X Research source If you freed Etienne Rarnis before taking out the Thalmor guards, he’ll be waiting for you next to the trapdoor and go through it once it’s unlocked."

    {
      "title": "Follow the underground path outside to escape the embassy.",
      "content": "Follow the underground path outside to escape the embassy. Stick to the path, and you’ll naturally reach the cave’s exit. Along the way, you’ll run into an angry Frost Troll (which is your last obstacle). Kill it as fast as you can using any weapons or spells in your possession, then keep running along the underground path until it leads you safely to the woods outside the embassy. [6] X Research source You’ll also find a Stone of Barenziah and a skill book in the Frost Troll’s lair—so stick around to loot if you can. Congratulations—with that, you’ve escaped the Thalmor embassy and can return to Delphine in Riverwood to complete Diplomatic Immunity!"

      "content": "Talk to Delphine in Riverwood before traveling to Solitude. Delphine will tell you a little about the Blades’ past (and their enmity with the Thalmor), explaining her suspicions that the Thalmor are behind the dragons’ return. To get proof, she’ll concoct a plan to infiltrate the Thalmor embassy during one of Ambassador Elenwen’s parties and tell you to meet her inside man—Malborn—in Solitude to get started. To meet with Delphine, just enter the Sleeping Giant Inn after “A Blade in the Dark” and follow her into her secret basement area."

After chatting with him, he’ll tell you that he can smuggle some of your equipment into the embassy for you to use during the infiltration, but you have to part with it right away. Choose the equipment you want for the rest of “Diplomatic Immunity” and give it to Malborn. [7] X Research source It’s a good idea to give Malborn the equipment you prefer using; it’s possible to run into quite a few battles in the Thalmor embassy, so you’ll need quality supplies. Unless you plan on fighting your way through the embassy, consider picking equipment that’s ideal for stealth, too. Consider giving Malborn a few lockpicks to ensure you can loot locked containers in the embassy."

Once you put the clothes on, she’ll take the rest of your equipment (don’t worry, you’ll get it back later) and send you on your way. Your Dragonborn will automatically get into the carriage to the embassy! [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a distraction at the Thalmor party. You’ll be dropped off outside the embassy. As you head in, guards will check your invitation, and Elenwen will greet you. Don’t worry: no matter what you say, Malborn interrupts her. He’ll then tell you to get one of the other guests to create a distraction so he can sneak you through the back door. Luckily, there are plenty of people you can ask for help: [9] X Research source Balgruuf the Greater - If you’ve finished the Civil War quest “Battle for Whiterun,” Balgruuf will attend and agree to help you. Elisif the Fair - If you’ve helped Elisif by bringing Torygg’s war horn to a shrine of Talos, she’ll agree to help. Erikur - If you speak to Erikur, you can pass a persuasion check to get his help. General Tullius - If you’ve completed “Message to Whiterun” (and you’re on the Imperials’ side), you can ask him for help. Idgrod Ravencrone - As long as Hjaalmarch is still under the Imperials’ control, Idgrod will attend. If you’ve completed “Laid to Rest,” she’ll agree to help you. Igmund - Igmund is a possible attendee. If you pass a persuasion check, he’ll help you. Maven Black-Briar - She’ll always attend (unless she’s the Jarl of Riften) and can agree to help you. Ondolemar - He may attend as long as Markarth is under Imperial control. If you’ve completed “Search and Seizure,” you can persuade him to help. Orthus Endario - If you’ve completed “Rise in the East,” Orthus will agree to help when asked. Proventus Avenicci - As long as you’re not in the middle of the “Whispering Door” or “Message to Whiterun” quests, he can help you. Razelan - This attendee will always help you; all you have to do is bring him a drink. Siddgeir - If you’ve already become Thane of Falkreath, Siddgeir can be persuaded to help you. Vittoria Vici - If you’ve completed the miscellaneous quest “The Spiced Wine” (and Vittoria is alive), she can be persuaded to help."

Malborn will bring you through a kitchen and into a pantry, where your equipment will be waiting in a chest. Take a moment to grab everything inside, then proceed through the door ahead into the next hallway. After this, you’ll be right where the guide on escaping the embassy above picks up! Malborn will lock the door behind you, so much sure you’ve done everything you wanted to do beforehand."

Now’s the time to grab it and check back in with Delphine while you’re at it. Travel to Riverwood’s Sleeping Giant Inn to see Delphine and complete Diplomatic Immunity. [10] X Research source Your equipment will be in Delphine’s chest (which is inside her basement hideout). When you talk to her, Delphine will give you your next task—finding Esbern—and Diplomatic Immunity will complete. The next quest, “A Cornered Rat,” will then appear in your journal."
