      "content": "Check the firmness of the cushions, as well as the foam and batting. If the cushions feel too soft, then you may need to add more filling. Open up the individual cushion cover and remove the insides. Batting is fabric used in upholstery to give the cushions a smooth appearance. It is usually made of cotton or wool, but can also be a blend of materials, including polyester. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source If the foam has noticeable dents in it, you may need to replace the entire cushion. If the batting is worn, but the foam is fine, you can get by with just replacing the batting."

      "title": "Replace the foam or the batting.",
      "content": "Replace the foam or the batting. Determine what needs to be replaced in your cushions. You can buy both foam and batting online or at an upholstery supply store. When buying new pieces of foam core, make sure to cut them to size to replace the insides. You can also stuff your couch cushions with a different material if you prefer. You don't have to use foam. Instead, you can find cotton, down, and even old clothing if you wanted to. The material you use will affect the softness of the couch. Make sure you like the firmness before you stuff every cushion. Consider the durability of your materials. Some materials may not hold up well, but foam padding could last you for years to come."

      "content": "Replace the cushion covers. Once you've repaired your cushions you can place them back in their covers. Sit on the couch to make sure the cushions were the only issue with the sagging couch. If the couch still sags, inspect the frame again."

      "title": "Check the slats.",
      "content": "Check the slats. If the wooden boards that support the couch frame have broken, you will need to replace the wood and screws. Measure the slats and take note of how many you need. You should be able to buy your material at a hardware store. If you need to, take a slat for reference to make sure you get exactly what you need. You could also place a piece of plywood between the frame and the cushions for added support. This isn't a permanent solution, and it could make the couch a little firmer than you'd like. Use wood glue to seal the ends. Use a staple gun with long, thick staples, or a hammer and very thin nails, to secure the beam in place."

If you see any cracked wood, or wood that is \"bowed\" out, you'll need to replace it. This will involve taking off most of the upholstery fabric and can be time-consuming. [13] X Research source You may have to remove some of the fabric on the bottom, known as a dust cover, to inspect the springs. Be gentle and take care not to rip the fabric. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Take note of what kind of springs your couch has. Some couches have zig-zag springs which are also known as \"sagless\" springs. Other couches use coiled springs. Determine whether your springs are bent or broken. If the springs are bent you may be able to fix them yourself. If they're broken you may need to bring your couch to an upholsterer. Older couches tend to have coiled springs, while newer couches have zig-zag springs. Your couch may not have springs at all, depending on the quality of the frame. Check the space beneath the cushions. You may find that the slats or straps of the couch have snapped."
