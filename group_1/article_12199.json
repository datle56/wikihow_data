      "content": "Leave your ear canal alone. For the majority of people, this is really all you need to do. Don’t pour or stick anything into your ear, and don’t try to scrape anything out. The human ear is designed to be self-cleaning, and earwax flows outward to facilitate this process. So, in almost all cases, there is no reason to go digging around in there. [3] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Earwax lubricates, hydrates, and offers some protection to the delicate components of the ear canal. It also possesses antibacterial properties, and naturally carries nasty stuff out of your ear canal.

Additionally, chewing and other jaw motions help push wax outward."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Using a cotton swab (or a rolled up napkin corner, etc.) to clean your ears will probably just push earwax down further toward your eardrum. [6] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Even worse, because of the thin skin and sensitive components inside your ear, you can easily cause punctures or other damage. Most cases of impacted earwax are caused by ill-advised cleaning methods that push wax down against the eardrum."

      "content": "Clean the outside of your ear. If you want to get rid of ear wax, wait until it emerges from your ear canal. Then, wipe it and the rest of your ear with a soft, moist cloth or cotton ball. You can even use those cotton swabs — that you’ve stopped sticking into your ear — to get to all the nooks and crannies on the outer part of your ear.

      "title": "Recognize signs of impaction.",
      "content": "Recognize signs of impaction. Cerumen (earwax) impaction almost always happens due to human habits, like regularly sticking foreign objects — including cotton swabs, hearing aids, earbuds, earplugs, or a stethoscope — into your ears. If you develop an earwax impaction, you’ll probably use terms like “clogged,” “full” or “plugged up” to describe the feeling in your ear. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Wax buildup on the eardrum can also cause muffled hearing or even progressive hearing loss. Other common symptoms of impaction include earaches; ringing in the ears (tinnitus); ear canal itchiness; discharge that may smell foul; and coughing spells."

      "content": "See your doctor for impaction removal. In most cases, your doctor will use some combination of irrigation and manual extraction to remove impacted earwax. Any pain should be minimal, and you will probably feel the difference (and possibly notice improved hearing) almost immediately.

      "content": "Skip the earwax candles. Earwax candles are little more than hollow paper tubes lined with wax. Supposedly, when one end is lit and the other is placed in your ear, the candle will draw out earwax via a vacuum effect. If this all sounds a bit far-fetched to you, rest assured that science agrees with you. [10] X Research source Plainly stated, there is no reliable evidence that these candles work in the least, and ample evidence that they can cause burns, fires, and punctured eardrums."

If you want to try to loosen and drain out excess earwax yourself by introducing a liquid, pick a safe option like salt water, baby oil, or (especially) mineral oil. Commercial earwax cleaning solutions are also available for purchase.
