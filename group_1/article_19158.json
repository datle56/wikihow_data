[1] X Research source The first step to confronting and overcoming your fears is identifying these causes. [2] X Research source Take some time to think about the events in your life that may have led to the development of your commitment issues. Go over your past relationships. Did you have any particularly messy breakups? Did a partner’s infidelity deeply wound you? Think about your childhood. Was your parents’ marriage happy, or did they fight often? Did they go through a divorce when you were young? Did you feel neglected or alone when you were a child? Did your caregivers emotionally support you, or were they absent? All of these things can contribute to a fear of commitment. [3] X Research source"

Some people avoid committing because they’re afraid there’s a better match out there, or they have an idealized vision of how the relationship should look. There’s no such thing as a “perfect” relationship, and it’s important to remember that every couple deals with setbacks from time to time. [8] X Research source Remember that the depictions of couples you see on TV, in movies, or on social media are often idealized and not realistic. Try not to compare your relationship to these representations, and instead focus on connecting with your partner. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice open communication with your partner. You might try to hide your reluctance to commit because you’re afraid of offending your partner, but this does more harm than good. It’s important to be honest and voice your fears, so that you and your significant other can get on the same page and work through your worries together. [10] X Research source If your partner asked to take things to the next level and you’re afraid, try to be open about this, rather than just shutting down. For example, you could say, “Last night you asked me if we could start talking about moving in together, and I’m not sure I’m ready for this step. I’m feeling a little afraid.” Actively listen to your partner’s response to show that you’re present and that you truly value their opinion. [11] X Research source For example, they might say, “Every time I bring up marriage, you shut down. I don’t know if you’ll ever want to get married.” In response, you could say, “It sounds like you’re worried I won’t ever be ready for marriage. That’s not what I’m saying—I’m just saying that I’m not ready right now, but I want to work through this with you.”"

Often, people with commitment issues do not pursue people they really like because they’re afraid of getting into a real, serious relationship.

While rejection can be painful, it's not the end of the world. See the setback as a chance to make yourself braver. If the person you are interested in is also interested in you, great!

For example, if you know you’re the kind of person who needs a lot of alone time and likes to take things slow, look for someone who will be respectful, patient, and understanding of what you’re going through. This means being upfront about your commitment issues (and the fact that you’re working on them) from the get-go. Although this may be scary, hiding your fears just causes more issues down the road. Be direct and open with the person you’re dating, and if they’re the right person for you, they’ll understand! [14] X Research source"

Note any areas in your life that cause you frequent stress or anxiety, and consider whether commitment issues could be to blame. Does your fear of commitment in relationships also show up in other parts of your life? If you see a pattern, you may want to discuss this with your counselor or therapist to break the cycle. [15] X Research source For example, you may be renting an apartment because the idea of owning property and being “stuck” somewhere is terrifying. Or, you may struggle with staying in one job for a long period of time. Think about ways to make these types of commitment phobia easier for you to manage. You may find rewarding yourself for sticking to a plan is the key to your consistency. If you stay in a job for two years, for instance, you could reward yourself with a cruise."

[16] X Research source The term gamophobia comes from the Greek words “gamos,” which means marriage, and “phobos,” which means fear. [17] X Research source Though this phenomenon is most commonly talked about in a romantic context, those who have it may struggle with making long-term plans in general.
