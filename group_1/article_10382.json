      "content": "Hold the mist roughly 5 in (13 cm) away from your legs as you spray. This ensures you get even coverage to avoid splotches. As you move the spray along your leg, keep it the same distance from your skin the entire time so your application is as even as possible. [3] X Research source If you're worried about the spray getting on other things, spray your legs outside if it's warm or in your bathroom for easy cleanup."

      "title": "Rub it into your skin thoroughly if the directions say to do so.",
      "content": "Rub it into your skin thoroughly if the directions say to do so. Some sprays tell you to spray the mist over your legs and then rub it in to make sure it’s completely even. If your instructions say to do this, use your hands to rub the spray in using circular motions, working it into every part of your legs. [5] X Research source Wash your hands after you rub in the spray to help get any excess makeup off of your skin. Spray tanners can stain your skin, so it's especially important to clean your hands right after you're done."

      "content": "Wait several minutes for the spray to dry before getting dressed. The instructions on your spray will tell you exactly how long it takes to dry, but it’s usually about 5 minutes. After your spray dries, it’s okay to put on pants or whatever clothing you’re wearing. [6] X Research source Spray 1-2 more layers of your body makeup or self tanner, if needed.

Squeeze out a tiny amount of the color corrector and put it directly on top of any spots, being careful not to apply it to unblemished skin. [8] X Research source If your color corrector comes with a makeup wand for applying it, apply the corrector right on top of the spot using the wand."

      "content": "Dab the color corrector using your finger to blend it in smoothly. Instead of rubbing the color corrector into your skin, use your finger to gently dab it repeatedly until it’s covering up the area you’d like to hide. This will help the color stay in place so that it doesn’t spread too far from the spot. [9] X Research source If you’re covering up a large bruise with the color corrector, try using a beauty blender to spread it evenly."
