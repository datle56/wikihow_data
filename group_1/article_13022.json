[1] X Research source The Shorts panel will reappear in 30 days, so just click the X again when it comes back. While it's not a permanent solution, it does help to minimize distractions. Unfortunately, you'll still see YouTube Shorts in the mobile app, even if you use the Not Interested trick on your computer. Shorts will also still appear on the Subscriptions page. If you want the 30-day YouTube Shorts break to apply to your phone or tablet, sign in to YouTube using your mobile web browser instead of the YouTube app. But there's a catch: You'll need to open YouTube.com in desktop mode —this will be fine on an iPad or Android tablet, but can be a little hard to navigate on a smaller phone screen."

Since YouTube Shorts is a newer feature, you can get rid of it by reinstalling an older version of YouTube that didn't have Shorts.

[4] X Research source To get an old version of the YouTube app, you'll need to install it from an APK file instead of the Play Store. You can get the last version of YouTube that didn't have Shorts, version 14.12.56.16, from APKMirror . If you're new to installing APK files, check out our helpful guide . You'll also need to disable Play Store updates to prevent your older version of YouTube from updating automatically. In the Play Store app, tap your profile and select Manage apps & device.
