      "content": "Wear safety goggles, helmet, and kevlar chaps. Safety goggles and a helmet or hard hat will protect your head and eyes from falling debris, which is one of the main injuries that occur from cutting down trees. Kevlar chaps will protect your legs from chainsaw grazes. [2] X Research source You can purchase all of this safety gear online or at a hardware store."

      "title": "Survey the area around the tree for structures.",
      "content": "Survey the area around the tree for structures. Take a look at the area around the tree to make sure there aren’t structures or other trees in the area where you want it to fall. Things like power lines, fences, and roads should all be considered before you fell a tree. You’ll want there to be an area that’s cleared out where the tree is free to fall. If there are a lot of structures around the tree, consider hiring professionals rather than doing it yourself. Cutting down a tree so that it falls into another tree could start a potentially dangerous domino effect."

      "title": "Examine the tree for stability and lean.",
      "content": "Examine the tree for stability and lean. Make sure that your tree is healthy and free of disease or the cutting down process could be unpredictable. Similarly, you’ll want to make sure that the tree isn’t leaning significantly in a certain direction because then you won’t be able to control the direction it falls in. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine the fall path of the tree.",
      "content": "Determine the fall path of the tree. The fall path should be free of structures, roads, and other trees. Make sure that there's enough space for the tree to fall on its side without colliding with anything else. Estimate the height of the tree, then use a tape measure to measure the distance from the base of the tree to an area that's free of objects. This will be your fall path. [4] X Research source To control the fall path, you'll cut a notch in the side of the tree that you want it to fall on. Before you cut the tree down, remove the side branches.

      "content": "Plan an escape route for after the tree falls. Once you get to know the area around you, you can establish a route to walk in as the tree is falling. You should never stand or walk in front or behind a falling tree. Make sure there is a clear path to walk in and step at least 15 feet (4.6 m) to the side of the tree as it falls."

Turn on the chainsaw and carefully cut down into the tree at a 70-degree angle. The top of the notch should be the shallowest part of the cut, while the bottom of the notch will be the deepest area of the cut. The chainsaw should not go more than ⅓ through the tree. The bottom of the notch cut should be 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) off the ground. [6] X Research source Hold onto the handle tightly with both hands so you have full control over the chainsaw."

      "title": "Make a bore cut through the other side of the tree.",
      "content": "Make a bore cut through the other side of the tree. A bore cut is when you insert the tip of the saw blade into the tree instead of cutting the tree from its side. Line up the chainsaw blade 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) away from the edge of the notch cut, and push it all the way through the tree. Then, continue sawing into the opposite direction of the notch until you make a clean horizontal cut through the other end of the tree.
