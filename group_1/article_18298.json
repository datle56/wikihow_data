      "content": "Dishwasher drainage issues are typically caused by accumulated debris. When the spray arms rinse food and grease off the dishes during a cycle, the resulting debris can collect in various parts of the dishwasher. It's also possible that your drain pump is damaged or malfunctioning. Most of these are easy DIY fixes! Below is a list of the most common causes of a dishwasher not draining: Dishwasher needs to be reset Drain hose kinks or leaks Drain hose obstruction Full filter Air gap clog Garbage disposal blockage Faulty drain pump"

Press it down for at least 3 seconds to start a manual draining cycle. You can also try unplugging the dishwasher for a few minutes and then plugging it back in to reset it. [1] X Research source"

Shine a flashlight into the hole and clean out any debris you see with a stiff brush (like a toothbrush) and water. Then, replace the air gap and its cover. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Check for blockages in the drain hose by blowing into it. If the air doesn't flow through, there's something blocking it. You can try removing the obstacle with a flat-head screwdriver or a straightened wire hanger, but if that doesn't work or the clog is too deep, the best option is to replace the hose. [4] X Research source Don't use a pipe cleaner to unclog the drain hose! The pipe cleaner has sharp edges and may puncture the hose."

      "content": "Check the drain hose for kinks or holes. Locate the drain hose under the sink and try to straighten out any kinks you find. After that, look for holes or signs of water leaking from the hose. If you find any, replace the hose with one that Frigidaire recommends for your particular model. [5] X Research source To replace the drain hose : Unplug the dishwasher, shut off the water supply valve behind the appliance, and unscrew the counter mounts with a drill or screwdriver. Then, unscrew and remove the kickplate under the dishwasher and lower the feet by turning them clockwise if they aren't already touching the floor. Arrange towels on the floor to catch any water that drips out, then slide the dishwasher out from under the cabinet. Lay it on its back or side so you can access the bottom. Next, detach the drain hose from the drain pump on the bottom of the dishwasher and the air gap at the other (if you don't have an air gap, the drain hose may be connected to the drainpipe under the sink or to the garbage disposal unit). Connect the new hose, ensure it's free of kinks, and make sure the connections are secure."

      "content": "Pull out the drain filter or glass trap and clean out the debris. Remove the bottom rack from your dishwasher and locate the drain filter or glass trap handle. Unscrew it counterclockwise and pull it out. Rinse it in warm water to remove any food debris, let it dry, and put it back in the dishwasher. [6] X Research source To remove stubborn food and grime, soak the filter or glass trap in warm, soapy water for 10 minutes. You can also use a soft brush to scrub off stubborn debris. Rinse the soap off and let it dry before reinstalling it. [7] X Research source Cleaning expert Chris Willatt recommends cleaning your drain filter once a month and your whole dishwasher every six months. To eliminate hard mineral deposit buildup (which can also contribute to clogging), Willatt says to fill the dishwasher with 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 in (0.64 cm) of vinegar and run a full cycle with it. The acidity in the vinegar will dissolve the minerals."

      "content": "Inspect the check valve to ensure it's not stuck closed. The check valve is located on the bottom of your Frigidaire dishwasher, just inside the drain tube. To access it, unplug the dishwasher, slide it out from under the counter, and set it on its back. Then, disconnect the drain hose from the drain tube and evaluate the condition of the rubber check valve flap. If it's stuck or the tube is blocked with debris, clear it to fix the issue.

      "content": "Inspect the drain pump for signs of wear and tear. The drain pump is located on the bottom of the dishwasher, so you'll need to unplug it, turn off the water supply, and unscrew and remove the kickplate to access it. [9] X Research source Disconnect the wires from the drain pump and use a nut driver to loosen the hose clamp. Then, lower the support feet (if necessary), pull the dishwasher out from under the counter, and lay the dishwasher on its side or back. Locate the drain pump on the bottom of the dishwasher. Use a set of channel locks to grip the drain pump hose clamp and move it to one side. Next, use a thin tool like pliers or a screwdriver to leverage the plastic tabs holding the pump in place, so you can pop the pump off. If the pump appears cracked, brittle, or broken: Replace it with a brand-new one that matches Frigidaire's recommendation for your model. Align it and push it into place, and then use your channel locks to squeeze the clamps back into place. Reattach the drain hose, screw the hose clamp back on, and put your dishwasher back into place."

Your dishwasher could have a serious problem, and you might cause more damage if you troubleshoot it yourself. Signs of deeper issues with your dishwasher include a persistent clog, leaks outside the appliance, and strange noises coming from the pump motor."
