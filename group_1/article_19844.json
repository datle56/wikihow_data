      "content": "Do 4 sets of 12 basic crunches . Start by lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your fingertips behind your head, inhale, then exhale as you raise your upper back off of the floor. Raise your torso for about 2 seconds, then gently inhale as you lower yourself back to the floor. [1] X Research source Be sure not to tug your head upward with your hands. Keep your head, neck, and back aligned, and avoid arching your lower back as you lift your torso. Repeat the steps to complete a set of 12 crunches. Raise your torso just enough to lift your shoulder blades off of the ground. A crunch can safely engage your abs, but a full sit-up (or raising yourself all the way to your knees) can strain the lower back. [2] X Research source To increase difficulty, try holding a weight over your torso as you do crunches. Start out light, such as with a 5 to 10 lb (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight, to avoid injury.
