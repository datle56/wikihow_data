      "content": "Take a small section of hair from the right side of the parting. Gather a small section of hair from along your forehead, starting from the parting. This first section of hair needs to be thick enough to divide into 3 strands, so approximately 2 cm (0.79 in) thick will work well. Run your fingers through this section of your hair to make sure that it is tangle-free. [2] X Research source Choose the side of your head that is the most comfortable for you to start with. A general rule is that if you are right-handed it will be easiest to begin on the left side and vice versa if you are left-handed. However, try out starting the braid on each side first to see which feels more natural.

Cross the right strand of hair under the middle strand so that it becomes the new middle strand. Then cross the left strand under the middle strand to make the next, new middle strand.

[6] X Expert Source Matt King Director of Education, Fox and Jane Salon Group Expert Interview. 31 August 2021. Although it can seem complicated, a Dutch braid is actually very simple once you get enough practice with it. It is exactly the same as a French braid, except each section of hair is crossed under rather than over. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a small extra section of hair to each strand as you cross it under. After beginning the Dutch braid, pick up an extra section of hair from the same side as the strand and then gather it into the strand. Then cross the right strand under the middle as normal. Do the same action to the left strand of hair to create a Dutch French braid that wraps around your hairline. [8] X Research source Make sure that you are working around your head and gathering hair from around your hairline, rather than working over your head and moving towards the top. The size of the extra sections of hair that you pick up depends on the thickness of your hair. Try adding a 1 cm (0.39 in) thick section each time as a starting point."

Aim towards the back of your head as you work. Continue gathering more hair into each section before you cross it below the middle strand. [9] X Research source Make sure that your hair feels taut as you are braiding. This is because you can always loosen it once you’re done, but you cannot make it tighter. [10] X Research source"

[11] X Research source You can still hold the braid to keep it in place using 1 hand while you bring the other arm over your head.

[14] X Research source Knowing which strand is which can get complicated when you change the position of your hands. However, saying aloud whether the right or left strand needs to be gathered or crossed next after you change position can help. [15] X Research source Work as slowly as you like and don’t feel that you need to rush. A halo braid is a complicated hairstyle which does take a lot of practice.
