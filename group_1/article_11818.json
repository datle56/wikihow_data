[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can help your partner deal with these symptoms by handling things like the dishes, laundry, yard work, and general tidying. That way, they'll be able to get the relaxation they need without stressing about all the stuff that still needs to be done. [3] X Research source Try saying something like, \"I want you to rest today, so I'll take care of the laundry, and dinner. Is there anything else that needs to be done that I might not know about?\" If your partner feels like they carry most of the weight of the chores, they might feel especially irritated about it when they have PMS. However, even if you normally split the housework evenly, do your best to give them a break around the time of their menstrual cycle. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Make healthy foods that might ease inflammation. Not only will cooking dinner for your partner be a nice treat, but certain foods might even help decrease some of their PMS symptoms. Choose healthy foods that are rich in nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, iron, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids.< However, avoid food that's high in salt or animal fats, as well as alcohol—all of these can make PMS symptoms worse.ref> https://www.thewomens.org.au/health-information/periods/healthy-periods/exercise-diet-periods </ref> Fish like salmon and sardines are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. However, also include meals with red meat or chicken, which provide iron and protein. Other healthy, PMS-friendly foods include broccoli, bok choy, tofu, low-fat dairy products, brown rice, couscous, nuts, and seeds. If you're not much of a cook, plan ahead so you can order take-out, or ask a family friend if they could send a meal over.

Everybody's version of self-care is different—your partner might want to take a long bath, go for a peaceful walk, spend time in the garden, or just curl up in front of the TV. [6] X Research source Whatever it is, make sure your partner knows it's totally okay to take some time to do that. Then, do your best to make sure they have the space to make it happen. If you and your partner have kids, take them out for an afternoon so your partner can have some quiet alone time."

That might just make your partner feel a little better when they're struggling with their PMS symptoms, especially if you know they usually crave chocolate around that time. [11] X Research source Try bringing home a small bar of high-quality dark chocolate. Steer clear of milk chocolate, though—it's high in fat and sugar, which can make PMS symptoms worse. Chocolate does contain small amounts of caffeine, which some experts suggest avoiding during PMS. [12] X Research source However, there's some scientific evidence that caffeine doesn't have much effect on PMS symptoms, so if your partner enjoys it, there's probably nothing to worry about.

      "content": "Try to anticipate when their symptoms will start. Make a note in a desk calendar or your phone each time your partner's period starts. Pay attention to when their symptoms are most severe. For some people, their symptoms will start a few days before their menstrual cycle and will peak a few days later. As you become more familiar with the pattern, it will be easier to plan around their PMS symptoms, so you'll know when you need to be home to help out with chores or offer emotional support. [14] X Research source You can also use an app to track your partner's cycles. Some even come with a feature to track individual symptoms. Although menstrual cycles are often called \"monthly\" cycles, most aren't exactly 30 days long. Tracking your partner's cycle will make it easier to know when to expect the onset of PMS. If your partner doesn't already track their cycle, they might find that they're more mentally equipped to handle their symptoms once they can anticipate them."

They might not physically feel up to it, or they might just not have the emotional space for being around friends for a couple of days. That's totally normal, so try not to schedule plans as a couple during that time, and ask them if they want to reschedule if their menstrual cycle shows up unexpectedly. Be considerate if you plan to go out without your partner, too. For instance, you might ask them if they'd rather you stay in and keep them company. If you do go out, offer to have dinner delivered, or run out and pick up their favorite snack before you leave."

      "content": "Sometimes, your partner might feel emotionally overwhelmed. This might come in the form of depression, anger, or irritability. They might even take it out on you sometimes. It's completely fine to let them know if they've crossed a line, but if they're just being a little snappy or short-tempered, try to respond in a calm, reassuring way. If you can avoid getting frustrated, it's more likely to just blow over, rather than turning into a full-on argument. If your partner gets upset, acknowledge that their emotions are real—even if you don't totally understand where they're coming from in that moment."

      "content": "Your partner might feel like you're making light of their discomfort. It's disrespectful and demeaning to make jokes about your partner being difficult during \"that time of the month,\" or to ask if they're on their period because they're upset with you. And since your partner might already be feeling irritable, it could potentially lead to a big argument. It's best to only talk about your partner's menstrual cycle in a supportive, empathetic way. If your partner is the type to make jokes about their own PMS, it's fine to laugh along with them, but it's a good idea to follow up with something positive. For instance, if they say, \"There I go crying at a pet food commercial. I guess I know what time of the month it is,\" you might say, \"Yeah, but you make the cutest face every time you see that puppy!\""

      "content": "Let them take the lead on any bedroom activities. Although everyone's body is different, many people actually have a higher-than-normal libido during PMS, so your partner might be really interested in being intimate during that time. On the other hand, some people experience zero interest in sex when they have PMS—and for some people, it might be different every time! Because each person's experience varies so widely, it's important to let your partner decide what they're comfortable with. If you're not comfortable having sex during your partner's menstrual cycle and they have a really high sex drive during that time, try talking to them about different activities that you would enjoy so both of your needs are being met."
