      "title": "Opt for skinny jeans or baggy pants with a man's shirt for clothing.",
      "content": "Opt for skinny jeans or baggy pants with a man's shirt for clothing. You can choose a t-shirt, polo, or button-up, depending on the style you prefer. If it's cool outside, wearing a jacket can add an extra layer of disguise. Accessorizing your look with a hat and sunglasses will make it harder for people to see through your disguise. If you typically carry a purse, switch to a backpack or man's wallet."

      "title": "Wear a sports bra if you want to hide your chest.",
      "content": "Wear a sports bra if you want to hide your chest. A sports bra is a safe way to minimize your chest without accidentally damaging your breast tissue. However, you may still have a visible chest, especially if you're curvy. If this is the case, you might try wearing baggier clothing or a jacket to make your chest less visible. You can also wear a binder bra. [1] X Research source Don't feel pressured to wear anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Some boys have bigger chests, so don't worry if your breasts are noticeable."

      "title": "Style your hair short or create a longer boyish hairstyle.",
      "content": "Style your hair short or create a longer boyish hairstyle. Short hair is stereotypical for boys, so creating a shorter style will give people one less thing to question about your disguise. You could also wear a longer style, as many boys do. As another option, you can cover your hair with a hat, if you like. If you don't want to cut your long hair but want a shorter style, you can make your hair look short by tying it back and wearing a hat. Simply create a deep part to the side, then slick your hair down and put it in a low ponytail. Next, wrap the length of your ponytail into a tight bun. Wear a hat to cover the bun. [2] X Research source As another option, wear a short wig to change up your hairstyle."

      "title": "Use stage makeup to look more like a boy if you want to enhance your disguise.",
      "content": "Use stage makeup to look more like a boy if you want to enhance your disguise. Apply a foundation that matches your normal skin tone. Then, make short strokes with an eyebrow pencil to change the shape of your natural eyebrows so they appear larger. Next, dip a porous makeup sponge, called a stipple sponge, into black and brown face paint and blot it onto your jawline and upper lip to create a beard and mustache. Finally, rub a foundation darker than your skin color around your eyes to make them look more deep-set. [3] X Research source Use an eyebrow pencil that matches the color of your brows. If you have light-color hair and won't be wearing a wig, you might decide to use yellow and brown face paint to create your beard and mustache. You want to use at least 2 shades for your beard and mustache because they're typically more than one color. If you're too young to have a beard and mustache, skip this step and avoid wearing makeup instead."

      "title": "Cut your fingernails short and keep them polish-free if you like.",
      "content": "Cut your fingernails short and keep them polish-free if you like. Although some boys love wearing nail polish, it's more common for them to keep their nails unpolished. That means your disguise may be more convincing if you skip the nail polish. Gender norms are changing, so more and more boys are sporting nail polish. Don't worry about taking off your nail polish if you like the way it looks with your boy disguise. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear cologne so you smell more like a boy.",
      "content": "Wear cologne so you smell more like a boy. Although this step is optional, using men's cologne will make people associate your smell with a male. Choose a scent that you like, and spritz a light mist onto your neck or wrists. Rather than buying a bottle of cologne just for your disguise, try borrowing one. Alternatively, get a sample from a store like Sephora."

      "content": "Shave any face or body hair that will be exposed for a stereotypical look. This will most likely include your face and possibly your legs. Additionally, you might also shave your armpits if you plan to wear a sleeveless top. However, it's up to you whether or not you want to take this extra step, as more and more girls are choosing not to shave their body hair. [5] X Research source Since you are biologically a male, shaving will help your look be more convincing. At the same time, your preferences are what's important."

      "content": "Pick a unisex outfit if you want an easy style. Jeans paired with a top or T-shirt is a common outfit for girls. Similarly, leggings and an oversized shirt can give a cute look that is easy to imitate. With the right accessories, you can make a simple, unisex style look very feminine. For example, you might belt a long t-shirt over a pair of leggings. Then, drape a few long necklaces around your neck, put on a bracelet, and carry a purse. Alternatively, wear a pair of skinny jeans with a flowy top, a necklace, and a big bracelet."

Pick a dress that fits your shape well, and pair it with tights to make your legs look more girly. If you're worried about people figuring out you're biologically a boy, start with a long dress that covers most of your legs. For example, you might wear a maxi dress, which typically goes down to the floor. You can cover broad shoulders with long sleeves, a cardigan, or a light jacket."

      "content": "Consider wearing a bra to create curves. Since girls come in all shapes and sizes, you don't need to wear a bra. However, it's an option if you'd like to appear like you have breasts. Choose a bra with the cup size you'd like to have, then stuff it with tissue or padding. [6] X Research source If you want to wear this disguise often, you can purchase breast forms so that you don't have to stuff your bra. Breast forms are realistic faux breasts that are usually made from silicone. They can help you get the look and feel of natural breasts. Try on different bras until you find one that fits you well."

Then, use blush to add more color to your cheeks and lipstick to make your lips look more defined. Finally, use a bright eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to make your eyes pop. Don't apply too much makeup because you don't want it to be cakey. It's better to go with less so your look is more natural. If your skin looks darker where your facial hair grows, using a concealer or foundation in a shade lighter than your normal foundation on just the darker areas can even them out. Watching makeup tutorials online can help you create the look you want."
