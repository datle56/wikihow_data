      "content": "Wash the potatoes then pierce them with a fork. Hold the potatoes under running water and use a scrub brush to remove dirt from them. Piercing the potatoes with a fork allows steam to escape from the potato while it is cooking. Stick the tines of the fork about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) deep into the flesh of the potato. Repeat 6-12 times, making sure to pierce all sides of the potato. You can make as many sweet potatoes as you want. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C) and oil the outside of the potatoes. Use vegetable or olive oil and lightly coat the outside of each potato. This will help keep the skin moist and smooth. You can put a few drops of oil directly onto the potato and rub it around with your hands. [2] X Research source"

Carefully remove it with a pot holder, unwrap it, and pierce the skin with a knife. If the knife cuts easily into the potato, it is done. If the potato is still hard, continue cooking it for 5-minute intervals until it is soft. [4] X Research source"
