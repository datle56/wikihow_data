You'll feel silly if you seek out supernatural solutions for something that turns out to be a leaky pipe or a hypertension headache. Do your due diligence and check for mundane sources. Get your house checked if you hear, smell, or feel strange things in a specific area. You may have problems with plumbing, electricity, gas leaks, rodents, or other mundane issues. The sooner you act, the easier it will be to fix. Get a doctor checkup for anyone who feels bad or has behavior you don't understand. Rule out common medical concerns before assuming there are demons. Things like depression, epilepsy, autism , or migraines could be mistaken for demons when the person actually needs a different type of support.
