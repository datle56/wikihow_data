      "content": "Realize that cultural messages about age are not destiny. While men in their 50s may be considered esteemed and a \"good catch\", women in this age group often feel invisible and less desirable. Media messaging reinforces the invisibility of older women, through such things as pairing older men with very young co-stars in Hollywood movies, rampant coverage of young female starlets in magazines, yet not showing older women anywhere near as much, while showing older men well into their 90s as powerful and even sexy, and so forth. These are images principally pushed by the advertising and entertainment industries and they do not reflect reality. Whatever your gender and age, you remain an important and valued member of society. Do not allow yourself to feel devalued by the incessant drive to sell aspirational products and lifestyles. Write daily self-affirmations as a reminder to not to fall into a negativity bias about yourself. Use these affirmations to balance your view of yourself and to help you build evidence of your successes.

However, realize that you're all feeling vulnerable and there can be strength in joining together and supporting one another. Just soften a tiny bit and open up to other women who are feeling just as vulnerable as you are; they just have a weird way of showing it."

In your age group, there is also a risk of coming across people who are misfits and worst of all, married! If you want to find people through this means, be very selective and use your decades of experience to root out the suspicious ones. When actually dating, sum up the date quickly, so that you don't over-invest yourself in somebody who is just going to suck you dry or be a complete loss. That said, it is possible to find someone you really connect with through online dating, so don't dismiss it; it has become the norm for many people now. [7] X Research source"
