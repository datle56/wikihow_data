If you do get braces , you’ll have to wear a retainer for the rest of your life to make sure your teeth stay in place. Plastic aligners are a great option for minor overbites since they’re usually cheaper than braces. [6] X Expert Source Lewis Chen, DDS, FICOI, FIADFE Licensed Dentist Expert Interview. 3 June 2021.

You'll be in the hospital for about 2 days. [9] X Research source Surgery is usually performed if less invasive methods, like braces, fail to fix the overbite. The surgery usually costs between $20,000 and $40,000."
