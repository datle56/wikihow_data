      "content": "Let the frozen lobster tails defrost in the refrigerator for the best results. If you have the time, thaw your frozen lobster tails for a full day for the best flavor and an even thaw. Make sure you have enough time to allow the tails to defrost fully. Thawing for 24 hours in the refrigerator also prevents the tail meat from sticking to the shell."

      "content": "Place the frozen tails on a plate in their wrapper. If the frozen tails are in a container, remove them from the container and place them on a plate, but keep them in their wrapper. The wrapper will collect any juices that escape while the frozen tails defrost. Make sure there is enough room on the plate for all of the tails. Do not stack or pile the frozen tails or they will not defrost evenly."

      "content": "Allow them to thaw for 24 hours in the refrigerator. Let the lobster tails sit in the refrigerator undisturbed for a full 24 hours before you use them. Frozen lobster tails will turn into tough and chewy meat if you cook before it has fully thawed. Take the lobster tails out of the refrigerator and check to see that the meat has completely defrosted by touching the center of the exposed meat at the end of the tail so you don’t have to cut the shell open. [2] X Research source Use the defrosted lobster tails immediately and do not refreeze them or they could collect bacteria and spoil. If the tails haven’t defrosted after 24 hours, allow them to sit in the refrigerator for another 6 hours before you check them again. If you plan to use the lobster juices, use them immediately before they spoil."

      "content": "Use cool water to defrost lobster tails more quickly. If you don’t have the time to let the frozen lobster tails defrost on their own, you can use the cool water method to speed up the thawing process. The frozen tails will defrost more quickly, but the meat may stick to the shell when they’re cooked. Make sure you have the ability to watch the seafood in the cool water so you can change the water as needed."

      "content": "Place the lobster tails in a large plastic bag. Use a plastic bag that can be fully sealed and arrange the frozen tails in the bag so that they form a single layer. Do not pack the bag too full or the tails may not defrost evenly. Use another plastic bag if you need more room. [3] X Research source Remove as much as from the bag as you can before you seal it so it doesn’t float on the water. Make sure the bag is completely sealed so no water leaks into it."

      "content": "Fill a large pot with cool water. Use a pot that is large enough to fully submerge the plastic bag full of lobster tails and fill it with water that is cool to the touch. You do not need to add ice to cool the water, just make sure the water isn’t warm or hot or it could start to change the consistency of the meat. [4] X Research source You can also use a bucket or a large container to fill with cool water."

      "content": "Allow the bag to sit in the water for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, pull out the bag and check the tails to see if they are fully thawed by checking to see if the thickest part of the meat has defrosted. If they aren’t, seal the bag, and pour out the water in the pot. Fill the pot back with fresh, cool water and place the bag back into the pot. Changing the water helps bring the lobster meat to room temperature more quickly. Don’t place the pot in direct sunlight. The heat from the sun could change the texture of the tail meat."

      "content": "Change the water every 30 minutes until the tails are fully defrosted. Depending on the size of the lobster tail, the time it takes for them to fully thaw may vary. Set a timer for every 30 minutes and pull the bag out to check the tails to see if they’re defrosted. Touch the center of the meat at the end of the shell so you don’t need to break the shell open until you’re ready to cook or eat them. If they aren’t defrosted, replace the water and submerge the bag of lobster tails back into the water. Cook the lobster tails as soon as they are defrosted and do not refreeze them to avoid spoiling."

Microwaving frozen lobster tails should be used as a last resort if you don’t have the time to defrost them for a day or using cool water. There is a risk of partially cooking the meat when you defrost frozen lobster tails in the microwave, so be sure not to defrost them for too long. [6] X Research source Defrosting in the microwave can alter the texture of the lobster tail meat and make it tougher."

When the 3 minutes are up, take the plate out of the microwave and check the thickest part of the biggest tail to see if it is fully defrosted. The center of the meat should be about room temperature, with no ice or frozen parts. [7] X Research source To avoid cutting open the shell to see if the meat has defrosted, touch the center of the exposed meat at the end of the tail. There should be no frozen spots. If the tails are close to being defrosted, lower the time to 1 minute on the defrost setting and microwave them again until they’re fully thawed."

Once the tail has fully defrosted in the microwave, use it in your dish as soon as possible for the best taste and texture of the meat. Do not refreeze the tail meat."
