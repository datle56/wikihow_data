      "title": "Sketch a square outline using a pencil.",
      "content": "Sketch a square outline using a pencil. Press your pencil lightly into the paper so your lines won’t be very dark. Then, slowly draw each side of your square. [1] X Research source If you want precise lines, trace a ruler. However, there’s no need for your lines to be totally straight."

      "title": "Draw a loop on the inside of each side of the square.",
      "content": "Draw a loop on the inside of each side of the square. Place the edge of your pencil about 1/3 of the way down the left side of the square. Then, draw a loop on the inside of the square. Repeat on the right side to create a second loop. [2] X Research source These loops should look like the sides of a puzzle piece where it connects with another piece."

    {
      "title": "Add a big loop at the top of the square.",
      "content": "Add a big loop at the top of the square. Put your pencil along the edge of the top about 1/3 of the way from the left corner. Then, draw a loop that ends about 1/3 of the way to the right corner. Adjust the loop as needed to make it look like a connector on a puzzle piece. [3] X Research source Just leave the bottom line flat."

      "title": "Outline your puzzle piece with a black marker.",
      "content": "Outline your puzzle piece with a black marker. Start by slightly rounding the edges on the left and right side of the piece to refine the shape. Then, outline the straight edges. Finish your shape by tracing along the looped edges. [4] X Research source Go slowly so you don’t smear the marker or accidentally veer off the line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Erase your guidelines after the marker dries.",
      "content": "Erase your guidelines after the marker dries. When the marker line no longer looks shiny, take your eraser and scrub away the pencil lines. This will leave your dark outline. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Color your puzzle piece with markers, colored pencils, or crayons. For a simple design, just color your piece. You can use several colors, or just one. If you want to get creative, draw a picture on your puzzle piece. [6] X Research source You could even glue stuff to your puzzle pieces. For instance, add some glitter or sequins to your drawing. Stickers are also a great way to decorate a puzzle piece."

Next, lay the ruler below the line to trace the bottom of the box. Then, position the ruler so it’s even with the bottom line and draw the right side of the square. Finish by adding a line at the top. [7] X Research source Use the markings on your ruler as a guide. For instance, you might make each side exactly 4 in (10 cm) long."

Then, draw a straight line connecting the loop to the top of your box to finish that side of the puzzle piece. [9] X Research source This is where your top puzzle pieces connect. Your loop doesn’t have to be perfect because the puzzle pieces will still connect together."
