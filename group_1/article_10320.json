As soon as the computer's startup screen appears (the screen right after the computer shuts down and is beginning to restart), begin pressing the BIOS key. Your computer's BIOS key will vary depending on the manufacturer, but it will usually be one of the function keys (e.g., F2), Esc, or Del. You can check your computer's BIOS key online or in the manual that came with your computer. Many computers will flash a \"Press [key] to enter setup\" (or similar) message at the bottom of the screen as your computer is starting up. This is the key that you should press. If you miss your opportunity and the computer finishes the restart cycle, you'll need to restart it and try again. When BIOS launches, go to the Boot Order section, which you might find in Advanced , and select your USB drive as Boot Option #1 . Most computers have directions for navigating through BIOS on the right side of the screen. Restart the PC again."
