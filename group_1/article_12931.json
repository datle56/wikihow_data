      "content": "Differentiate any constant to zero. A constant is any ordinary number, with no variable involved—for example, 3, -16, or 2 / 3 {\\displaystyle 2/3} . These are freebies in any differentiation problem, because their derivative is always 0. Just cross out that term and move on. [1] X Research source Write this in the form d d x ( 3 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} }{\\mathrm {d} x}}(3)=0} . This says \"The derivative of 3 with respect to x is 0.\" The derivative of a term is the \"rate of change\" of that term: how quickly that term changes inside a function. Since a constant never changes (3 will always stay 3), its rate of change is always zero."

      "content": "Differentiate x 1 {\\displaystyle x^{1}} to 1. The term x 1 {\\displaystyle x^{1}} (which we usually write as simply x {\\displaystyle x} ) is another easy one to differentiate, once you know the rule. The derivative of x {\\displaystyle x} with respect to x {\\displaystyle x} is always 1. [2] X Research source Write this as d d x ( x ) = 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} }{\\mathrm {d} x}}(x)=1} . The notation d x means \"derivative with respect to x .\" This means that we are changing the value of x , and seeing how much faster or slower the other term changes in response. In d d x ( x ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} }{\\mathrm {d} x}}(x)} , we're comparing the change in x to the change in x . That's the same thing, which is why the rate of change is 1."

      "content": "Write the derivative of x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} as 2 x {\\displaystyle 2x} . The 2 in the exponent moves in front of the x to become the coefficient (the number multiplied by x ). [3] X Research source ) Meanwhile, the x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} gets reduced to x {\\displaystyle x} . [4] X Research source Have you noticed a pattern? In the derivative, the value of the variable's exponent is always one lower than it was in the original term. x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} gets \"downgraded\" to x 1 {\\displaystyle x^{1}} (which is x ), and x 1 {\\displaystyle x^{1}} gets \"downgraded\" to x 0 {\\displaystyle x^{0}} (which equals 1). Since the value of the variable's exponent is called the \"degree\" of the polynomial, we can say that differentiating a term reduces the degree of that term by one. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Differentiate x n {\\displaystyle x^{n}} to get n x n − 1 {\\displaystyle nx^{n-1}} . Or in English: to differentiate a variable x raised to an exponent, write that exponent in front of x as a coefficient, then reduce the exponent by 1. This is one of the most useful differentiation rules. The rules for deriving x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} and x {\\displaystyle x} above are actually just specific examples of this general rule. [6] X Research source Example: what is d d x ( x 7 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} }{\\mathrm {d} x}}(x^{7})} (the derivative of x 7 {\\displaystyle x^{7}} with respect to x )? The exponent, 7, becomes a coefficient in front of the term: 7 x ? {\\displaystyle 7x^{?}} The new exponent is one lower than the original, 7-1=6. The answer is 7 x 6 {\\displaystyle 7x^{6}} ."

      "content": "Treat each term as a separate problem. Polynomials contain multiple terms, added or subtracted together. To differentiate the polynomial, differentiate each term separately. You can leave all of the addition and subtraction symbols alone. [8] X Research source For example, take f ( x ) = − 12 x 3 + x 2 − 5 x + 6 {\\displaystyle f(x)=-12x^{3}+x^{2}-5x+6} . The derivative, f ′ ( x ) {\\displaystyle f'(x)} , is equal to the derivative of each term, added or subtracted as they were in the original.

[9] X Research source In our example, 6 is the constant. d d x ( 6 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} }{\\mathrm {d} x}}(6)=0} , so we can get rid of it. Careful: only terms with no variables are constants. This rule does not affect numbers that are multiplied by x or any other variable."

If you're asked to \"evaluate the expression\" for a value of x , all you need to do is replace each x in the new equation with the given value and solve.
