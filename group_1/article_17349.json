      "content": "Gather wood. Cut down as many trees using your Copper Axe as you can. Use your mouse or right stick to point your cursor to the point where the tree and the ground meet. Then press the attack button. The tree will drop wood and almonds that are then automatically placed on your inventory when you get in close proximity to them. The specific attack button is different depending on what platform you are playing on, as well as the control scheme you use. The attack button is labeled at the bottom of the screen. It's usually the right trigger button or right shoulder button. It's advisable that you get 200 to 300 blocks of wood early on since a lot of the early-game items use it as a crafting ingredient/requirement."

Then use the mouse or the right and left shoulder buttons to switch to the different menus. The crafting menu is in the lower-left corner. [1] X Research source"

Now you'll need to look for the wood fishing pole on the items that are available for crafting. You can then place it on your inventory after you've finished crafting it. The wood fishing pole is the easiest to craft of the four craftable fishing poles in the game. Other fishing poles like the reinforced fishing pole, Fisher of Souls, and Fleshcatcher, both of which require lead/iron anvils and metals like Lead, Iron, Crimtane, and Demonite bars to craft, another option would be buying the Sitting Duck's Fishing Pole from the travelling merchant, this is a very expensive option costing 35 Gold and being a rare item for him to sell. Once in Hardmode, you can get the Golden fishing pole and the Hotline Fishing Pole as quests from the Angler. [2] X Research source"

In order to get something to bite the bait, you'll need to make sure that you are fishing in an area that has at least 75 continuous (vertically or horizontally) tiles/blocks of any liquid (this includes lava and honey). This technically means that you can fish in any body of water so long as they adhere to the 75 continuous tiles/blocks requirement. [5] X Research source The easiest way to fish is to go to the nearest ocean biome. However, you'll need to be careful since you're probably going to come across some high-level monsters on your way there. Although it's possible to make your own fishing area, it will take time. You might want to look into this though, once you've acquired more powerful equipment after defeating a couple of bosses. You can also fish in lava and honey, but you will need to make sure that you have the right fishing pole and bait."
