      "content": "Get in a low stance. Tremblay advises that before you dribble, get in a low, defensive stance. [1] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021. Spread your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and drop your hips back slightly (as if you were sitting in a chair). Keep your head up and shoulders square. This position helps protect the ball while also giving you plenty of mobility. Avoid a tall, vertical posture. In this stance, the ball travels from your upper body to the ground and back again as it bounces, leaving it wide open for a defender to steal. Avoid bending at the waist (as if you were bending over to pick something up). Besides being bad for your back, this stance is fairly unbalanced, meaning it's easier to accidentally stumble forward."

      "content": "Touch the ball with your fingertips, not your palm. Having good control over the ball when dribbling is key, but you don’t want to use too much arm strength. For the best results, avoid slapping the ball with your palm. Instead, handle the ball with the tips of your fingers. Spread your fingers out across the surface of the ball for a wider, more balanced contact area. [2] X Research source Indiana Pacers’ player Paul George recommends against palm-to-ball contact, as it “slows down the whole dribbling process.” [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Bounce the ball off the ground.",
      "content": "Bounce the ball off the ground. Handling the ball with your fingertips, take it in your dominant hand and bounce it off the ground. Bounce the ball firmly, but not so hard that you use serious arm strength. Your dribble should be quick, yet steady and controlled. Each time the ball returns to your hand, without grabbing it or catching it in any way, make contact with your fingertips and push it back down with a controlled motion of the wrist and forearm—again, you shouldn't be tiring your arm out from dribbling. [4] X Research source Aim the ball to hit the floor at a spot slightly to the side and ahead of the foot on the same side of your body as your dribbling hand. Avoid bouncing the ball too lightly, as this can make it easier for a defender to steal the ball. Be firm without using too much force. When practicing dribbling for the first time, it's OK to keep your eyes on the ball until you get the hang of things. However, the more you can look up, the better."

      "title": "Keep your hand on top of the ball.",
      "content": "Keep your hand on top of the ball. When you dribble, it’s important to keep the motion of the ball under control. You never want the ball to get away from you, as this can give the other team possession of the ball for free. Keep the palm of your hand directly over the ball as you move so that the ball (on its “up” bounce) will bounce right into your fingertips. [5] X Research source Another reason to focus on keeping your hand over the ball while dribbling is that momentarily “catching” the ball on its underside results in a penalty called a carrying violation. To avoid this, keep your palm over the ball and facing the floor as you dribble. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep the ball low.",
      "content": "Keep the ball low. The shorter and quicker the ball bounces, the harder it is for your opponent to steal. One surefire way to make your ball’s bounces shorter is to bounce it closer to the ground. Keep your knees bent, drop your dominant hand down to the side of your leg, and dribble with low, quick motions, instructs Tremblay. [7] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021. If you have to bend to the side to dribble in a low stance, you’re dribbling too low. In your low stance, the highest point of your bounce should be up to your hip."

      "title": "Keep your head up.",
      "content": "Keep your head up. When you first start dribbling and the process isn’t intuitive yet, it's hard not to look at the ball as you dribble. However, it’s very important to practice looking up. During a game, you’ll have to look for your teammates, keep an eye on your defender, and be aware of where the basket is, all while dribbling. So, keep your head and gaze up. [8] X Research source The more you practice, the more natural dribbling will become! Soon, it’ll feel like second nature, and you’ll be able to trust the ball without looking at it."

      "title": "Dribble to the side when you’re near defenders.",
      "content": "Dribble to the side when you’re near defenders. How you dribble the ball changes based on the players and conditions around you. If you’re in open court (such as moving the ball up the court after the opposing team has scored a point), you can dribble the ball in front of you. However, when you’re near defenders, it’s better to bounce the ball at your side while assuming a low, defensive stance. This way, the defender has to reach across your body to get the ball."

      "title": "Keep your body between defenders and the ball.",
      "content": "Keep your body between defenders and the ball. When one or more defenders are covering you (players on the opposing team are following and trying to steal the ball from you), defend the ball with your body. Never dribble your ball on the same side of your body as the defender is on. Rather, position yourself so your body is between the defender and the ball. This makes it difficult for the defender(s) to steal the ball. [9] X Research source For more protection, use the hand that isn't dribbling as an arm bar. Raise your non-dribbling arm and make a fist, presenting the side of your forearm to your opponent. Be careful when using arm bars. Avoid pushing the defender, striking the defender with your fist, or driving through the defender using your arm as a wedge. Instead, use an arm bar defensively (like you might hold a shield) to keep space between yourself and the defensive player. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid stopping with the ball. Don’t stop dribbling unless you know what to do with the ball . Once you stop, you can’t dribble again. As the official NBA rules state, “A player may not dribble a second time after he has voluntarily ended his first dribble.” [11] X Research source If you stop dribbling, pass or shoot the ball ."

      "title": "Know when to pass the ball.",
      "content": "Know when to pass the ball . Dribbling isn’t always the best way to move the ball around the court. Often, it’s better to pass, as it can be much faster and can be used to misdirect the opposing team. If dribbling to the hoop means going through multiple defenders, it’s usually a good idea to pass the ball to a teammate who has a better chance of making a shot. [12] X Research source As a general rule, make a move that’ll get your team closer to making a basket, whether that’s passing the ball to a teammate under the hoop or driving into the key yourself."

      "title": "Avoid traveling, double dribbling, and carrying.",
      "content": "Avoid traveling, double dribbling, and carrying. There are basic rules that dictate how you dribble in basketball. A careless dribbling violation can result in a penalty, halting your team’s offensive momentum and giving the defending team the ball for free. Avoid committing any of the following violations: [13] X Research source Traveling : Moving with the ball without dribbling. Traveling includes: Taking an extra step, skipping, hopping, or shuffling your feet. Carrying the ball while you walk or run. Moving or changing your pivot foot (set foot) when stationary. Double dribble : This penalty refers to two separate violations: Dribbling with both hands simultaneously. Dribbling, stopping your dribble (catching or holding the ball), and then starting to dribble again. Carrying : Catching the ball with one hand and then continuing to dribble (without stopping the dribbling motion). In a carry, your hand makes contact with the bottom of the ball, then flips the ball over in the act of dribbling."

      "title": "The triple threat stance",
      "content": "The triple threat stance The “triple threat” is a highly versatile stance taken by offensive players after they receive the ball and before they start dribbling. From the triple threat position, the player can pass, shoot, or start to dribble. As Tremblay explains, the stance allows the player to protect the ball with their hands and body while they decide which option to take. [14] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021. To do the triple threat, bring the ball close to your body once it’s passed to you. Grasp the ball with both hands. Keep a low stance as you move the ball across your stomach. Hold your elbows out at a 90-degree angle."

      "title": "A crossover",
      "content": "A crossover A “ crossover ” is a dribbling technique used to destabilize and misdirect a defender. The player dribbles the ball in front of their body, transferring it between hands in a “V” shape. With this technique, the player can get the defender to move toward the ball while it’s in one hand, then quickly cross the ball over to the other hand. [15] X Research source To do a crossover, stay low and bounce the ball in a “V” shape in front of you. Bring the ball from one hand to the other, with the “point” of the “V” in front of your legs."

      "title": "Dribbling behind the back",
      "content": "Dribbling behind the back Dribbling behind the back is a classic way to “juke” or mislead a defender. A player can dribble straight toward the hoop and then redirect the ball behind their back to swerve around the opposing team. [16] X Research source To dribble behind your back, follow the same “V” shape dribbling pattern as a crossover, just behind your back. Place your hands on either side of your hips, and bounce the ball between them. [17] X Research source Keep in mind that dribbling behind your back takes practice! It’s okay if you don’t nail the move on your first try."

      "title": "Dribbling between your legs",
      "content": "Dribbling between your legs Another classic ball-handling move is to dribble between your legs . A player can bounce the ball between either leg while assessing the court or a defender to keep the ball more protected. The leg acts as a barrier between the offender and defender, and switching the ball between hands gives the offender an opportunity for misdirection. [18] X Research source To dribble between your legs, follow the same “V” bounce pattern as the crossover, just under your legs. Stand with your feet hip-width apart with one foot slightly in front. Cross the ball under your hips between your legs. Know that this dribbling technique takes practice. The more you practice, the better you’ll become!"
