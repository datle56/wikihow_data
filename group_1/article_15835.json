      "content": "Honestly evaluate your friendship and whether it’s worth saving. Take some time to identify the other person’s toxic behaviors and ask yourself if you think these are things you can deal with. Do you think your friend will be willing to change? If the answer to both of these is no, then cutting this friend out of your life might be the best move for you. The first step in letting go of a toxic person is admitting to yourself that the friendship is impacting you negatively. [1] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 Aug 2020. Typical behaviors of a toxic friend include constant negativity, making belittling or humiliating comments, acting selfishly, and not respecting your boundaries. It’s completely normal to have mixed feelings. If you’ve known this person for a long time, you might enjoy the familiarity and comfort their presence provides. However, despite the perks they may bring to your life, it’s not worth staying in the friendship if it leaves you feeling drained, frustrated, or doubting your own self-worth. If you want to let them go quickly, make a clean break in your friendship with a direct, clear statement. If you want to end things a bit more gently, gradually reduce the time you spend around this person. If you’re in an abusive relationship, whether it’s physical, emotional, or something else, do what you can to get out of the relationship immediately."

      "content": "Write down what you’re going to say. If you’re feeling nervous about confronting a toxic friend, write down your thoughts and feelings beforehand. Then, practice what you’re going to say before you meet with them so you’ll sound confident when talking with them face-to-face. Having to confront a toxic friend and break off a relationship can be hard, but making a script ahead of time can help you stay calm and keep you on track in the moment. [2] X Research source For example, you might write, “I feel like I'm not getting anything out of this relationship. I do care about you, but it's becoming too hard for me to maintain this relationship. I think it would be best if we go our separate ways.”"

      "content": "State your feelings in a clear and direct way. While it may be challenging, stating your feelings clearly is the best way to make sure your friend really hears you and understands how their behavior has impacted you. Toxic people can be very clingy and controlling and may not take no for an answer easily. [3] X Research source Use “I” statements when talking about your feelings to keep the focus on your personal emotions and avoid making your friend feel like you’re aggressively targeting them. For example, instead of saying, “You make it hard to be your friend,” say, “I feel like I’m giving more than I’m receiving in this friendship.” Do your best to stay calm during your conversation. While you have every right to be angry, confronting a toxic person when you’re still angry might actually cause the situation to escalate."

      "content": "Let the person know you don't want to see them again. While it may be hard, cutting off all contact with a toxic friend is the quickest way to remove their negativity and harmful behaviors from your life. Make it clear that you don’t wish to see them in the future and will not be contacting them from now on. Say something like, “I don’t want to see you again, so please don’t try to contact me.” [4] X Research source While it may seem a bit aggressive, being blunt in this situation is one of the most effective ways to establish boundaries and make sure the other person understands them. Unfollow and block them on social media to further remove them from your life. It’s possible that a toxic friend might still try to reach out to you. If you’re set on cutting off all contact, ignore their texts, calls, and emails. Another option is to block the person's number ."

Cutting off a friendship altogether can be difficult, so slowly phasing your friendship out can be a good way to distance yourself from your friend’s toxicity. When you find yourself instinctively reaching for your phone to message them, pause for a second and hold yourself back if it’s not something urgent. If they stop getting as many messages from you, they might catch on to your intentions of creating some distance. [5] X Research source Avoid interacting with them on social media as well. Hold back from liking or commenting on their posts and avoid posting anything that includes them. Reader Poll: We asked 718 wikiHow readers to give us their opinion on the most effective way to avoid someone, and 44% said that completely cutting off all contact (including text, social media, and in-person communication) was the best strategy.

      "content": "Decline invitations to hang out with them. Limiting physical contact is equally as important as limiting digital contact. If they ask you to hang out, make an excuse why you can’t or simply tell them you don’t want to make plans . You don’t have to stop hanging out with them completely, but limiting how much time you spend together can give you a bit of space to breathe. [6] X Research source For example, you might make an excuse by saying, “I have a lot going on in my life right now and really don’t have time to hang out.” Or, be more firm and say, “I need some space and think it’s best if we don’t hang out for a while.” If you have the same friend group or are in the same social circle, taking a break from joining group events where they might be there is also a good way to limit contact."

If your friend doesn’t get the response from you that they were expecting, they might get the hint that you want things to change in your relationship and that you’re not completely happy with how things are now. For example, if you used to shrug off their belittling comments, call them out for their rude behavior. [7] X Research source For example, say something like, “I don’t appreciate it when you make comments like that. It hurts more than you might think.” Another example would be to let them work through their own decisions and issues instead of immediately jumping in with advice as they might expect. In this situation, you might say something like, “I think it’s best if you take some time to sort through things yourself. If you still need help later, then come talk to me.”"

In order to stay strong and motivate yourself to go through with your decision, create small rewards for yourself each time you do something to distance yourself from the toxic person. For example, go out and do something fun after turning down an invitation from them to hang out. [8] X Research source Stick to your values and remind yourself why it’s important for you to get away from their toxic behavior. It might feel difficult at that moment, but your actions will help you reach a place where you’ll hopefully feel much happier."

Losing a friend of any kind can be painful, and it’s perfectly okay if you feel like you need some time to recover and gain control of your emotions . The important thing is that you acknowledge these emotions, both the positive and negative, and give yourself adequate time to process them. [9] X Research source Be kind and understanding with yourself. Avoid giving yourself a hard deadline to “get over it” and move on.

Once you've left a toxic person, surround yourself with those who remind you about all the good and positive things that come out of a relationship. Reach out to other close, trustworthy friends, be with your family, or spend time with a romantic partner. Being surrounded by positive people will allow you to get the love and care you deserve.

Being aware of these kinds of patterns can help you break free from them and avoid future toxic relationships. [11] X Research source While you’re certainly not responsible for someone else's poor behavior, you may be vulnerable to toxic people for certain reasons. For example, maybe you have a tendency to be more passive in relationships and are uncomfortable stating your needs. This could make it easier for toxic friends to take advantage of you."

Instead, forgiving is all about recognizing that what’s happened has happened and that it’s now time to move on. Let go of your anger or any lingering resentment you may feel toward them. Forgiveness is also about accepting the fact that they might not be able to change and making peace with that fact. [12] X Research source Forgiveness doesn’t make you weak or a pushover. If anything, it shows that you’re the bigger person who won’t let themselves get caught up in a relationship that’s already ended. You can certainly tell the other person that you forgive them, but accepting these feelings by yourself can also be more than sufficient enough. Do whatever you need to do to make peace with the situation."
