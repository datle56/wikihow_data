      "title": "Fill out your deposit slip.",
      "content": "Fill out your deposit slip. Either bring your own deposit slip if you have one or pick one up at the bank. Fill out all the identifying information, like your name, address, account number, and bank name and address. Then, write the date you’re making the deposit and indicate how much cash you’re depositing on the cash deposit line, typically located on the right side of the slip. When you’re done, write the grand total at the bottom of the deposit slip. [1] X Research source If you’re using your personal deposit slips, most of your identifying information should already be printed on the slip. Double check that all of this information is correct. If it isn’t, talk to a representative of the issuing bank. If you did not receive deposit slips when opening your account, contact the bank where you have the account. If you’re depositing checks along with cash, write the totals of your checks on the subsequent lines under the cash deposit line. Count the checks in ascending or descending order to ensure the balance equals that on the deposit slip. When depositing checks, you must write the check numbers on the deposit slip. Since some check numbers are very long, put the last four digits of the check number and then the check amount."

      "content": "Bring the deposit slip, cash, and your ID to the bank teller. Approach the bank teller’s counter or pull up to the bank’s drive-thru and tell them that you’d like to make a deposit. The teller will walk you through the process, though generally you’ll hand them the cash and your deposit slip. You’ll also likely need to present your ID to confirm you’re the owner of the account. The teller will count the money and confirm it’s the right amount before depositing it. [2] X Research source If your account number isn’t listed on your deposit slip and you don’t know it, bring your debit card with you. The teller can usually type in the card number to find your account number. Before depositing your cash, double count it one more time to make sure it’s all there."

      "content": "Use an online bank with a physical location or ATM. Some online banks also offer walk-in locations where you can deposit cash. Check with your bank to see if they have a walk-in location near you. If they do, the depositing process is similar to that of a traditional bank. Have your ID, cash, and bank information ready. In some cases, online banks also accept deposits through ATMs. Check with your bank to see if this is possible. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy a money order. Money orders are like checks, but they are guaranteed by a public or private service like Western Union or the Indian Postal Service. Visit the money order service of your choice, fill out the money order , then pay for it. From there, deposit it according to the instructions prescribed by your bank. Note that money orders allow you to deposit up to $1000. [5] X Research source The specific process by which you can deposit a money order varies depending on the online bank you use. Generally, scan or take a photo of the money order, then send the image to your online bank. In some cases, you might need to mail the money order to the bank. Check your online bank’s policy regarding money orders before you get a money order. In many cases, money orders require you to pay a small fee, typically less than $2."

Then, transfer the funds to your online bank over the internet. The specific method by which you can accomplish this varies depending on the banks you use. [6] X Research source Generally, however, set up an account online with your traditional bank, then select an “electronic funds transfer” or some similar formulation. You will then be prompted to provide the routing number for the online bank you wish to transfer the funds to. If you exclusively use an online bank, open a bank account at a local bank. Look for one with the lowest monthly fees."

To deposit cash into your online account using wire transfer services , deposit the cash at your traditional bank. Request a wire transfer and fill out the bank’s transfer form. [7] X Research source Requirements for using wire transfer services vary from bank to bank. Depositing cash in your online bank via wire transfer may result in a brief hold time before the money is available. There are often fees involved in using a wire transfer service. Ask about these fees before depositing cash using a wire transfer. If you exclusively use an online bank , the only way to move cash from the physical bank to your online bank is to open an account with a traditional bank. Look for one with the lowest monthly fees."

These cards work the same way regular debit or credit cards do and allow you to make purchases up to the amount deposited on the card. Many prepaid cards allow you to load the cash at certain stores then make an ACH transfer to your online bank. Or, simply keep the cash on the card and use it that way. [8] X Trustworthy Source US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau U.S. government agency for protecting consumers in the financial sector Go to source The process by which you deposit cash onto the card depends on the terms of the card. Some cards allow customers to deposit cash at the checkout register of certain big box stores. Cards that were obtained at banks usually require you to add more money to the card at the issuing bank. Before purchasing a reloadable prepaid debit card, ask the issuer how to deposit cash onto the card. If you find the process too difficult, consider another option for depositing cash. Reloadable prepaid debit cards are available online, at big box stores, and at many banks. Be aware that many prepaid debit cards charge fees to obtain the card, deposit cash, or withdraw funds. Some even have monthly membership fees."

It’s a good idea to have the person with you when you make the deposit in case the bank doesn’t allow you to make the deposit on your own.
