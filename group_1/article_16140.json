      "title": "Avoid breaking local laws.",
      "content": "Avoid breaking local laws. Trespassing is illegal in many countries and jurisdictions. Private property laws vary from one place to another, and you should not assume a legal action in one area is legal in another. At many larger structures, the caretakers will grant permission to view the premises they preserve. If there are signs that say \"No Trespassing\", don't enter unless you have permission.

      "title": "Be aware of your actions.",
      "content": "Be aware of your actions. Without speaking with a caretaker or owner, you could be perceived as a squatter, vandal, arsonist, or someone looking for salvage. Make your intentions clear to avoid unfounded accusations. Avoid bringing anything unnecessary such as tools to avoid trouble."

    {
      "title": "Find a site to explore.",
      "content": "Find a site to explore. In most cases, the structures you are looking to explore caught your interest during other activities, rather than by intentional scouting. However, unmentioned structures show their neglect and can be found simply by traveling around your town or city. You can also find structure locations from people with similar interests on internet forums. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Walk the perimeter.",
      "content": "Walk the perimeter. What are the possible entrances (or exits, if there is a need to escape)? Windows, unlocked doors, doors that can be opened by force (note laws), rooftops, tunnels, and holes are all possible entry points into abandoned buildings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide when to make an entrance.",
      "content": "Decide when to make an entrance. Sometimes it's better to enter during the day for lighting purposes, but nighttime is usually better because you're less likely to be seen. Bring a flashlight and a friend along! [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Find the easiest way in.",
      "content": "Find the easiest way in. Do you have to hop a barbed-wire fence, or can you squeeze through an opening instead? In many cases, you'll find infiltrating a structure is much easier than it looks. Barbed-wire, high walls, and locked doors are all good deterrents, but in many cases, there is a part of the structure that is much more vulnerable. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave the structure the same way you found it.",
      "content": "Leave the structure the same way you found it. You wouldn't want to ruin the experience for future explorers. You also don't want a police report filed if anything is destroyed or stolen. [6] X Research source"
