They want your attention and affection, whether it's simply a glance, talking to them in a fun, upbeat voice, giving them a special toy, rubbing and petting them, or giving a delicious treat. Pay attention to what your puppy best responds to. When you notice your puppy showing good behavior, immediately reward the action, so you puppy makes a positive association with the behavior. [2] X Expert Source David Levin Dog Training Coach Expert Interview. 19 December 2019. Be consistent when you positively reinforce good behavior. Your puppy will quickly learn what behaviors you approve of and which won't get your much-wanted attention."

      "content": "Reassert your authority over your puppy. Your puppy will respect you more and respond to your discipline if you take clear control over him. To do this, give your commands in a stern tone of voice. You may also want to make your dog follow commands outside of training sessions. For example, make your puppy sit and wait briefly before setting down his food dish. Give your puppy time to fulfill your command. If it looks like your puppy isn't going to respond to your command, don't back down and give in. You need to show your puppy that it has to listen and obey your commands. Project your authority in a calm and assertive manner. [4] X Research source"

For example, try taking your puppy out to eliminate first thing in the morning, 15 to 20 minutes after meals, and consistently after naps or play periods. Your puppy will learn to understand when it's appropriate to eliminate, reducing chances of accidents. You may want to start by crate training your puppy if you don't plan on taking it outside to eliminate."

For example, if you notice your puppy running up and jumping on someone, you can quickly command it to \"come.\" Your dog should stop jumping up on the person and come to you instead.

      "content": "Get help. If you've been patient with your puppy, but your dog still resists training or responding to your discipline, get help. You can ask your veterinarian to recommend a professional trainer or canine behaviorist. You might want to enroll your dog in an obedience training class taught by a professional. You'll learn helpful tips and your puppy will begin to understand what you expect from the training sessions that you also do at home."

      "content": "Start early and be consistent. You should start disciplining your puppy as soon as you bring it home. Puppies learn quickly and should be shown what behavior is unacceptable in your house. This also means that you must be consistent when responding to bad behavior. If not, your puppy will be confused, making it harder to prevent the bad behavior. [7] X Research source For example, say your puppy barks at the neighbors and you command it to stop. Then, it starts barking at the postal carrier, but you say nothing. Your puppy will be unsure about when it shouldn't bark, making it likely that your dog will bark whenever it feels like it."

      "title": "Use reward-based training for self-rewarding behaviors.",
      "content": "Use reward-based training for self-rewarding behaviors. Reward-based training uses discipline to help the puppy understand when something is a bad choice. Any type of reaction can be a reward in the dog's mind, so often the advice is to completely ignore bad behavior. However, if your dog is exhibiting behavior that's self-rewarding (for example, the dog enjoys chewing shoes) then this doesn't really work. That being the case, a short but sweet guiding command is appropriate. When it exhibits behavior you don't like, simply say \"Not that\" or similar words in a disapproving voice. The aim is not to scold him, but to guide him."

      "content": "Ignore bad behaviors that aren't self-rewarding. When your puppy tries to get your attention by barking, jumping up, or nipping at your fingers, it's best to ignore him. Consider what reward your puppy is trying to get when engaging in bad behavior in order to determine when to ignore him. If your dog is jumping up on you when you come home, it probably wants your attention. Withholding your attention sends the message that it needs to act differently to get your attention. Eventually, your puppy will learn that good behavior earns your attention and affection. [8] X Research source For example, if your puppy starts barking at you, turn your back to it and take away any attention. Your dog will learn that it gets nothing from you when it behaves poorly."

You might try clapping your hands and firmly saying \"no\" when you catch your puppy doing something undesirable, like chewing on your shoe or squatting to urinate on the carpet. The noise and disapproving tone will distract your puppy from the bad behavior. Redirect your puppy's attention on desirable behavior. For example, if your dog was urinating inappropriately, pick up your puppy and immediately take it outside to the appropriate toilet spot."

      "content": "Use time-outs effectively. If your puppy is engaged in bad behavior, remove it from whatever is causing the behavior and place it in a different environment. You might put it in a quiet room in the house away from distractions or outside in the yard. Leave your dog in time-out for 10 to 30 seconds, then remove it and act as though nothing happened, if your dog has stopped the bad behavior (like barking). If your puppy hasn't stopped, wait until it does.

But, if it continues barking despite your inattention, figure out why your dogâ€™ s barking and remove it. For example, if your dog is barking at the traffic out the window, pull the blinds. If the behavior continues, remove your dog to another room for a few minutes. [10] X Research source You can also try to quiet your dog by giving it something to chew like a rope toy."

Ignore your dog for up to 20 seconds after it lets go of your hand. This will teach your dog that you won't tolerate rough play.
