      "title": "No, you can’t cure gel nails without a UV light.",
      "content": "No, you can’t cure gel nails without a UV light. UV and LED nail lamps emit UV wavelengths that cure and dry gel polish. [2] X Research source If you don't have or don't want to use UV light, use special non-UV gel nail polishes that are gel-like in terms of their shine and durability but are specially formulated to air-dry without being cured under a nail lamp. [3] X Research source Can I use sunlight to cure gel nails? No, you can’t cure your gel nail polish with sunlight. The sun emits UV light at various wavelengths and intensities, while UV or LED light emits specific UV wavelengths and intensities. These machines are calibrated to cure gel polish. [4] X Research source Can I use my phone’s flashlight to cure gel nails? No, you can’t cure gel nail polish with your phone’s flashlight, a black light, or a teeth-whitening LED light. Nail lamps are designed to cure gel nail polish—other products likely won’t do as good of a job, and could even be harmful if misused."

      "content": "Purchase a non-UV gel polish for an easy at-home option. There are several nail polish brands that make non-UV gel polishes you can use at home, such as Sally Hansen’s Miracle Gel line and Essie’s Gel Couture line. These gel polishes are applied in the same manner as regular, non-gel polish and are made to dry on their own without light. They’re not technically cured, but they deliver a similar look and durability to gel manicures. [5] X Research source When purchasing a gel polish, make sure that it specifies on the label that the polish does not require a UV light or LED lamp to cure. If the polish doesn’t specify that it’s a non-UV polish, it likely won’t cure without a light or lamp. You can also try a gel alternative instead of a non-UV gel polish. For example, Dazzle Dry sells four-step manicure kits that air-dry in five minutes without a UV lamp. [6] X Research source"

Hold the can of quick-drying nail polish spray about 7 inches (18 cm) away from your hand, and spray a light coat over your nails while the polish is still wet. Repeat this to spray the nails on your other hand. [7] X Research source Leave your nails to dry for the time listed on the bottle—usually, five to 10 minutes. Once the non-UV gel polish is dry and hardened, wash your hands with soap and water to remove any residual spray. While quick-drying polish sprays are generally formulated for non-gel nail polishes, they might also help dry non-UV gel polish faster. Be aware, however, that they won’t cure gel polishes—only UV light can do that. [8] X Research source"

Hold the cooking spray about 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hand and spray each of your fingers with the oil while the polish is still wet. Repeat this on your other hand. Leave the oil to dry for several minutes, then wash your hands to rinse off oil residue. [9] X Research source Cooking spray thins out the nail polish, helping it to dry faster. Note that it won’t cure gel polish, but could work on non-UV gel polish. Try not to touch anything while your nails are drying, as the cooking spray can leave your fingers feeling a bit sticky."

Stick your nails into the water, making sure that all the nails are completely submerged. Hold your nails under the water for about three minutes before removing them from the bowl. Let your fingers and nails air dry for at least an hour. [10] X Research source While your nails will likely feel completely hardened right when they come out of the ice water, they may not be completely dry for several hours. Be careful with your nails for several hours after removing them from the water."

      "content": "Both UV and LED nail lamps emit UVA rays. UVA rays are a kind of ultraviolet radiation. Their wavelengths penetrate the skin and damage cells, causing tanning, skin aging, wrinkles, and skin cancer development. [22] X Research source If you’re trying to avoid using a UV light because you’re worried about cancer risk, note that an LED nail lamp will expose you to similar radiation. [23] X Research source You’re mostly exposed to UVA and UVB radiation from the sun. That’s why it’s important to wear sunscreen and cover up when you go outside. A 2023 study on the effects of UV-emitting nail polish dryers on human cells revealed that cells were damaged and mutated. However, more research is needed to establish if there’s a direct link between using the nail-drying lamps and an increased risk of skin cancers. [24] X Research source"

      "title": "LED lamps cure gel polish faster than UV nail lamps.",
      "content": "LED lamps cure gel polish faster than UV nail lamps. This is because they produce a narrow, targeted spectrum of UV wavelengths. Some people believe the shorter curing time makes LED nail lamps safer than UV nail lamps. [25] X Research source However, the UVA rays they emit are more intense than those emitted by regular UV lamps. If you have concerns about exposure to UVA rays, limit or stop receiving gel manicures that are cured by either kind of lamp. [26] X Research source Curing time also depends on wattage. A high-wattage LED lamp cures within around 30 seconds, but a UV lamp takes around two minutes."
