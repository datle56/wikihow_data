      "title": "Choose a battle format.",
      "content": "Choose a battle format. The format determines how many Pokémon and trainers will be battling at a time, greatly affecting the flow of the battle. Single - The classic 1v1 trainer battle where one Pokémon is used at a time (standard format during campaign mode). Battles are generally longer, prompting more defensive strategies and allowing for more setups and entry traps). Double (Gen III onward) [1] X Research source [2] X Research source - A 1v1 trainer battle where two Pokémon are used at a time. Battles are generally much shorter than singles due to more Pokémon being on the field simultaneously, prompting more offensive strategies and stronger teamwork. Spread moves (one that hit the entire field) are also viable here. Multi (Gen III onward) [3] X Research source - A 2v2 trainer battle. Due to party size being limited to 6 Pokémon at a time, trainers are only allowed to bring up to 3 Pokémon from their individual teams. Triple (Gen V & VI) [4] X Research source [5] X Research source - A 1v1 trainer battle where 3 Pokémon are used at a time. Most single target moves (with a few exceptions) are only able to hit Pokémon that're oposite/adjacent to the user (i.e. left & right positions can't hit each other, but both can attack/be attacked by center position). Pokémon on the field may also 'shift' positions with the Pokémon adjacent to them (at the cost of losing their turn). Rotation (Gen V & VI) [6] X Research source [7] X Research source - Similar to Triple battles, except Pokémon are now placed in a 'wheel-like' formation with one Pokémon in front and two in the back (only the front Pokémon can attack/be attacked). Unlike in Triple battles however, shifting and attacking occur in the same turn). Wonder Launcher (Gen V only) [8] X Research source [9] X Research source - A multiplayer battle feature (available only if both trainers have it active) where trainers earn points at the start of each turn that can be used to buy items; the items that're bought can then be used mid-battle. Battle Royal (SM/USUM) [10] X Research source (NTBCW the Battle Royale mode from Pokémon Rumble) - A 1v1v1v1 trainer battle, with 3 Pokémon per team. Trainers earn 1 point for each of the opposing Pokémon they knock out, winning if they hold the most points at the end."

      "content": "Choose a battle tier. Each tier (with the exception of Anything Goes) bans certain Pokémon and techniques for various reasons, ranging from balancing purposes, to creating a greater challenge. Note that while many communities have their own tier lists, the Smogon tier list [11] X Research source [12] X Research source is the most well-known/widely used, and includes: Uber - Contains Pokémon and tactics that're too overpowered for the OU tier (e.g., Rayquaza Mega-evolving or OHKO moves like Sheer Cold or Fissure). Over (OU), Under (UU), Rarely (RU), & Never (NU) Used - Tiers based on an individual Pokémon's usage in the competitive scene, with the more commonly used Pokémon generally outclassing the ones that perform similar roles in lower tiers. Not Fully Evolved (NFE) - Any Pokémon that isn't fully evolved. Pokémon must also be capable of evolution in the first place. Little Cup (LC) - Similar to NFE, except Pokémon must also be available (in the wild, not breeding) at Lvl 5. Monotype - All Pokémon on a team must share a common type (both single and dual typings are allowed). Video Game Championship (VGC) - Nintendo & The Pokémon Company's official annual tournament. Rules differ slightly with each year, but consistently uses the Doubles format."

      "content": "Consider basing your team around a specific battle mechanic. Some Pokémon can take advantage of certain effects in ways that others can't, so many trainers either build teams from them, or specifically to counter them. Examples of these mechanics: Baton Pass teams [13] X Research source - Boosting the stats of a tank, then using Substitute and Baton Pass to safely pass the boosts to a sweeper. Tailwind teams [14] X Research source - Doubles the speed of all Pokémon on the user's team. Generally used to boost the speed of medium-speed Pokémon. Trick Room teams [15] X Research source - Causes slower Pokémon move first for five turns. Applies to every Pokémon on the field. Weather teams [16] X Research source Various effects depending on the type of weather active (ie. Harsh Sun, Hail, Sandstorm, or Rain), and the Pokémon on the field."

A Pokémon's stats, abilities and learnset generally make them better suited for certain roles, Thus deciding one team roles before you start choosing Pokémon will help to narrow down options. Examples include [17] X Research source : Clerics/Healers - Heals/removes inflicted status conditions from their teammates. (Useless in Singles format) Crippler - Inflicts the opponent with status conditions, paving the way for Sweepers. Hazers - Clears the oppopent's stat changes with moves like Haze/Clear Smog. Useful for countering Baton Pass teams and certain Sweepers. Leads - The first Pokémon that's sent out the start of the battle; are generally fast, allowing them to setup entry hazards, delayed moves, field conditions, or to counter the opponent's lead. May also be bulky, allowing them to setup hazards multiple times throughout the match. Lures - Tricks the opponent into trying to counter it (due to recognising it's common role), only for the opponent to be countered instead. Phazers (Pseudo-Hazers) - Forces the opponent to switch out by using Roar, Whirlwind, Perish Song, etc.. Useful for countering Baton Pass teams or removing threats from the field. Pivots - Switches in to force the opponent to switch out, either by threatening offense, or strong defense, then switches itself back out again using U-Turn or Volt Switch. (Rapid) Spinners - Uses Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards/free the user from moves such as Bind or Whirlpool. Is blocked by Ghost Pokémon due to being a Normal-type attack. Stallers - Inflicts status conditions (generally Toxic), then alternates as needed between Substitute and a healing move until the opponent faints. Walls/Sponges - A type of Staller that instead uses its high Def/Sp.Def to survive. Used to cripple Sweepers. Sweepers [18] X Research source - Pokémon with high Attack/Sp.Atk and Speed that can quickly KO the opponent with high power moves (once a path has first been cleared for them of course). Setup Sweepers - Pokémon that require their stats to be raised (either by themselves, or getting passed boosts from a Baton Pass) in order to do their job. Revenge Killers - Switches in to quickly finish off the opponent's Pokémon after it's teammate faints, then switches back out again. May hold a Choice item to ensure a KO. Tanks - Pokémon with high defensive & decent offensive stats that can take attacks and actively retaliate; may sometimes carry support, defensive, or status-inflicting moves. Utility/Utility Counters - Pokémon with a wide variety of role options (not simultaneously) due to its large movepool, or that can counter a wide variety of threats. Wallbreakers - Bulkier than sweepers, they're designed specifically to counter walls that most sweepers can't."

Note that if you plan on Baton Passing stat changes, having more of one type of attack than the other will broaden your options a bit.

Hidden Power [22] X Research source is a Special move learned by most Pokémon that changes it's type and power based on the users's IVs. It's also useful for any special attackers needing coverage. The formulae listed here determine the type and power, however it may be easier to use one of the many online calculators. Three IVs are randomly inherited from their parents. If either parent holds a Power item, the baby will inherit the corresponding stat; if both parents hold one, the baby will only inherit one of those stats from a randomly chosen parent . After that, the baby will inherit two other random IVs. From B/W onward, if one Pokémon holds a Destiny Knot, 5 IVs will be inherited."

Hidden Abilities (HAs) were introduced in Gen V, and are only obtainable by randomly catching or evolving a Pokémon that has one, or by inheriting it from their parents (only from the mother if not breeding with a Ditto). Note that not all species have Hidden Abilities, and that some are only available in Events only. Eggs were originally assigned abilities randomly, however from Black & White onwards, they were given a 60% chance of inheriting their mother's HA (if bred with a male from the same Egg Group), with a 20% of getting either non-HA. Starting in B2W2, Eggs were given an 80% chance of inheriting their mother's Ability (both normal and HA), if bred with a male Pokémon from the same Egg Group.
