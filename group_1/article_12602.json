You try to make plans with them, but they bail at the last minute, and tend to make that a habit. Or, they say they’ll do something, but then it doesn’t get done. They “flake,” kinda like how old paint flakes away from a wall. There are lots of ways to be flaky, but usually people say it to mean that someone often ducks out of social plans."

Getting frequently canceled on is super frustrating, so you'll probably notice this behavior first. It’s common for people who are flaky to cancel plans, and often at the last minute, or they might just no-show altogether. If they bail on plans more often than not, they could be a flake.

For example, you might text them, “Are you going to the party on Friday?” A day later, you might receive a noncommittal text that says, “Maybe! Are you?” Alternatively, they might never respond. Then, when they bump into you at the party, they might say, “Oh! I meant to respond to your text.”"

For instance, they might fall behind on work or school activities, or might have trouble keeping their space clean. If you feel you can’t count on them to follow through, they’re probably a flake.

Often, this type of behavior is what makes them fun to be around, when you can tie them down! It’s not so fun when it’s a consistent problem, though. Ask yourself if they often change course or act on a whim when you hang around them. [7] X Research source For instance, let’s say you’re hanging out with a flaky friend on a Saturday night. They might randomly suggest that you go on a scavenger hunt or hop in the car without a destination."

Here are some ways to do that: Create padding in your schedule so they can be late. Plan an activity that you can do while you wait for them. Let them pick places and activities.

If they neglect to do something, leave it for them to fix. [14] X Research source As an example, let’s say your roommate left their clothes in the hallway. Don’t pick them up! Leave the clothes there until they come get them. Or, say your friend is late for a scheduled event, like a movie. Instead of skipping the movie, continue without them. Similarly, your coworker might have done only half of a report. Send them an email with your boss copied on it that says something like, “This is the report that I have received from you. Half of the data is missing. Is this your final version?” This alerts your boss to the issue so you get credit for any extra work you do."

Be patient with them as they learn to be more organized and self-controlled. [15] X Research source If your partner is flaky, this might mean running a more relaxed household with fewer chores.

If they don’t seem to make any attempts at improving their behavior, and that behavior is hurtful, it may be time to consider ending the friendship .

[20] X Research source In these cases, encouragement and grace are everything. Make it clear that you look forward to seeing them, but try to understand if they end up flaking.
