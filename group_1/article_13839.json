      "title": "Buy hair extensions.",
      "content": "Buy hair extensions. Hair extensions are typically made of human hair that are sewn into wefts, or tracks, either with a machine or by hand. They come in endless colors, textures and lengths. Choose a color and texture that matches your hair, so the extensions will look as natural as possible. If the extensions match your hair and are applied correctly, no one will be able to tell the difference between your natural hair and your extensions. [1] X Research source Dying or adding highlights to the extensions can help you get the perfect color or shade. If you are stuck in between two shades, select the lighter one. Virgin or Remy wefts are made from either untreated or minimally treated human hair. These options are expensive, but they result in the most natural look. Synthetic options are less expensive, but they often cannot be styled or washed. They may not look as natural as human hair options. In addition to weft extensions, you’ll need hair bonding glue. The glue should match the color of your hair extensions. Do not attempt to use any other type of glue to put in extensions."

      "content": "Make sure your hair texture matches your extensions. If you bought straight extensions, and your hair is naturally curly, you'll need to start by permanently straightening your hair before you apply the extensions. The texture should be as close as possible to achieve a natural look. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply setting solution.",
      "content": "Apply setting solution. This helps to keep your hair in place during the process and protect it from getting damaged. For short hair (above shoulder-length), slick your hair back with a hair setting solution, then comb the hair as close to your scalp as possible. For longer hair, pull your hair into a tight, low ponytail and slick your hair back with a hair setting solution. Allow the setting solution to dry completely."

      "title": "Create a rectangular part.",
      "content": "Create a rectangular part. Use a comb to part your hair in a rectangle shape on the top of your head. [3] X Research source Part it on either side and across the back, right where your head juts out the most. Secure the hair within these parts with a hairband to keep it out of the way. All of the wefts will be applied below this rectangular part. You need enough hair within the rectangle to cover the top of the wefts that you'll be putting in just below the part. Otherwise, the extensions will be visible."

    {
      "title": "Create a U-shaped bottom part.",
      "content": "Create a U-shaped bottom part. Use your comb to create another part that starts about three inches from your bottom hairline and extends from one side of your head to the other side, curving around the base of your head. The lowest extension will be applied just below this part. Make sure the part is very neat. If it's not straight, the weave won't stay in as neatly and it will look messy. Make sure the part starts three inches above your hairline. If you put in the weave too low it will be visible when you style your hair in an updo."

    {
      "title": "Measure and cut the first weft extension.",
      "content": "Measure and cut the first weft extension. Hold the weft against the U-shaped bottom part to measure how much you need. Curve it so that it lies against the part. The sides of the weft should land half an inch from your hairline on either side of your head. If the weft extends past your hairline it will be visible when you style your hair in an updo. Use a pair of scissors to cut the weft to size. [4] X Research source Double check that the weft is the right length by measuring it against your part once you’ve cut it."

    {
      "title": "Apply binding glue to the weft.",
      "content": "Apply binding glue to the weft. The weft will naturally curl inward, and the glue should be applied to the inside of the curve. Apply it very carefully and slowly in a straight line across the edge of the weft. Take the time to make sure it's applied quite neatly. The glue will come out of the bottle quite thickly."

    {
      "title": "Soften the glue with a blow dryer.",
      "content": "Soften the glue with a blow dryer. Use a blow dryer to heat the glow and soften it until it’s sticky to the touch. It shouldn’t be runny or slimy, but when you touch it it should be tacky. Gently touch the glue along the edge of the weft to make sure the entire line of glue is sticky. If the glue is too runny, it could drip into your hair and cause damage. Make sure it's not wet, but just tacky enough to adhere to your hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the weft to your hair.",
      "content": "Apply the weft to your hair. Very carefully position the weft so that the glue is facing your hair. Starting half an inch from your side hairline, press the weft against your hair about 2 or 3 centimeters (0.8 or 1.2 in) below the part. Keep pressing the weft into your hair, little by little, until you reach the other side. Be very careful not to apply it to your scalp. If the weft adheres to your scalp, it will inhibit hair growth and lead to bald spots there. It is very important to make sure the weft is applied a few centimeters below the part and attached only to your hair, not your skin.

If the weft is applied too close to your hairline, it will be visible."

      "title": "Let it dry.",
      "content": "Let it dry. Wait about three minutes to let the extension completely dry once you're finished applying it. Give it a tug to make sure it's firmly in place. If part of the weft isn't properly adhered to your hair, apply a little bonding glue and press it down until the entire weft is attached."

      "title": "Repeat the process two and a half inches above the first weft.",
      "content": "Repeat the process two and a half inches above the first weft. Now that the first weft is in place, it's time to apply the next one. Measure two and a half inches above the top of the first weft and make another U-shaped part around the back of the head. Secure the hair above the part, then follow the same process to measure, cut, and glue in the next weft: Measure a new weft and cut it so either side falls half an inch from the side hairlines. Apply glue to the weft in a straight line, then use the blow dryer to heat it slightly so it's tacky, but not runny. [6] X Research source Apply the weft to your hair a few centimeters below the part, making sure it doesn't touch your scalp."

      "title": "Finish applying wefts.",
      "content": "Finish applying wefts. Continue applying wefts every two and a half inches until you reach the top part, the rectangle you initially created. When you reach this top part, Measure, cut, and apply one final weft. This time the weft will extend from one side of your forehead around the crown of your head and up to the other side. Make sure it's half an inch from your hairline on either side."

      "title": "Comb out your hair.",
      "content": "Comb out your hair. When the wefts are all in place, take down the rectangle of hair that you secured at the top of your head. Use a comb to blend your own hair with the extensions. You are now free to style your hair as you normally would. You can also get a haircut to help blend the extensions even more."

      "title": "Remove the extensions when you’re ready.",
      "content": "Remove the extensions when you’re ready. After several months, your extensions might naturally begin to come loose, and you'll be ready to take them out. You can by removal cream designed for this purpose to take them out easily. Apply the cream around the bonded areas, let it sit for the amount of time indicated on the packaging, then use a comb to help the extensions come loose. If you don't want to buy the removal cream, try using olive oil. Apply the oil and let it soak in for 20 minutes, then use a comb to gently remove the wefts from your hair. [7] X Research source If the oil doesn't work, you could also try peanut butter or dish soap to do the trick."
