      "content": "Make 5 double crochets into 1 stitch on the right side of your work. Decide where you'd like to make your first popcorn stitch and insert your crochet hook into the stitch. Create a double crochet (DC) stitch and put your hook back into the gap of the same stitch. Make 4 more (DC) stitches into the same stitch. [1] X Research source It's important to work the popcorn stitch on the right side of your work since the back of the popcorn stitch is smooth."
