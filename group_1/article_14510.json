      "content": "Sketch the cabin section of the boat. To sketch this section of the boat, draw a very skinny rhombus-like shape that is touching the boatâ€”you won't need to draw the long bottom line though, since the sailboat itself already creates that. Then, draw a slightly diagonal line above the rhombus, but touching it. Parallel from that line, draw one that is even more diagonal, and connect the two lines with another one on top of them that is slightly curved. After that, draw a few squares and half-circles inside this shape for the windows."

Be sure to leave some space on the left sail between the sail and the mast Once you've done that, draw a few curly lines near the top of the mast, and a line in the bottom right corner of the sail on the left that touches the mast."
