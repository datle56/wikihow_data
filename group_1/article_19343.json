      "content": "Bathe at least once per day. Try to shower or take a bath either in the morning or at night to clean off any sweat or odor-causing bacteria that are on your skin. Use an antibacterial soap for additional protection against odors. Scrub the areas that normally smell, such as your armpits, feet, and groin, with a washcloth and your soap to help get rid of the odor. [1] X Research source If you exercise or get sweaty during the day, rinse off or shower as soon as possible to eliminate the odors."

      "title": "Dry your body thoroughly.",
      "content": "Dry your body thoroughly. Bacteria tend to grow in warm, moist areas, so use a towel to pat your entire body dry after you bathe. Be sure to focus on areas where moisture gets trapped easily, like your armpits or groin. Keep patting your skin with your towel until you’re completely dry.

      "title": "Trim excess body hair to help stop bacteria growth.",
      "content": "Trim excess body hair to help stop bacteria growth. Bacteria can thrive in your body hair if it gets wet and they will trap odors in places like your armpits and groin. If you only want a light trim, use a small pair of grooming scissors to cut the hair shorter. Otherwise, you can use an electric trimmer or razor to completely remove the hair so there isn’t any odor. [3] X Research source Use caution when you cut your armpit hair. You have to shave it with shaving cream then when you have done that, wash your armpit off. When you are done with that, apply more shaving cream and use a razor while trimming your body hair. Make sure to be careful so you don’t accidentally cut yourself. Apply shaving cream or aftershave when you trim for a pleasant odor."

      "title": "Put on deodorant and antiperspirant.",
      "content": "Put on deodorant and antiperspirant. If your armpits or feet sweat, choose an antiperspirant that’s aluminum-based to help block your pores. Apply the antiperspirant under your arms or even on the bottom of your foot to help prevent sweat from forming. Many antiperspirants also have deodorizing fragrances to help mask odors, so pick a scent that you like. [4] X Research source You can also buy deodorant without antiperspirant if you don’t regularly sweat. Deodorant is acidic and helps kill the odor-causing bacteria on your skin."
