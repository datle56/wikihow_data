If any children are riding in your car, check to make sure they’re buckled in properly as well. In 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that seatbelts saved nearly 15,000 lives."

Nearly 80% of crashes occur within 3 seconds of being distracted. Stay focused on the road at all times so you can react and avoid potential accidents. If you’re drowsy or tired, pull over to grab a cup of coffee or rest until you feel awake enough to drive. [2] X Research source"

Choose a fixed object like a traffic sign, wait for the vehicle in front of you to pass it, and then count how long it takes for you to pass it. Use this rule to help maintain enough distance so you can safely stop and avoid accidents.
