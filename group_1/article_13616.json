      "content": "Decide what kind of twist style you would like. You can divide the hair into large sections for less twists or do small random twists all over the scalp. The styles and options are almost endless, so choose the one you feel most comfortable with. No matter which option you choose, Hair Augmentation Specialist Nikia Londy emphasizes that no matter what you choose, this style \"look[s] amazing on anybody! [It] also protects the hair and [is] low maintenance.\""

      "title": "Shampoo and condition the hair.",
      "content": "Shampoo and condition the hair. Give your hair a nice shampoo lather and rinse followed by a thorough conditioning. Once you have finished washing your hair begin drying by only removing excess water; It is very important to leave the hair a little damp. A good idea will be to use a leave-in moisturizing conditioner. Try removing excess water by blotting or squeezing the hair gently with a cotton t-shirt. Do not rub your hair! Don't use a towel because it will dry your hair out. Also, it will make you hair frizzy and your curls can get tangled in the towel. If your hair has drops of water dripping off the ends it is still too wet and you should continue blotting."

      "title": "Detangle the hair",
      "content": "Detangle the hair . Comb through the hair with a wide-tooth comb. Start by combing the ends of the hair. Once those tangles are gone then slide up an inch or so and (still combing downwards) keep combing until all tangles (from the roots - down) are gone. Use detangling spray (i.e. Kinky Curly Knot Today ) for a smoother comb through."

      "title": "Part your hair into two sections.",
      "content": "Part your hair into two sections. Use a rat-tail comb (a comb that has teeth on one end and a styling separator on the other) to part the hair horizontally from ear to ear. Hold the top and bottom sections separate from each other by using hair clips for each section."

    {
      "title": "Divide the top and bottom parts into six even sections.",
      "content": "Divide the top and bottom parts into six even sections. These are the sections you will use to make your twists ( Please note : This is example is only using six twists, however the procedure is the same for many). To create three sections on the top part, part the hair running from the crown down to the horizontal part you previously made. Clip each section so they remain separated. To create three sections on the bottom part, part the hair running from the base of your scalp up to the horizontal part you previously made. Clip each section so they remain in place."

      "title": "Remove the clip from the first (and eventually all) of the six sections of hair.",
      "content": "Remove the clip from the first (and eventually all) of the six sections of hair. This will be the only section that has been unclipped/not twisted and loose. It may be easier to work from the bottom to the top so you do not take the chance of messing up the top twists."

      "title": "Apply hair lotion, curling cream, curling gel, or mousse.",
      "content": "Apply hair lotion, curling cream, curling gel, or mousse. These styling products make the hair follicles sticky and will help to lock in the style. Rub the product onto your hands and smooth it into the loose section of hair to be twisted."

      "title": "Secure and separate the loose section.",
      "content": "Secure and separate the loose section. Use an elastic rubber band (optional) to hold the hair in place. Hair Augmentation Specialist Nikia Londy recommends that you then \"separate the hair into two separate strands.\" You do not need to use a rubber band if you prefer not to. Place the rubber band as close to the roots as possible while taking care to not pull the hair too tightly. Make sure the two separated sections are even."

      "content": "Twist the two new sections of hair together. Hair Augmentation Specialist Nikia Londy instructs: \"stretch out the hair and begin to twist them over each other until you reach the ends of your hair.\" Allow the ends to curl on each other and apply a small amount of hair gel or cream to hold the twist in place. Apply a small amount of cream or gel to curl the end of the twist and hold it in place.\" Repeat the process for the remaining sections of hair."

      "title": "Embellish with beads, barrettes, bows, or elastics with balls.",
      "content": "Embellish with beads, barrettes, bows, or elastics with balls. The embellishments can be added to the ends or base of the twists. Barrettes, bows and elastics are normally snapped/tied into place. Beads can be added by sliding them over the ends of the twists far enough up so they stick in place. It's best to secure the twist with a rubber band to keep the beads in place. Alternatively, you can find beads that clip onto your hair, which are specifically made for styles like the two strand twist."
