      "title": "Wash the rutabaga.",
      "content": "Wash the rutabaga. Rinse the rutabaga under cool water and scrub the skin with a vegetable brush. This will remove any excess dirt from the surface of the vegetable. [1] X Research source Pat the rutabaga dry with a clean towel or paper towel. Make sure that the rutabaga is completely dry to prevent an accident when you're peeling and chopping."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel the rutabaga.",
      "content": "Peel the rutabaga. Carefully slice off the top and bottom stems from the rutabaga. Trim about ½ inch (1.3 cm) off the top and bottom. Stand the rutabaga on the top end and cut it in half. Use a paring knife to carefully peel off the top layer of skin. Vegetable peelers aren't always effective for rutabaga, which has a skin that’s often covered in a thick waxy coating."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chop the rutabaga into small chunks.",
      "content": "Chop the rutabaga into small chunks. Use a kitchen knife and cut the peeled halves into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. This will help the rutabaga to cook faster. Cut all the chunks to the same size and thickness to ensure even cooking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Boil the rutabaga.",
      "content": "Boil the rutabaga. Transfer the chunks to a large stockpot and cover the rutabaga with water. Add an extra inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) of water to ensure the rutabaga is completely covered. Put on a lid and heat the rutabaga over medium-high heat. When the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for another 30 to 40 minutes. [2] X Research source The rutabaga is ready when a fork can easily pierce the flesh."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drain and mash the rutabaga.",
      "content": "Drain and mash the rutabaga. When the rutabaga is cooked through, pour the contents of the stockpot through a colander to drain the water. Return the rutabaga to the pot. Add the butter and nutmeg. Use a potato masher, hand mixer, or fork to mash the rutabaga until it’s smooth. You can leave some small chunks of rutabaga in the mash if you like, or puree it until it’s completely smooth and free of chunks. For an extra creamy mash, add a dollop of sour cream to the rutabaga as well."

    {
      "title": "Season before serving.",
      "content": "Season before serving. Add salt and pepper, to taste, and stir the seasonings into the mash. You can also add fresh or dried herbs, such as dill, oregano, or rosemary, or other seasonings like minced garlic. [3] X Research source Serve the mashed rutabaga while it’s still hot, either on its own or as a side dish with roast beef, duck, or stir fry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Preheat the oven.",
      "content": "Preheat the oven. Rutabaga is best roasted at 425 F (218 C), so set the oven and let it preheat to that temperature. Line a baking sheet with cooking spray, parchment paper, or a silicone mat. This will prevent the rutabaga from sticking to the pan."

      "content": "Wash, peel, and chop the rutabaga. Scrub the rutabaga with a vegetable brush under running water. Cut off the top and tail, and cut the rutabaga in half. Peel the skin off with a paring knife, being very careful not to cut yourself. Chop the rutabaga into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks."

      "title": "Oil and season the chunks.",
      "content": "Oil and season the chunks. Transfer the chunks to a large mixing bowl. Drizzle the oil over the chunks. Season the rutabaga with salt and pepper, to taste. Toss everything together to coat the chunks with the oil and seasonings. Other seasonings you can add to the rutabaga include garlic powder, dried rosemary, fresh minced garlic, onion powder, or a small minced onion. [4] X Research source"

Bake the rutabaga for about 40 minutes, until it’s tender and golden brown. [5] X Research source After 40 minutes, pierce a chunk with a fork. The rutabaga is ready if the fork enters easily and the rutabaga feels soft."

    {
      "title": "Serve hot.",
      "content": "Serve hot. Use an oven mitt to remove the cooked rutabaga from the oven. Transfer the roasted chunks to a serving bowl, or portion them out onto individual plates and serve with meat, fish, or a vegetable-based protein."

      "title": "Stir fry it.",
      "content": "Stir fry it. Heat a tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Wash, peel, and cut a rutabaga into thin slices. When the oil is shimmering, add the rutabaga slices. Cook the slices for about seven minutes, until golden brown and soft. Season with salt, pepper, garlic, and other seasonings if desired. You can either eat stir fried rutabaga on its own, or cook it with other vegetables, meats, or rice."
