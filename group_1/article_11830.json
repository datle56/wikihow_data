      "content": "Let him know right away that his behavior isn’t okay. If he’s a good boyfriend, he’ll want you to feel loved and cared for, not objectified or awkward. Tell him that what he’s doing makes you feel bad and that you’d like him to stop. [1] X Research source Try something like, “I really don’t like it when you do that. It makes me uncomfortable, and I want you to stop it.”"

      "title": "Sit down and think about what you’re okay with (and not okay with).",
      "content": "Sit down and think about what you’re okay with (and not okay with). Everyone’s boundaries are different, so don’t be afraid to come up with your own. That way, you’ll have a clear message to tell your boyfriend when you two talk so there’s no misunderstanding. [2] X Research source For instance, maybe you’re okay with your boyfriend grabbing your butt in private, but not in public. Or, maybe you’re okay with him touching your butt, but you’d like him to ask you first."

      "content": "You don’t need to feel guilty for asserting your boundaries. Everyone is allowed to have their own boundaries in a relationship, and that includes you. Standing up for yourself and telling your boyfriend how you feel will only improve your relationship, and it will make you feel much better, too.

      "content": "Make sure you’re both feeling cool, calm, and collected. Pick a quiet, private spot to talk so you don’t get overheard.

      "title": "Tell him how you’re feeling to avoid making him defensive.",
      "content": "Tell him how you’re feeling to avoid making him defensive. When you use “I” statements, focus on how his behavior makes you feel instead of blaming him for it. That way, you can have a much more productive conversation, and he’ll be more likely to respect what you’re saying. Instead of saying, “You always grab my butt in public,” try, “When you grab me in public, I feel uncomfortable.” Instead of saying, “You only ever talk about my butt,” try, “When you compliment my butt and not the rest of my body, I feel like you’re sexualizing me.”"

      "content": "Let him know what he can do so he understands what you’re comfortable with. Maybe you don’t mind your boyfriend talking about your butt with you, or you’re okay with him grabbing your butt in private. Be clear about what’s okay so he knows in the future. Try something like: [5] X Research source “It’s totally fine if you grab my butt when we’re home alone. I don’t mind it in private.” “You can take pictures of my butt if you keep them to yourself.”"

      "content": "Tell your boyfriend what will happen if he doesn’t respect your boundaries. You might take a break, rethink the relationship, or simply spend some time apart. It’s important to follow through with these consequences, too—that way, he knows you’re serious. [6] X Research source Say something like, “If you don’t respect my boundaries, I think it might be best if we took a break.” Or, “If you can’t respect my wishes, I’ll have to break up with you.”"

      "content": "Give him a chance to talk uninterrupted. It’s important that he has a say in the conversation too, even though it’s about your boundaries. Let him tell you his perspective, but be firm in your position. Nod along as he talks and ask follow-up questions to show that you’re listening. [7] X Trustworthy Source Understood Nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences, such as ADHD or dyslexia Go to source You can say things like, “I understand where you’re coming from,” and, “Could you tell me more?”"

      "content": "Tell him in the moment that what he did was not okay. If you’re in public, pull him aside and tell him quietly that what he did was wrong. If you’re in private, you can sit down and have a longer talk and remind him about your boundaries. It’s important to call things out in the moment so he understands what you’re not okay with. You could say something like, “Hey, that wasn’t cool. You can’t sexualize me like that.”"

If you’ve talked to him multiple times but he still does things that you’re uncomfortable with, break up with him as soon as possible. [8] X Research source Breaking up might sound extreme, but it’s important to hold your ground and let him know that his behavior is not okay."

      "content": "Your support system might be able to give you some advice. Talk to a close friend or family member about what you’re going through to see if they can help you out. Since they know you well, they might be able to suggest how to talk to your boyfriend and get through to him about your boundaries.
