      "content": "Cut a piece of fabric to cover the toe, sides, and top of the shoe. Err on the side of too much fabric when you are cutting out your fabric. You can always trim later, or fold the extra fabric over the sides. Measure the fabric by laying it over the top of the shoe, and marking the edges with tailorâ€™s chalk. Cut the fabric along the chalk lines."

    {
      "title": "Slit an opening in the fabric at the top of the shoe.",
      "content": "Slit an opening in the fabric at the top of the shoe. Place the fabric over the shoe, draw a mid-line with chalk, and then cut. This will allow you to fold the extra fabric inside the shoe, during glueing. Cut flaps into the fabric that goes over the opening of the shoe, so that they can be folded inside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut fabric to fit the back of the shoe, and the heel.",
      "content": "Cut fabric to fit the back of the shoe, and the heel. Use the same method you used to cut patterns for the top and sides of the shoe. As before, lay the fabric around the shoe, and mark with chalk, before cutting with your fabric scissors. If your shoe has a heel, cut a piece of fabric to wrap around the heel."

      "title": "Paint the fabric glue, or Mod Podge, on the top and inside of one shoe.",
      "content": "Paint the fabric glue, or Mod Podge, on the top and inside of one shoe. Applying the glue carefully is important because an even coating of glue prevents lumps in the fabric. Use your fabric paint brush to apply the Mod Podge in a thin, even layer. Make sure your fabric glue matches the kind of fabric you are using."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the fabric over the top of the shoe.",
      "content": "Wrap the fabric over the top of the shoe. Make sure to line up the fabric with your chalk marks. Pull the fabric taut so that it does not lump or buckle. Act quickly so that the paint does not dry before you have applied the fabric. Fold extra fabric around the edges of the shoes, and trim with scissors if necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the flaps of fabric along the opening of the shoe into the shoe.",
      "content": "Fold the flaps of fabric along the opening of the shoe into the shoe. This will create a smoother, more seamless edge than if you trimmed the fabric right up to the shoe opening. However, if the folded fabric will make the shoe uncomfortable to wear, then trim it. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Glue fabric to the backs and heels of the shoes.",
      "content": "Glue fabric to the backs and heels of the shoes. Paint the glue before wrapping and trimming the fabric, just as you did for the top of the shoe. If your fabric has a pattern like stripes or houndstooth, make sure to line up the pattern so that it matches neatly where it joins at the heel. For a smoother join at the heel, try folding your fabric inward before you glue it down. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Repeat the process with the second shoe.",
      "content": "Repeat the process with the second shoe. Now that you have done it once, the second shoe will be easier. Doing one shoe at a time makes sure to give you the time to carefully wrap and trim each piece of fabric before the glue sets."
