      "content": "Go for layers. If you're chilly, do something about it. Throw on that cardigan over a t-shirt or a vest. Wear a scarf in July. Throw on tights under your dress and socks over those. You can clash or not clash. It's all good. If you do clash, you may end up looking a bit Hipster -- but unlike Hipsters, your look isn't screaming I-dont-give-a-damn so hard that it seems like you do."

      "content": "Jazz it up with jewelry and accessories. Again, anything goes. Wooden bangles, a dreamcatcher pendant, an old locket, one of those headband-or-is-it-a-choker necklaces from the 90s, whatever strikes your fancy that day. Hemp bracelets, doorknocker earrings, and long necklaces are cute and add a feminine touch to any outfit, but whatever interests you is great. Vintage pins and necklaces are also cute. Look around at garage sales and thrift shops to spruce up your wardrobe. Scarves, headbands -- they work for both sexes. So does the quintessential messenger bag (denim, leather, you name it), though if you really wanna rock the Lisa Frank backpack, more power to you."

      "title": "If the shoe fits, wear it.",
      "content": "If the shoe fits, wear it. Really, anything is kosher. You're not very surprised by that, hopefully. But if you're looking for something specific, here's something to get you started: Vans Authentics are a safe bet. They even come in a wide variety of colors. Mono black (canvas and rubber both black), any shade of green, navy, or off white are great choices, but those aren't your only options. Moccasins are very important to an indie wardrobe. They add the unique and antique look to an everyday outfit. They can vary in design, color, and they go great with just about anything. Some great moccasin online sites are Minnesota moccasin, the moccasin shop, or moccasin house. Nike Dunks have become popular recently because of the nostalgia it can bring, and the limited edition styles they come in. In addition, they look good on just about everyone. Some may want to avoid these, because Nike Dunks could be looked at as mainstream. However, Nike SB dunks or Nike iD Dunks are more individual, if you have the money for them. Sanuks also add great touch! They come in different styles and color/patterns. Check your local boat shop or gb shoe warehouse Girls can also go for some cute flats in whatever color, pattern or style they choose. Funky platforms and gladiator sandals are also great choices if you're tired of boppin' around in sneakers."

      "content": "Make your own clothes . There's nothing more independent and totally you than something you've made yourself. If you can sew , you can start. And if creating something sounds like a task, try tailoring a piece you already have or adding your own touches to an item growing dust in your closet. You can reinvent your wardrobe without making a single trip to the store. And if sewing isn't your bag, try dyeing, knitting , crocheting , or any other project that can turn something boring into something brilliant."

      "title": "Dress for the weather.",
      "content": "Dress for the weather. For girls in cold weather, pea coats in any color are great, whether they're double-breasted or not. When it's chilly, cardigans are your best friend! Striped, patterned and solids are great and look fabulous with any T-shirt or tanks. For guys in cold weather, vintage leather or Members Only jackets are a great option. If you'd like, you can even deck them out with cool pins! In chilly weather, vests or sweater vests look awesome with anything. You can also try a track jacket; they come in lots of colors and are great year-round. Scarves (for men and women) are great year round because you can get them in cotton, linen, silk and wool. They're a classy touch to add no matter what outfit you're wearing. Bright colors and neutrals both look great, as long as they go well with your outfit. Bandanas can also be made into a cool scarf -- singular or with two tied together. You can also wear a scarf in many different ways -- even a simple scarf can make the most basic outfit seem amazingly unique."

      "title": "Be eco-friendly.",
      "content": "Be eco-friendly. Indie kids have a pretty good grasp on what's good and what's terrible for the environment. If they can reuse something, they will. Thrift shops are happening places! So donate your clothes, shop second-hand, make your own, and don't let fashion affect your carbon footprint. Generally, you'll wanna stay away from fur and the like, too. Animals are a huge part of the environment! Take the time to know what goes into your pieces and who or what it's affecting."

      "content": "Let your hair do its thing. If your hair is straight, wavy, or curly, let it out in all its glory. No need to spend hours in the bathroom \"correcting\" it. What's wrong with your hair the way it is? Nothing! And it's way better for your hair not to be exposed to all that heat. So flaunt what your mamma gave you, even if it is a nappy pile of coarse straw. That's not to say you can't do things with it. If you wanna throw it up, shave it off, rock the mullet, go for it. Just don't get too involved with dyes and thermal treatments. That's not you, you know?"

      "title": "Rock a set of headphones.",
      "content": "Rock a set of headphones. If there's going to be one generalization, it's that indie kids are up on the music scene. So get yourself a nice pair of retro or designer headphones that'll add a touch of mystery for when you're walking about. The best pair of headphones that suit the purpose that come to mind are the Grado SR60's. Once you get your headphones, try to find killer underground bands and songs to listen to. Most indie kids don't prescribe to the top 40 and like to pave their own path when it comes to their musical tastes."

      "title": "Avoid brand names and mainstream stores.",
      "content": "Avoid brand names and mainstream stores. Alright, so if there's one thing that actually is indie, it's avoiding brand names. An indie kid wouldn't be caught toting a Coach purse or a pair of $250 True Religion jeans. They tend to be a bit more logical than that -- if a similar, well-made, quality piece can be found at a vintage shop, where's the contest? But again, do as you please. Just because the mainstream likes something doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Embrace a trend or two if you honestly like it -- just don't stop embracing it when it falls out of favor!"

      "title": "Bring it back.",
      "content": "Bring it back. Being indie is about appreciating what is \"good.\" And \"good\" is timeless -- not temporary like trends always, always are. Because of that, indie people generally appreciate vintage items and timeless pieces (think 40s - 70s). If you find something that's old school that you like, rock it! It was good then and it's good now. Whether it's a vintage band tee or your sister's Kelly Kapowski t-shirt, remember: Do you like it? Not very hard to forget! Who knew being indie was so effortless?"

      "title": "Mix a whole bunch of styles if you so choose.",
      "content": "Mix a whole bunch of styles if you so choose. Since you're free to be who you are, mix it up! Go a little Jackie Kennedy, go a little John Lennon, go a little Artist Formerly Known as Prince if you damn well please. If you like it, you'll feel confident. And if you feel confident, you'll rock it. Don't worry about certain pieces fitting into a certain label. Do you like that plaid shirt but you know it screams hipster? How about that studded cuff that almost comes prepackaged with eyeliner? Cool. Go for it! When you mix 'em all, the look is quintessentially you."

      "content": "Don't believe the hype. You're probably gonna read a bunch of stuff on the Internet or see a bunch of videos or talk to a bunch of your friends about what indie is. If they say \"dude, you gotta wear skinny jeans\" or \"whoa, what are you doing in those Converses?!\" shrug it off. The whole idea of indie is that there isn't a look you have to abide by. Feel free to correct them, too! Choose your clothes according to your personality and body type."

    {
      "title": "Be yourself",
      "content": "Be yourself . Being indie means you're independent â€”it's where the name comes from. What does independent mean? It means you do your own thing. It doesn't matter what current fashion trends are, were, or will be -- you just do whatever you feel like. So don't even worry about dressing indie -- if you're dressing like you want, that's it. Just make sure you like it because you like it. Society's voice is so obnoxiously loud sometimes it's hard to determine if it's us making the decision or someone else telling us to make the decision."
