      "content": "Start with a clean necktie. Before you put away a tie, you'll want to make sure that it's free of dirt, stains, smudges, and other blemishes that might undercut the look of your formal attire. Ties are often made from delicate materials that can have unpredictable results when run through the washing machine, so have your accessories dry cleaned if they're in need of serious treatment. [1] X Research source To remove small stains at home, dab them with a clean, non-shedding cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the tie so that it's facing you.",
      "content": "Hold the tie so that it's facing you. Take the tie in one hand by the slender end, letting the other fall straight down toward the floor. You should be staring at the outer face of the tie—the one that people will see when they look at you. Inspect the tie for dust, lint, and loose threads before you begin folding. That way, it will be pristine and presentable whenever you're ready to wear it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Double the tie over on itself once.",
      "content": "Double the tie over on itself once. Using your other hand or a flat surface like a table or your bed for stability, bring the ends of the tie toward one another so that the outer face is folded inward. Adjust the ends until they overlap and the rest of the material is perfectly aligned. Run your hand down the length of the folded tie lightly to work out any inconsistencies in the fabric. [3] X Research source It may seem counterintuitive to fold the outer face of the tie inward, but this will protect the visible side from dirt and prevent it from getting snagged on other items in your suitcase or accessory drawer. Make sure there are no twists, wrinkles, or smaller folds in the tie. When left to sit for long periods of time, imperfections in the material may cause creasing that can be difficult to remove."

    {
      "title": "Fold the tie 2-3 more times.",
      "content": "Fold the tie 2-3 more times. Holding the ends together, place one hand in the center of the folded tie and double it over again. Continue doing this until the tie is as small as you want it. Remember to smooth out the fabric after each subsequent fold. The weight of the tie will keep it folded once you lay it down, so there's no need to use a separate band or clip. Avoid folding the tie so tightly that the pressure of the bundle inadvertently causes wrinkles."

    {
      "title": "Pinch the slender end of the tie between your thumb and forefinger.",
      "content": "Pinch the slender end of the tie between your thumb and forefinger. Grip the tie by the very tip so that there's no excess fabric sticking out from between your fingers. The end you're holding will be the one that ends up on the inside of the roll. Alternatively, you can fold the tie in half once and grip both ends before rolling so that not as much wrapping is required. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hold the tie up vertically.",
      "content": "Hold the tie up vertically. Let the broad end extend toward the ground so that the tie is completely straight. Keeping it pointed up and down will make rolling quicker, easier, and more precise. This means that your gripping hand should be held flat with your two fingers pointed out to the side. Try not to let the tie touch the ground or any other objects in the immediate vicinity, especially if there's water, ink, or food or drink nearby."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the tie loosely around your fingers.",
      "content": "Wrap the tie loosely around your fingers. Reach down with your other hand and gather up the broad end. Then, bring it up and around the hand you're holding the tie with. Make sure you're rolling the tie with the outer face (the one that will be visible while you're wearing it) pointed inward to keep it tucked away and protected. Continue rolling the tie until it forms a neat little cylinder shape. You can wind the tie either in front of or behind your second hand. Whichever method you prefer will work—just double check that the outer face of the tie is on the inside. Be careful not to roll the tie too tight. Doing so could create wrinkles or cause you to trap you own fingers (oops!)."

      "title": "Set the tie on one end or lay it out on its side.",
      "content": "Set the tie on one end or lay it out on its side. Now that the tie is in a nice compact bundle, the best way to store it is to stand it upright on one end so that it resembles a cinnamon roll. If you'd prefer, you can also place it down lengthwise, with the broad tip tucked underneath to keep it from coming unraveled. [5] X Research source Your ties will take up the least amount of space when stored in an upright position. In fact, you could fit as many as 2-3 dozen in an average-sized sock drawer! Consider using a compartmentalized drawer organizer to keep your rolled ties separated and neatly organized. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Layer folded ties between your other clothing.",
      "content": "Layer folded ties between your other clothing. The next time you're packing your suitcase for a business trip, start by putting down a base layer of heavier garments like slacks. Arrange your folded ties in a row on top, then cover them with your dress shirts and other items. The added weight will keep them nice and flat and prevent them from being jostled around. You can also pack ties with a coat or pair of pants by tucking them into the pockets to ensure that they don't go anywhere. [7] X Research source Keep your ties separated from garments that could bleed or snag."

    {
      "title": "Stick rolled ties inside your shoes.",
      "content": "Stick rolled ties inside your shoes. Insert the bundle into the opening of the shoes so that they're standing upright on the insole, just like they would be in your dresser back home. The sidewalls should be supportive enough to hold their shape, which means your delicate ties won't get crushed under the rest of the clothing you've packed. Be careful not to push the ties too deep into the shoes, or they could end up getting squashed. This trick will produce the best results with sturdier types of footwear like dress shoes and boots. You likely won't get the same level of protection from low-cut loafers or flimsy flats."

    {
      "title": "Place the ties in individual boxes.",
      "content": "Place the ties in individual boxes. If you're looking for a little extra protection, try stashing your rolled ties inside a separate container, such as a durable jewelry box, before throwing them in your luggage. They won't take up much more room, and they'll be able to withstand more manhandling without coming out a mangled mess. [8] X Research source You may be able to find special storage boxes designed specifically for organizing and transporting ties. Ask around at stores in your area that sell formal clothing and menswear accessories. If you're unable to find a suitable container, a (clean) piece of Tupperware, pencil box, or similar portable storage device can make an acceptable substitute."
