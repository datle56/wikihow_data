      "content": "A fringe haircut is a men’s style where the hair is left longer in the front. This creates a “fringe”—or bangs—over the forehead. Fringes work for a variety of different face shapes and hair textures because they can be styled in different ways. They can be long or short; straight across or side-swept; soft or angular; textured, curly, or sleek. [1] X Research source Popular fringe cuts for men include the messy fringe, textured fringe, classic fringe, and cropped fringe."

      "title": "Classic Fringe",
      "content": "Classic Fringe In a classic fringe, the bangs fall just above your eyebrows. The fringe is worn brushed down or down and to the side, and the sides and back are trimmed neatly. [2] X Research source How to style it: This is a fairly low-maintenance look, but if your fringe tends to look limp or oily throughout the day, consider adding a little texturizing powder or dry shampoo to freshen it up."

    {
      "title": "Cropped Fringe",
      "content": "Cropped Fringe With a cropped fringe, your bangs are cut in a blunt, straight line across your forehead. To keep the look fresh, add plenty of texture throughout the top and the fringe. For a classic, neat look, go with a French crop, with the back and sides kept neat in a low fade. Or pair shorter bangs with a mullet for a modern twist on this fun style. [3] X Research source How to style it: Work in a matte clay , sea salt spray , or texturizing powder to show off the piecey, choppy texture of this cut."

      "title": "Angular Fringe",
      "content": "Angular Fringe For an angular fringe, the top section of hair is left a little longer and layers are cut at an angle. The top and sides are usually cut in a taper, creating a balance between the neatly-trimmed sides and back and the effortlessly messy fringe. [4] X Research source How to style it: Use a matte pomade or clay to hold the style in place while showing off the texture of the angled layers."

      "title": "Messy Fringe",
      "content": "Messy Fringe The messy fringe is a textured cut with choppy layers that create a messy fringe on the forehead. It’s a great way to show off naturally wavy or curly hair, and you can wear it pushed back, down over your forehead, or swept over to the side. [5] X Research source How to style it: The messy fringe might seem effortless and low-maintenance—it’s meant to look like you just rolled out of bed—but it actually takes a little more styling than some cuts. Work sea salt spray or matte clay into your hair, then tousle your hair with your fingers, bending pieces in different directions until you get just the right look."

      "title": "Textured Fringe",
      "content": "Textured Fringe A textured fringe haircut is a style that has plenty of choppy layers mixed in to add volume and definition to your hair. It typically has a bit of a windswept look, but isn’t necessarily as disheveled as a messy fringe. How to style it: Emphasize the dimension in your hair with a little texturizing powder , texture paste , or sea salt spray . Opt for a matte product for a more natural finish."

      "title": "Lifted Fringe",
      "content": "Lifted Fringe With a lifted fringe, the hair is left long in the front, but it’s worn pushed up and back or to the side instead of down over the forehead. This is a great option if you want a fringe but have a rounder or wider face and don’t want to cover your forehead. [6] X Research source How to style it: Work styling clay or pomade into your hair, then use a round brush to lift it up and while you blow dry it. Options for a lifted fringe style include the quiff , pompadour , faux hawk , and slick-back ."

      "content": "Afro Fringe To get an afro fringe, let your natural curls grow out so they fall over your forehead. This is a versatile look—have your stylist or barber shape the rest of your hair in a shape that best suits your face, like cut close on the sides and worn longer on the top. [7] X Research source How to style it: To care for an afro , moisturize your hair regularly to keep it healthy, detangle your curls with a wide-toothed comb while your hair is wet, and gently pick it out to get the desired volume and shape."

      "title": "Side-Swept Fringe",
      "content": "Side-Swept Fringe For a side-swept fringe, the layers are cut a little longer so they can be brushed down and to the side across your forehead. This creates a carefree look that’s especially flattering if you have a wide forehead. For an edgier look, leave your fringe longer to create an asymmetrical shape. How to style it: Use sea salt spray or texturizing powder to bring out the texture in your hair, then use your fingers or a comb to sweep your hair down and to one side while you blowdry or air dry it."

      "title": "Disconnected Fringe",
      "content": "Disconnected Fringe For a bolder look, go with a disconnected fringe, where the top is cut with a distinct separation—or disconnect—from the sides. Go with a high skin fade on the sides and back to really show off that separation, and opt for plenty of texture on the top to create more visual interest. How to style it: Work a little texturizing powder into your hair after it dries for a natural finish that shows off the textured layers."

      "content": "Specify the length and style of fringe you want. Todd says, “When you’re asking for a fringe haircut, let your stylist know what length and thickness you prefer. Also, discuss the style you want, like straight-across or textured. Consider your stylist’s recommendations based on your face shape to get the most flattering look, and ask them for tips on how to style and maintain the cut.” Bring pictures of the style you want. it’s usually a lot easier to show your stylist or barber what you want instead of trying to explain it. Let your stylist know what the back and sides should look like. Since a fringe is just the front part of your hair, you can pair it with other cutting techniques like an undercut , fade , taper , or modern mullet ."

      "title": "Fringes are a great way to shorten a long face shape or hide a big forehead.",
      "content": "Fringes are a great way to shorten a long face shape or hide a big forehead. Most fringes fall down over the forehead, which can shorten a longer face. But because there are so many variations on fringes, you can find one that will work for almost any face shape. First, figure out your face shape by comparing the width of your forehead, cheeks, and jawline. Then, choose a fringe that will complement that shape. Pittman says that fringes are very flattering if you have “an oblong or rectangular face shape—you would especially benefit from a fringe that’s straight across horizontally. That will reduce how long that face shape looks by creating width in the forehead.” According to Pittman, “if you have a heart-shaped face, it’s wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, so you’d want to slim the width in the top.” Try an angled, side-swept fringe for a flattering look. If you have a square or round face, opt for a shorter fringe or one that you style up and back to help elongate your face. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Fringes can work with any hair texture. You just have to find the right style for your hair type and the length of your style. For instance, if you have thick, curly, or coily hair, you might prefer a messy or afro fringe so you can embrace your hair texture instead of fighting against it. If you have thin or receding hair, a textured fringe can add volume at your hairline. [10] X Research source Fringes usually work best with short or medium-length hair. But if you have longer hair, an asymmetrical side-swept fringe may work with your style."
