Use a measuring cup to pour white vinegar and water in a bowl and mix it thoroughly to incorporate both ingredients together. This slightly acidic solution will help remove wax and silicone buildup on wood tables. [1] X Research source You can also purchase chemical wax polish remover at most furniture stores or online.

As the wax transfers to your cloth, it will start to become black. As it darkens, use a different, clean portion of the rag. Continue to do this over the surface of the table until you remove the wax. [3] X Research source If you are using a chemical wax remover, remember to wear gloves. You may have to use many rags for this step."
