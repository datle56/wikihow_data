      "content": "Play a simple drinking game with a deck of cards. Shuffle a deck of cards and place it face-down on a table. Flip over the first card, then take turns guessing whether the next card will be higher or lower than the last. If you guess wrong, you drink! A similar game is Red/Black, where players take turns guessing if the next card is red or black. If you’re wrong, drink. If you get 3 in a row correct, make a new rule, like, “Neither of us can say the word ‘beer,’ or we both drink.”"

      "content": "Add some alcohol to this classic party game. You probably already know how to play Never Have I Ever , and the drinking game is almost identical. The first person says something that they’ve never done, and the other player has to drink if they have done that thing. [1] X Research source Playing with 2 people lets you spill some more secrets, if you have a close relationship. Try prompts like, “Never have I ever stolen anything,” or, “Never have I ever drunk-dialed an ex.”"

      "title": "Play Truth or Dare with a boozy twist.",
      "content": "Play Truth or Dare with a boozy twist. Take Truth or Dare to the next level by adding an option to drink if you don’t want to tell a truth or perform a dare. It’s a simple way to raise the stakes and make the game even more audacious as it progresses. If you’re drinking with a romantic partner , dating Coach Laura Bilotta says to “focus on fun and playful dares rather than embarrassing or risky ones.”"

      "title": "Take a drink if the other player guesses your lie.",
      "content": "Take a drink if the other player guesses your lie. To play Two Truths and a lie , one player makes 3 statements about themself (where they were born, what they’ve done in their life, etc). The other tries to guess the lie, and if they’re right, the first player takes a drink. Take turns making up statements and guessing the lie, and play until you’ve both learned something new and exciting about each other."

If your opponent beats you, drink! [2] X Research source Play multiple rounds and keep track of your wins and losses.

      "content": "Test your powers of memorization. Start by saying, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing…” At the end, say a single item you’ll bring, like apples. [3] X Research source The other player then repeats the phrase, plus your item, plus a new item. Take turns going back and forth like this, adding an item each time. Whoever messes up the list has to drink. For example, a turn might look like, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing apples, pears, and sandwiches.” Then the other player says, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing apples, pears, sandwiches, and juice.”"

      "content": "Add alcohol to the popular bluffing card game. You probably played Bullshit when you were younger. In it, players take turns laying off cards from their hands in ascending order, announcing the card and how many of it they’re laying off each turn, racing to get rid of all their cards. [4] X Research source The other player can call “bullshit” if they think you’re lying about your cards, like if you said you’re playing 3 aces, but they hold 2 of the aces themselves. If you get caught in a bullshit call, drink. If you call bullshit but your opponent was telling the truth, you drink."

For example, on the first round you might say “green” and your friend says, “car.” The next round, you both might guess “traffic light” as the word(s) that connect them."

[6] X Research source If they make it, the shots cancel each other out, and it’s their turn. Or go the full mile and play beer pong with a full fleet of cups."

      "content": "Subject each other to a little public embarrassment. Start by flipping a coin and having your friend guess if it’s heads or tails. If they’re right, your turn ends and they flip the coin. If they’re wrong, flip it again, and let them guess again. This time, if they’re right, they must answer a single question truthfully, then it’s their turn to flip. Otherwise, flip the coin again. If they’re right on the third flip, they take a shot. If they’re wrong, they must post something embarrassing to social media, like “I like the smell of old underwear.” Decide beforehand what either of you will post if you lose. Relinquish the coin and let them flip, putting yourself to the test!"
