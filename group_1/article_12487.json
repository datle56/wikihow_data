      "title": "Choose a good topic",
      "content": "Choose a good topic . Avoid controversial topics that are likely going to cause divisions within the congregation. As the Jumu'ah prayer is a time for coming together, you should choose a topic that will unite the congregation. Also avoid complicated topics, such as the nitty-gritty rules of inheritance, as not everyone will be able to understand the topic properly. Remember, the congregation should be able to leave the mosque with a lesson learnt, and if you choose a very niche topic, the khutbah might not be as effective. Try to choose a relevant topic. For example, if Ramadan, Eid or the Hajj season is approaching in a few weeks, speak about the virtues of these events so that the congregation can understand their significance."

      "title": "Learn and practice public speaking.",
      "content": "Learn and practice public speaking. The khutbah is an act of public speaking in front of a large audience. On Fridays, the mosques are normally packed even more, so it's vital that you know how to deliver an effective khutbah in order to benefit the congregation. With that in mind, you need to know that these people have a respect for knowledge, so you should be able smoothly and coherently deliver the sermon. There are many ways to do this, for example: Look at the audience. When they feel that you are speaking directly to them, they will feel engaged. Raise your voice to emphasise certain points. This will bring back any attention that may have been lost and emphasise the key parts of your speech. Know your verses and hadiths. The worst thing to do when delivering a khutbah is being unable to recite a certain verse, mispronouncing the verse, or forgetting a verse. Come prepared beforehand; revise the verses or narrations you are going to say. This is also especially important because you don't want to constantly be looking at your script. Learn as much of the English as you can by heart, and definitely memorize the Arabic. Remember: if you misread a verse, you may change the meaning, so be careful, and don't be afraid to have a quick glance at your notes to remind you of the words. Going over the English is just as important as going over the Arabic; if English isn't your mother-tongue, it may be best to avoid words that you may have difficulty pronouncing. Some people might get distracted, and even find it funny, if you mispronounce a word."
