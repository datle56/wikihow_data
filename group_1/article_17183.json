Skin can be oily, dry, or combination, and you can have normal or sensitive skin. Choose a matte finish or oil-free liquid or powder foundation if you have oily skin. Choose a moisturizing or hydrating cream or stick foundation if you have dry skin. Choose a hypoallergenic and scent-free foundation if you have sensitive skin. Choose a powder foundation if you have combination skin. [8] X Research source Choose a foundation that offers full or medium coverage if you have an uneven complexion and want to cover most of your skin. Otherwise, look for a foundation that offers partial or sheer coverage if you have a fairly even complexion and want a more natural look. It’s always a good idea to buy foundation that has an SPF, because this will provide a small measure of protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays."

Going by eye, choose a few shades that look closest to your skin tone. Then, test them by dabbing some swatches of foundation on your jawline. The skin at your jawline will be truer to your natural undertone and give you an idea of how the foundation will look against your neck. If the store doesn’t offer testers, hold the bottles of foundation up to your neck and jawline. Whether you are using testers or just holding bottles up to your skin, find a door or window to see what the foundation shades will look like in natural light. This will also give the foundation some time to dry so that you know what it will look like all the time."
