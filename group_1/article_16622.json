      "title": "Attach cardboard to the back of the hole.",
      "content": "Attach cardboard to the back of the hole. Attach a sturdy piece of scrap cardboard with tape or a hand clamp that’s easily removed later. Placing a back piece behind the hole prevents any material from running through the hole. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Squeeze three or four drops of super glue into the hole.",
      "content": "Squeeze three or four drops of super glue into the hole. Make a small pool at the bottom of the hole with a few drops of super glue. The backing will give the glue a flush edge at the bottom of the hole. Super glue dries quickly, so you will have to work fast before it sets. [2] X Research source Wear plastic gloves to avoid getting super glue stuck on your hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sprinkle a pinch of baking soda on top of the glue and press firmly.",
      "content": "Sprinkle a pinch of baking soda on top of the glue and press firmly. Press the baking soda into the super glue with your finger or a flat edge so the two substances bond together. Super glue is thin, but when combined with a powder like baking soda, it thickens and makes more of a cement-like substance. [3] X Research source Other powders like sawdust or chalk powder may also work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Layer super glue and baking soda until the hole is filled.",
      "content": "Layer super glue and baking soda until the hole is filled. Keep building layers until you’ve formed a plug that is flush with the top of the hole. Even if the hole is filled after the first time, add a second layer of super glue and baking soda to strengthen the bond. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the patch dry for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the patch dry for 15 minutes. The superglue hardens within 2-3 minutes, but it’s best to allow the patch to cure a little longer. As it dries, the hardened substance will turn a chalky white color. Once the patch is dry, remove the backing. [5] X Research source Try mixing colored powder or food dye with the baking soda to resemble the color of the plastic more closely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sand the top of the patch if there’s any residue.",
      "content": "Sand the top of the patch if there’s any residue. Use short back-and-forth strokes to sand away any buildup. Keep a constant pressure as you file the cement mixture. Sandpaper or a fine-grit metal file will work fine. [6] X Research source Wear a face mask so you don’t breathe in any plastic particles as you work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach cardboard backing to the hole.",
      "content": "Attach cardboard backing to the hole. Adhere the backing with pieces of tape or with a hand clamp to prevent any run-off. Make sure it's pressed tightly against the bottom of the hole. Scrap cardboard works best since it can easily be removed when you’re finished. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Melt a plastic welding rod with a welder into smaller holes.",
      "content": "Melt a plastic welding rod with a welder into smaller holes. To weld the plastic , hold the plastic welding rod 1 ⁄ 2 inch (13 mm) above the hole. Use the welder on the end of the plastic rod to melt the plastic into the hole. Once the hole is filled, turn off the welder and let the plastic solidify. [8] X Research source Keep your hands away from the heating end of the plastic welder to avoid burns. Find a rod that closely resembles the color of the plastic you’re fixing."

      "title": "Wrap a heated plastic rod into a spiral inside a larger hole.",
      "content": "Wrap a heated plastic rod into a spiral inside a larger hole. Heat the end of the plastic rod with a plastic welder. Start spiraling the rod along the bottom of the hole so it is pressed against the backing. Layer the plastic until it lays flush with the top edge of the hole. [9] X Research source Hold the plastic welder 1 ⁄ 2 inch (13 mm) away from the rod to make it malleable but not completely melted."

    {
      "title": "Use a soldering iron to trim the rod and smooth the hole.",
      "content": "Use a soldering iron to trim the rod and smooth the hole. Once the hole is filled with the plastic, use a hot soldering iron to cut the end. Rub the edge of the iron across the top of the filled hole to smooth it out and fuse the top of the plug. [10] X Research source Don't leave a depression in the plug since this could compromise its strength and integrity."

      "title": "Let the plastic cool for 5 minutes before filing it.",
      "content": "Let the plastic cool for 5 minutes before filing it. It only takes a few minutes for the plastic to solidify. Once it is cool to the touch, use a file or sandpaper to smooth out the plastic and make it flush. [11] X Research source Hold the plastic welder just above the area to remove the file markings and smooth out the surface. Cut away any pieces too big to file with a small razor blade.

      "content": "Cut 2 fiberglass patches 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger than the hole. You'll layer epoxy on either side of a mesh fiberglass patch to fill the hole. Cut the fiberglass larger than the hole so you can fully cover it. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix even amounts of each part of the epoxy in a bucket.",
      "content": "Mix even amounts of each part of the epoxy in a bucket. Use a stirring stick to mix the even parts of the epoxy in a bucket or large mixing bowl. A two-part epoxy has a resin and an activator that need to be mixed together to cure. Once it’s mixed, the epoxy is very thick and tacky. [14] X Research source Wear disposable gloves when working with epoxy , since it may cause skin irritation. Lay cardboard or another disposable liner underneath the plastic in case it drips through the mesh."

      "title": "Spread a thin layer of epoxy on one side of the hole with a putty knife.",
      "content": "Spread a thin layer of epoxy on one side of the hole with a putty knife. Cover the entire area surrounding the hole with a layer of epoxy. Make sure the layers are even so that it dries evenly. Make the layers thick enough that the fiberglass sticks to it, but not overly thick. [15] X Research source Apply enough epoxy so the entire fiberglass patch sticks to the plastic."

      "title": "Press a fiberglass patch onto the epoxy so the hole is at the center.",
      "content": "Press a fiberglass patch onto the epoxy so the hole is at the center. The excess fiberglass on each side ensures there’s enough to cover the hole and will add a smooth transition between the plastic and epoxy. [16] X Research source Fiberglass patches are flexible and will conform to the shape of the plastic you’re mending."

    {
      "title": "Paint another layer of the epoxy over the fiberglass.",
      "content": "Paint another layer of the epoxy over the fiberglass. This time as you apply the epoxy, spread it over the part of the mesh that covers the hole. Use just enough epoxy to hide the mesh underneath, but not so much that it is clumpy. Keep it as close to flush with the plastic as possible. [17] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the epoxy dry for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Let the epoxy dry for 24 hours. Let the epoxy set on one side of the plastic before transporting the plastic or moving on to the next step. As it dries, it will harden and form a solid layer. It takes at least 24 hours for the epoxy to initially cure, though it may take longer in humid climates. [18] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Repeat the process on the other side of the hole.",
      "content": "Repeat the process on the other side of the hole. Once one side of epoxy and fiberglass has set, apply epoxy to the other side of the plastic and adhere the fiberglass to it. Paint another layer of the epoxy over the fiberglass and let it cure for another 24 hours. [19] X Research source Repeat the entire process again with more fiberglass pieces if you need to add more structural integrity to the plastic. For plastic car bumpers , use a 2-part automotive body filler instead of epoxy. Home Improvement Specialist Ryaan Tuttle says, “You want to mix up some Bondo and fill in the holes. And then you can lightly sand it down when you're done.” Just mix the base putty with the hardener and follow the same process that you would with epoxy."

    {
      "title": "Sand the epoxy until it is smooth.",
      "content": "Sand the epoxy until it is smooth. Once both sides of the epoxy are set and dry, use sandpaper to smooth any dry epoxy, so it is level with the plastic. Wear a face mask as you sand the epoxy down so you don’t breathe in any dust particles. Epoxy can be painted afterward to match the color of the plastic."
