      "title": "Take a breath and ask yourself how you’re feeling right now.",
      "content": "Take a breath and ask yourself how you’re feeling right now. Turn your focus to the present and let go of what you can’t control. You can’t change the past or predict the future, so save your brain power and time and stop ruminating on them. [1] X Research source This doesn’t mean you have to completely forget about the past or future. Consider them when you make decisions, but save your energy for the present."

      "title": "Tell yourself that you’re confused and it’s OK.",
      "content": "Tell yourself that you’re confused and it’s OK. Ignoring or running from your confusion makes you feel better temporarily, but it won’t solve anything long-term. [2] X Expert Source Kim Chronister, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 20 September 2022. Let yourself feel confused or agitated—it’ll lead you toward the source of your feelings and to possible solutions. The more you try to not think about something, the more your brain will fixate on it. Let your feelings and thoughts flow uninterrupted."

      "content": "Use deep breathing to trigger your body’s relaxation response. Slow, guided breathing improves your mood and focus and reduces anxiety. When you feel confused or paralyzed by indecision, try one of these breathing exercises : [3] X Research source The 4-7-8 Technique: Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds. Hold your breath for 7 seconds, then exhale through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat. Resonant Breathing: Sit upright and repeat inhaling for 5 seconds and then exhaling for 5 seconds.

      "title": "Consider positive outcomes based on facts instead of worst-case scenarios.",
      "content": "Consider positive outcomes based on facts instead of worst-case scenarios. If you’re convinced that something bad is real or bound to happen, you’ll fixate on it even if it has no grounding in facts. Look at what’s objectively true about your situation, then imagine likely best-case scenarios. [4] X Research source For example: Imagine your best friend is distant and constantly on their phone. It’s more likely they’re talking to a crush than ignoring you because they’re upset. Say your spouse is moody and constantly sending emails. Instead of assuming they’re cheating, recognize it’s more likely they’re working hard on a project. Most of the time, the worst-case scenario your mind comes up with is not the most likely one."

      "title": "Treat your thoughts as if they’re opinions, not facts.",
      "content": "Treat your thoughts as if they’re opinions, not facts. Even when your thoughts feel true, framing them as opinions helps you step back and look at them in new ways. [5] X Expert Source Kim Chronister, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 20 September 2022. When you put distance between yourself as an individual and your thoughts, it’s a lot easier to be objective about them. [6] X Research source For example: Frame “I’m going to make a mistake if I text my ex” like an opinion (“I feel like it’s a mistake to text them”). Then ask objective questions—why would it be a mistake? What’s likely to happen? Questioning your thoughts objectively helps point out flawed or self-limiting thought patterns and helps you approach your feelings like a third party."

Assumptions like “Everything will fall apart if I don’t figure this out now” or “People will think I’m weak if I need help” actually prevent you from taking action. These limiting beliefs are probably not totally true—debunk these thoughts to broaden your perspective.

      "content": "If you’re struggling with a decision, examine the benefits of each choice. This will guide you towards making a thoughtful decision you’re less likely to regret. What options do you have? How would each option help or hurt? How would your life be different after making that choice? [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Write your pro-con list down so you can clearly see your train of thought and look at it with a fresh perspective.

      "content": "Unhelpful thinking styles keep you confused and distressed. Recognize when you’re following an unwarranted train of thought and call it out to yourself. Stop trusting faulty logic and reevaluate your circumstances to ground yourself in reality. [9] X Research source Some common traps include: Worst-case scenarios: You exaggerate a negative outcome of a situation and think that you’ll be unable to cope. Harsh self-criticizing: You judge yourself by rules you think you should be following and label yourself negative things like undeserving or useless. Black-and-white thinking: You think in extreme all-or-nothing terms where outcomes are perfect or terrible with no possible middle ground."

      "content": "Take “mental vacations” to help parse through confusing thoughts. When you live in a constant state of “go, go, go,” you build up stress that damages your clear thinking ability. Take 20 minutes out of your day to close your eyes, breath, and let your mind and body relax. [10] X Research source Sit or lay in a comfy position and tell yourself “I’m going on vacation!” to get in the right headspace. Let yourself feel and experience whatever emotions come up during your break without trying to push anything away.

Try distracting yourself with whatever interests you—watch TV, listen to music, go for a walk outside, or pick up a good book. [11] X Expert Source Kim Chronister, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 20 September 2022. The goal is to take a break from thoughts and activities that make you feel anxious and confused so your brain and body can recuperate from stress. [12] X Research source Remember, this is a short-term solution. If you’re frequently feeling confused or conflicted, there’s a deeper underlying cause that needs to be addressed. Reader Poll: We asked 2540 wikiHow readers what their go-to self-care activity is, and only 4% of them said Baking and cooking. [Take Poll] Baking or cooking isn't the first type of self-care that comes to mind for most people, possibly because cooking takes organization and work. But it also does a great job of distracting your thoughts for a short period of time."
