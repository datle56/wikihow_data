      "content": "Move your phone out of direct sunlight or heat. Being in direct sunlight is one of the fastest ways that your phone can overheat, so quickly move it away from the sunlight and onto a cool surface. Exposure to the sun can cause serious damage to your phone’s battery, including an inability to recharge and even the potential to start a fire. [1] X Research source If you’re outside , move your phone to a shady spot. If you’re inside , place it on a cool, hard, dry surface (like a kitchen counter or coffee table). If your phone is in its car mount or car cradle , remove it as these are typically exposed to the sun via the window or windshield. Although the urge to put it in the fridge or freezer might make sense at first, the abrupt change in temperature can actually damage your phone."

      "content": "Unplug your phone if it’s charging. You should avoid charging your phone if it’s overheated, so unplug it if it’s plugged in. After your battery reaches 100%, many smartphones are designed to continue to inject power into their batteries even when they’re at capacity. This excess energy has nowhere to go and will increase your device’s temperature, which can lead to damaged battery or a damaged phone all together. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Blow on your phone or fan it with something. Just like you might blow on your food before eating it, you can blow on your smartphone to increase airflow and allow the heat to dissipate— it’s science! If you happen to have a fan on hand (or something you can use as a fan—like a handkerchief), use that instead of exhausting all your lung power. This method works best if the phone has already been moved to a cooler surface. [3] X Research source"

You can also adjust app settings to make sure none of them are silently running in the background. [4] X Research source Don’t game or stream and charge your phone at the same time, as charging is adding energy to your battery and will likely increase the heat. Instead, take breaks from your gaming and streaming, especially if you’re charging, so your phone has a chance to cool down."
