Your partner might not be able to have their phone on them all the time, so be patient while you wait for their response. If they’re at work, with friends and family, or doing another activity, they may just be a bit distracted. Try your best not to jump to any conclusions about why they’re taking so long since it could make you upset for no reason. If you’ve waited multiple days for a reply and you still haven’t heard back, it may be a sign that the person has lost interest . To distract yourself while you wait, put your phone down and try getting some exercise, cooking, taking a walk, or doing your favorite hobby so you aren’t tempted to keep checking for a reply.

      "content": "Cut back on how many text messages you send. The person might feel overwhelmed if you’re talking to them a lot, especially if you’ve just started dating (or aren’t quite sure where you’re at yet). It’s completely OK to send 1 or 2 messages back-to-back before your partner replies. However, it might be pretty tough for them to catch up and respond to a wall of texts. If you normally send multiple texts, try saving a few of the topics for when you’re chatting on the phone or hanging out together. If you’re in a new relationship, you can try testing your partner by only messaging them once a day. This gives them the chance to step up their game and text you more often."

It can be easy to accidentally assume that someone doesn’t care if they only send short messages. Ask the person how they feel about a topic if you think there’s something wrong so your partner has a chance to fully explain themselves.

For example, you can use texting to ask about each other’s days or make plans, but you should call or meet up if you want to talk about any relationship issues. You could even move to a different messaging platform, such as Messenger or Twitter DMs, for more casual conversations. That way, when you send a text, the person knows that it’s important."

If you always ask the same questions or talk about the same thing, the other person might just need something more engaging. Try asking them open-ended questions that start with “How,” “What,” or “Why” to get them talking. Tailoring your messages to them better might encourage them to respond more often. [8] X Research source For example, you could ask something like, “You’re a huge movie buff, right? What are some new movies I should check out?” As another example, you could end your message on a cliffhanger like, “OMG, the craziest thing just happened at work.” Dating coach John Keegan mentions how some great ways to engage via text include sending something flirtatious , light, and playful, or that reconnects to a previous conversation you both had.

Find a time when you can talk to your partner face-to-face or over the phone so you’re not waiting for replies. Mention how their texts make you feel when you read them. Give them advice on how to write their messages going forward so they know what you prefer. [10] X Research source For example, you might say something like, “I feel like I’m not respected when I write sincere messages and get one-word answers back. I’d appreciate it if you would say a little bit more about how you’re feeling so I don’t think you’re upset.”"

You can learn a lot more about your partner when you’re hanging out with each other than over text. Rather than texting an entire conversation, ask them when they’re able to get together with you. Cantarella suggests that, since physical chemistry is a lot more important than how you communicate in your messages, you’ll feel a lot deeper of a connection. “Once you eliminate texting from your main form of communication, you get to the face to face, and that's when you can see if someone's right for dating.” [12] X Expert Source Julianne Cantarella Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 6 August 2021."
