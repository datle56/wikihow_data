      "content": "Learn how to isolate your lats when flexing. Your lats are a pair of wide muscles that run from your armpits to your lower spine, wrapping around the back of your ribcage just beneath your shoulder blades. To figure out how to isolate your lats, first stand with your feet together. Arch your lower back so that your chest is pushed forward and your butt is pushed out. Spread your upper back by lifting your arms slightly away from your sides and holding your hands about 6 inches (15 cm) in front of your hips. Push your shoulders back and tense the muscles in your armpits. [1] X Research source As you get into position, imagine that you are holding a small ball in place under your arm with your muscles, while also holding your elbows up slightly."
