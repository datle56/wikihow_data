      "content": "Try a light aerobic workout to get your blood pumping. For instance, you can do jumping jacks or walking push-ups. For jumping jacks, start with your arms and legs straight together. At the same time, jump your legs out to about shoulder length and bring your arms up by your head. Jump back to the original position and repeat. For walking push-ups, do a couple of push-ups like normal, and then stay in the same position to move over four steps. Do more push-ups."

      "title": "Do stretches.",
      "content": "Do stretches. Stretching will help you be more flexible when you do actually start dancing. For instance, try hamstring stretches. Sit on the floor with one leg bent away. Stretch the other leg out in front of you. Let the outstretched leg pull inward while leaning forward. Hold for half a minute. Repeat a few times, and then switch to the other leg.

      "title": "Stretch your wrists and arms.",
      "content": "Stretch your wrists and arms. In breakdancing, weight is often carried on the arms and wrists, so you need to ensure they are flexible enough before starting. Holding your arm out, move your hand back and forth to slowly stretch out the muscles. With you arm still outstretched, flipped your hand over and back several times. To stretch out your forearms, place your palms together in front of you with your elbows out. Rotate your hands forward, stretching the muscles, and then rotate them back."

      "content": "Stretch your neck. You will be using your head and neck for balance. Standing straight, gently roll your neck in a circle, loosening your neck muscles. Repeat, moving in the opposite direction. Looking straight ahead and gently grab the side of your head, pulling your ear toward your shoulder and holding for a few counts. Do the same on the opposite side."
