      "title": "Draw a vertical line and divide it into 8 equal sections.",
      "content": "Draw a vertical line and divide it into 8 equal sections. Each section will be equal to 1 head length, which is the length of your person’s head from top to bottom. Generally, adult figures are 8 head lengths tall, so marking this on your paper at the beginning will help you keep the proportions of your drawing right. [1] X Research source Draw horizontal lines to divide up the vertical line, and keep in mind that the top horizontal line will be the top of your person’s head and the bottom line will be the bottom of your person’s feet. If you want to draw a child, divide the vertical line into fewer head lengths since children are generally shorter than adults. For example, use 3 head lengths for a toddler, or use 6 for a 10-year old."

      "title": "Sketch",
      "content": "Sketch rough outlines of the different parts of the body. Lightly sketch the first outlines of your person’s body using the guide lines to help with proportions. Include rough outlines for the head, arms, body, and legs. Don’t worry about making the shapes precise yet since this is just a rough sketch. [2] X Research source The outline of the head should fall within the top head length section. The outlines of the person’s body and arms should start in the second head length section and extend down to the fourth section. The outlines of the legs should take up the lower 4 head length sections."

    {
      "title": "Connect and refine the outlines of the different parts of the body.",
      "content": "Connect and refine the outlines of the different parts of the body. Trace around the outer edges of the body to connect the different outlines so they flow together seamlessly. At this point in the process, start adjusting the proportions of the body to make it look more masculine or feminine, depending on what you’re going for. [3] X Research source If you want to draw a person with masculine features , broaden the shoulders, chest, and waist, and also take in the hips so they’re narrower. In general, use more angular lines as you define the outline of your drawing. To draw a person with feminine features, narrow the shoulders and chest area, and broaden the hips and thighs. Use rounder, softer lines to outline your figure."

    {
      "title": "Add in smaller details, like the hands and facial features.",
      "content": "Add in smaller details, like the hands and facial features . Sketch the outlines of the feet, hair, and knees. If you’re drawing a person with feminine features, add breasts and round out the hips and thighs. For a person with masculine features, define the muscles on the stomach, chest, and arms. [4] X Research source At this point, the person's body should be finished."

      "title": "Draw clothes",
      "content": "Draw clothes over the person’s body. Get creative with this part. Draw different styles and cuts of shirts, pants, shoes, and accessories. For a more feminine look, draw a dress or a skirt over your figure. To draw clothes, simply sketch them where they would naturally fall on the person’s body if they were wearing them. Then, erase any parts of the body inside the outlines of the clothes since those areas would be covered up. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Erase any unnecessary lines and shade in your drawing.",
      "content": "Erase any unnecessary lines and shade in your drawing . Go in and erase the vertical and horizontal lines you drew at the beginning to mark the head length sections. You should also erase any outline sketches from earlier that don’t belong in the final drawing. When you’re finished, shade the clothes, skin, and hair to make the person look more realistic and three-dimensional. [6] X Research source When you’re shading your drawing, pretend there’s an imaginary light source shining on one side of your person. Then, make the parts of the person’s body on the opposite side darker by shading them in more since that’s where the shadows would be."

      "title": "Draw an oval and divide it into 4 equal sections.",
      "content": "Draw an oval and divide it into 4 equal sections. This will be the head of your cartoon person. Make the head bigger than you would for a realistic-looking person since cartoons usually have exaggerated proportions. Use a horizontal and vertical line to divide the oval into 4 equal parts. [7] X Research source The horizontal and vertical lines in the oval will help you draw the face on your cartoon person later on."

      "content": "Draw a cylinder for the neck and a rectangle for the torso. Draw the neck so it’s coming out of the bottom center of the oval. Then, draw a rectangle coming off the bottom of the neck to make your cartoon person’s torso. [8] X Research source If you want to draw a cartoon person with feminine features , make the top of the rectangle narrower and the bottom of the rectangle wider. To draw a cartoon person with masculine features , broaden the top of the rectangle and make the bottom narrower."

      "content": "Draw cylinders for the arms and legs and circles for the knees and elbows. Draw 2 cylinders for each arm and leg with 1 circle in between each pair. The circles will be the outlines of the joints in your drawing. Position the arms and legs depending on what your cartoon person is doing. In general, the arms should extend out of the upper corners of the torso, and the legs should extend down off of the bottom. [9] X Research source Use straight, angular lines if you’re drawing a masculine cartoon person and round, soft lines if you’re drawing a feminine cartoon person."

Since you’re drawing a cartoon and not a realistic person, exaggerate the eyes by making them bigger than the rest of the facial features. When you draw the hair , have the hairline start slightly lower than the top of the head. [11] X Research source Get creative with the hairstyle you choose. Give your person a simple short hair hairstyle, or try drawing long or curly hair ."

Don’t forget to draw shoes and include any accessories you want your cartoon person to be wearing.
