      "content": "Locate a dungeon. You'll have the best chance finding a saddle in the dungeons scattered underground. Chests in dungeons have a 54% chance of spawning a saddle as loot. You'll know you're in a dungeon by the cobblestone + mossy stone walls, floors, and ceilings. They typically have a zombie, skeleton, or spider spawner, and one or two chests. It is possible, but very rare, to find a dungeon without a chest. With two chests, the chances are good that you'll find a saddle in one of them. Dungeons can occur anywhere in the overworld.

      "content": "Find a desert temple. These structures appear in the desert biome, and the floor of the temple structure will always be at Y:64. This means that the temple may be partially or completely covered by sand. When you find the temple, look for the blue clay block in the centre of the floor. Digging this out will expose the secret chamber containing four chests. Each of these chests has a 15% chance of spawning a saddle, but this will go up to 24% in 1.9. This means you'll be almost guaranteed to find a saddle from the four chests. Watch out for the TNT booby trap when you drop into the secret chamber. Don't drop anything else first to set off the pressure plate, as all the loot will explode. Break the pressure plate to disarm the trap."
