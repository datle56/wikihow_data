      "title": "Carnations symbolize love and remembrance.",
      "content": "Carnations symbolize love and remembrance. Their connection to death comes from their frequent use in funeral arrangements or as sympathy gifts to those who’ve lost a loved one . White, dark red, and pink carnations are particularly apt for mourning as they symbolize remembrance, deep love, and a mother’s loss. [1] X Research source The maternal meaning of a pink carnation originates from the Christian crucifixion story, where the flowers were said to spring up from Mary’s tears as she mourned her son Jesus. Many countries use carnations to honor veterans and the working class, particularly on International Workers’ Day (May 1). White carnations are worn in the Netherlands to remember the World War II resistance, while the Portuguese use bright red carnations to represent the 1970s Revolution of the Carnations."

People often dye regular roses black to evoke the gothic mystery and elegance of the black rose. [5] X Research source However, black roses are not the best choice for sympathy gifts, as they are closely connected to death's more macabre and tragic aspects.

In the late 20th century, black roses came to be used as a symbol of anarchist political movements in North America, but this symbolism is not widely recognized. Most popularly, black roses appear in media to symbolize farewells, grief, or the end of something significant."

[8] X Research source Marigolds are most popularly used for Day of the Dead traditions in Latin America, and anywhere pre-Columbian religions are practiced.

The spiritual significance of marigolds comes from Nahuatl mythology, in which the sun god Tonatiuh gifted the flowers to the people as a way to honor their dead."

[20] X Research source Due to its negative connotations surrounding death, avoid using wolfsbane as a gift demonstrating sympathy or grief. In Ancient Greek mythology, wolfsbane was created by the monstrous dog said to guard the gates of hell, and it’s also been connected to witchcraft throughout European folklore.

      "title": "Rafflesias symbolize death and trickery.",
      "content": "Rafflesias symbolize death and trickery. These meanings largely come from the flower’s biological behavior. The Rafflesia is an extremely rare parasitic plant that boasts the largest known individual flower in the world. The flower emits a rotten smell that attracts carrion flies, hence its connection to trickery and deceit. Not only are rafflesias not commercially sold, but their parasitic nature, foul smell, and eerie appearance would not make them an appropriate sympathy gift."
