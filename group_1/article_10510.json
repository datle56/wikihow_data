You should set aside time every day to study so that you can learn the material you're expected to know. [1] X Research source Daily study sessions are needed to keep the material fresh in your mind and to give yourself time to make connections between concepts. If you have other homework, you may decide to do it during your designated study time since it will help you better grasp the material. By reserving a specific time each day for studying, it can be easier to focus, because you won't have to worry about any other priorities competing for your attention.

For example, designate the days you want to focus on that subject, and which sections you will review each day. [9] X Research source It's okay for your plan to be a general outline. Don't let your planning waste the time you plan to use for studying. Break the information down so you're only tackling a little each day. That can keep you from feeling overwhelmed, and it will be easier to reward yourself continuously for sticking to your plan.

Try to recollect if your teacher has mentioned any important part of the text would be coming for the exam. Also try to remember any tricks or mnemonics taught by teacher to remember any important formulas or text. Research anything you don't understand and look up confusing vocabulary.

When you get home from school, it's a good idea to go through your notes from the day and try to fill in any gaps where you missed items or didn't quite understand. As you study for your exams, look up any information that isn't clear to you so that you can get more information. [13] X Research source It's crucial that you review the information in the weeks and days leading up to the exam. The more you revisit the information, the more it will become internalized and easier to remember. [14] X Research source"

Many exams incorporate more than one style of question. For a multiple-choice exam, make lists and tables, know the differences between concepts and words, and know-how topics are related to each other. For a fill-in-the-blank exam, focus on your notes because most teachers take their questions from the notes they provide. You should expect your teacher to remove an important word or words from a sentence, such as a term, date, phrase, or historical figure. [17] X Research source For an essay or short answer exam, pay attention to what your instructor emphasized in class. Write out what you know about this topic and do additional research if necessary. Use the syllabus, study guide, and textbook summary of the material to make a list of possible questions. Create a study list for each possible essay question."
