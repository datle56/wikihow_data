      "content": "Turn the top valve counter-clockwise. Turn the valve to the left until it can’t go any further. This will completely open the valve and release any gas that is left in the tank. Release the valve outside or open windows to avoid breathing in too much helium. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Push the tilt nozzle down to release the pressure from the tank.",
      "content": "Push the tilt nozzle down to release the pressure from the tank. This nozzle is the lever that you push to fill the balloons with helium. You will hear a hissing sound as the nozzle goes down, this is the pressure being released from the tanks. Hold the nozzle down until the noise stops, indicating that all the pressure has been released. If you don’t hear a hissing noise, put more downward pressure on the tilt nozzle."

      "title": "Puncture the side of the relief disc.",
      "content": "Puncture the side of the relief disc. Before attempting to puncture the disc, put on safety glasses and gloves to protect yourself from accidents. Find the relief disc on the back shoulder of the helium tank. This is often labelled to help you locate it. Place the head of a screwdriver onto the disc and use a hammer to bang on the top of the screwdriver handle. Continue hitting the screwdriver until you puncture a hole."

    {
      "title": "Remove the punctured relief disc.",
      "content": "Remove the punctured relief disc. The punctured disc may be sharp so be sure to wear gloves and avoid touching the perforated edges where possible. Use your gloved hands to pry the disc off the tank. [2] X Research source If the disc isn’t coming out easily, try making a few more punctures in the disc. If a section of the disc breaks off, puncture the remaining disc with the hammer and flat-head screwdriver and then remove it by hand."

    {
      "title": "Draw a circle around the hole and mark it as empty.",
      "content": "Draw a circle around the hole and mark it as empty. Use a permanent marker to circle the hole in the tank where the relief disc was. Below the circle write that the tank is “empty”. This will indicate to the recycling centre that the tank is safe to be processed and recycled. [3] X Research source Use a contrasting colour to mark the tank as empty so that it can be clearly seen. For example, use a silver marker on a black tank."

      "title": "Take the tank to a recycling centre.",
      "content": "Take the tank to a recycling centre. The recycling centre will be able to process the tank and reuse the metal. If your recycling centre won’t take the tank, contact a local metal recycler to collect the tank instead. [4] X Research source If you use a recycling pick-up service, place your empty helium tank in the recycling bin. Make sure that the lid can close to avoid extra charges."

      "title": "Take your helium tank back to the supplier if it is reusable.",
      "content": "Take your helium tank back to the supplier if it is reusable. Many helium tanks can be reused. Return your helium tank to the supplier that you purchased it from. Many stores will even offer you cash rewards for tanks that are returned in good condition. [5] X Research source Check the instruction sheet on your tank to see if it can be reused. If you plan to use helium again in the near future, keep the tank on hand. Most stores will be able to refill your tank if it reusable."

      "content": "Throw it in the rubbish if it less than 5 gallons (18.9 litres). Helium tanks with smaller volumes can be safely disposed of in the trash. Turn the top valve to the left to release all the helium before you put it in the bin. [6] X Research source If the tank doesn’t fit in your rubbish bin, take the tank to your local refuse centre. It is important that all the helium is released from the tank before you throw it away, as improper disposal can put the rubbish workers at risk of bodily harm."

They will be able to determine whether it should be recycled or disposed of and handle the process for you. This service is generally offered free of charge. [7] X Research source"
