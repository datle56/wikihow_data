Sometimes, even if it's filled with unreadable characters, a DAT file will include some text that provides clues as to what type of file it is. If you see an application name in the DAT file, you may be able to use that application to open the file. Close Notepad or TextEdit without making changes, then right-click the DAT file again, select Open With , and choose the application. If you see something about \"video\" in DAT file, you may be able to open the DAT with a video player like VLC Media Player. If you use NotePad or TextEdit to edit a DAT file with unreadable characters and then save it, it will break the DAT file, making it unusable even if you opened it in the correct program."
