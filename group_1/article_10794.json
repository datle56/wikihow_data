      "title": "Outline the basic shape of your web shooters on a piece of paper.",
      "content": "Outline the basic shape of your web shooters on a piece of paper. Think about how you want the main wrist piece of your web shooters to look. Your wrist piece might be a rectangle, hexagon, oval, or a more complex shape. Once you’ve decided on a design, sketch it out on a blank sheet of paper. [1] X Research source No matter what shape you choose to make your outline, it should be about the same length as your palm and no wider than your wrist. Take inspiration from your favorite style of web shooters from the comics, or come with your own original design. Sketch your web shooters in pencil so you can make changes easily if needed."

      "content": "Cut out your design to make a template. Guide your scissors along the lines you just drew, cutting slowly and carefully to avoid mistakes. When you’re done, you’ll have a handy template that you can use to recreate your design with your craft foam and other materials. You can use the same template if you decide to make a second web shooter prop later on."

      "title": "Use your template to cut two wrist pieces out of 5mm (0.2in) craft foam.",
      "content": "Use your template to cut two wrist pieces out of 5mm (0.2in) craft foam. Place the design you just cut out in the center of a sheet of 5mm-thick craft foam . Run your pencil lightly around the edges of the design. Then, remove the paper and cut along the pencil lines to create the same shape out of foam. Repeat the process with a second piece of foam to make an identical wrist piece for your opposite hand. [2] X Research source You can find craft foam at any craft store or online. If possible, use gray or black foam. If you’re unable to find foam in one of these colors, you can always paint it later. You may have trouble getting your scissors through the thick foam. If you encounter a lot of resistance, consider using a utility knife like an X-Acto knife instead. Just be sure to ask your parents before you do!"

      "content": "Cut twelve to sixteen 3x2cm (1.2x0.8in) rectangles out of the craft foam. The easiest way to do this is to draw a single 3x2cm (1.2x0.8in) rectangle on a piece of paper, then cut out the shape and use it as a template for your foam pieces. That way, they’ll all be the same size. The foam rectangles form the wrist straps for your web shooters, so make as many as you need to fit around both wrists comfortably—usually, between 12 and 16 will do. [3] X Research source If you’re not sure how many rectangles to cut, measure your wrist in centimeters and divide the number you get by two. This will tell you exactly how many you need for each web shooter."

      "title": "Paint your foam pieces if desired.",
      "content": "Paint your foam pieces if desired. To make your cosplay or costume more accurate, paint your foam pieces to match the web shooters from the Amazing Spider-Man comics or films. With a foam paint brush , brush one side of each foam piece with a coat of acrylic craft paint and allow it to dry for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, flip over the pieces and paint the opposite side. Let dry for 5 to 10 minutes. In the newer comics and movies, Spider-Man’s web shooters are almost always gray or black. However, you can also add a few accents in red or another color, if you’d like. [4] X Research source Feel free to customize your web shooters however you want. It’s your project, so have fun and use your imagination!"

      "title": "Glue your foam pieces together with the wrist pieces in the center.",
      "content": "Glue your foam pieces together with the wrist pieces in the center. Lay out your foam rectangles side-by-side on your work surface. Place the wrist pieces in the center of each line of rectangles. Squeeze a line of hot glue onto the inside edge of one of the end pieces with a hot glue gun , then press it to the outside edge of the piece next to it. Keep gluing like this all the way down the line. Let the glue dry for about 5 minutes. [5] X Research source Each time you glue 2 pieces, clamp them together for 10 to 20 seconds to make sure the glue bonds securely. Ask a parent or older siblings for help if you’ve never worked with hot glue before."

      "title": "Attach Velcro to the ends of your completed wrist straps.",
      "content": "Attach Velcro to the ends of your completed wrist straps. Cut two soft strips and two rough strips of Velcro to a length of 3cm (1.2in) each to match the length of the foam pieces. Dab 2-3 dots of hot glue onto the back of each strip. Press a strip to the inner face of one of the end pieces and stick the other to the outer face of the piece on the opposite end. Do the same for second web shooter. [6] X Research source Make sure you get the uncut strips of Velcro so you can trim it to the correct length yourself. Pre-cut squares may be too small. Make sure the Velcro pieces are facing the opposite direction so your web shooters will fasten properly."

      "title": "Cut 2 keyhole pieces of 3mm (0.1in) craft foam for the trigger pieces.",
      "content": "Cut 2 keyhole pieces of 3mm (0.1in) craft foam for the trigger pieces. A keyhole is like a thin rectangle that narrows to a circle at one end. Measure the rectangle so that it’s just long enough to reach from the wrist strap of your web shooter to your palm. Once you’ve cut the two keyhole pieces out of a sheet of 3 millimetres (0.30 cm) craft foam , glue one to the back of each wrist piece with hot glue . [7] X Research source Sketch the keyhole shape on paper and cut it out to use it as a template when cutting the craft foam. You can make your trigger piece black like the rest of your web shooters or paint it a contrasting color, like silver. If your trigger piece doesn’t lay across your palm the way it’s supposed to, glue a piece of metal wire to the backside. This will allow you to bend it into a shape that will better fit your hand."

      "title": "Glue a straw to each wrist piece to make a webbing nozzle.",
      "content": "Glue a straw to each wrist piece to make a webbing nozzle. Take your scissors and snip two 1 in (2.5 cm) pieces from the ends of a clear plastic drinking straw . Then, cut a horizontal rectangular notch at the top of the foam wrist piece on both of your web shooters, just wide enough to fit the straws into. Dab the bottom edge of the straws with hot glue and slip them inside the notches. [8] X Research source Adding a webbing nozzle to your web shooters is optional, but it will give them a more realistic, functional look—even if they don’t really shoot webs."

      "content": "Cut four to eight 5.7 cm (2.2 in) pieces of 1 in (2.5 cm) PVC pipe. Mark the PVC pipe in regular increments to indicate where each piece will begin and end. Then, cut it into individual segments using a hacksaw or similar tool. Work slowly and carefully to avoid accidents. [9] X Research source For this style of web shooter, you can either make the pipe segments completely encircle your arm or concentrate them in the area on the inside of your wrist. Be sure to cut an appropriate number of pieces to bring your preferred design to life. [10] X Research source The exact number of pipe segments you cut will depend on the size of your wrist and the specific design you go with."

      "title": "Spray-paint the pipe segments silver.",
      "content": "Spray-paint the pipe segments silver. Do this in a well-ventilated area or outdoors, and wear a mask. Stand the pieces up on a sheet of scrap cardboard or newspaper. Shake your silver spray paint can a few times to make sure the paint is thoroughly mixed, then press and hold the button on the back while waving the nozzle over the PVC in smooth, slow strokes. Make as many passes as needed to completely coat the pieces. [11] X Research source You could also paint your PVC pieces by hand using silver acrylic craft paint , though this will take quite a bit longer. Choose a metallic paint color to give your web shooters a more realistic finish."

      "title": "Allow the painted PVC to dry for 30 to 60 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the painted PVC to dry for 30 to 60 minutes. The pipe segments need to be dry to the touch before you continue working with them. Otherwise, the paint may smudge or rub off on your hands, clothing, or other objects. [12] X Research source Situate the freshly-painted pieces in a warm, dry place with good ventilation to speed up their dry time. While the PVC is drying, you can go ahead and begin putting together the other components for your web shooters."

      "title": "Fashion a pair of wrist straps out of Velcro.",
      "content": "Fashion a pair of wrist straps out of Velcro. Cut a roll of soft Velcro into a strip just long enough to fit around your wrist. Make a second, slightly larger strap to go around the middle of your forearm. When you’re done, cut 2 small squares from a second roll of rough, adhesive Velcro , peel off their backs, and stick them onto the inside of one end of each wrist strap. Attaching the opposing Velcro pieces will allow you to fasten and unfasten your wrist straps quickly. Your wrist straps should be no further apart on your forearm than the length of your PVC segments."

    {
      "title": "Stick 2 strips of rough Velcro to each of the PVC pieces you cut.",
      "content": "Stick 2 strips of rough Velcro to each of the PVC pieces you cut. Snip what’s left of your strip of rough Velcro into 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) squares. Attach a square to the top and bottom of each pipe segment, on the same side of each one. All in all, you’ll need double the amount of Velcro squares as the number of pipe segments you cut. If you have 6 segments, for example, you’ll need a total of 12 squares of Velcro. Make sure you have enough Velcro to cut all of the squares you need, along with the wrist straps themselves. It may be a good idea to buy extra, just in case."

      "title": "Attach the PVC pieces to the Velcro all around the wrist straps.",
      "content": "Attach the PVC pieces to the Velcro all around the wrist straps. All you have to do now is press the pipe segments into place around the soft Velcro wrist straps. As mentioned, you can position them all the way around your wrist or group three to four together on the inside of your arm just over your palm. Once you’ve got all your web canisters in place, you’re ready for action! If you want to make a second Spider-man web-shooter prop for your other hand, simply double up on the amount of materials you buy and repeat the preceding steps."
