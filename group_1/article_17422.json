      "title": "Add water to the wand.",
      "content": "Add water to the wand. The simplest way to use water to de-clump mascara is removing the wand and dipping it in hot water. Leave the wand in the hot water for a few minutes. Then, remove the wand and place it back into your mascara. Do not pump the wand. Simply place it back in the container. If successful, your mascara should be less clumpy the next time you apply it. You can use your mascara right away after using this method."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the mascara in boiled water.",
      "content": "Place the mascara in boiled water. If simply dipping the wand in hot water is not successful, you can try a more intense method. Boil a pot of water big enough that you can completely submerge your sealed tube of mascara in the water. Let the water come to a rolling boil before reducing the heat to a simmer. Place the mascara into the simmering water. Allow it to sit for a few minutes. Take out the mascara using tongs. After the mascara has cooled to the touch, check the mascara to see if it's more liquid-like and does not clump as much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add olive oil, if necessary.",
      "content": "Add olive oil, if necessary. If your mascara is still a little clumpy after being submerged in the water, add a few drops of olive oil in the mascara tube. This should loosen up the mascara further and restore it to its original consistency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 10 drops of eyedrops to the container.",
      "content": "Add 10 drops of eyedrops to the container. Remove the mascara's wand from the bottle. Using any brand of eyedrops, which you can find in a drug store, add 10 small drops to the mascara. Any saline solution will work for this, as it will loosen up the formula. Try starting with just 1-2 drops, then add more if you need to. [1] X Expert Source Frankie Sanderson Makeup Artist & Stylist Expert Interview. April 14, 2020."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the container.",
      "content": "Shake the container. Place the wand back in the container. Give the container a good shake for a few seconds. This should disperse the eyedrops throughout the container."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twirl the wand.",
      "content": "Twirl the wand. Unscrew the wand slightly and twirl it around in the mascara. Then, check the mascara. If successful, the mascara should be restored to its original state."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an appropriate sized wand.",
      "content": "Use an appropriate sized wand. If you have mascara wands that did not come with the mascara container, avoid using wands bigger than the tube. If you struggle to force the wand into the tube, air will get pushed into the tube. Too much exposure to air causes mascara to dry out and clump. Different formulations of mascara often have differently-sized wands, so make sure to use the original wand that came with your mascara for the best results.

    },
    {
      "title": "Do not pump your mascara.",
      "content": "Do not pump your mascara. Many people pump the wand to get more mascara on the brush. This pushes more air into the container, causing mascara to dry out faster. Stick to one motion to remove mascara to make it last longer. If you're continuously not getting enough mascara on the brush, and you've had the same tube for a while, it may be time to get new mascara. Use a twirling motion to get more mascara on the applicator rather than pumping it in and out of the container."

    {
      "title": "Discard mascara when it goes bad.",
      "content": "Discard mascara when it goes bad. No matter how well you care for it, mascara will dry out over time. If none of the above methods restore your mascara, you should invest in a fresh tube. Mascara usually lasts around two to three months.
