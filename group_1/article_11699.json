      "title": "Avoid triggers.",
      "content": "Avoid triggers. For many people, dealing with their emetophobia may be as simple as avoiding what triggers the disorder and its related anxiety. However, be aware that this may not always be possible, such as if you have a sick child, and you should have alternative ways to deal with your fear if necessary. Figure out in advance how to avoid your trigger. For example, if certain foods stimulate your fear, don’t keep them in your home. If you are in a restaurant, you could ask your tablemates to avoid or cover foods that may make you sick. Stay away from your triggers as long as it doesn’t affect your life or that of someone else. For example, if using a public restroom makes you nauseous, make sure this isn’t causing you to stay at home."

      "content": "Communicate with people. People react strangely to your behavior in situations where you’re avoiding triggers. Be honest about your disorder with others, which may prevent uncomfortable situations or questions. In turn, this may help you relax and control your fear. Let others know about your fear before anything happens. For example, if the smell of ranch dressing bothers you, say, “I just want to let you know that I apologize if I react badly. I have this disorder that makes me nauseous when I’m around ranch dressing,” or, “Changing dirty diapers makes me slightly nauseous, even as cute as your baby is.” You may find that people can help you avoid triggers like this by not ordering the food or changing diapers when you’re not present. Consider using humor to your benefit. Making a joke about your emetophobia may release tension. For example, if you’re in a car you can say, “May I please sit in the front seat so this doesn’t turn into the vomit comet?”"
