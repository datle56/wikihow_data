That said, the term has come to mean mostly high-end, quality video editing software with robust features and controls. Common options include the following: DaVinci Resolve — A new, free, and open-source video editing program. It may keep changing, but the price is enough to make it worth trying. Adobe Premier — One of the classics, Premier works well on Mac and PC. If you use other Adobe products, like Photoshop, you may find Premier easy and intuitive to get used to. Final Cut X Pro — This specific version of Final Cut was considered the industry standard for a long time, though it has gotten weaker with updates. Very popular for Mac computers. Avid — The standard of many professional film editors, Avid has all the functionality of its competitors and an interface made to work on the project with a large team. [1] X Research source"

For good video clips, every single frame needs to seem intentional. If you're only using one continuous camera feed, you can still mask over mistakes or slow moments with well-placed text or music.

      "title": "Make all transitions as smooth as possible.",
      "content": "Make all transitions as smooth as possible. Flashy, obnoxious transitions are the hallmark of many poor editors. Ditch the snazzy flashbulb and stick to simple fades, dissolves, and hard cuts (no transition at all) when switching between clips. If you want to use a fancy effect, use it to transition in and out of the clip at the very beginning and end. Never use the novelty cuts and transitions—they just take focus away from your clip."

      "title": "Remember the rule of thirds, especially when titling.",
      "content": "Remember the rule of thirds, especially when titling. The rule of thirds comes from photography, and is used to compose great frames for film or photos: mentally divide the frame with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, so you have nine even boxes on your image. The rule of thirds states, simply, that the best images place items on these lines. When titling or adjusting the image, try to line up your text, the horizon, and special effects with these imaginary guidelines. Some video-recording hardware, such as smartphones, have a \"Grid\" option which places a three-by-three grid of squares over the camera interface."

      "title": "Balance color, sound, and music.",
      "content": "Balance color, sound, and music. The purpose of a good editor is to disappear, and this is doubly true for a short video clip. Use a basic color correcter, like your program's \"color balance\" effect (they all have one), to make the footage smooth and attractive, lower the volume on the music so that you can still hear the camera audio, and make sure that, when played together, the sound is not too loud. Remember, you want people focused on content, not why the music is too loud. Just like video, audio needs to be faded in and out to sound natural."

      "title": "Keep editing in mind next time you go shoot a clip.",
      "content": "Keep editing in mind next time you go shoot a clip. If you're only recording simple, one-take clips, then this doesn't need to apply; for all other shoots, knowing that you'll be editing a video later should make you a much more diligent camera person. Some things to consider include the following: Always shoot 5 seconds of nothing before and after shot (also known as \"run-in\" and \"run-out\" footage). This gives you crucial editing footage to splice with other shots. Take a few shots of \"coverage,\" or the setting around you, to which you can cut in order to hide any mistakes in the footage. Never skimp on audio; use a dedicated microphone instead of a camera microphone, and consider mastering the audio separately."
