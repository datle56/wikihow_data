If you can’t see where the leak is coming from, press a clean tissue around each drain pipe connection in your under-sink cabinet while the water is running. If you find the culprit, try tightening the connection firmly but not excessively, by hand for PVC nuts or with a wrench for metal nuts. If that doesn’t work, try disconnecting and reconnecting, and potentially replacing, the pipes and/or nuts. [1] X Research source If you have old metal drain pipes covered in rust, you should consider replacing them. Check the rusted areas for leaks since this is commonly where they're found. If the drain pipe itself isn’t leaking, plug the sink, fill it with water, and wait 5-10 minutes. Run a clean tissue around the underside of the sink where it meets the metal sink drain, which is also known as a sink strainer. That might be the source of the leak. [2] X Research source"

If the locknut or bell housing feels a bit loose, try tightening it -- securely but not excessively -- and see if that stops the leak. Usually, however, a poor plumber’s putty seal is the culprit and you’ll have to pull out the sink strainer. [4] X Research source If you're dealing with a very small leak, you may be able to fix it by applying clear silicone around the whole connection where the strainer meets the sink."

Press the new sink strainer down into the plumber’s putty firmly, and tighten the locknut or bell housing from below as per the appropriate instructions for your model. Clear away excess putty in the sink with your fingers, a plastic putty knife, and a wet rag.

[27] X Research source Use a screwdriver to remove all the clips or brackets. Removing an undermount requires a second set of hands to hold the sink up as you remove the clips. Recruit a buddy or put your teen to work! If the undermount sink is installed in granite countertops, it may be held up with an epoxy. In this case, first make sure the sink is supported by wood braces below it and cut the epoxy where the sink meets the countertop with a linoleum knife.
