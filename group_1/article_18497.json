      "content": "A Gashadokuro is a giant skeleton from Japanese mythology. According to legend, a Gashadokuro (or “starving skeleton” in English) is a spirit (or yokai) that takes the form of a giant skeleton, comprised of the skulls of people who died in battle or of starvation. Gashadokuro stand over 10 meters (33 ft) tall and roam around at 2 a.m. to attack and eat any humans they come across. They can turn invisible and are practically indestructible. [1] X Research source Size: 10 meters (33 ft) tall Appearance: Giant skeleton made from the skulls of the dead. Because they’re so tall, sometimes only their eyes are visible, which are often described as burning yellow or green. Powers: Invisibility, indestructibility Behaviors: Their bones and teeth make a “gachi gachi” clattering sound as they move, though they’re usually silent when stalking prey. They will continue hunting their prey until their pent-up anger is released, which causes their bones to collapse. Weaknesses: Shinto talismans, sunlight"

      "title": "Gashadokuro are formed from angry spirits.",
      "content": "Gashadokuro are formed from angry spirits. When soldiers die in battle or people die of famine, they rarely receive proper burial rites. Because of this, their spirits are unable to pass on and become angry and vengeful. As their bodies decay, their anger turns into a grudge against the living, which in turn twists them into a supernatural force. The bones of hundreds of victims gather together in one mass and form a Gashadokuro. [2] X Research source Because of how they’re created, Gashadokuro are often found near battlefields or mass grave sites."

      "content": "The first Gashadokuro myth dates back to the 10th century. In the 10th century, the government in Kyoto put a bounty on samurai Taira no Masakado’s head after he led an armed revolt. His cousin decapitated him and brought his head to the capital for a reward. Takiyasha Hime, Maskado’s daughter and a powerful sorceress, was infuriated by her father’s murder and conjured the first Gashadokuro with the bones of those who died in battle alongside Masakado. As revenge, she released the Gashadokuro on the city. [3] X Research source The Gashadokuro continued to ravage the city until Masakado’s head was moved to Shibasaki, or modern-day Tokyo. The head became somewhat of a demigod, with a grave still standing today near the Tokyo Imperial Palace. This legend is a semi-historical account, based on true events."

      "content": "Ward off Gashadokuro with a Shinto talisman. Because Gashadokuro are made of the skulls of the dead, they are not technically living and therefore cannot be killed. However, some sources claim that wearing Shinto talismans or charms can ward off these giant skeletons and protect you from harm. While no specific talismans are listed, it can be assumed you would visit a Shinto temple to find a protective charm. [7] X Research source In addition to warding off Gashadokuro, Shinto talismans are believed to take away their invisibility. Other sources say only Shinto priests have the power to ward off Gashadokuro."
