Gay people have it harder when it comes to romance since there aren’t as many options out there. If you stick too closely to a checklist of everything you want in a partner, you’re more likely to pass by someone who’d make a fabulous companion, even if they’re not your dream person at first glance. Keep your mind open, and let yourself be surprised by people. That also goes for everyone else you meet. Just because someone isn’t available doesn’t mean they wouldn’t make a great ally."
