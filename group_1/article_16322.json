Think of a place where you feel completely at ease, like a beach or a relaxing place from childhood. Focus only on being there, and imagine it with as many sensory details as possible. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Helpful sensory details include sights, smells, and sounds that you feel you might encounter while in this imaginary space. For example, if your scenario was a peaceful, remote cabin in the woods, your sensory details might include the scent of pine trees and the sound of birds calling."

This technique is called the military method; first, get into a comfy position and relax the muscles in your face, followed by your shoulders and arms. Then, take deep breaths to release the tension in your chest and relax your muscles through your legs and feet. Once your whole body feels loose, use imagery to visualize a calming scene as you fall asleep.

If you have scratchy or uncomfortable sheets or blankets, get softer ones. [16] X Research source Medium-firm mattresses in particular can improve the quality of your sleep.
