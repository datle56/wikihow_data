On newer Androids you'll usually do this by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, holding your finger, and then letting go—you'll see a list of currently-open apps. [2] X Research source If that doesn't work, tap the small square icon at the bottom of the screen (usually at the bottom-right) to display open apps. Or, if you're using a Samsung model, tap the three horizontal lines at the bottom instead. [3] X Research source Swipe through the apps until you see the one that's frozen. Swipe it off the screen. If you had to swipe left or right to scroll through the apps, swipe the app upwards to close it. If you scrolled vertically, swipe the app horizontally to close it. If you can't close the app this way, open your Android's Settings , select Apps or Apps and notifications , tap the app you want to close, and select Force Stop . If you don't see this, tap App info first. [4] X Research source Tap OK to confirm. If an app keeps giving you problems, consider deleting it to avoid future problems."

Keep in mind that factory resetting your phone will erase all data on the phone, so this works best if you've created a backup already. But as long as you have data synced to your Google account, such as your contacts, emails, and other data, you'll be able to restore that even if you don't have a backup. [7] X Research source First, if your phone is on and frozen, press and hold the power button until it powers down. Press and hold the recovery mode buttons for your model—if you're using a Google Pixel or Android One, press and hold the power and volume-down buttons. If you have a Samsung model, press and hold the power and volume-up buttons instead. If you have a Samsung, you'll eventually see the Samsung logo followed by \"Installing system update.\" Then you'll see \"No command.\" After about 15 seconds, your phone will enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to scroll to the Wipe data/factory reset option, and then press the power button to select it. Select Yes to confirm. Your Android will now restore to its original factory settings. When the restore is complete, you'll be back to the recovery mode menu. Press the power button and select Reboot system now to reboot normally. Once your Android comes back up, you'll be asked to select a wireless network and sign in with your Google account.
