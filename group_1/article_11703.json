      "title": "Leave yourself reasonable time for studying.",
      "content": "Leave yourself reasonable time for studying. Waiting until the night before a test to start studying is likely to spike your anxiety. You will be crunched for time, you will not have time to ask questions or find lost information, likely feel overwhelmed, and otherwise be in a bad situation [1] X Research source Instead of waiting until the last minute, start studying as soon as a test is scheduled. With several days or even a week to prepare, you'll feel more relaxed because you have plenty of time to learn the material. Draw up a schedule to make most of your study time. Set aside as much time as you feel you need; it could be 20 minutes a day, it could be 2 hours a day. You can adjust this if you feel you need more or less time after studying for a few days. Stick to this schedule so when it comes time for the test, you know you've prepared as well as possible. You should also get into the habit of looking over your notes from class every day. Statistically, students who do this get better grades on tests because the brain absorbs information more efficiently this way. It can help with your anxiety because you'll have a head start on your studying before you even knew a test was coming up. Some students make the mistake of spending more time organizing than actually studying, because actively studying is more anxiety provoking; be sure that the bulk of your time is actually doing the work. You may have to make do with the time you have. If so, stay calm--any studying done is better than none at all."

      "content": "Keep all of your notes and schoolwork organized. Being disorganized can make anxiety much worse. You'll start to panic because you can't find that one page of notes you need to know, and then lose time looking for it instead of studying. [2] X Research source To avoid this problem, keep all of your schoolwork neat and organized. That way, you'll be able to find everything you need and spend the maximum amount of time studying. Keep all of your notes for a certain class in one notebook, so everything for that class is in one place. Also make sure to date the page every time you take notes. If you take notes on your computer, keep your notes, assignments, and any study aids in separate folders for each class, and date all of your notes. Designate a folder for any loose material you have for a class. Handouts, essays, homework assignments, and past tests can go in here so you can find them easily when you need them."

      "title": "Take breaks while studying.",
      "content": "Take breaks while studying. Although you should study as much as you need to, it is possible to overdo it. Spending every minute of the day studying will wreak havoc on your nerves and make anxiety worse. Be sure to factor breaks into your study schedule. Every hour or two, you should take a break for 10 minutes or more. [3] X Research source Any activities will do. Try watching TV, exercising, doing some stretches (especially for your neck and arms), going for a walk, taking a nap—whatever you have to do. This will rest your brain and you can come back to your studies refreshed and ready to continue."

      "title": "Keep the exam in perspective.",
      "content": "Keep the exam in perspective. While under stress, it is very easy to \"catastrophize\"—that is, think the very worst of the situation and get worried about what is unlikely to happen, but mildly possible. This can set off a chain reaction, in which the student gets more anxious, more distracted, more worried, and then less likely to do well. Some mindsets to help put things in perspective: If you have been doing well in exams throughout the class, it is likely you will do well on this particular test. If you do not do well, it is probably not the end of life as you know it. Many tests can be taken more than once, whether it is a driving test, passing the bar, or just having to re-take chemistry class. You may have to just pass the class, rather than make a particular grade."

      "content": "Look for physical symptoms of anxiety . Anxiety is not only an emotional state; it produces physical symptoms that you can identify if you know what to look for. If you experience any of the following symptoms when studying or thinking about a test, this would be a tell tale sign that you're feeling anxiety. You can then take steps to alleviate symptoms. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all. Go to source Headaches. Dry mouth. Rapid heartbeat. Usually a heart rate above 100 beats per minute characterizes a rapid heartbeat. Sweating. Shortness of breath. Light-headedness. Extreme body temperature, either excessively hot or cold.

      "title": "Stay active.",
      "content": "Stay active. Exercise and physical activity are great ways to reduce anxiety. Physical activity releases endorphins that will elevate your mood. It will also distract your mind from the test and studying, so your brain will have a chance to relax and refresh itself. Any number of physical activities will have a beneficial affect on your anxiety. They include, but certainly aren't limited to: [5] X Research source Going to the gym. Taking a walk. Doing housework. Riding your bike. Working outside. Playing sports."

[6] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source It will also starve your brain of nutrients and you won't be able to focus very well. Eat at least three balanced meals every day to keep your strength up. Make sure your meals are nutritious. Whole grain products, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins are best because they will provide you with a sustained release of energy that will carry you through your study session. Avoid sugary foods and drinks. Not only are these bad for your health, but the spike in your blood sugar will make you jittery, which could increase your anxiety. Also, the energy high will come with a crash before too long, and you won't be able to study effectively anymore."

This doesn't mean you can't be friends with them, but it might be best to take some space from them while you're trying to study. You might be making a good effort to curb your own anxiety, and allowing their negative thoughts to overcome you could set you back."

      "content": "Think about your cognitive state. Anxiety often impairs concentration and causes sufferers to simply blank out. If you're trying to study but just can't bring yourself to focus, you could be suffering from anxiety. Procrastination is also a symptom, since avoidance of a problem is a defense mechanism. If you notice these symptoms, it is time to take action and work on your thought processes. [9] X Research source"

You may say to yourself \"I'm definitely going to fail this test,\" or \"If I fail this test my life is over.\" These thinking traps are a symptom of anxiety, as well as a cause of greater anxiety.

By breaking down negative thoughts, you can find that most of them are unrealistic, and then replace them with more positive thoughts. [11] X Research source Think about whether this thought is logical. For example, you think \"If I fail this test, my life is over.\" Is that really true? In almost all situations, no, it's not true.

[12] X Research source For example, you're convinced that you will fail the biology test tomorrow. But you've gotten good grades on every biology test this semester so far. Past experience is on your side here. This new perspective makes your fear seem more unlikely, since you've already established that you're good at biology."

      "content": "Replace illogical thoughts with logical ones. Once you've established that a fear is illogical, you can work on replacing it with a more balanced and logical thought. This will bring your mind back to reality and help break down illogical fears. [13] X Research source Once you've isolated the thought that \"I will definitely fail this test tomorrow,\" replace it with, \"I've been studying all week, I know this material, and it's within my power to do well on this test.\" This new pattern of thinking breaks down your fear that was based on nothing, and replaces it with a new thought that is rooted in reality. Even if you can't get past the idea that you will fail tomorrow's test, you can use logic to help you remain calm by reminding yourself that a failed exam doesn't mean you will fail the class. Remind yourself that you may even have other options, such as investigating extra credit or asking to re-take the exam."

      "content": "Use positive self-statements. When people suffer from anxiety, they usually use negative self-statements like \"I'm stupid,\" or \"I'm worthless.\" These kinds of statements can easily cause your anxiety to progress into depression and threaten your overall mental health. [14] X Research source Just like you replaced your illogical fears with logical thoughts, replace negative statements with positive ones. Make an effort to tell yourself \"I'm a hard worker,\" \"I'm tough,\" \"I can do this,\" or \"Everything will be okay.\" That way you can cut negative statements out of your thinking and improve your happiness and mental health. Statements such as \"I'm stupid\" or \"I'm worthless\" are not only unhelpful, they're untrue because they summarize you based on one observation. For example, if you've performed poorly on your calculus quizzes so far, you might think \"I'm a loser.\" This is an emotional overstatement. Try to think about the facts instead: You just happen to be performing poorly on calculus quizzes. This says nothing about who you are as a person, or your ability in other areas."

That way, you can sit down and relax for a few minutes before starting. You'll be able to gather your thoughts and focus on positive thinking. This relaxation period before the test is very important to getting off to a good start. [15] X Research source"

By doing this, you risk missing something crucial and getting questions wrong. Force yourself to stop and read directions. By reading everything carefully, you can be confident that you understand what to do and can complete the test correctly. You can even underline or circle important terms in the instructions. For example, if you're worried you may get side-tracked during an essay question, you could underline the most important part of the prompt (e.g., underlining \"Explain\" will help remind you that you can't just summarize)."
