If you’re dealing with any kind of abuse at home, turn to a relative, teacher, church leader, a friend’s mom or dad, or another adult you trust. Abuse can be hard to talk about, but an adult can intervene in a situation where you don’t have power. [3] X Research source You might feel awkward to tell an adult what’s happening, but it’s important to let other people know if you’re being abused. Start by saying something like, “I’ve been having some problems at home lately. Can I talk to you about it?” Or, write your feelings and give them a note if that feels more comfortable to you. If you don’t have an adult you can turn to or don’t feel comfortable talking to someone in person, call or text 1-800-422-4453. It’s a free and confidential helpline that’s open 24 hours a day. Alternatively, visit the Childhelp Hotline website for more information and support. Keep in mind that some adults are legally required to report child or teen abuse to authorities.

People who engage in abusive behavior might be trying to get a rise out of you, so avoid taking the bait. Instead, you can: [8] X Research source Maintain a neutral facial expression. Ask an older or younger sibling for help. Assert confidence with your body language. Stop coming over or calling if you live away from home.

You may feel obligated to stay in contact with your parents, but if their behavior severely impacts you or there’s nothing positive to gain from the relationship, it might be time to go no contact. It can be triggering to take care of them when they’ve been emotionally abusive, so reflect on your relationship and cut ties if it’s more painful than loving. [10] X Research source You don't owe a debt of care to those who have abused you. You may struggle with feelings of guilt or regret over cutting ties, but remember that you made the difficult choice to protect your mental health.

If your parents say inappropriate, critical, or insulting things to your children, intervene and end the conversation.

If you have an issue with the way he eats, you can talk to me about it.\" While most adult conversations should be conducted in private, it’s important for your child to see you protect them in abusive situations. If your parents keep coming over unannounced, you could say, “I need you to ask me if you can visit, rather than showing up without notice. Eli has extracurricular activities, and it’s not fair to him if I can’t drop him off. I would appreciate it if you could notify me a week in advance so I can clear my schedule.” Protecting your children also means not following your parents’ example. It might be tempting to stoop to their level or talk badly about them, but it won’t improve your situation. Instead, come up with a plan for when you feel the need to engage in these behaviors. For example, you could step out of the room or think of your to-do list to distract yourself. [15] X Research source"

For example, if you can’t tell if your parents are abusing you , you may start to feel bad about yourself because you’re taking their words or actions to heart. [16] X Research source Once you learn to identify abusive behaviors, you can: Recognize that what is happening is not your fault. Take control of your own reaction during abusive situations. Put more appropriate distance between you and your parents. Get the help that you need to cope with the abuse and move forward.

Do they get upset if you bring up a certain topic? Do they tend to get angry after the weekend? Once you recognize these warning signs, you can prepare yourself better or make a plan to dodge abuse. [17] X Research source For example, if your mother always yells at you when she has been drinking, try to get out of the house as soon as you see her with a bottle. If your father tries to diminish your accomplishments when you've achieved something, refrain from telling him about your successes and only tell people who support you. If you need help figuring out these triggers, document instances of emotional abuse in a journal and highlight any similarities. You may notice changes in your parents’ mood or behavior right before abuse happens. With that being said, the level of freedom you have depends on your age. If your parents don’t let you drink alcohol or attend parties in high school, it doesn’t mean they’re being overly controlling. Parents set rules to protect you and steer you towards positive development, but if they won’t let you visit friends or attend school, it’s a sign of abuse."

This may be easier said than done if you live with your parents, but if you can, find ways to put physical distance in between you and them. [18] X Research source If you sense that your mom is about to be abusive, for example, you could tell her that you need to do homework and head to your room. Alternatively, you could spend time at the library or a friend’s house, get involved in extracurricular activities at school, offer to babysit or house sit for extended family, walk around your neighborhood, or get a part time job to get out of the house. While it’s a smart decision to move to safety, it's not your fault if you get caught in a serious conflict. No matter what you say or do, there is no excuse for a parent to emotionally abuse you."

Many people who are victims of emotional abuse often have a negative view of themselves, but spending time with caring, non-judgmental people can help them process the abuse and feel validated and understood. [21] X Research source You can also boost your self-esteem by doing things you enjoy. Whether it’s dancing, reading, watching movies, or listening to music, engaging in fun activities can help you move forward.

It may be scary to stand up for yourself , but the abuse may never stop if you don’t say something. Clearly explain how their actions affect you, give examples, and use “I” statements to avoid coming off as accusatory. [22] X Research source State what the consequences will be if your parents ignore your boundaries. If they don’t respect your personal limits, follow through and enforce the consequences. Making empty threats will only enable their behavior and make you seem less credible. [23] X Research source For example, you might say, “Mom, I get scared when you drink. If you continue to come home drunk and bully me, I’m going to live with Grandma. I want to stay with you, but I just don’t feel comfortable.” You could also say, “I don’t appreciate the way you speak to me. I know I’m not doing that well at the moment, but there’s no need to call me names. It makes me feel worse than I already am. If you keep disrespecting me, I will cease communication with you.” If you think your parents might get violent with you, setting boundaries might not be the best approach.
