[1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Since you can’t specifically target knee fat, reducing overall body fat is a good method to also reduce fat around your knees, and that is usually attained through nutrition. To maintain a calorie deficit, you can either consume fewer calories than you normally would or increase activity and exercise to burn more calories. Replace foods that are high in calories and low in nutritional value with healthier options. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, if you’re craving a sweet treat like a chocolate ice cream bar, try eating some reduced-fat flavored yogurt instead, which is lower in calories and better for your body. Swap high-calorie foods for low-calorie foods to lower your calorie intake without changing the types of food you eat. Reach for a diet soda instead of a full-calorie one, or choose baked or fat-free potato chips instead of regular fried ones. Cut portion sizes and eat smaller meals if you don’t want to make any adjustments to the foods you enjoy."

      "content": "Running is another aerobic exercise that can decrease overall body fat. It is a more intense activity that works your legs a bit harder than walking, which may be beneficial for increased fat loss in the legs and knees. Going for a run at a pace of 5mph can burn 600 calories in one hour! Studies show that short intervals of running may be more effective for fat loss than long-distance runs. Consider incorporating interval training into your exercise routine by walking at a brisk pace for longer periods of time, running for a shorter period of time, then returning to your walking pace.

[6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you experience any leg or knee pain, biking can be a great alternative to walking and running since it places less pressure on your knees and joints. If your leg or knee pain causes you to have issues with balance, then walking may be a more suitable option than riding a bike, since poor balance could lead to injury."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can’t spot reduce knee fat, but you can strengthen your leg muscles to achieve a more toned look that reduces the appearance of knee fat. Jumping rope combines the weight loss benefits of cardio with the muscle toning power of strength training exercises. Plus, once you’ve purchased a jump rope, this is another free exercise that you can perform virtually anywhere that has enough overhead space! Jumping rope is a great exercise to add to your weekly training routine, but it is important to listen to your body. If your joints don't feel great over time — ankles, knees, hips, and back, more specifically —, you might want to decrease the volume of the exercise."

Over time, strengthening your leg muscles will create a more toned appearance that can include a decrease in leg and knee fat. [8] X Research source To do a lunge, stand with your feet shoulder-length apart. You can place your hands on your hips or hold them together in front of you. [9] X Research source Step about 2 feet forward with one foot. Keep your upper body upright and bend both knees so there is a 90° bend in your front leg. Engage your leg muscles to push your body back to its starting position. Repeat with the other leg. For added intensity and strength training, hold a weight or dumbbell in each hand as you perform the squat. Let the weights hang heavy in your hands and keep your arms on either side of your body.

Place your weight on your front foot and push through. You should feel your back foot lift off the ground. Press down through your front foot to fully extend your leg.
