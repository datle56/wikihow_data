      "title": "Give ducklings un-medicated duck or chick feed.",
      "content": "Give ducklings un-medicated duck or chick feed. Many feeds are medicated, so make sure you check the label on the packaging. Baby ducks can overdose on medicated feed and die. Un-medicated feed should be the main component of a duckling's diet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Supplement their diets with fresh fruit and vegetables.",
      "content": "Supplement their diets with fresh fruit and vegetables. Use a knife to finely chop the fruit and vegetables before you give them to the ducklings. Don’t give the ducklings large pieces of food or they could choke. Try feeding them lettuce, carrots, grapes, broccoli, apples, pears, and celery. If you're planning on feeding baby ducks at the park, chop some fruits and vegetables up and put them in a plastic to-go container before you go. Then when you get to the park you won't have to worry about breaking the food up into small pieces."

    {
      "title": "Treat ducklings to dried mealworms.",
      "content": "Treat ducklings to dried mealworms. Sprinkle a few mealworms in with the other food you're feeding the baby ducks to give them extra protein. You can find mealworms at your local pet store or order them online. For baby ducks at the park, you can sprinkle some of the mealworms on the ground or in the grass for the ducklings to find."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add brewer's yeast to the food to give ducklings extra niacin.",
      "content": "Add brewer's yeast to the food to give ducklings extra niacin. Niacin deficiency is common in baby ducks, and it can cause them to develop bowed legs. Sprinkling some brewer’s yeast into ducklings’ food is an easy way to get them the niacin they need. If you're feeding baby ducks at the park, add the brewer's yeast to their food beforehand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed ducklings crumbled bread, but not too much.",
      "content": "Feed ducklings crumbled bread, but not too much. Don’t give more than one slice a day per ten ducklings. Make sure the bread is finely crumbled so the baby ducks are able to swallow the pieces. Bread lacks the nutrients baby ducks need. If you give them too much bread and they fill up on it, they won't eat other foods that are important for their health."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring along fresh water if you're feeding baby ducks in the park.",
      "content": "Bring along fresh water if you're feeding baby ducks in the park. Baby ducks need access to water when they're eating to help them get down their food. If you're not feeding the ducks near a pond or other water source, put down a plastic container and pour some fresh water into it. Make sure the ducklings can get in and out of the container easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure the baby ducks always have access to food.",
      "content": "Make sure the baby ducks always have access to food. Baby ducks are self-feeders. After the ducklings' first few feedings, you can start putting their feed or pellet food in a food dispenser. Fill the dispenser whenever their food gets low. Supplement their diet with fruits, vegetables, and other treats daily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give the ducklings their food on a plate for their first few feedings.",
      "content": "Give the ducklings their food on a plate for their first few feedings. The baby ducks will be more likely to try out new food when it’s easily accessible to them. After a few feedings using the same types of foods, you can start putting the ducklings’ food in a food dish or dispenser. If you don’t have a plate, use another flat surface like the lid to a plastic container."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide water during every feeding.",
      "content": "Provide water during every feeding. It’s important that ducklings always have water available when they’re eating. Water helps baby ducks swallow their food easier without choking. Refill the ducklings’ water container with fresh water before every feeding session. Use a water container that’s easy for the ducklings to get in and out of. If the container you’re using has a high edge, place a rock inside and outside of the container so the ducklings can climb on it to get in and out. Never fill the ducklings’ water container with more water than they can stand in. Rescued baby ducks are very susceptible to drowning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove old, uneaten food from the ducklings’ living area every day.",
      "content": "Remove old, uneaten food from the ducklings’ living area every day. You want the baby ducks to be eating fresh food. Avoid putting new food on top of old food; it may deter the ducklings from eating."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your hands after feeding the ducklings.",
      "content": "Wash your hands after feeding the ducklings. Wild birds are prone to carrying diseases like salmonella. Even if you don’t actually touch the baby ducks when you’re feeding them, it’s still important that you wash your hands. Germs from the ducklings can transfer to their food and water dishes."
