[3] X Research source For instance, don't write, “It's always been my dream to study at LSE. I love history, and I've always wanted to become a historian. I especially love ancient Rome.” This example is informal, isn't specific, and LSE doesn't have an ancient history program. A well-crafted personal statement might include statements such as, \"My fascination with complex systems laid the foundation for my decision to specialize in modern economic analysis. During my internship with HSBC, I witnessed firsthand how the interaction of myriad variables weaves the fabric of our global economic tapestry.\""
