Keep filing just slightly past the base of the crack to make sure your nail stays smooth and even. [1] X Research source Filing works for both horizontal and vertical splits. Either way, it will make your nail less jagged and less likely to catch on things, like socks or carpet. If part of the nail is still attached but hanging on very loosely, use scissors or nail clippers to trim it off before filing.

This solution is useful if you split your toenail while at work or on-the-go. It’s not a long-term solution, though. Fix the split at home or go to a professional salon as soon as possible."
