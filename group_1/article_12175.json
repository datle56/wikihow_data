      "content": "Buy the arch if you have a larger budget. If you have a large garden, you can even keep the arch there after the wedding as a permanent feature. If the decorations on the arch don't fit your garden's design, you can replace them with trailing plants or vegetables. You can buy a wedding arch from stores that specialize in wedding decorations. You can also find them online. You can buy a wooden trellis that is large enough for what you envision."

      "content": "Rent an arch if you are on a smaller budget . They are also an option for those who don't have a lot of room in their homes or gardens to store the arch after the wedding. You can typically rent them from the same places that you rent tables and chairs for events. How far in advance you rent the arch depends on the place you are renting it from. Most places will rent it for the same length of time as the tables and chairs. How much the arch costs depends on the rental company, how plain or fancy it is, and how long you are renting it for."

      "content": "Check with the venue if you are on a tight budget. Some places will already have an arch that you can decorate. Keep in mind that the decorations cannot be permanent. For example, you would not be able to paint the arch or glue items to it. Some venues may also charge you extra for using their arch."

      "title": "Build a wedding arch",
      "content": "Build a wedding arch if you're feeling crafty. This project can get expensive, depending on what materials you use. It can also take a long time, so it would be a good idea to start early. The arch can be as fancy or as simple as you want it to be. A basic, wooden trellis-like design would fit most wedding themes, however. Bamboo sticks are great for a delicate-looking lightweight arch. You can buy them in garden supply shops and craft stores. Tree branches are great for a rustic arch. They are free if you can find them in your garden or a forest."

      "title": "Make sure that the arch is anchored.",
      "content": "Make sure that the arch is anchored. The last thing you want on your big day is for the arch to topple over because someone bumped into it or a strong, unexpected gust of wind blew it over. If your arch did not come with some sort of anchor, you will need to buy or make one yourself. A metal bucket filled with rocks, gravel, or sand will offer you plenty of support. [1] X Research source Place each of the arches legs into a bucket, then fill each bucket with sand, gravel, rocks, etc. This is temporary and great for rental arches. For a sturdier support, fill the buckets with quick-setting cement instead. Note that this is permanent and should not be done on rental arches. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy a variety of flowers and greenery for your arch.",
      "content": "Buy a variety of flowers and greenery for your arch. Where you buy the flowers and greenery from depends on your budget and preference. You can buy them wholesale, online, or a florist. Because the arch will be kept outdoors, you need to get the timing just right: obtain the flowers the day before or the day of the wedding. Cut some greenery as well. Ferns are a classic choice, but you can use other types of greenery as well, such as eucalyptus or succulents."

    {
      "title": "Keep the flowers and greenery in water.",
      "content": "Keep the flowers and greenery in water. Fill two buckets with water, and place the flowers in one and the greenery in the other. You can also arrange the flowers based on color, shape, or size to make it easier for you to place them on the arch later. Make sure that the water is cool, and that the buckets are in a shaded area. The buckets need to be large enough to hold your flowers comfortably. If you find yourself pushing the flowers into the bucket to get them to fit, get another bucket."

      "content": "Remove the lower leaves from the flowers. Make sure you keep some leaves on your flowers, to make your decoration look full and green. However, remove the leaves from the bottom 2/3 of the stem to make arranging the flowers easier. [3] X Research source You can pull the leaves off by hand or use scissors."

      "content": "Use cable ties to secure pre-soaked oasis blocks to the arch. Oasis blocks are squares or rectangles made out of soft, green foam used in floral arrangements to keep the flowers hydrated. Soak them in water first, then secure them to the arch with cable ties. You will need a block on top of each pole, and another in the middle of the cross bar. [4] X Research source You can buy oasis blocks in craft supply stores and floral shops."

      "title": "Insert your desired greenery into the blocks.",
      "content": "Insert your desired greenery into the blocks. Make sure that stem is firmly wedged into the block. It needs to be deep enough so that the plant is stable, but not so deep that the stem pokes out of the other side of the block. If the stem is too long, cut it. If the stem is sticking out of the block, the plant won't get any water and will wilt. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill the gaps in with flowers.",
      "content": "Fill the gaps in with flowers. Once again, trim the stems down as needed so that they are firmly wedged in the blocks without poking out through the other side. Don't use too many flowers, however, or the arch will become too top-heavy. [6] X Research source Start with the largest flowers first, then fill the gaps in with the smaller ones. The ratio of flowers to greenery is up to you. A more traditional arch will have more flowers than greenery, but you can use more greenery than flowers for a more unique look."

      "title": "Add some flowers to the base of the arch, if desired.",
      "content": "Add some flowers to the base of the arch, if desired. You can use more pre-soaked oasis blocks, or you can use buckets filled with water. Alternatively, you can anchor your arch with heavy, potted flowers instead of using buckets filled with sand, gravel, or rocks. [7] X Research source How you anchor the arch with the pots depends on the arch's design: If the arch has flat, metal plates on the bottom, set the flower pots on top of the plates to weigh them down. If the arch has stakes or narrow feet, thrust them into buckets filled with soil, then transplant the flowers ."

      "content": "Buy a variety of fake flowers and greenery. Choose a theme and color scheme, and stick with it. Make sure that you have large and small plants. Different textures will also help create a more unique arch. You can buy the flowers and greenery online or from an arts and crafts store. Roses and ferns are great for a classic theme, but you can use other types of flowers and greenery, such as succulents or eucalyptus. How many flowers you buy depends on how full you want your arch to be. You can cover the tops and sides of the arch, or you can cover just one corner of it."

      "title": "Tie the flowers",
      "content": "Tie the flowers into bundles, if desired. Gather 5 to 7 flowers into a bundle, then wrap green floral tape or wire around the stems to hold them together. This way, you can secure the flowers to the arch in bundles and save yourself some time and effort. If your flowers came in a spray, you can leave them attached to the main stem, or you can cut them into individual flowers with wire cutters."

      "title": "Use wire to attach greenery to the front of the arch.",
      "content": "Use wire to attach greenery to the front of the arch. Hold the plant parallel to the cross piece. Use your other hand to wrap green floral wire around the pole and the stem. Start at the end of the stem and work to the other end. You don't need to wrap the entire stemâ€”as long as it feels stable, you should be good. Cut the excess wire off with wire cutters. [8] X Research source Repeat this step a few more times to attach more stems and plants. Be sure to overlap them in order to hide the wire-wrapped stems. Ferns lend a classic touch, but you can also use other types of greenery as well, such as leaves or eucalyptus. Try to use 2 to 3 different types of greenery for a more varied look."

For a unique touch, consider covering just the top left or right corner, stopping the flowers halfway along the cross bar and pole. [10] X Research source The ratio of flowers and greenery is up to you. You can use more flowers for a classical look, or more greenery for a modern look."

      "content": "Re-arrange the flowers, if needed. Fake flowers and greenery have wire inside the stems. Take a look at your arch. If you notice any areas that appear flat, carefully bend the stems on the flowers and greenery to make them stand out. Try to keep a few flowers flat against the arch in order to avoid a bristling look."

      "content": "Add a backdrop with curtains or runners. Slide curtain rings onto the cross bar, then use the clips to secure narrow curtains or runners. If your curtains have a pocket along the top edge, you can simply slide the cross piece of your arch through this pocket before adding it to the poles. [11] X Research source For a more romantic touch, use sheet curtains or tulle instead. A solid color will be easier to coordinate, but you can also use a neutral pattern as well, such as thick black-and-white stripes. If you can't find ready-made curtains, consider making your own !"

Use floral wire or cable ties to secure the lights, then disguise the wire/ties with flowers or greenery. Keep the pack hidden with flowers or greenery. [12] X Research source You can get wires with standard Christmas-tree sized bulbs, or you can get thin wires with mini bulbs. Add another string of lights along the cross piece for extra sparkle. If you will be using real flowers, make sure that you get outdoor lights that are resistant to getting wet."

Here are some ideas to get you started: [14] X Research source Coat the buckets with spray paint to match your color scheme. Wrap a wide ribbon around the middle of the bucket, then tie it into a bow. Wrap the buckets with burlap fabric for a rustic look."

      "content": "Make a flower garland to wrap around the poles. Thread a long piece of string through an upholstery needle. Use the needle to thread real or fake flowers onto the string, leaving about 4 inches (10 cm) between each flower. Tie a loop into each end of the string, then drape or wrap the garland around your arch. Slip the loops over nails to keep the garland secure. [15] X Research source Make sure that you pull fake flowers off of their stems first. Cut real flowers off just below the bloom. Alternatively, you can make shorter garlands, then hang them from the cross bar to create a curtain-like effect instead. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider making a flat arch for a unique touch. Use strong packaging tape to secure the flowers to the chalkboard in an arch shape. Start from the top-center of the arch, then work your way down to the ends. Add a few more layers of flowers, making sure to cover the tape. Use chalk to write a message on the chalk board, such as the newly-weds' names. [17] X Research source Add some greenery, such as eucalyptus, for a unique touch. You can use real or fake flowers. Consider making the arch asymmetric, where it is thicker in one area. This will give it a more organic feel."
