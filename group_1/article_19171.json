      "content": "Focus on your physical senses if you’re feeling stressed or anxious. It’s important to give yourself time to process the negative feelings you are experiencing. As soon as you’re able to do so, take a few minutes to just breathe and focus on what you are seeing, smelling, feeling, and hearing. This will help ground you in the present moment and break the cycle of stress and anxiety. [1] X Research source If you can, find a quiet space where you can be by yourself, without distractions."

      "content": "Acknowledge that not all bad days have an obvious cause. Sometimes you may experience days when you feel down, anxious, or exhausted for no apparent reason. This is especially true if you struggle with issues like depression or anxiety . If this happens to you, remind yourself that you don’t need a reason to feel bad—some days are just more difficult than others. If you can’t identify a reason for your mood, focus instead on helping yourself feel better in the moment. [6] X Research source For example, you might have a drink of water or eat a healthy snack. If you’re tired, take a brief break from whatever you’re doing and rest. You can also try a few simple stress-relieving activities, like going for a walk, meditating, or doing a little yoga."

      "content": "Remind yourself that what you’re experiencing is temporary. When you’re in the middle of a bad day, it’s easy to feel like things will be terrible forever. However, remember that this bad day will not last forever, and neither will the things you are feeling right now. [8] X Research source Just because a bad experience is temporary does not mean your feelings about it at the time aren’t valid. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself time to be upset. You might tell yourself something like, “This day has been awful and I feel really down about it right now, but today won’t last forever.” Try to view tomorrow as an opportunity to start fresh."
