      "title": "A need to clean",
      "content": "A need to clean Roaches are considered dirty animals, so your mind might be telling you it’s time for a spring cleaning. [1] X Research source If you’re looking to improve your hygiene , start by cleaning your home and keeping a regular bathing schedule. You’ll be on your way to a healthier life in no time. This interpretation is especially relevant when the roaches crawl over your hands. It isn’t just about physical cleanliness either. You could be receiving a message to clear the clutter out of your mind and tend to your mental health. Practice meditation or schedule some time with a counselor to keep your mind clean."

      "content": "Resilience Have you ever heard the myth that cockroaches can survive a nuclear bomb? While that isn’t true, roaches are incredibly resilient. When you’re facing an upcoming difficult situation and you see cockroaches in a dream, it could be a sign that you’ll be able to bounce back. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Disgust",
      "content": "Disgust The dirtiness that’s associated with cockroaches can be what’s spilling into your unconscious mind. In these dreams, especially if you’re totally grossed out, you could be seeing a reflection of the disgust you have in your waking life. This could come from being around people you don’t like or being stuck in a bad situation."

    {
      "title": "Shame",
      "content": "Shame Having cockroaches fill your dreams can sometimes point toward feelings of shame and embarrassment. If you kill a cockroach and get guts on your hand or you chase a cockroach and can’t catch up to it, the dream may be telling you to shine a light on the parts of yourself you’re not happy with. Pratcing shadow work , where you face the aspects of yourself that you don’t like, can help you overcome and accept your shortcomings. Developing your intuition can help you find where your attention needs to be directed. Meditate to calm yourself down, then start asking yourself yes and no questions. You can start easy by saying things like “Is this my name?” and then move on to questions you don’t consciously know the answer to."

      "title": "Responsibility",
      "content": "Responsibility The strength of the cockroach empowers you! If you successfully get rid of the roaches in your dream it could mean that you’re ready for new responsibilities and challenges in your life. You may be stepping up for a promotion in your job, leading up a club, or even having a baby."

      "title": "Positivity and change",
      "content": "Positivity and change Due to their resemblance to eggs, cockroaches have been associated with rebirth and change. Seeing flattened roaches in a dream could mean new opportunities will be available to you, perhaps sooner than you think."

    {
      "title": "Hidden thoughts",
      "content": "Hidden thoughts Roaches always seem to pop up out of nowhere. They like to hang out in small, dark places, so hiding roaches can be symbols of repressed thoughts seeping up into your mind. It’s part of human nature to avoid pain, and sometimes that means not thinking your thoughts or processing emotions. Things always seem to be revealed in dreams, however…"

      "title": "Female dominance",
      "content": "Female dominance Female cockroaches can reproduce asexually (which is a little scary) and lay up to 16 eggs at a time—that’s a recipe for a lot of roaches! The female roach’s ability to exist and reproduce by herself symbolizes strong feminine energy and self-fortitude. It can be hard to tell what the sex of a roach is in a dream, but if it’s laying eggs it’s a pretty good indication that it’s female. If you’re a man having this dream it may mean a strong woman will start influencing your life. If you’re a woman having this dream, it may mean you’re about to change for the better."

      "title": "Roaches in one area",
      "content": "Roaches in one area Dreaming about a small concentration of cockroaches can mean it’s time for you to take risks. You’re being given a rare opportunity to make serious changes in your life, so take that leap and grab hold of your destiny. Think about the risks you’re trying to take. Do you want to ask someone out, but you’re afraid of what they’ll say? Do you want to quit your job but don’t know what life will hold for you after? Now may be the best time for you to act, before the opportunity passes you by."

      "title": "House infested with cockroaches",
      "content": "House infested with cockroaches This dream means just what it does in real life: clean things up before they get out of hand. If you’re seeing swarms of cockroaches rooting around the crevices of your dreams, this could be an unconscious sign that something seriously needs your attention. The good thing about this dream is that it means it’s not too late to change. You’re in control of your own life and if you find the root of the problem you can stop it in its tracks."

    {
      "title": "Cockroaches crawling on you",
      "content": "Cockroaches crawling on you This dream can point to a promise you don’t want to uphold in waking life. You may have bitten off more than you can chew and are left with the consequences of disappointing someone. Before you promise anything, make sure it’s in your capabilities to keep it. Maybe those roaches just think you’re neat. A positive interpretation of this dream is that you’re very attractive (that’s why they want to be all over you) and that people in your life are going to offer you their support. Take note of how you feel; if you’re calm this dream is probably a good sign."

      "title": "Killing a cockroach",
      "content": "Killing a cockroach Since there are so many different interpretations of cockroaches, there are a ton of different ways this dream could go. If the roach represents hardships and bad omens, this dream is about you overcoming them. If the roach represents strength and resilience, this dream may mean you’re lost and don’t know how to move forward. Pay attention to how you feel when you kill it. Are you filled with relief? Then it may signal the end of hardships. If you feel remorse, you may have killed your own luck and motivation. If you think the dream means you’re becoming untethered from your goals, just make some new ones! Start small, and work your way up to bigger changes. Working on things relevant to you now and doing what you want to will always be easier than accomplishing last year’s goal."

      "content": "Being attacked by a cockroach Being attacked is usually a pretty bad sign. This dream can be foretelling an injustice in your life. You may be blamed for something you didn’t do, or wrongfully punished. Reach out to your support system to get help during troubling times. This dream can also mean you’re feeling spiritually and physically exhausted. Maybe it’s time to take a break! If you’re someone who’s always on the go, schedule a date with yourself to just enjoy being alone."

      "title": "Seeing a dead cockroach",
      "content": "Seeing a dead cockroach A good cockroach is a dead cockroach…right? It turns out that’s not always the case. The meaning of this dream depends on which way the cockroach is facing when you find it. If it’s face up, that’s a good sign. It may mean you’ve overcome a recent hardship or annoyance in your life. If it’s face down, however, it can represent stagnation. [3] X Research source A face-down cockroach can also mean something has ended before it could begin. It could be a goal you weren’t able to accomplish or an unfulfilled wish that's now out of reach. Remember though, whenever something ends there’s room for a new beginning!"

      "content": "Dreaming of a cockroach in your bed There’s nothing quite so scary as feeling something crawling on your leg after you get between the sheets. You’re most vulnerable while in your bed—you sleep there, after all—so this dream could be telling you something bad is coming your way in a familiar place. Trust yourself more than your surroundings, and you’ll get through this. By grounding yourself you’ll be able to muster the strength to stay standing in shifting environments."

      "title": "Seeing a black cockroach",
      "content": "Seeing a black cockroach Black cockroaches, or Oriental cockroaches, are flightless insects associated with bad omens. Their inability to fly, despite having wings, makes them associated with being weighed down and not being able to escape a bad situation. If you kill a black cockroach in a dream, this can symbolize getting through a dark time."

      "title": "Seeing a white cockroach",
      "content": "Seeing a white cockroach White is usually a positive symbol in dreams—sometimes meaning peace, sometimes meaning purity—but not in this case. A white cockroach means that there’s something treacherous afoot. Someone may be going behind your back or being malicious just for fun. Sometimes, this dream means you’re losing motivation, especially if you’re feeling that way in waking life. Refocus on what’s important to you, and spend your energy on what you really want to do."

There are certain numbers that are of significance and may reveal more about your dream. If you know your lucky numbers in numerology, keep an eye out for them. For example, seeing three cockroaches can mean a spirit is watching over you. The number three is associated with clarity and connection to the divine."

This, once again, is because of the dark and dirty places roaches like to hang out. In Chinese mythology specifically, cockroach dreams are symbolic of wartime and being controlled.

      "title": "Islamic interpretations",
      "content": "Islamic interpretations in Islam, roaches are almost always a sign of bad luck or a reflection of your own ideas about luck. The context of your dream determines what omens it may carry. If you’re trying to catch a cockroach but it keeps running away, that can mean someone in your social circle has bad intentions for you. Reevaluate who you’re surrounding yourself with and who you can trust. [6] X Research source If the roach is running through your house, that points to a hidden, minor enemy within your family. They won’t cause you too much harm, but they can still trouble your life."
