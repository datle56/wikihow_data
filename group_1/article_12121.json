      "content": "Avoid ever blaming your inability to come on your own or someone else's poor health. Saying \"Johnny had a cold last week\" or \"My gout has really been bothering me lately\" or \"Sorry! Can't do lunch. Kassie is allergic to gluten!\" or \"Hard pregnancy! I have random morning sickness\" won't impress anyone. In some cases, it'll cause the person to try hard to accommodate your sickness. Blaming your inability to turn up on sickness usually backfires, for example: Allergies: These can be catered for simply. Current illness: A simple date shift will mean you still have to turn up. Blaming it on aches and pains is silly! They will suggest a non-active activity! Blaming it on sickness is unwise! They might say that they aren't overly freaked out about germs."

Some people can be very accommodating or persistent and you can really hurt them by carrying on with excuses before finally putting down your foot and saying no."

Unless you really want to have a strong, close friendship with this/these person/people, do not ever tell them why! This also sounds like you had to come up with some sort of reason not to come. [3] X Research source Here is an example email invite and decline: Invite : \"Tracey, How have you been? I am very excited about the upcoming ballet recital. We hope to see you there! I was thinking that it would be fun to get together sometime at my house. Let me know what days work for you. Thursday, Friday, and the 7th work for us. Let me know if you have any other days also! Jenny\" Decline : \"Hello, Jenny! I'm looking forward to the recital also. Lilly is dragging me from store to store trying to find purple tights and green leotards! Hard to find! Thank you for the invitation. I am sorry, but I cannot make it. I really appreciate the offer I look forward to seeing Janice perform on Tuesday! How is your father-in-law's shoulder? We are all praying for him! Have a good weekend! Tracey\""
