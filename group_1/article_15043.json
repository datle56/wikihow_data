      "content": "Brush your hair in the shower with a wide-tooth comb. You don't want to use a round brush to detangle. It's better to start with mostly detangled hair. Add extra conditioner to your hair, a small dollop, and then work up from the bottom with a wide-tooth comb, working out the tangles as you go. Rinse the conditioner out when you're done.

      "content": "Remove excess water from your hair. When you get out of the shower, pat your hair dry with a towel. Don't rub it, as that can create more tangles. Hold the towel on both sides of a section of your hair and pat inward."

      "title": "Divide the hair into sections.",
      "content": "Divide the hair into sections. To blow dry it properly, you need to go section by section with the blow dryer. The best way to approach this task is to isolate an area by clipping back the rest of your hair with darby clips. Section off your bangs separately. [2] X Research source Divide your hair into 4 main sections. Divide down the middle from nose to the back of your head first, then divide each side into 2 sections, using your ears s dividers."

      "content": "Apply a heat-protectant product to your hair. Before you start blow drying, you need to apply a heat-protectant product to your hair to prevent damage. Look for a heat-protect product like mousse, serum, or leave-in conditioner. Work a small amount through your hair, then comb through your tresses to distribute the product evenly."

      "title": "Blow dry your bangs with the round brush, if applicable.",
      "content": "Blow dry your bangs with the round brush, if applicable. Start with blow drying your bangs, if you have them. If they dry without assistance, they can set in an unflattering wave or cowlick. Go ahead and use the round brush. Move the bangs back and forth with the brush as you dry your bangs. It's best to set your hair dryer to medium throughout the process. If you work with high heat, you could damage your hair. If your blow dryer only has low and high, use low. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Blow dry the rest of the hair without the round brush. Work around your head, doing a rough blow dry. You don't need much technique here, except you should keep the blow dryer moving. Don't let it sit on 1 part of your hair, as that can lead to too much heat, damaging your hair."

      "content": "Let your hair air dry as an alternative. If you'd rather spend time doing something else instead of blow drying your hair, you can let it air dry instead. When you get out of the shower, pat your hair dry without rubbing it, and then let it dry. You don't need to comb it or use the round brush on it at all. Just make sure you don't let it dry all the way."

Therefore, hold off on drying more until you get your round brush set.

They heat up more than the nylon variety, making your hair dry too fast. Stick to brushes with nylon and boar bristles. [5] X Research source It can help to have more than 1 brush, so you can leave 1 in your hair to help create the curl while you move on to a new section. You may also want to have brushes in a variety of sizes. For instance, a smaller brush might work best for shorter layers while a larger brush would be beneficial for longer layers."

Then, blast it with some cool air for a few seconds to help set it. You can leave the brush in place while you work on the next section, which helps set the curl; this is where a second brush comes in handy.
