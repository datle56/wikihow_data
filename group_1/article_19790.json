      "content": "Most earaches go away with home treatment in a couple days. If you have mild ear pain, the mostly likely cause is a viral or bacterial infection. In many cases, these kinds of earaches heal on their own, with no need for medical treatment. Wait 1-2 days to see if you start to feel better. While you’re waiting, focus on treating the symptoms with remedies like hot or cold compresses and OTC pain medications. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have a baby under 6 months of age and you suspect they have an earache, call your pediatrician right away. Ear infections can be more serious in young babies. [2] X Research source Some types of ear infection, such as swimmer’s ear or a severe middle or inner ear infection, might require treatment with antibiotics to clear up. If you have severe ear pain, or if it lasts longer than 2 days, get your ear evaluated by a doctor to determine the right treatment."

      "content": "Choose whichever temperature feels best to you. Both cold and heat can be soothing for this kind of pain, so it’s a matter of personal preference which one you use. Wrap an ice pack or a hot compress (such as a hot water bottle or heating pad) in a thin towel or cloth and gently hold it against your ear. Don’t put it directly against your skin, since it could cause burns or frostbite.

Don’t use a heating pad on a child’s ear. [4] X Research source With a warm compress, you might feel earwax trickle out of your ear. It’s normal for the wax to melt when you expose it to heat. Don’t use ice or heat on your skin for longer than 20 minutes at a time. [5] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source"
