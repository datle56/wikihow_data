If your router only has a Console port, you will most likely need a DB9-to-RJ45 cable. Connect the DB9 end of the cable to the Console port on your router. Then connect the female RJ45 end to a male RJ45 port on your computer. If your computer does not have a male RJ45 port, you can use a female RJ45-to-USB adapter. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a rollover cable (which is similar to an Ethernet cable, except the pins are reversed on the other end), and connect it to a female DB9-to-RJ45 adapter. Warning: Do NOT connect a rollover cable from the Ethernet port on your computer to the Console port on your router or switch. This will blow out the Console port on the router or switch."

Once you have your Cisco router or switch connected to your PC, use one of the following steps to find out the port number it is connected to: Windows: Right-click the Windows Start menu and click Device Manager . Expand \"Ports (COM & LPT)\" in the list of devices. [3] X Research source Note the port number your router is connected to (i.e, \"COM1\") Mac: Open the Terminal and type cd /dev and press Enter . Then type ls -ltr /dev/*usb* and press Enter . The port number will be listed after \"/dev/tty.usbmodem\" or \" /dev/tty.usbserial\". Linux: Open the Terminal and type cd /dev and press Enter .
