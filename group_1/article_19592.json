      "content": "Treat irritation with aloe vera or antibacterial cream. Soothe redness and irritation with aloe vera to leave your skin clear and smooth. Because it's a natural product, it's especially safe to use on the pubic area. If you suspect that you have infected ingrown hairs , try using an antibacterial cream on them up to 4 times each day. Bacitracin , Neosporin , and Polysporin are all possible topical treatments. Products that contain petroleum jelly, like petroleum jelly or Aquaphor, also work well. Tea tree oil (or coconut oil) is another common solution."

      "content": "Use a commercial razor bump removal product. Look for something that contains salicylic acid, glycolic acid, witch hazel, aloe, or any combination of these ingredients. Some of these products might come in a roller bottle that's designed to go directly on your skin, while others might require you to put the solution on a cotton ball and dab it on your skin. Be sure to follow your product's instructions exactly—many are designed specifically for the pubic area, but read the package to make sure it's safe to use on the area. [1] X Research source If you don't know what to buy, call your local waxing salon and ask what they recommend to their clients. You can probably purchase the product there as well, or look around online. In general, apply the solution to your skin at least once per day, if not more. Aim to do it when you get out of the shower, before your skin has sweat or anything else on it."

If you don't have a gel pack, dampen a cloth with cold water and lay it on the affected area for a few minutes. [2] X Research source Warm compresses may also work, as they help soften the skin and bring ingrown hairs to the surface."

      "content": "Soak in an oatmeal bath. Oatmeal baths are known to soothe skin and relieve itchiness due to the starch and beta-glucan contained in oatmeal. The phenols found in oatmeal also have an anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effect. This is often a simple—and enjoyable—way to treat razor bumps on the pubic area. [3] X Research source Taking a regular, warm bath may also soothe the skin, as warm water opens up the pores and relieves swelling and irritation."

      "title": "Wear loose clothes.",
      "content": "Wear loose clothes. Wearing tight underwear or clothes may irritate the skin on and near your pubic area further, as there's less air circulation and more friction. Aim for loose, breathable fabrics, like cotton, that won't rub against your skin. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Treat scarring with Retin-A. Retinoids, derived from Vitamin A, can help smooth over skin and reduce the appearance of scars or marks left by razor bumps. You may need to see a doctor for a prescription, so make an appointment with your dermatologist if the issue doesn't clear up on its own. Be sure to apply the product according to its instructions. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Do not use Retin-A if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. It can cause severe birth defects. [6] X Research source Areas treated with Retin-A are more susceptible to sunburns. Cover up, or wear SPF 45 sunscreen. [7] X Research source Don't use Retin-A on any areas where you plan to wax in the future. It can make the skin significantly weaker, leading to potential tearing during a waxing session."

      "title": "Stop shaving until the bumps heal.",
      "content": "Stop shaving until the bumps heal. Shaving over razor bumps will only irritate or tear them open, leaving them vulnerable to infection (and probably won't remove much hair, anyway). If you can, let the hair grow for a few days and see if it breaks out of the bumps on its own. [8] X Research source Resist the urge to scratch the area, as well. It might itch, but breaking the bumps with your fingernails can lead to infection and scarring."

      "content": "Throw out any dull razors. A dull or rusty razor can keep you from getting a clean shave , whether it's by snagging hairs instead of cutting them, or irritating the skin around the follicle. This, in turn, often leads to razor bumps or razor burn . Use a new, clean razor, especially when shaving sensitive skin, like your bikini area. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source In general, change your razor blade after 5 or 6 shaves. Store your razors in a dry area to keep them from rusting."

      "content": "Shave every other day, at the most. Shaving every day can irritate new bumps, so try to wait and only use a razor every second day. If you can, try to shave every three days or even less frequently, as this is better for the sensitive skin of your pubic area. If you already have razor bumps or razor burn, let it clear up completely before shaving again. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Gently exfoliate before shaving 2-3 times a week.",
      "content": "Gently exfoliate before shaving 2-3 times a week. If you don't exfoliate , you won't remove excess layers of skin, which can lead to ingrown hairs. Regular exfoliation will prevent razor bumps because the hair will never get a chance to regrow towards the skin and become trapped. It helps clear off any dead skin cells or other material on your skin, paving the way for a close and clean shave. Try chemical exfoliation (products with salicylic or glycolic acid), physical exfoliation (gloves, loofah, skincare scrubs, or an ingrown hair prevention brush ), or whatever works best for you 2-3 times a week. If your skin is particularly sensitive, it may be better to exfoliate a few days prior to shaving; otherwise, it's usually okay to exfoliate in the shower just before you shave. [11] X Research source Dermatologist R. Sonia Batra recommends “products that have a chemical exfoliant like an alpha hydroxy acid or beta hydroxy acids” like “glycolic lotion, glycolic wash, salicylic lotion, or salicylic wash.” [12] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. Batra adds that using a chemical exfoliant “can sting quite a lot if you put it on right when you shave, or even right before you shave. So usually, days you're actually not shaving would be the best time to apply it.” [13] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. If you prefer a physical exfoliant, Batra recommends “a gentle washcloth or a gentle brush to help slough the outer layer of skin.” [14] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. Remember to be extra careful when exfoliating the pubic area, as the skin is more sensitive than other parts of your body and may not be able to tolerate stronger exfoliators. Avoid irritating ingredients like fragrances, as well."

      "title": "Shave in the shower.",
      "content": "Shave in the shower. The steam from a warm shower serves two purposes: it makes the hair softer and your skin less prone to nicks and irritation. If you usually shave first, consider reorganizing your shower tasks so that you do it last. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Try to give it five minutes before you start shaving. This is especially important when shaving the pubic area, as the hair is often coarser than on other parts of your body. If you don't have time to shower, wet a washcloth with water that's as warm as you can stand, and lay it over the area you're going to shave. Try to leave it for two or three minutes before shaving."

      "title": "Shave the hair with the grain, avoiding pressure.",
      "content": "Shave the hair with the grain, avoiding pressure. Applying pressure can make the razor uneven on your skin. Instead, aim to hold it lightly and \"glide\" it over your bikini area. Try not to go over the same area twice, but if you must, make the second pass with the grain, instead of against it. Shaving against the grain means to move the razor in the direction opposite of hair growth. For instance, most people are shaving against the grain when they run a razor from their ankle to their knee. Shaving with the grain creates less irritation, but not as close a shave. Try to use this technique as much as you can if you're going back over an area you've already shaved."

      "content": "Use shaving cream (or a substitute). Shaving cream (or gel) can also soften hairs and make them easier to remove, as well as making it easier to track where you've shaved and where you haven't. Find a cream that includes aloe or other moisturizing compounds for the best results. [16] X Research source If you're in a pinch and have no shaving cream, use hair conditioner instead. It's better than nothing!"

      "title": "Rinse off with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse off with cold water. Ending your shower with a blast of cold water, or using a cold washcloth on the area, will cause your pores to temporarily contract, leaving them less vulnerable to irritants and infection. [17] X Research source Contrary to the popular myth, cold water doesn't \"close\" your pores. The cold temperatures may cause pores to contract slightly, but the effect is only temporary and minimal. There's no harm in rinsing with cold water, but if you find this step notably unpleasant, it's usually okay to skip it. Pat the area dry when you're done. Rubbing the pubic area with a towel can be too harsh, which may irritate your skin. Instead, dry your bikini area in small taps to avoid itching, redness, or bumps."

      "title": "Try a different hair removal method.",
      "content": "Try a different hair removal method. If you want to prevent razor bumps in the long-term, consider stopping shaving altogether. While waxing may cause more ingrown hairs at first, if you do it consistently over a long period of time, you won't need to wax as much and will experience fewer ingrown hairs in the long-run. Laser hair removal also significantly reduces hair growth, though it's more expensive. [18] X Research source If you choose to wax, aim to make an appointment with a reputable waxing salon every 6-8 weeks in the beginning. You might be able to go for longer stretches without waxing later on as your hair growth begins to slow. Laser hair removal usually works best on dark hair and light skin. If your skin and hair are close to the same color, you might not be a good candidate for treatment. You'll need at least 4-6 laser hair removal treatments, so look for promotions to lower the cost."

      "content": "Razor bumps are ingrown hairs. Razor bumps, also known as pseudofolliculitis barbae, are caused by ingrown hairs that occur after shaving. When the hair is shaved, the end is sharp and can curl back and pierce the skin. New skin then grows over the hair, and the ingrown hair causes an immune response that creates the bump.
