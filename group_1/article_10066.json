Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of melted butter and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice into a mixing bowl and stir them together. Mince 2 cloves of garlic with a chef’s knife and add it to the butter and lemon juice. Use a zester or a grater to scrape the zest off of 1 lemon, and mix it into your butter mixture. Mix the ingredients until they’re thoroughly combined. [2] X Research source You can adjust how many spices and herbs you put in the mixture to change the flavor.
