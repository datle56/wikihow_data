      "content": "Stand with both feet as flat on the ground as possible. To prevent the tires from gaining traction, put the least amount of weight on the bike by standing over the bike. If the tires have too much traction, then the motorcycle will move forward when you attempt a burnout. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Start the motorcycle and keep it in the neutral gear. Turn the key in the ignition and start up the engine so it can warm up. Check the temperature gauge after a few minutes to make sure the dial is at about the halfway point to indicate that the engine has warmed up. [2] X Research source Keep the engine in the neutral gear while it warms up. You can rev the engine a few times to get it warmer faster. Allow the engine to run for at least 5 minutes before you attempt a burnout."

      "title": "Pull the clutch lever all the way in.",
      "content": "Pull the clutch lever all the way in. On most motorcycles, the clutch is the lever on the left hand of the handlebars. Use all 4 fingers to engage the clutch by pulling it back all the way to the handlebar. [3] X Research source Keep a tight grip on the clutch lever so it stays engaged. If your motorcycle has the clutch on the right handlebar, be sure to engage it fully with all 4 fingers of your right hand."

      "content": "Hold the front brake with the middle finger of your right hand. Apply the brake and rev the engine throttle simultaneously by holding the front brake with your right hand. Use just your middle finger to pull back the lever for the brake so you can use the rest of your hand to work the throttle. [4] X Research source If you have a motorcycle with the throttle on the left-hand side, then use the middle finger of your left hand to apply the brake."

      "title": "Rev up the engine close to the red line on the gauge.",
      "content": "Rev up the engine close to the red line on the gauge. With your right hand, rev up the engine by twisting the throttle down. Look at the repetitions per minute (RPM) gauge and look for the red line towards the top of it. Rev up the engine so the arrow is about 75% of the way to the red line at the top. [6] X Research source Start revving the engine slowly to make sure the engine isn’t in gear and the bike won’t move. It’s important that you build up the engine before you put it into gear so the tire spins too fast to gain traction."

      "content": "Let go of the clutch to perform a burnout. Don’t ease off of the clutch to disengage it. Instead, let it go in 1 motion by releasing all of your fingers at once. The engine will then engage in first gear and the rear tire will start spinning to create a burnout. [8] X Research source The longer you hold the burnout, the more wear and tear on your rear tire."

      "title": "Reengage the clutch and release the throttle to end the burnout.",
      "content": "Reengage the clutch and release the throttle to end the burnout. Use your left hand to pull the lever to engage the clutch, which will pull the engine out of first gear and into neutral. Rollback the throttle with your right hand, but keep the brake engaged the entire time. The rear tire will come to a stop and your motorcycle will not roll forward. [9] X Research source Do not release the brake until the tire has completely stopped spinning."
