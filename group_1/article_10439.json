    {
      "title": "Check the cables.",
      "content": "Check the cables. The cables should be tightly attached to the wall and your modem; loose coaxial cables can lose data, and a loose power cable can provide insufficient power. If there are any splitters between your modem and the coaxial port on your wall, make sure all the cables entering and exiting the split are snugly secured. Also check that the pin inside the coaxial cables is straight. A bent pin indicates damage and prevents internet connection. Replace any damaged cables."
    },
    {
      "title": "Restart the modem or gateway.",
      "content": "Restart the modem or gateway. A random glitch can be causing the blinking green light, and restarting it can be an easy fix! To restart, unplug the modem's/gateway's power from the wall for a few minutes, then plug it back in."

    {
      "title": "Check for a Cox outage.",
      "content": "Check for a Cox outage. An overall internet outage or maintenance outage can cause your router to blink green. Call the local ISP office to see if there's an outage; you can also check their website for additional information."
    },
    {
      "title": "Update the firmware.",
      "content": "Update the firmware. Outdated software causes many issues, like a blinking green light. You can generally update the firmware by opening the app provided to you by Cox. Alternatively, go to their website, log in, go to System Settings in your router/modem/gateway's admin interface, and look there for a firmware update."
    },
    {
      "title": "Factory reset the device.",
      "content": "Factory reset the device. Doing so removes all personalized settings, like if you changed the network name/password. To reset it to factory settings, look at the back of the modem and press the recessed \"Reset\" button for a few seconds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Replace your equipment.",
      "content": "Replace your equipment. Your router may be too old or internally damaged and replacing it might be your only option. Since it's a rental device, call Cox to get a replacement. If you don't want another rental, you can buy your own Cox-compatible modem and wireless router."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call for a tech.",
      "content": "Call for a tech. In some cases, you can't fix the blinking green light yourself and need help from Cox. They should also check the coaxial lines to make sure there isn't any damage, but they can also replace any lines outside that have been compromised (think chew marks from outside critters).

      "content": "There are a few reasons for a blinking green Cox modem, including: Loose cables - loose cables can prevent your modem from connecting properly and trigger the blinking green light. Loose splitters - loose splitters can also prevent your modem from connecting properly. Bent coaxial pins - These can also prevent proper modem connection. Damaged cables - can also prevent your modem from connecting properly and trigger the blinking green light. Outage - an outage from your ISP prevents your modem from connecting to the internet properly and triggers the blinking green light. Software glitch - a hiccup(glitch) in your modem can be causing the issue; there might not be anything wrong with your internet connection, but this glitch. Outdated firmware - outdated software can cause many issues, including the blinking green light. Bad settings - you or someone else could have previously configured settings that is now preventing you from connecting to the internet. Old equipment - older equipment doesn't always work with newer systems and causes the green light on your modem to blink. Damaged equipment - think of the chewers outside that may have compromised/exposed wiring; water, sunlight, snow, and ice also play a role in deteriorating outside equipment [2] X Research source"

      "title": "What does my Cox modem blinking white mean?",
      "content": "What does my Cox modem blinking white mean? A flashing white light indicates that something is wrong with the connection. You'll usually see this in cases where you have more than one router hooked up to a modem to create a more complicated network that covers a large area. In these cases, the solution is to take the PANORAMIC WIFI GATEWAY (PW8) out of bridge mode and connect to the other router while it's in bridge mode . This appears to be a bug with the PW8 in bridge mode."
