      "content": "End the relationship in person. No matter how much you're dreading it, it’s usually best to end the relationship face-to-face. This gives your significant other the respect they deserve and allows you both to get closure. [1] X Research source It also helps prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications, which occur more frequently on digital forms of communication because they don’t allow you to read cues like body language or facial expression. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source It is acceptable, however, to end the relationship over the phone if you're in a long-distance relationship, and you know you won't see each other for a while. It’s also okay to end the relationship via phone or text if you're in a controlling or manipulative relationship . In fact, it’s preferable and safer to break up this way if your ex is prone to outbursts, violence, or manipulative behaviors."

      "title": "Choose your time and place wisely.",
      "content": "Choose your time and place wisely. Be thoughtful when choosing a time and place for the break-up to avoid uncomfortable situations. [3] X Research source Emotions may run high during the conversation, so it’s usually best to break-up somewhere private, instead of a busy public place. Consider the other person’s schedule as well—it’s not a good idea to break up with them right before they have a big test at school or an important presentation at work. Pick a time when they'll be in a calmer emotional state. Don't break up with your partner right after a stressful meeting at work, for example. Fridays can be a good choice since this gives your soon-to-be-ex the weekend to recover and process their emotions. Don't break up with your partner in your favorite restaurant, bar, or park. Pick a neutral location that has no special meaning for either of you."

      "title": "Be firm about your decision to break up.",
      "content": "Be firm about your decision to break up. Being wishy-washy or sugar-coating things to “let them down easy” only causes more pain in the end. Use clear, direct language and simply say that you don't want to be in the relationship anymore—doing otherwise creates confusion and leaves the door open for argument. [4] X Research source Don’t imply that this is just a “break” or that you might get back together in the end. You may think that it'll ease the pain, but if you don't really mean it, their feelings will just get hurt again down the road. When you’re sure that someone isn’t the right person for you, it’s best to just say this directly, so you can both start to move on."

      "title": "Be honest but not cruel.",
      "content": "Be honest but not cruel. You don't want your partner to walk away feeling unsure about why the relationship was over, but you don't want them walking away knowing the top 20 things you don't like about them, either. [5] X Research source Be truthful about why the relationship needs to end, but resist the impulse to list every little thing you don’t like about the other person, and avoid blaming them. You don't have to go into all the details and rehash old arguments, unless the person is genuinely confused about why you’re ending things. Don’t put the person down or add insult to injury. For example, instead of saying. \"I don’t want to be with someone so insecure,\" say something like, \"I think it may help you to work on your self-confidence.\" Try to boil it down to a main problem. For example : \"We are not compatible enough in key areas,\" \"I don't feel supported by you in my career path,\" or \"I want children and you don't.”"

      "content": "Be prepared for however they may react. Being on the receiving end of a break-up can cause anger, shock, panic, sadness, and all kinds of other emotions. No matter how the other person reacts, try to remain calm. Put yourself in their shoes and approach the conversation with empathy. You can even show them some kindness by mentioning all the things you appreciate about them, or letting them know that you don’t regret your time together. [6] X Research source Comfort them if they need it, but don't let their emotions sway you from your decision. Be compassionate, but also firm. If you're worried about leaving your ex alone, call a friend of theirs, explain what happened, and ask if they can come support your ex for a bit. If things get too out of control or the conversation becomes circular, step out for a bit to let them cool down, and tell them you can resume the conversation later."

      "title": "Establish concrete boundaries for your future interactions.",
      "content": "Establish concrete boundaries for your future interactions. Decide what level of interaction you’re comfortable with, and convey this to your ex in a clear, direct way. Tell them, for example, that you’ll be disengaging on social media, that you won’t respond to phone calls or texts, or that unexpected visits are off-limits. Whatever boundaries you decide on, just make sure to communicate them firmly and enforce them as best you can. If you have mutual friends and want to avoid each other for a while, make a \"joint custody\" plan to see your friends without running into each other. If you both have a favorite coffee shop or go to the same gym every time, try to set a schedule that helps you avoid each other. Make a plan for returning each other’s belongings as soon as possible, so you don't have to keep seeing each other."

It’s usually best to make a clean break, or at least to spend some time apart before trying to become friends. [7] X Research source If either of you still has feelings for the other one, it’s too early to try to be friends. Take some more time to make sure you’ve both fully moved on. Don’t try to become friends with benefits—this can make things more complicated and hurt your chances of having a successful friendship in the future. [8] X Research source"
