[7] X Research source The amount of hair you cut depends on how far up the damage goes, but typically it will be about 1/2 inch to two inches. Start by cutting less, and then go back to cut more if desired. Have the person lean their head forward slightly when cutting the back to help you perform a more even trim. [8] X Research source"

The trick is to pull away from the places you want layers by combing each section at an angle down towards the face from the back. Here are the sections you will pin: [12] X Research source As you divide your sections, twist each 1 into a tiny bun. Then secure the bun with a duckbill hair clip until you're ready to cut that section. Pin together the \"top box\" section. Use a comb to make a part on the top left and right side. Use the end of the eyebrows as a guide for how far over the part should be. Divide this section in half. One part will be from the crown of the head to the forehead, and the second part will be from the crown of the head and reach to the middle back section of your head. This hair will be combed forward and be section off in the front. The back of the hair from the middle down will not be layered. It can be left loose or pinned back. [13] X Research source Divide the right and left front sections. These sections will start at the temples and end at the ear. Start with the comb at the back of the head, and angle down towards the bottom of the ear. [14] X Research source"

Slide your fingers toward the ends until they reach the length you want the layer to end. You will cut the hair that is sticking out from your fingers.

[17] X Research source Common layers are cut right below the earlobe, or just above the jawline to help frame the face. It's a good idea to drop 1 section of hair down, and then cut it at the desired length of the layer. Then, you can pull that hair back up and use it as a guide for the rest of your hair."
