Since a circle has 360 degrees total, dividing the central angle by 360 degrees gives you the portion of the circle that the sector represents. Using this information, find what portion of the circumference the arc length represents. For example, simplify the formula to get: arc length = ( 62.8 ) ( 135 360 ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{arc length}}=(62.8)({\\frac {135}{360}})} = ( 62.8 ) ( .375 ) {\\displaystyle =(62.8)(.375)}"
