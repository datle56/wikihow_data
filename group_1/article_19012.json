      "content": "Get a legendary from other chests. Other chests don't have as high a chance of containing a legendary card, but there are still ways you can use them to get Legendary cards. Fortune chests are available following Arena's 1-12. At Arena 4, the chance of getting a legendary card starts at 2% and increases to 10% at Arena 10. Fortune chests contain four featured cards each day, one of which is a legendary. You are guaranteed two of the four featured cards. They can be purchased in the shop for 750 gems. Lightning chests have a low probability of containing a legendary card (less than 1%). However, you can use them to strike cards you don't want and exchange to for other cards fo the same type. In other words, if you end up getting a legendary you don't want from the lightning chest, you can strike it until you find one you do want."

      "title": "Purchase a legendary chest in the shop.",
      "content": "Purchase a legendary chest in the shop. These chests have a 100% chance of containing a legendary card. These appear in the shop as special offers which only appear once every few weeks. The offer usually only lasts about 24 hours and cost 500 gems. This is one of the risk-free methods as you have a 100% chance of getting a legendary. If you save up enough gems, you can also buy it without having to spend any money. Legendary chests are best when you only have a few legendary cards since you have a smaller chance of getting a repeat of a card you already have. However, more skilled and higher level players will often choose to spend the gems on challenges instead. These have better value if you can consistently get a high number of wins. These appear at least once every month."

At Royal Arena (2000 trophies), you will be able to get legendary chests in your chest cycle. King's chests will be replaced by Legendary King's chests as well.

Put in mini P.E.K.K.A. or Rage for Lumberjack (this will change the deck significantly). Swap Bandit for Dark Prince or Knight.
