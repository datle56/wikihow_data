Your doctor will likely need to do a physical exam and x-ray or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treatment. Ask your doctor about any home treatments you are considering during your appointment."

      "content": "Wear night splints to improve your condition while you sleep. Night splints are braces that attach to your injured foot, ankle, and lower leg simultaneously. The splint stretches your plantar fascia ligament while you're sleeping, which helps to ease the pain. [2] X Research source These splints are usually called \"Plantar fasciitis night splints\" or \"heel splints.\" You can buy them online, at sporting goods stores, and from medical equipment facilities. Some splints will come in small, medium, and large sizes. Other brands will fit a range of shoe sizes. You may find the night splint to be uncomfortable at first, but they can be very effective. [3] X Research source The night splint assists in holding the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon in an elongated position during sleeping to expand the fascial sheath. Night splints help in stretching your calf muscle and supporting the arch of your foot. Night splints need to be used each night regularly and failure to wear these nightly limit their effectiveness."

      "content": "Do plantar fascia stretches to loosen the ligament. Get into a seated position on the floor with your legs straight in front of you. Cross your injured foot over the knee of your other leg. Grasp the toes of your straight leg and gently pull them toward you. If you can't reach your toes, then wrap a towel around them and pull on the towel. [4] X Research source Hold the stretch for 10 seconds and repeat 20 times. You can switch legs and stretch your non-injured foot if you want to! Perform this exercise in the morning before you've done any standing or walking."

Place the non-injured foot in front of you with the knee bent. Push your hips toward the wall and hold the stretch for 10 seconds. You should feel a pull in your calf muscles. [5] X Research source Repeat the stretch 20 times. Feel free to repeat this stretch for your non-injured foot, too."

Stand supported against a bench with the painful area pressed heavily down on the road. Roll it backward and forward on the area for 1 to 2 minutes. The pain might feel severe at first, but it lessens as you continue. Repeat this several times a day. You should experience no pain after several days, but you may feel some soreness at first."

      "content": "See your doctor about getting cortisone injections. [6] X Expert Source Miguel Cunha, DPM Board Certified Podiatrist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. Cortisone is a steroid with strong anti-inflammatory properties. Ask your regular doctor about getting plantar fascia cortisone injections to help reduce your inflammation and pain. Some regular doctors and general practitioners give the injections in-office, or they could refer you to a specialist for the procedure. [7] X Research source Cortisone usually starts working within 3 to 5 days after the injection. Effects can last for several days to a few months -- results will vary. Most people are good candidates for this treatment. Cortisone injections are usually a temporary solution and your doctor may limit the number you can have. Too many injections in that area can cause the plantar fascia to rupture. Keep in mind that many conditions can cause heel pain beyond heel spurs."

      "content": "Talk to a doctor about extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). ESWT is a non-invasive medical procedure that involves high-energy shockwave impulses being sent to the tissues surrounding the heel. It may stimulate healing for damaged plantar fascia tissue. [8] X Research source ESWT is usually done in multiple sessions over a period of time determined by your doctor. You may feel an increase in pain right after the treatment, with relief usually starting within a few days. [9] X Research source ESWT does not have consistent results. It's typically used as a last resort before considering surgery. The reason that ESWT works for some people is unknown. It is possible that the shockwaves cause inflammation in the treated area and this causes the body to send more blood to that area, which promotes healing."

      "content": "Explore surgery options if no other treatments work. Before performing surgery, doctors usually give home treatments about 12 months to work. If no other treatments ease your pain, talk to your doctor about surgical options. Surgery doesn't always help this condition and should be considered only as a last result. [10] X Research source There are 2 surgeries your doctor will discuss with you: Instep plantar fasciotomy involves removing a part of the plantar fascia to ease pressure on the nerves in your foot. Nerve injury, arch instability, and rupture of the plantar fascia are all possible complications. However, if the potential benefits of the procedure outweigh the risks, then you may still want to proceed with this treatment option. Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy is very similar to instep plantar fasciotomy, but uses smaller incisions so that you'll heal faster. Endoscopy has a higher rate of nerve damage, so consider this before moving forward with this option."

Soft silicone heel pads are inexpensive options and you can purchase them over the counter. Insoles are easily found over the counter as well, and can be quite cheap. [18] X Research source Use heel cup inserts to help align the bones in your foot and cushion your heel. Your feet may sweat more with a heel cup, so change your socks and shoes often. Pick up generic insoles at a drugstore or shoe store. Push on the arch to make sure it doesn't collapse. You can also take insoles to a podiatrist to get them customized."
