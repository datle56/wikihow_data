[17] X Trustworthy Source Civil Law Help Center Nonprofit law firm dedicated to civil legal services to all people Go to source For example, if you are seeing a therapist to talk about your harasser and the emotional trauma they've caused, your therapist bills would be something you could potentially recover from your harasser. If you are taking anti-anxiety medication, the cost of that would also be part of your damages. If the person damaged your personal property in any way, repair bills or the cost to replace those items would also be considered damages. It can be hard to quantify something as vague as \"pain and suffering,\" but think about how the harassment has affected you. For example, maybe you stopped participating in an activity because your harasser would always be there. That indicates a loss that you can put a price tag on.
