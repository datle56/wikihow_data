      "title": "Contact the company directly.",
      "content": "Contact the company directly. If you have a problem with a business, your first course of action should be to contact the business directly. You may be able to resolve the problem quickly in this way. For example, if you purchased a product that you believe doesn't match what was advertised, you could return it and ask for a refund."

    {
      "title": "Make a formal request in writing.",
      "content": "Make a formal request in writing. If your first attempt at resolving the problem does not lead to a successful result, you should document your problem in writing. This will serve 2 purposes: it will give the vendor another opportunity to satisfy your concerns before the problem escalates, and it will also serve as documentation of the problem which you will be able to use when you file your online complaint with the BBB. In your letter, clearly identify the problem and the resolution that you would like. For example, you might say, “I am writing because the Acme Widget that I bought does not glow in the dark, as the advertising claims. I would like to return it for a full refund.” Summarize your prior efforts to resolve the problem. You should provide the dates and locations of any contacts you made with anyone from the company. For example, you might say, “On October 1, 2016, I returned to the Acme store in Anytown, USA, and I spoke with the manager, Mr. Smith. I asked to return the widget, but he told me he would not refund my money.”"
