Choose a measuring cup with a spout so you can easily pour the lotion into the new bottle after you warm it up. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the measuring cup in your microwave and set the timer for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Put the measuring cup in your microwave and set the timer for 30 seconds. Lotion easily pours when it reaches around 120 °F (49 °C). You can use an instant read thermometer to test the temperature. Try to avoid overheating the lotion, as this can deactivate any preservatives. [2] X Research source Heating up your lotion too much can also create condensation on the inside of your bottle once you transfer it."

      "title": "Mix up your lotion with a metal spoon.",
      "content": "Mix up your lotion with a metal spoon. Once your lotion is warmed up, place a spoon inside your container and swirl it around to mix up your product. This distributes the heat through the lotion, so it will all pour out evenly. [3] X Research source If you want to add ingredients like essential oils or preservatives, you can do so as you are mixing your lotion."

      "title": "Place a funnel in the top of your empty bottle if you want to avoid spills.",
      "content": "Place a funnel in the top of your empty bottle if you want to avoid spills. It is easy to make a mess when pouring lotion into a different bottle. Use a funnel as you pour if you want help guiding the lotion into the bottle. You can use a small or medium sized funnel for best results. Hold the funnel at the neck of the bottle as you pour in your lotion. The tip of the funnel easily sits into the top of your bottle."

    {
      "title": "Pour your lotion into your bottle from the measuring cup.",
      "content": "Pour your lotion into your bottle from the measuring cup. If you are using a funnel, pour the lotion directly through the funnel. The funnel will catch any spills as you pour. If you are not using a funnel, hold the measuring cup about 3–5 in (7.6–12.7 cm) above the bottle, and carefully pour the lotion directly inside. Keep your arm straight as you pour so you don’t spill any. Continue pouring until the lotion reaches the neck of the bottle. [4] X Research source Holding the measuring cup above the bottle as you pour helps it easily flow through the pour spout. If you do spill a bit of lotion, that’s okay! Simply use a paper towel or washcloth to wipe it off your surfaces or your bottles."

      "title": "Put your lid or dispenser back on once you fill your bottle to the neck.",
      "content": "Put your lid or dispenser back on once you fill your bottle to the neck. Once you’ve filled your bottle, place your topper back on the bottle, and screw it into place. You can leave 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) of space at the top so its easier to screw on your lid. [5] X Research source You can use either a plastic lid or hand pump, for example."

      "title": "Fill up a plastic Ziploc bag or pastry bag with your lotion.",
      "content": "Fill up a plastic Ziploc bag or pastry bag with your lotion. Use a spatula to scoop up your lotion and spread it into your bag. Move the lotion towards the bottom of the bag with your fingers, and squeeze out any air from the bag. Then, seal up the top of the bag when you are finished filling. [6] X Research source Fill the bag completely if filling a large lotion bottle or many different bottles. Add about 1 ⁄ 2 –1 c (120–240 mL) of lotion into your bag if you are filling travel-size or small bottles."

      "title": "Use scissors to cut off the very tip of the bag.",
      "content": "Use scissors to cut off the very tip of the bag. If using a Ziploc bag, cut either the left or right bottom corner. If using a pastry bag, cut the side at the skinny end. Hold your scissors at a 45-degree angle, and snip off 1 ⁄ 16 in (0.16 cm) to make a tiny pour spout. [7] X Research source If you cut a large chunk of plastic off the end, you will squeeze more lotion out at a time. This can get messy, so be mindful of how much you snip off!"

      "content": "Insert the tip of the bag into the neck of the bottle to fill them up. The first 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) of the bag will easily fit inside the bottle. Then, gently apply pressure to your bag towards the tip to release your lotion. [8] X Research source If your lotion is not coming out evenly, use your hand to move the lotion towards the tip. That way, you can easily squeeze it out."

      "content": "Tap your lotion bottle on the table it if you want to fit more inside. As you fill the bottle, you may notice some extra space on the sides. Take the bag out of the bottle, and gently tap your bottle on your table a few times. This moves the lotion around in your bottle, so you can fill it as full as possible. [9] X Research source While this isn’t required, it makes it easier to fill your bottle to the neck."

      "title": "Replace your lid when you reach the neck of the bottle.",
      "content": "Replace your lid when you reach the neck of the bottle. When your lotion bottle is full, take your bag out of the bottle, and place it towards the side. Pick up your lid or dispenser, and screw it back on top. Then, you can fill another bottle or throw your plastic bag away. [10] X Research source If you have lotion left over in your bag, squeeze it back into your main container. That way you don’t waste any lotion. If your bottle has an applicator tube that goes inside, place this into the bottle first, then gradually lower the lid onto the top. Press down on the applicator a few times to release your lotion."

This is a great idea if you need to easily fill many lotion bottles at once, and there are many different types of professional filling machines available. Search online for “Manual lotion filler for sale” to review different options. Select a machine that works for your needs and fits your budget.

[12] X Research source You can use a spatula to help you scoop the lotion if you are having trouble. Every machine is slightly different, so read your instructions to ensure you are filling the tank correctly."

      "title": "Place a bowl underneath the filling tip to catch any spills.",
      "content": "Place a bowl underneath the filling tip to catch any spills. The filling tip is the thin metal tube where lotion is dispensed. Lotion can drip from the filling tip if you leave the hand lever in the down position for just a second or 2. To avoid this, simply place a bowl underneath the metal tip. Then, any extra drips will fall into the bowl and you can easily wash them away. [13] X Research source This way, lotion does not wind up on your bottles."

      "title": "Position the lotion bottle so the filling tip is slightly inside the opening.",
      "content": "Position the lotion bottle so the filling tip is slightly inside the opening. To pour your lotion into the bottles, hold the lotion bottle up to the filling tip, and place the lotion bottle around the tip. [14] X Research source This prevents the lotion from spraying as it comes out. In addition, it ensures you do not miss the tip of your bottle while filling it."

      "content": "Use the pull-down lever to start and stop the flow of lotion. Hold the lotion bottle in 1 hand. Then, pull down on the lever with the other hand to release your lotion from the machine. To stop the flow of lotion, move the lever back to the upwards position. [15] X Research source The lotion will come out quickly."

      "title": "Fill the bottle until you reach the top.",
      "content": "Fill the bottle until you reach the top. If you are filling a small bottle, 1 pump of the lever will likely fill your bottle. If your bottle is not completely full after 1 pump, then pull down on the lever again to release more product. Lift up on the handle when you reach the top to stop the lotion from dispensing. [16] X Research source After your bottle is full, continue filling all of your bottles."
