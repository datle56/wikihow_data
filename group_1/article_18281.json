      "content": "Twist your hair up along the back of your head. Lightly grasp the hair and twist it up along your head in the opposite direction that you swept it. For example, if you swept it to the right, twist it to the left. If you have longer hair, fold the twist over and tuck the ends of your hair under the twist. Then, tuck the ends into the tunnel created by the twist. If you don’t have enough hair to fold the twist over, tuck then ends under the twist along the back of your head, or leave them loose for a more casual look. When you’re done, the hair should form a downward-pointing cone."

[10] X Research source It’s okay to use bobby pins that don’t match your hair, but they may be more visible in the finished style. If your hair is thick or coarse, use larger bobby pins to hold it in place. The idea is to make the style messy, so don’t use a brush or hairspray to smooth your hair."

Remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect! Use two fingers to start the roll or make a small loop of hair near the end of your hair and secure it with a hair tie, then roll the hair around it.
