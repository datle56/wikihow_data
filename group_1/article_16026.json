      "content": "Get an Oval Stone. Oval Stones are evolution-inducing items that can be given to your Pokémon for them to hold. Once your Pokémon has an Oval Stone, leveling up at the right time will make the Pokémon evolve. To get an Oval Stone, simply walk around the areas where they are found. When your character walks on the correct square of floor (which is assigned at random), a message prompt with “Your character has found an Oval Stone\" will appear. Below, find the locations in each game where you can find Oval Stones: [1] X Research source Diamond/Pearl/Platinum: Lost Tower; the Underground; found on wild Happiny and Chansey Heart Gold/SoulSilver: Rock Tunnel; Bug Catching Contest (first prize); Amity Meadow; found on wild Chansey Black/White: Challenger's Cave; Black City shop B; during Dust Clouds; found on wild Happiny Black 2/White 2: Dust clouds inside the Relic Passage, Rebirth Mountain, and Clay Tunnel; White Forest X/Y: Unknown Dungeon (hidden on a rock to the left of Mewtwo); PokéMileage Club (balloon popping, level 2) Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire: Found on wild Happiny Sun/Moon: Paniola Ranch; \"Path for Brilliant-Stone Hunting!\" mission of Isle Aphun in Poké Pelago (available starting at Rank 2)"

      "content": "Wait for daytime to arrive. Happiny will only evolve into Chansey in the daytime. From the fourth generation of Pokémon games onward (which also happen to be the games that Happiny is available in), the in-game time is the same as the time on your device's clock (and thus the real-world time if your clock is accurate.) Note that the Pokémon definition for \"daytime\" varies from game to game. See below for more information on each generation's \"daytime\": [3] X Research source Generation IV (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver): 10:00 AM-7:59 PM Generation V (Black/White/Black 2/White 2): Spring: 10:00 AM-4:59 PM Summer: 9:00 AM-6:59 PM Autumn: 10:00 AM-5:59 PM Winter: 11:00 AM-4:59 PM Generation VI (X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire): 11:00 AM - 5:59 PM Generation VII (Sun/Moon): 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM (Sun), 6:00 PM - 6:00 AM (Moon, which takes place 12 hours ahead of your device's clock)"

      "title": "Give the Oval Stone to Happiny.",
      "content": "Give the Oval Stone to Happiny. Once you have an Oval Stone in your bag and a Happiny with you, you're all set! Start by opening your Bag and selecting the Oval Stone. Select “Give” from the small menu that pops up, then choose Happiny from your list of Pokémon. If you've done this right, message should appear on the screen telling you that Happiny is now holding the Oval Stone. Happiny will keep the Oval Stone until you give it something different or it evolves."

      "title": "Level Happiny up once.",
      "content": "Level Happiny up once. Now, get into battles with enemy Pokémon and start winning. The precise Pokémon you fight don't matter — they can be Pokémon you find in the wild or Pokémon from an enemy trainer. As long as you win, Happiny participates in the battle, and Happiny survives until the end of the fight, it will gain experience. If you're in an area with many difficult Pokémon and you don't want to risk having your low-level Happiny faint, you may want to use an Exp. Share item, which allows even Pokémon that don't participate in the battle to gain experience points. [4] X Research source Other things that can boost the rate of experience gain include having a high affection level in Pokémon Amie (Gen VI) or Pokémon Refresh (Gen VII) and having Pass Power (Gen V) or O-Power (Gen VI) active."

      "title": "Watch Happiny evolve.",
      "content": "Watch Happiny evolve. When you get Happiny enough experience points to level up, it should start to evolve immediately. Congratulations! You now have Chansey. Note that your Oval Stone will disappear after the evolution. Keep an eye on the clock as you get your Happiny experience points. If you battle long enough that your Happiny levels up during the night, it will not evolve into Chansey and you'll need to wait for daytime or adjust the clock and try again."
