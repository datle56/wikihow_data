      "content": "Choose the music you want to dance to if you’re allowed to pick. Depending on the strip club and its rules, you may or may not be allowed to choose your own music for your routine. If you are allowed, try choosing 1 fast-paced song and 1 slower song. This will give you a chance to catch your breath and avoid getting too worn out. [1] X Research source Check the strip club’s website or call to find out if you get to pick your own song or if they will just play something random. Make sure your song choice fits your personality, as well. For example, you wouldn’t choose a country song if you hate country music. Choosing a song with some sexy lyrics might help set the mood, too."

      "content": "Slowly take off your clothes during your routine. If you take everything off all at once, there will be no build-up or anticipation. Go slowly and take off one item about every 30 to 60 seconds. Wait until the last 30 to 60 seconds of your routine to remove the last item, such as your bra or panties if it’s a fully nude strip club. [2] X Research source Try teasing the audience by acting like you’re about to take off your bra. Slip 1 strap down, smile at them, and then pull it back up. Or, you could hook your fingers into the sides of your panties and move them down slightly, and then snap them back into place with a wink."

      "content": "Touch your body and walk seductively around the stage. Walking in a slow, exaggerated way can work well for a strip routine. Try strutting around the stage while caressing your hips and thighs, running your fingers through your hair, or moving your hands down the center of your body. [3] X Research source Make sure that you step in time with the music and move to the beat."

      "content": "Do a stripper squat dance move. Show off your legs and booty with this easy move. Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and slowly squat down as low as you comfortably can while moving your arms back and forth in front of you. Then, slowly come back up in the same way starting with your butt. Do this move while facing the audience to give them a full frontal view, facing the side to show off your profile, or with your back to them to show off your booty. You can also open and close your legs a few times while down in the squat position."

      "content": "Try the zigzag while lying on the stage. Lie down on your back and point your toes up toward the ceiling with your legs straight. Then, arch your back to lift it off the ground slightly. Bend your knees and slowly kick and scissor your legs back and forth while you touch your body and look at your audience. [4] X Research source Lock eyes with someone sitting near the stage to get their attention in an extra sexy way."

      "content": "Bend forward, touch your toes, and then stand up quickly. This attention-grabbing, snapping move is a great way to highlight your assets. Slowly bend down as if you’re going to pick something up off the ground, touch your toes (or your calves if that’s as far as you can reach), and then slide your hands up your body as you begin to rise. When you’re halfway up, whip your body straight up and throw your head back. [5] X Research source You may know this move as the “Bend and Snap” made famous by Legally Blonde ."

      "content": "Do a beginner pole dance trick, like the step around. Dancing on a pole may look easy, but it takes some practice to do it gracefully. If you can, practice tricks on a pole before you dance at an amateur night. The step around is the easiest move to master since you don’t have to lift your body weight onto the pole. Simply hold the pole with 1 hand while seductively stepping around it. Consider some of the following beginner moves as well: [6] X Research source Back hook: Hook 1 leg around the pole while holding it with both hands, then spin backward. Front hook: Hook 1 leg around the pole while holding it with both hands, then spin forward. Carousel: Face the pole and spin around it with both legs out straight. Cradle: Grasp the pole above and below your body and tuck your knees in toward your chest with your body cradling the pole."

      "content": "Combine a variety of dance moves and pole tricks. Create a pattern of moves that you can follow during your routine, or choose moves that match up with different parts of the music you’ll be dancing to. Practice these moves ahead of time so you have a cohesive routine when it’s time to perform. For example, during a quick part of the song, try a zigzag while lying down, stand up, do a pole trick, and then take off your top. During a slower part of the song, walk in slow motion, seductively bend over, do a stripper squat, and then remove your skirt."

These colors are scientifically perceived as more attractive by men and women, so it’s a great way to make yourself stand out no matter who your audience is!

      "content": "Select items that will be easy to undo onstage. If you’re starting out fully clothed and removing the items during your routine, you need to be able to take them off while moving and dancing. Opt for pieces that you can undo with 1 hand and easily pull off. If they’re too hard to remove, it will be difficult to take them off during your routine. [8] X Research source For example, instead of zippers and buttons, go with items that have snaps and hook-and-loop fastener closures."

      "content": "Wear non-slip shoes that you can easily walk in. Falling in the middle of your routine won’t be fun for you, and it may affect your chances of taking home the prize money. Make sure you select a pair of shoes that are comfortable and make you feel sexy. Try high heels, boots, or whatever type of shoe you want. Look for shoes that are labeled non-slip. These usually have rubber bottoms that will provide extra traction on stage. If you buy new shoes for the occasion, make sure you break them in beforehand. You don’t want to get blisters!"

You know what hairstyle and makeup looks work best for you, but a few simple strategies may help you stand out from the crowd. Some things you might want to try on the night of your dance routine include: [10] X Research source Wearing fake eyelashes to make your eyes appear larger, which most men find sexy. Opting for red lipstick to draw attention to your lips. Having noticeable lips can help when the judges think back on your routine. Styling your hair loose and wavy so it looks like you just rolled out of bed. This creates a sexy, tousled look. Getting a manicure and pedicure. Apply a bright-colored or sparkly polish to your fingers and toes for an eye-catching detail. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a unique, attention-grabbing stage name. It’s best to avoid generic stripper names, such as Diamond, Star, Candy, and Hennessey. Instead, opt for a sexy stage name that sounds like it could be your real name. This will help protect your privacy and make customers less likely to ask for your real name (which you shouldn’t use). [12] X Research source For example, if you want a name that starts with an “O,” consider going with Olivia, Onyx, or Opal. If you want something that starts with an “R,” try Rachel, Rosa, or Ruby."

      "content": "Smile and have fun while you’re dancing. Looking bored or unhappy during your routine is the least sexy thing you can do. Make sure to smile while you dance so everyone can see you’re having a great time. This will increase your chances of winning and make you seem a lot more confident. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you forget to smile sometimes, try putting a thin layer of petroleum jelly on your teeth before you go on stage. This will help you remember to smile, add shine to your teeth, and help prevent getting lipstick on your teeth."

For example, try ending your routine with a carousel on the pole or do a bend and snap right as the music ends."
