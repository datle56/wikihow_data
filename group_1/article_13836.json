Tie it into a ponytail. Because you will be working with multiple ponytails and it can get a bit confusing, this will be referred to as Ponytail #1. [1] X Research source"

Clip your ponytail here so that you can work with the rest of your hair without it getting in the way. [2] X Research source"

Pull Ponytail #2 straight through the two sections of Ponytail #1 so that it’s going toward your face. Just like you did with Ponytail #1, secure Ponytail #2 toward your face with a hair clip so that it is out of the way. [4] X Research source"

Take Ponytail #3 up through those two sections and clip it forwards again. Now, you will probably start seeing the pattern you use to create this “braid.” [5] X Research source"

After you’ve “braided” to the nape of your neck and secured your hair into low ponytails, you want to go back and create the volume that makes this braid so big.

After you’ve tugged and fluffed the loops so that you’re satisfied with how they look, it can be helpful to secure them a bit with some hairspray.

You will be finishing the tail of your braid using the same method you used for the beginning of your braid. Pull the lower ponytail through the two sections of the upper ponytail, clipping it out of the way. [10] X Research source Clip your lower ponytail carefully so you don’t mess up the section of your braid that is already completed.
