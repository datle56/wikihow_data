      "content": "Organize your tasks. You’ll feel more in control if you know what needs to be done and when. Start your list early so you can complete some things that can be done ahead of time. [1] X Expert Source Jennifer Guttman, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 26 July 2021. Don’t rush through your tasks, even though it may seem like you have a million things to do. Complete one task at a time, and be sure to give it your full attention. Prioritize what needs to get done, be it catching up on work at the office so you can spend time with your family or reading that book your teacher assigned over the break. Some tasks may be able to wait or may not even need to be done at all, like folding your napkins into swans for your holiday dinner, or sending out personalized holiday messages to everyone on each of your social media accounts."

      "content": "Ask for help. Don’t feel as though you have to do everything yourself. If you are having difficulty finding time to clean your home before a party, decorate that Christmas tree, or get cash from the bank to stuff red envelopes for the Chinese New Year, ask your family or friends for help. They’ll likely appreciate contributing to the holiday joy."

      "title": "Make a budget.",
      "content": "Make a budget. Financial worries are often one of the biggest holiday stressors. Making a budget and sticking to it can help reduce some of your anxiety. Keep in mind that you don’t need to make a 10-course meal or purchase designer gifts for everyone on your list to have a happy holiday. Consider making your own gifts to save some money. There are tons of unique ideas that people will love to receive. Homemade decorations are also a great way to cut down on costs. They are also fun to make and could be a nice way to get the whole family involved. You could have a potluck dinner instead of preparing everything yourself. Not only will this reduce the cost and workload, but it will also ensure your table is filled with a variety of dishes so there will be something everyone loves."
