In the US, Canada, Latin America, the UK, Switzerland, and the EEA, Nintendo will replace or repair Joy-Cons with drift for free, even if the Joy-Cons are no longer under warranty. Note that if Nintendo can't fix your Joy-Cons, they will replace them, and they cannot guarantee an exact color replacement. If you have special or limited edition Joy-Cons, you may want to try and fix them at home. Go to the support page for your region and follow the on-screen instructions to request your free Joy-Con repair: US and Canada Latin America UK, Switzerland, & EEA If you live in a different region and your Joy-Cons are still under warranty, you still might be able to get them replaced for free. Go to the Nintendo support page for your region for more information. Nintendo may refuse to repair or replace your Joy-Cons for free if the damage was caused by a third-party accessory, a modification to the Joy-Con, or negligence, or if the controller's serial number was removed."

This will cause the can to spray propellant instead of air, and the cold shock from the propellant boiling off may damage your Joy-Con. If you accidentally spray propellant into your Joy-Cons, remove the nozzle of compressed air and allow the Joy-Con to sit for a few moments before trying to use it again. Avoid getting the propellant on your skin, as it could cause mild frostbite. If the can of compressed air gets too cold to touch, set it down and allow the can to come to room temperature before using it again to avoid cold burns."
