      "title": "Missing or inaccurate LEGO logo",
      "content": "Missing or inaccurate LEGO logo Almost every LEGO piece (except the smallest ones) is stamped with the signature LEGO logo in its slanted, capitalized font. You can usually find it on top of the studs, which are the round protrusions that stick out of the top of most LEGO bricks and minifigure heads. If the logo is missing, the piece is most likely fake. And if it's present, it may be misaligned, misspelled, or isn't stamped in the same distinctive font. [1] X Research source On flat pieces, the logo is located on the underside."

      "title": "Poorly designed packaging",
      "content": "Poorly designed packaging The packaging for a real LEGO set is carefully and tastefully designed. On every box or package, you'll find the official LEGO logo and the brand partner's logo (i.e., Star Wars , Disney , or Marvel ). You'll also see key details about the set itself, like the number of pieces in it and the set number. Bootleg LEGO packaging is often missing some or all of these details and has major spelling errors (like \" Star Wnrs \" instead of \" Star Wars \"). [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Inconsistent sizing",
      "content": "Inconsistent sizing LEGO's precise manufacturing process makes pieces that fit together easily in any design you want. Counterfeit LEGO manufacturers aren't as good at precision. Not only do they use cheaper factories to make their pieces, but they don't have access to LEGO's size blueprints. So if you buy a set and some or a lot of the pieces don't fit with any of your real LEGO bricks (or even with each other), that's a big sign the set is fake. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Misprinted and poorly designed minifigures",
      "content": "Misprinted and poorly designed minifigures On fake minifigures, the colors and designs printed on the torso, arms, and legs, may be misaligned, faded, or look completely different than the original. The minifigure may not even resemble a real LEGO! [4] X Research source It might, for example, be bigger than the standard 4 cm (1.6 in) or come with two legs you have to assemble instead of one unified piece. [5] X Research source Authentic LEGO minifigures come with a torso already pre-assembled with its arms. The legs (which are all one piece), head, and sometimes a plastic wig or a hat must attached to the torso to complete the build. Finally, their bodies are either printed or painted with unique clothing designs and vibrant colors. Fake LEGO minifigures (and other LEGO pieces) are usually easy to identify when you see them side-by-side with their authentic counterparts. If you don't own a piece to compare it with, search for an image of the original online."

      "title": "Flashing",
      "content": "Flashing LEGO bricks are made by forcing extremely hot plastic into a mold in a process called injection molding. [6] X Research source After the pieces harden, they're sanded to remove any excess plastic – called flashing – that isn't part of the LEGO piece's design. [7] X Research source The cheap factories counterfeiters use don't take as much care to make their knockoff LEGO pieces look clean and refined. For that reason, they may have rough edges and plastic protrusions. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Custom pieces or designs Even if a \"LEGO\" piece looks high-quality, clean, and colorful, it may still not be an original LEGO design! LEGO manufactures thousands of uniquely shaped pieces and minifigure designs, but there are many more they don't make. Counterfeit LEGO sets – even the 1:1 copies, like the sets made by the Chinese brand Lepin – can contain pieces that LEGO simply doesn't have in their catalog. Their presence is a huge red flag that your set isn't the real thing."

      "content": "Low prices LEGO sets are made with a premium quality that you can usually only buy at a premium price (except for rare instances when they go on clearance). So if you found a LEGO set – especially a new one – for an extremely low price, you may have just bought yourself a counterfeit. If you think to yourself, \"The cost of this LEGO set is too good to be true!\" it probably is!"

      "content": "Non-brand advertising Bootleg LEGO sets may use similar packaging and product designs to the genuine brand, but their advertising can be a clue that they're not real LEGO. Look at the packaging or its advertisement for phrases like \"Non-brand\" or \"Compatible with LEGO.\" Real LEGO pieces don't fit with any other brand's building blocks, so don't be fooled by these claims."

      "content": "Secondhand LEGO retailers Websites like BrickLink and Brickify are online marketplaces where LEGO enthusiasts buy, sell , and trade their secondhand LEGO sets. You can even use these sites to find rare minifigures or individual pieces your set is missing. While sellers aren't supposed to list fake pieces, though, it can happen. Use your best judgment when looking at a listing to make sure it looks and sounds real. eBay can be another legitimate resource for buying secondhand used and unopened LEGO sets. Just avoid listings where the seller has a low rating, a no-return policy, or only uses stock images to show the product."

An investigation revealed that the counterfeit LEGO manufacturer, Shantou Meizhi Model Co – under the brand name Lepin – used LEGO blueprints to design imitation playsets.

Lepin, for example, copied LEGO's blueprints, meaning they violated the toy brand's intellectual property rights. Legal knockoff brands may look similar to LEGO, but they don't directly copy their designs brick by brick."
