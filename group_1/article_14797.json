      "content": "Make sure you have a pretty good idea of the style you want to achieve. Print out pictures from the Internet and cut out images from magazines of looks you like, and use these images as a starting point. Paste them to your wall, or create a little fashion notebook and put them in there."

      "content": "You may be able to pair some of your current clothes with a few new items. Get rid of anything that you don't feel flatters you, that you dislike, that you find uncomfortable, or that doesn't fit with the new look you're going for. Keep an eye out for things that could be altered to fit your new style, and hang onto these items."

      "content": "Make sure you have enough outfits for all seasons and occasions. An alternative style often includes long-sleeved, plaid flannel shirts, T-shirts of classic bands, black tights, dark or acid wash jeans or shorts, vintage button-down shirts, and cardigans. For shoes, you can opt for Converse, classic boots, combat boots, or any other footwear you like. Keep an eye out for studded clothing and accessories, and make sure to pick up a few dressy outfits for any formal events you may need to attend."

      "content": "There are lots of places you can shop to find clothes that fit your style. You can check out mainstream stores such as Kohl's, Gap, JCPenney, and even Macy's to see if you can find anything that catches your eye. These are good places to get the basics. Next, try some stores that fit a more \"alternative\" type of aesthetic. Hot Topic, for example, is known for having good band tees and accessories, but be warned: many alternative people shop there, so you might not get a \"one-of-a-kind\" look unless it is very unpopular in your area. Zumiez, Journey's, and even Claire's are all good places to shop, as well. Shop at thrift stores for old-fashioned, vintage, or cheaper clothing. Don't be afraid to shop in unusual places or places that don't look like they'd have any potential; it's easy to miss a needle in a haystack."

      "content": "There are a lot of great websites that sell alternative accessories and clothing. Many of these sites also have fairly low prices. Good options include bluebanana.com, shanalogic.com, restyle.pl/, and shopplasticland.com. Be careful when shopping online; since you can't try on clothes, you'll have to pay extra special attention to sizing charts and customer reviews. One brand's size large may fit like a medium in another brand."

      "content": "There are lots of hairstyles that work with an alternative aesthetic. You can have short and punkish hair, long and flowing hair, cute and wavy hair; whatever you want. Learn how to dye your hair, or go to a friend or hairdresser, and maybe dye your hair different colors. You can make it all black, two-toned, rainbow, whatever floats your boat. Curl it, crimp it, iron it, scrunch it, braid it; do whatever you think looks best."

      "content": "Be as creative and out-there as you want! Don't be afraid to wear something you would think would never match; it may look really good. Have a friend who wears similar styles help you decide whether they look good or not. Some good examples would include: a ripped up tee, skinny jeans, any shoes a long-sleeve shirt, skirt, Doc Martens a simple tee, long skirt, \"goth boots\" plain tee, ripped up jeans, any shoes alternative dress, Doc Martens (depending on the style of the dress) tee with a vest, shorts, any shoes layers upon layers of different clothing"

      "content": "These finishing touches can elevate your look. While there is no typical alternative hairstyle, many people opt for thick, sweeping bangs over one eye or a high ponytail with studded hair accessories. Alternative makeup usually includes heavy eyeliner, smoky or cat eyes, and red lipstick, but it's all about expressing yourself and feeling comfortable, so go with whatever you like best!"
