      "content": "Set realistic goals for yourself. By making a list of your goals, whether it simply be losing five pounds or being able to run a mile under a certain time, having your goals written out may help you stick to them long-term. Write your goals down, and keep them in plain sight so you are reminded about what all your hard work is going toward each day. Be as specific as possible. Instead of just saying \"lose weight,\" say \"lose X pounds by December.\" Make sure your goals are realistic and timely. You may need to make multiple goals until you reach a larger, more long-term goal. Keep track of your progress towards your goals in a journal or a sheet of paper you tack to the fridge. Seeing how far you've come may help keep you motivated and working harder to achieve your long-term goals."

The prescribed calorie deficit ranges from 500–750 each day. This amount will be different for everyone based on how many calories you are currently eating and how fast you want to reach your weight goals. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It's not wise to cut too many calories or eat less than about 1,200 calories daily. If you do not eat enough (especially if you're working out) you're more likely to lose lean muscle mass rather than fat. You may need to test out a few different calorie levels until you find the right balance for your body, lifestyle, and activity levels. For example, if you notice you're not losing weight at all, you may need to eat fewer calories daily. If you're feeling tired, fatigued, or notice your athletic performance is suffering, you may not be eating enough."

      "content": "Consult with your doctor. Talk with your physician or a registered dietitian for advice on how to lose weight and build lean muscle mass. They can tell you more about exercise plans, diet plans, and give you warnings about any health issues which might arise. If you have a heart condition, asthma, or any other health conditions you feel may inhibit your ability to lose weight, consult with your doctor immediately. Beware of any “professional” trying to sell you supplements. Especially if those supplements come in a powder form. Doctors and dietitians will usually prefer a healthy diet and lots of exercise, as supplements are largely unproven and poorly studied."

      "content": "Set up a weekly plan. When you're starting a new diet or exercise plan, it may be helpful to keep a weekly plan or log somewhat like a \"to-do\" list. Keep a notebook or journal with your weekly plans. Write out each day of the week and include what exercises you'll be doing that day, what meals and snacks you're eating and even what progress you've made on your goals. Weekly meal and exercise plans can be a great component to your diet. They've been shown to help keep you on track and organized throughout the week. An example of one day of your plan might be: Morning workout: 30 minute jog and 20 minutes of yoga ; Breakfast: greek yogurt with fruit; Lunch: spinach salad with grilled salmon; Snack: two hard boiled eggs; Dinner: grilled chicken with quinoa and steamed vegetables."

Be aware that running is a high impact exercise that can be hard on the knees and other joints. If you have previously had a knee injury, running may not be the best option for you."
