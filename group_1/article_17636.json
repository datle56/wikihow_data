      "content": "Gently pry up the jammed key. Use a screwdriver or other flat instrument to get under the key, and pull up slightly on one of the edges. You can also use your nail. If you are working on a laptop (whether PC or Mac), the key is held in place by a flimsy plastic clip, which also serves as the spring. The keys are attached in slightly different ways on each type of keyboard, so removing them will be different on each type. If you're unsure if or how your laptop keys come off, consult your manual. Mechanical keyboards should not be fixed by prying at the keys. Most keyboards include a key puller that will remove individual key caps off of the keyboard. Don't remove all the keys at once, as you may have trouble remembering where they all go. Try to remove only a few at a time."
