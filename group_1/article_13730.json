      "content": "Avoid ruining your curl pattern. If you're happy with your curls the way they are, be careful whenever you put your hair up. Don't stretch out your hair by putting it into a too-tight bun. The easiest way to prevent damaging your beautifully curly locks is to simply not pull back your hair too hard when putting it up. Low buns not only look especially great with curly hair, [1] X Research source but they are also worn much looser than a high topknot or ballerina bun."

Secure it in place with a bobby pin. Remember to keep it loose to avoid damaging your curls. Don't twist it too tightly. [3] X Research source You could also do a 2-strand twist or a 3-strand braid instead of 1 coil."

      "title": "Secure everything in place with a few bobby pins.",
      "content": "Secure everything in place with a few bobby pins. Slide in a few bobby pins through the braid, the bun, and the bun's base to keep it firmly in place. How many you'll need will depend on how much hair you have to secure and how well your hair holds a style. If your hair is prone to frizzing, consider using an anti-frizz hairspray. [4] X Research source Select bobby pins that are the same color as your hair so they don’t stand out."

      "content": "Add a braid for an elegant look. If you want to include a braid in your curly bun, you will need to section your hair before putting it up into a ponytail. Using both hands, gather your hair into 2 separate sections with one strand to your left and one to your right. Put the right section up into a bun as normal. Make sure the left section is thick enough to braid. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Braid the left section. Take the free remaining hair and make it into a simple braid . Don't braid too tightly, as this may damage your curls and create a braid that is too stiff to use as a wrap. To create a simple braid: Separate the left section further into 3 equal strands. Cross the left section over the middle section. Cross the right over what was originally the left section. What was originally the middle section will now be on the left. Cross that over the current middle section (originally the one at the right). Do the same with what is now the right strand. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the hair section. Secure the tip with a hair elastic."

Preheat your curling iron, then wrap each section of hair around the curling iron for 10 to 15 seconds. Each hair section should be small enough so that you can wrap it around the wand without much hair overlapping. Try spraying the ends with a light-hold hairspray before curling for added lift.

While it's generally better to work with clean hair, a bun can disguise hair that's a little greasy."

Position the base of your ponytail so that it is at your back, sitting either at the top of your head (a high ponytail) or a little further down towards the nape of your neck (a medium ponytail). To get the perfect ponytail: If you have bangs, pin them to the side for now. You don't want to accidentally put them up into the ponytail. Gather the rest of your hair with both hands, sweeping it backwards. Hold the gathered hair with 1 hand and use the other to collect any hair strands that you missed and add them to the main ponytail. Secure the ponytail in place with a hair tie."

      "content": "Select a small section of hair to make your first curl. Select a strand of any size from your ponytail. If your hair is short, you’ll need to create more curls. Keep in mind that the amount of hair you choose will determine how many individual curls you'll have at the end. For example, if you select roughly 1/8 of your hair, you will end up with 8 total twists. Doing a twisty curl with all of your hair at once is one way to create a chignon hairstyle. To make each twisty curl: While gripping its tip, gently twist the strand of hair until its full length is tightly wound. Use both hands if necessary. Do not use too much force and stop if you feel any pain. You don't want to accidentally pull out your hair or damage its roots. After your hair is fully coiled, keep on twisting it. The strand will eventually begin to bunch up in a spiral towards the base of your ponytail. If your hair doesn't bunch up when completely spiraled, wrap the strand around itself at the base instead."
