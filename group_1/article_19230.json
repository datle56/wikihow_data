PSA grades on a scale of 1–10, where 1 is the worst and 10 is perfect mint condition. PSA will inspect your card for any marks, misprints, defects, or damage. [1] X Research source How much does it cost?: PSA grading starts around $25 USD per card for ones that are valued lower than $499 USD. If you want a quicker turnaround time or have a higher-valued card, it can cost $75 USD or more per card. You’ll be charged once PSA processes your Pokémon cards. If you want to get 20 or more Pokémon cards graded at the same time, choose the Bulk Grading option that’s $15 USD per card instead."
