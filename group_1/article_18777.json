The most common way to do so is by doing the initial part of the Thieves Guild quest, and then selling your items to Tonilia at the Ragged Flagon. If you haven't found a vendor yet, you can still steal gold coins. They won't be marked as stolen items in your inventory. If you steal crafting items (such as ingots) and make other items with them, the final item won't be marked as stolen."

Do not fast travel. Instead, walk everywhere. You will run into tons of animals whose pelts you can take. Make sure to craft your pelts. Use the tanning racks to turn the pelts into leather; craft the leather into leather helmets at the forge; improve the leather helmets at the crafting table.
