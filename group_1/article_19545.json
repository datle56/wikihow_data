      "content": "Know what you want. It’s not enough that your sister or your best friend spilled you a litany testifying to the wrinkle smoothing effect of a treatment they got from some clinic in your local downtown area. Don’t allow yourself to be talked into any procedure. Think about what results you want. Ask yourself if you honestly feel that you need to undergo a procedure to be happier and to feel more beautiful. Some people need that extra boost for their confidence while the rest are confidently beautiful in their own, raw skin."

      "content": "Set realistic targets. Any procedure can only enhance your skin so much but not be able to completely bring back your 20-something-year-old skin. In fact, the more you push back, the more artificial you’ll end up looking. Getting a procedure is like getting a natural makeup done only it stays on longer. That means, less will give you more. You can’t fight all your aging skin issues all at once or you’ll risk looking less like yourself — and you don’t want that. Here are questions that you should be asking yourself before making a go or no-go decision: What procedures do you find acceptable? In general, skin enhancement procedures fall under three categories: non-invasive, minimally invasive, and invasive. The first and second will give you subtle improvements over several sessions and may entail minimal to no downtime. The third category will give you drastic changes to your appearance and will require you to be rested for several days depending on the intensity of the procedure. What resources are you willing to give for this procedure? Skin enhancement procedures do not come cheap. You have to examine your budget relative to the options that you are looking at. Remember that many of these procedures require several treatment sessions before you can see any visible improvements to your skin, and that also requires you to set aside time to get follow up procedures in the long run."

Apply primer: This step is optional but it is highly recommended when you know you will need your makeup to stay on for longer. Add highlighter to your nasolabial folds: Tilt your face down as you perform this step looking into the mirror so you can see where the shadows appear. Use a fine tipped or slim concealer brush to dot the product under the fold where the shadows are showing. This will help lift this sunken area forward. For this step, use a concealer that is one shade lighter than your natural skin tone. Use a medium sized dome brush to blend the product: Take not to brush along the fold. Rather, you should brush underneath. Push up the product to tuck it against the fold, essentially making the shadows fade and bringing the fold forward to give you a smoother surface texture. Layer with a foundation in your natural skin tone: Apply the product evenly across your face with a broad brush. Use a contouring powder: Get more lifting power by contouring your cheek area and jawline. This will help make the hollow part of your nasolabial folds appear higher and firmer. Put on a little blush: Give your look a radiant finish with a little blush on the cheek. This technique makes your skin appear even firmer by guiding the onlooker’s eyes to focus more on your cheekbones."
