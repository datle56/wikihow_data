      "title": "Take a moment to cool down.",
      "content": "Take a moment to cool down. You can’t expect to resolve an argument immediately after it occurs. In the wake of a disagreement, take some time to cool down. Take a few hours, even a few days, to process your emotions properly. Take a long walk, go see a friend, watch a movie. Engage in relaxing activities until you've calmed down enough to look at the situation objectively. [1] X Research source Don’t use you or your girlfriend’s frustration to completely shelf the argument. Leaving conflict unresolved can build resentment and lead to the relationship’s downfall. [2] X Research source Clinical Psychologist Dr. Liana Georgoulis says it’s important to “Recognize when you yourself are becoming flooded with emotion or engaging in problematic communication patterns and instead call a time-out for yourself in which you practice coping statements and deep breathing techniques.” If you need a break but your partner objects, they may be trying to use you to self-soothe. You may not have the capacity to help, though. To de-escalate, hug or compliment your partner and explain that you need time to process things. Don't: storm off without saying anything. Do: say \"I'm upset and need some time to cool down. Can we talk about this tomorrow?\""

      "content": "Analyze what caused the fight. Fights rarely happen over nothing. Take some time to think about what caused the fight and whether there’s anything you could have done differently in the situation. Think about what led up to this. Why did you start fighting? What triggered the argument? What was said? Do you regret anything you said? Why or why not? [3] X Research source Memory is subjective, especially in stressful situations. [4] X Research source She may remember certain aspects of the fight differently than you. This is normal and doesn't necessarily mean one of you is lying."

      "title": "Acknowledge your feelings about the situation.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your feelings about the situation. After an argument, you need to accept and experience your feelings. While we may dislike emotions like anger and sadness, it's important to acknowledge them rather than ignore them. Stifling your feelings can cause an explosion down the road. Accept that emotions aren’t always rational. If your girlfriend hurt your feelings, for example, logically knowing she didn’t mean to might not help you let it go. Know that you and your girlfriend are both entitled to an emotional response to a disagreement, even if the response isn’t entirely logical. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make time to talk about the problem.",
      "content": "Make time to talk about the problem. After you both have calmed down, suggest a time to discuss your conflict. After a big argument, it's important you schedule time to talk to assure you are both calm going into the discussion. [6] X Research source Georgoulis says “If people are not carving out times to discuss issues in their relationships, then fights and arguments are more likely to happen.” Choose a time to talk that works for everyone. Pick a day when neither one of you has to work early in the morning. Aim to talk soon after dinner so you aren’t hungry or sleepy. [7] X Research source If you don’t live together, go somewhere neutral. While you might feel odd discussing your relationship in public, a neutral ground can assure no one feels uncomfortable. Pick a quiet place without many people, like a coffee shop. [8] X Research source Don’t come into the conversation under the influence. Using substances may ease your nerves, but you won’t be able to pay full attention to your partner and what’s upsetting them."

      "content": "Use open body language. When discussing your conflict, use your body language to demonstrate that you are open to dialogue. Face your partner with uncrossed arms when they are speaking to show that you’re listening without judgment. This can encourage relaxed, effective discussion. [9] X Research source Make eye contact. Nod occasionally to show you are listening. [10] X Research source Never cross your arms or do anything that makes you look tense. Try to avoid nervous tics, like fiddling with your clothing or wringing your hands.

      "title": "Use good verbal communication skills.",
      "content": "Use good verbal communication skills. Your girlfriend needs to know you are open to working things out, so make sure you communicate with her effectively in the aftermath of a fight. Be clear and concise when speaking, don’t include too many details and get to the point of what you're going to say. Do not interrupt your girlfriend when she's talking. Always ask if she understands what you're saying. Ask for clarification if she says anything you do not understand. [12] X Research source Use \"I\" statements . These assure that you're expressing your own feelings rather than placing objective judgment on the situation. Instead of saying \"You overreacted about me being late and embarrassed me in front of your friends\" say something like \"I felt embarrassed when you called me out on being late in front of your friends.\" [13] X Research source Clinical Psychologist Dr. Gera Anderson, says that if your partner asks questions, “View it as them trying to get or understand what you are communicating. In some instances, usually during conflict, you may have to repeat your statement in a harder tone or with louder volume.” Don't: shout \"How could you do this?!\" Do: say \"I'm angry because you broke the promise you made yesterday.\""

      "title": "Validate your girlfriend's feelings.",
      "content": "Validate your girlfriend's feelings. It can be very frustrating to feel like your feelings aren’t being validated in a romantic relationship. Even if you don’t agree with your girlfriend's perspective, make sure you strive to make her feel that her feelings are valid by acknowledging that she has a right to feel how she feels without judging her. To defuse an argument while validating your girlfriend’s feelings, Georgoulis says to say something like “I want to try and understand your perspective, would you mind being a bit calmer or gentler?” When validating your girlfriend’s feelings, make sure you actively listen to her and let her know that you understand how she feels. An apology goes a long way when validating feelings. If you’ve done something to upset her, apologizing can make her feel seen and heard. Often, the simple act of allowing someone to feel the way they do removes a lot of tension from a situation. It releases pent-up negative energy and will make your girlfriend feel like you genuinely care about making her happy. Don't: say \"I'm sorry you feel that way, but it was just a harmless joke.\" Do: say \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I'm sorry I made you upset.\""

      "title": "Figure out where you disagree.",
      "content": "Figure out where you disagree. Most couples will have a few issues they can’t agree on. This is normal, as humans are unique. Take an argument as an opportunity to figure out where you two differ and how you can reconcile these differences. If you have different expectations regarding time together, the relationship as a whole, or lifestyle choices, it's important to identify them and find a solution. See if you can figure out if there's an underlying issue that drove your argument. If you had a big argument, it's doubtful it was over a minor matter. Try and figure out where you disagree and what you can do to reconcile the disagreement. Sometimes simply acknowledging that you feel differently about a subject can help ease tensions. The two of you will end up taking certain things less personally if you understand where you differ personality-wise.

This gives you both time to cool off and figure out how you want to proceed without having your decision clouded by anger and other feelings. [21] X Research source The 3-day rule doesn’t work for everyone. Some people take longer to process their emotions and others process them quicker. If you want to practice the rule with your girlfriend, make sure you both agree on how long you’ll be away from each other."

If you start arguments with the phrase “You always do…,” that’s not a good sign, as it can come off as rude and aggressive. Instead, say something like “I’m upset. I had a bad day and I’m not in the state to cook tonight. Do you mind making dinner?” Don’t abuse your requests. If your girlfriend is always the one to make dinner, offer to take over every now and then, even if you’re upset."

But if you’re always arguing about the bigger things, like where to live, whether or not to have kids, drug use, or family dynamics, that might be a sign to call it quits. If you find that your core values and needs aren’t being met, express that to your girlfriend. If they’re still unable to meet them, that may be a sign that you two aren’t compatible.
