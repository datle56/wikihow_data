You'll soon be the person who he thinks of as always making him happy, and it will lead to plenty of alone time. Make time to fit into his schedule. You may have to sacrifice some time. Listening to his issues is key. See if he’s having issues in any classes. Ask if he’d like to study or do classwork together."

Help him to see the friendship could be something deeper. Generally, flirting is done via body language, gestures, posture, or verbalization. If you are sitting next to each other, flirt with your eyes. Look him in the eyes and smile. Keep eye contact for a bit longer than normal. Mimic his body movement. Lean closer when he leans in. Smile when he smiles. Lick your lips. If you see him looking at your lips, lick them nonchalantly. Don’t do this a lot. You want to be somewhat suggestive, not compulsive. When you catch him looking at you, smile a little and look down. Then look back up at him, smiling coquettishly the entire time. [5] X Research source Play with your hair.

If he comes in for a hug, invite it happily, and be sure he’s the first one to let go. Play with his hair. When you see a strand or two out of place, reach up and gently swipe them.

Even shy guys will open up when they know you like them. Grab his hand when you’re walking next to one another. Ask him to help with something with which you obviously don’t need help. If it’s simple, he’ll pick up on the fact that you’re just making up a reason for him to see you. While in his presence say, “I wish I could find a boyfriend.” Tell him about a pretend dream where you two were dating. Do not be overly intimate before he makes a move.

Make sly comments about how you two look would look good as a couple. Definitely do not mention anything about marriage. Do not say, “I love you.” To someone who hasn’t even made the first move, this will not be received well."
