      "title": "Apply a heating pad to your lower abdomen for 20 minutes before bed.",
      "content": "Apply a heating pad to your lower abdomen for 20 minutes before bed. Set a heating pad to medium or low heat and place it on your lower belly for 20 minutes before you go to sleep. You can even sleep with it on your stomach if you like, just be sure to set it to low so you don't get too hot. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Heat helps relax your muscles, easing painful cramps so you can sleep pain-free. If your heating pad has a timer or automatic \"off\" feature, use that so it'll go off after an hour or two. That way, you won’t wake up in a sweat. If you don't have a heating pad, you can also put a small, damp towel in the microwave for 30 to 60 seconds and lay it over your stomach. Just make sure it’s not too hot so you don’t burn your skin. If it is, fan it out for 1 minute."

      "content": "Take OTC pain medication 45 minutes before going to bed. Swallow 2 capsules of ibuprofen or acetaminophen with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water about 45 minutes before you lie down to go to bed. If your cramps are mild, you can probably just take 1 to get you through the night. [3] X Expert Source Aimee Eyvazzadeh, MD, MA OB/GYN & Fertility Specialist Expert Interview. 24 March 2020. Always follow the dosing directions and heed the listed warnings on the package. Don’t take OTC pain medicine if you take blood thinners—talk to your doctor about alternatives."

For your back, place your hands behind you and use your thumbs to apply pressure to the area just above your butt and around your lower spine. [4] X Research source You can also place a tennis ball between your back and a wall and shift your positioning to break up knots and massage hard-to-reach spots.

      "content": "Try the seated butterfly stretch to relax your pelvis and hip muscles. Sit down with your legs open and your knees bent, the soles of your feet touching. Press your feet together as you lower your chest towards your toes. Breathe in and out at least 5 times to help you relax into the stretch. [6] X Research source You can also place your hands on your knees and push down while you’re sitting upright to stretch your inner hip and thigh abductors. After the stretch, try flapping your knees up and down like butterfly wings to loosen up your pelvis muscles even more. For a deeper stretch while you’re leaning over, use your elbows to push your knees toward the floor."

Slowly breathe in and out as you rotate your hips and pelvis in a circular motion. Do 5 to 10 clockwise circles followed by 5 to 8 counter-clockwise rotations. [8] X Research source Your back should slightly rise up and down as you rotate your hips. Go slow and try to coordinate your breathe with your movements (that is, inhaling when your pelvis is tilted upwards and exhaling when your pelvis is tucked in and your back is arched)."

Let your arms relax perpendicular to your torso. Inhale and as you exhale, slowly move your knees to one side as far as you can go. Inhale once you come back to the center and repeat the movement on the other side. [9] X Research source The soles of your feet will come off the ground as you twist. Don’t focus on pushing your knees toward the ground. Be gentle with yourself; go as far as you can and stop if you feel any discomfort."

      "content": "Try to get 310 to 320 mg of magnesium every day. Green leafy vegetables (like kale and spinach), bananas, raspberries, legumes, cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage), and fish (like salmon, mackerel, and tuna) are all good things to eat before and during your period to keep cramping to a minimum. If you're worried you're not getting enough from your diet alone, talk to your doctor about taking a magnesium supplement. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It’s easy to get magnesium from eating greens at every meal—just one cup of spinach contains 157 mg.

[11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Animal-based sources of B6 include milk, cheese, salmon, tuna, eggs, chicken liver, and beef.
