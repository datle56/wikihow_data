      "content": "Stock up on face painting brushes and sponges. Use round, thin tip brushes for smaller details and flat, wide brushes for larger details. Have at least three brushes of each size in your face painting kit; one for black paint, one for white paint, and one for color paint. Having different brushes for different colors will prevent the colors from mixing."

      "content": "Don’t forget the glitter. Buy non-toxic, cosmetic-grade glitter from the craft store and add it to your face painting kit. Add glitter over paint to make it shimmer and pop. Make sure you use cosmetic-grade glitter. Cosmetic-grade glitter won’t hurt if it gets in someone’s eye."

      "content": "Use a photo as a reference. Don’t be afraid to look at the photo every once in a while to make sure you’re painting the design right. If you don’t have any printed photos available, look one up online using your smartphone. Search something like “lion face paint” or “butterfly face painting design.”"

      "title": "Add the base of your design with a sponge.",
      "content": "Add the base of your design with a sponge. Dip the tip of your sponge in water. Don’t soak the sponge, you only want there to be a few drops of water on it. Rub the wet corner of the sponge onto the color paint you want to use, rubbing in circular motions. Gently dab the tip of the sponge onto the person’s face to apply the color. [4] X Research source If the color isn’t vibrant enough, add more water and paint to the tip of the sponge."

      "title": "Add a second color to the base for a more intricate design.",
      "content": "Add a second color to the base for a more intricate design. Use a different sponge or clean off the sponge you used to apply the first color. Choose a color that will blend well with the first color. Keep in mind that colors opposite each other on the color wheel contrast nicely, but they don’t blend well together. For example, if you’re painting a butterfly and you’ve made the base of the wings purple, a blue would blend well while a yellow would not. Apply the second color with the wet tip of the sponge, but use a dry section of the sponge to blend the colors together."

      "content": "Use your brushes to add detail to the design. Dip one of your brushes in water and rub the bristles on the color paint you want to use. Make sure the brush isn’t dripping wet or the paint might run on the person’s face. For smaller details, make light strokes with the thin edge of the brush. Use the flat side of the brush to make bolder, thicker lines. [5] X Research source When you’re finished with one color, clean the brush or grab a new brush to use with a new color. Use a thin brush to add shadows and highlights with black and white paint."

Distracting people will make the time go by faster and they won't get as antsy.
