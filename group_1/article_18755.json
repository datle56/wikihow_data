      "title": "Wipe your car’s interior with rubber gloves.",
      "content": "Wipe your car’s interior with rubber gloves. Put on a pair of rubber gloves and run your hands along all the fabric surfaces in your car. The gloves’ surface has enough grip to pull up pet hair, but it won’t stick the way it does to fabric. This way, you can brush all the fur into a pile and dispose of it. [1] X Research source It sometimes helps to wet the gloves with water first. Just make sure the carpets dry thoroughly so they don’t get moldy or musty."

      "title": "Vacuum the hair.",
      "content": "Vacuum the hair. Vacuuming works best if the hair is already in piles, though it can also pick up individual hairs around your car’s interior. Use a cordless vacuum to get into hard-to-reach areas, or use a pet or upholstery attachment on a traditional vacuum cleaner. If you don’t have a vacuum on hand, many gas stations have car vacuums for a small fee.

      "content": "Use a lint roller for small amounts of fur. For a quick solution, run a lint roller over the fabric surfaces to pull up dog hair or get the last few bits after vacuuming. To get to hard-to-reach cracks and crevices, pull the sticky paper off the roller and stick it on the area or use a vacuum with a crevice tool.

      "content": "Try a dog hair cleaning brush, stone, or glove. There are a ton of dog hair cleaning products that can easily remove fur from your car. Dog hair cleaning brushes build up a static charge that pulls up the fur without damaging your upholstery. Dog hair cleaning stones are great for removing dog hair that’s deeply embedded in the fabric, and dog hair removing gloves are often recommended by professionals.

      "content": "Use hook-and-loop fastener hair curlers for a DIY hack. Many hair curlers have hook-and-loop fastener, which can easily trap dog hair. Simply roll the curlers over the affected surface to lift the hair without damaging your seats or carpet. Once you remove the hair, just wipe it off the curlers outside of your car. Hair curlers won’t have to be replaced regularly like lint rollers do, and they’re easy to store in your glove compartment. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the wire bristle attachment on a steamer. If you have a steamer, the vapor is a great way to remove any germs and bacteria left by dog hair. When used with a bristle wire attachment, it can also pick up and remove the hair. This will also help remove other dirt, grease, and dust mites. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove fur with a squeegee. A squeegee is a quick and affordable way to remove dog hair, and it works similarly to using rubber gloves. Run the rubber blade over your upholstery, and it will gather the hair so you can collect it all in a pile and remove it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub your seats with balloons. While this may sound odd, balloons have static electricity, which sometimes allows them to pick up dog hair. Simply wipe the balloon across the affected surfaces, then brush the collected fur off outside of your car. Repeat until all the hair has been removed.

      "content": "Try a wire brush if nothing else works. Wire brushes can be very effective at removing dog hair, but they’re usually only used as a last resort as they can damage your upholstery. If you’re willing to risk it, gently run the brush over your upholstery until all of the pet hair has been removed. [9] X Research source"

If there are lingering pet odors in your car, put some baking soda or dry coffee grounds in a cup or dish, and leave it in your car for a few hours. Both items are great at absorbing odors and should have your car smelling fresh in no time. The sooner you use them, the better they are at removing the smells .

Dog hair is less likely to stick to materials like leather, plastic, chiffon, silk, and satin, as it’s harder for the fur to get in the fibers.

Then, roll a lint brush over the loose fur to remove it. If necessary, alternate with a soft bristle brush to remove hair that’s deeply embedded in the hook-and-loop fastener, or try pulling it out with a pair of tweezers. [20] X Research source"
