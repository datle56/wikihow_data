      "content": "Wash the sheet in hot water without detergent. If your sheet is new, washing it first is essential because otherwise, the new fabric might not accept the dye. However, even if your sheet is older, wash it to remove dirt and oils that might keep the dye from absorbing easily. [1] X Research source If there are any large or dark stains on the sheet, soak the material in stain remover to lighten the stain, then wash it in hot water. Do not dry the sheet. It will accept the dye more evenly if it's already wet."

      "content": "Fill 1/3 of your bathtub with 120–140 °F (49–60 °C) water. Turn your tap onto the hottest setting and let it run for a few minutes. Then, put in the stopper and fill the bathtub about a third of the way. There should be enough water so you can completely submerge your sheet, but if you fill the bathtub with too much water, it will be hard to get the color dye you need. [2] X Research source Most household water heaters are set between 120–140 °F (49–60 °C), so the hottest water from your tap should be enough. You'll get better results with hotter water, so if your water heater is set to 120 °F (49 °C), you may want to boil a pot of water on your stove and add it to the bath to bring the temperature up. You can also pour the water into a very large bucket or container."

      "content": "Mix your fabric dye according to the package instructions. The exact way you mix your dye will depend on the brand and the type of dye you're using, but in general, you'll pour the dye into 1–2 cups (240–470 mL) of very hot or boiling water. Doing this will ensure that the dye mixes more evenly when you add it to the bath. [3] X Research source A single box of dye should be enough for 1 sheet. However, if you're trying to achieve a very dark or bright color, you can use 2 boxes, if you prefer. Some popular, easy-to-use brands of fabric dye include Tulip, Dylon, and Rit Dye."

      "content": "Stir in the dye and 1 cup (300 g) of salt. Once you've mixed your dye, pour it into the hot water in your bathtub or container. Then, add 1 cup (300 g) of table salt to the mixture and stir everything with a long-handled spoon or long stick. [4] X Research source The salt will help the dye absorb more evenly. If you're using 2 boxes of dye, add 2 cups (600 g) of salt."

      "title": "Submerge your sheet in the dye bath and stir continuously.",
      "content": "Submerge your sheet in the dye bath and stir continuously. Try not to bunch up the sheet when you place it in the water. Place the sheet into your bathtub, then use your spoon or stick to swish the sheet around in the water. Keep stirring for at least 10 minutes, then stir the sheet again every 3-5 minutes as long as it's in the dye bath. [5] X Research source Stirring the sheet ensures there aren't any folds or wrinkles where the dye can't penetrate. It's a good idea to wear long gloves for this so the dye doesn't stain your hands if you accidentally touch it."

      "title": "Leave the sheet in the dye for about 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Leave the sheet in the dye for about 30 minutes. To get a rich, vibrant color, you'll probably need to soak your sheet for about half an hour, stirring regularly. However, if you lift the sheet out of the water and you're satisfied with the color before then, it's fine to take it out early. [6] X Research source You can also leave the sheet in the water a little longer if you haven't achieved the color you want."

      "content": "Remove the sheet, wring it out, and drain your bathtub. When you're happy with the color, lift the sheet out of the bathtub and squeeze it to remove as much of the excess dye as possible. Then, remove the stopper from your bathtub so you can rinse the sheet. [7] X Research source It might help to have a large plastic container available to put the sheet into after you wring it out. If you're using a washing machine, allow it to continue to the spin cycle."

      "content": "Wash the sheet again with mild detergent and cold water. After you finish rinsing out the excess dye, place your sheet in the washing machine or wash it by hand with cold water and a mild detergent. This will help set the dye and remove any remaining residue. [9] X Research source When you're finished, hang the sheet to dry or place it in the dryer. Then, enjoy the new look for your bed, or take your dyed sheet to the beach or on a picnic to show it off! [10] X Research source When you wash your sheet for the first time, consider washing it separately from your other clothing, and in cold water. That way, if any of the dye is left, it won't bleed onto your clothes. After that, wash the sheet the way you normally would, but keep in mind that washing in cold water will preserve the color longer."

      "title": "Wash the sheet in hot water, but don't dry it.",
      "content": "Wash the sheet in hot water, but don't dry it. Your sheet will absorb the dye more evenly if it's clean and wet, so before you try to dye it, run it through the washing machine. Use hot water, but skip the detergent, as this may leave a residue that interferes with the dye. [11] X Research source Light-colored sheets made of cotton or rayon are best for this project."

Tie-dyeing can be messy, so to protect your floor, table, or other work surface, it's a good idea to spread out some sort of tarp or dropcloth. If you don't have one on hand, try cutting open 3-4 garbage bags, then spread them across your work area. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix your dye in a bucket according to package directions. The easiest way to tie-dye your sheets is to buy a tie-dye kit, which will come with several different colors of dye, rubber bands, and containers or squeeze bottles. However, if you're mixing up your own dye, follow the package instructions to determine how much water to use for the product you're using. [13] X Research source If you're using multiple colors of dye, mix each color in its own container. If the dye package recommends adding salt, do that now. [14] X Research source You can also mix the dye and pour into squeeze bottles if you want more control over the process. This is especially helpful if you want to use more than 1-2 colors."

      "title": "Twist or fold the sheet and secure it with rubber bands.",
      "content": "Twist or fold the sheet and secure it with rubber bands. For a traditional tie-dye pattern, grab the center of the sheet, then twist it into a long sphere. Then, wrap rubber bands tightly around the sphere, spacing them about 4–5 in (10–13 cm) apart. [15] X Research source To make geometric patterns, fold the sheet into triangles or squares, or pleat it in an accordion shape. Then, criss-cross the rubber bands across that shape. [16] X Research source Make smaller circular gathers for a polka-dotted or floral tie-dye."

If you're only using 1 color, you can submerge the whole sheet in the dye bin. However, if you're using multiple colors, try to dip a different area of the sheet into each color. Either way, try to saturate the sheet fully with the dye. [17] X Research source It's okay if the colors bleed into each other somewhat, but try not to overlap them completely or the final result may look muddy. If you're using squirt bottles, squeeze the color out onto the fabric. Try to apply each colors to a different section. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the sheet from the dye and place it in a separate container for 20 minutes. In order for the dye to soak deep into the twists and folds that you created, you'll need to let the sheet rest undisturbed. Place the dyed fabric in a plastic bin, container, or bag, and wait about 20 minutes or so. [19] X Research source Make sure you choose a container that's okay to dye, since it may become stained."

Keep rinsing the sheet until the water runs completely clear. Otherwise, the sheet may bleed the next time you wash it. [21] X Research source The cold water will help set the dye. When you're finished, hang the sheet up to air dry or place it in the dryer. The first time you wash the sheet, it may be a good idea to wash it in cold water, separate from your other clothes, in case any of the dye still remains. After that, however, it should be fine to wash with like colors. You can use whatever water temperature you typically prefer for your bedding, although washing the sheet in cold water will keep the colors vibrant longer."
