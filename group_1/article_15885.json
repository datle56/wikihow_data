If your budget is tight, utilize a familiar space. If you, a friend, or a family member have a space large enough for your guest count, then don’t worry about spending money on a venue.

If the cutoff date is well before the actual date of the party, you can open the invitations to additional guests to account for those who failed to RSVP. Account for those who can’t make it. If you are planning a large party, allow for guests to invite one friend, or invite more people than you think you can actually handle. This is helpful if your party is less formal and you aren’t sending RSVPs. If you are concerned about guests bringing friends that you aren’t comfortable with, place a caveat on the invitation regarding plus ones. For example, you might require guests to ask if they would like to bring a plus one, allowing you to screen your guests carefully."

[13] X Research source If you're buying the foods and drinks, make sure to not overbuy, as that is one of the biggest party organizing mistakes that people make. To avoid this, assume that each guest will have two drinks during cocktail hour and one drink every hour thereafter. Don't forget to have non-alcoholic options as well. Set up the music. Create a party playlist according to the ambience of the evening. Preset playlists are available on many music streaming programs, including Spotify and Apple Music.

      "content": "Throw that party. Have a great time! Remember to stay safe and minimize the risks for you and your guests. Serve water and other snacks if you plan on serving alcoholic drinks. Drinking on an empty stomach increases the rate at which alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream. If someone is getting too rowdy or tensions get heated, take them to the side and let them know they need to either calm down or leave. Keep your valuables secure and in other rooms, away from the party. Be mindful of your neighbors. You wouldn’t want your party to end early because you’re making too large a ruckus."
