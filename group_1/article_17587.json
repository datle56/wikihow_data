Measuring the area will help you determine how big your new piece of glass should be. Subtract 1 ‚ÅÑ 8 inch (0.32 cm) from the measurement. The additional space will ensure that the glass will fit in the window and won't crack if the frame expands during cold weather. [5] X Research source"

If you're using a glazing compound, squeeze a tube of the compound onto the frame, around the empty hole. If your compound came in a container, use a putty knife to apply it. [7] X Research source Don't worry about laying too much putty or compound because you'll be scraping the excess away later. You can purchase putty or a glazing compound from the hardware store or online."
