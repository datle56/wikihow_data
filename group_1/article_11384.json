      "content": "Bake an 8 in (20 cm) square cake and an 8 in (20 cm) round cake. Use a boxed mix or your favorite cake recipe to mix up your batter. Then, divide the batter into 2 cake pans, one 8 in (20 cm) square cake pan and one 8 in (20 cm) round cake pan. Bake the cakes as directed in your recipe. [1] X Research source If you’re using an 9 by 13 in (23 by 33 cm) pan instead of an 8 in (20 cm) square pan, trim the cake to an 8 by 8 in (20 by 20 cm) shape. However, keep in mind that you’ll likely need additional cake mix to make both cakes. You can bake 2 different cake flavors if you like. For instance, you might make a strawberry round cake and a chocolate square cake."

      "content": "Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature before you handle them. Don't try to cut the cakes while they're hot because they will crumble and break up. Instead, allow the cakes to cool on a cooling rack or towel until they feel room temperature to the touch. [2] X Research source If you have time, put your cakes in the refrigerator or freezer to get them cold. This will make it easier to work with them."

Turn the square cake so that it looks like a diamond from your perspective. [3] X Research source One corner of the square cake will point toward you. This corner will form the bottom of the heart."

      "content": "Cut the round cake into 2 equal-sized semicircles. Place the round cake on a clean surface that you can use for cutting. Position a large cake knife directly over the middle of the cake. Slowly slice into the cake to divide it into 2 equal halves.

Line the flat side of the semicircle up with the top-left side of the square cake to make 1 side of the heart.

Line the flat side of the semicircle up with the top-right side of the diamond. Place the cake down to complete the heart. [6] X Research source It’s okay if the heart doesn’t look perfect. You can trim the square cake to make the pieces fit together, if necessary."

If the 2 semicircles don’t touch in the center of the heart, you may want to trim the square cake to bring them closer together. Move the semicircles away from the square cake. Then, use a cake knife to shave about a millimeter of cake off of the top sides of the square cake. Continue to shave the cake until the semicircles touch in the middle of the heart. [7] X Research source You might not need to trim your square cake at all. If you do need to trim it, expect to cut off a few millimeters from each side, at the most."

If the cakes don’t line up on the side, use your cake knife to shave down the square cake so that there’s a smooth line down the side of the heart. [8] X Research source You may not need to shave the bottom part of the square cake. If you do end up trimming it, expect to remove about 2-3 millimeters of cake from each side."

Then, use a butter knife to spread a thin layer of icing onto the top sides of the square cake where the 2 cakes join. Push the semicircles into the icing, which will hold the pieces in place. [9] X Research source The icing between the square cake and the semicircles should be about 1-2 mm thick. The icing will help keep your heart together as you decorate it."

Start applying the icing in the center of the cake and spread it out toward the sides. Get more icing on your knife as necessary to cover the entire surface of the cake. Then, use the flat side of your knife to even out the icing. [10] X Research source If you want to decorate your cake, try adding a border, writing on the cake, or adding candy or sprinkles. If the cakes are different heights, you can even them out when you ice the cake. Simply apply more icing on the cake that’s lower until the surface of the heart looks even."

Then, repeat on the other side of the center line. Continue to slice the cake horizontally every 2 in (5.1 cm) until you reach the edges of the cake. [13] X Research source Alternate from side-to-side as you cut to help you keep the slices as even as possible. You will have some slices along the edges that are a different shape, and that's okay."

Make a horizontal slice across the middle to divide the cake into a top and bottom half. [15] X Research source Slowly cut the cake since you’ve already sliced it vertically. It may be easier to cut each vertical section individually so the sides of the pieces don’t start to crumble."

Next, position the knife 1 in (2.5 cm) below the line you cut down the middle and slice the cake again. Continue to make 1 in (2.5 cm) horizontal slices until you’ve cut the entire cake. [16] X Research source Most of the slices will be roughly the same size, which is 2 by 1 in (51 by 25 mm). However, you will have edge pieces that are a slightly different shape to accommodate the shape of the heart."
