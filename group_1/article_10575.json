      "content": "Understand how barcodes work. A barcode contains two sets of numbers—a global prefix that identifies your business, and a product serial number—that allows you to bring up a product's information by scanning the code. If your products don't have individual serial numbers yet, you'll need to set up a product list in your preferred point of sale program before you can create relevant barcodes."

      "content": "Register your business with GS1 . GS1 is a not-for-profit company that maintains the global standards for barcodes. After registering your company with GS1, you will receive a \"prefix\" set of numbers that you can use to refer to your company at the beginning of each barcode. To register with GS1, go to the GS1 U.S. page , read the guide, click Fill out GS1 Company Prefix Application , and follow the instructions. GS is the main kind of worldwide barcoding system. We use it on the products. You have to buy a barcode for your category or company. They are available in denominations of one to thousands. There are some companies online that try to resell them. You can buy 100 for 15 bucks. But those are not legitimate barcodes. If you purchase more barcodes, they may be cheaper."

Most businesses will use either UPC (North America, U.K., New Zealand, and Australia) or EAN (parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America) barcodes. [1] X Research source There are other types of barcodes (e.g., CODE39 and CODE128) as well. Different versions of barcodes support varying lengths of product numbers. For example, EAN-8 barcodes support up to 8 numbers to identify your business and a product, while EAN-13 codes support up to 13."
