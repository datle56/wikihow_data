      "content": "Furry nails can smell due to bacteria buildup like any other manicure. You’re constantly using your hands, so it’s very common for dirt and debris to gather under your nails as well as inside the tiny ridges on the surface. This can cause bacteria to build up and unpleasant odors to form. When you paint over your nails or apply fake nails, you can trap that dirt as well as moisture, leading to worse odors and potentially even fungal infections. [1] X Research source Your nails can also soak up odors. For instance, if you recently cut an onion or garlic, your nails might smell for a while. Potential signs of a fungal nail infection include soreness, swelling, redness, itchiness, discoloration, nail thickening, and nail brittleness or crumbling.

      "content": "Furry nails may be more likely to smell than other nail designs.

So, it’s possible that these nails can smell worse and more quickly than other manicures. On TikTok , users have claimed that furry nails can smell cheesy or even like poop, which might be due to poor hygiene practices. If an infection is behind the odor, the nails might smell sour, yeasty, musty, rotten, or sickly sweet. Don’t worry—there are plenty of ways to help keep your nails from smelling .

      "content": "Furry nails give your nails a fuzzy texture using flocking powder . Furry or fuzzy nails is a nail technique that’s become a viral trend on TikTok in the past year. This trend gives your nails a soft and fuzzy texture, like a fluffy sweater or a stuffed animal’s fur. This is usually done by applying colored flocking powder to your painted nails while they’re still wet. Flocking powder is a super-fine, fibrous material that has a fuzzy or velvety appearance and texture. It’s often used in crafts and to flock Christmas trees to give them the appearance of collecting snow. [3] X Research source Some furry nails might involve applying actual pieces of faux fur to the nails. However, this trend more commonly uses flocking powder. Jan Arnold, the co-founder of CND nail polish, is often credited as creating furry nails. In 2016, she gave models faux fur-covered nails at the Libertine fashion show. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash your hands and dry them completely. Dirt, debris, and bacteria are the most common causes of odors, so take a moment to wash your hands and underneath your nails. To clean under your nails , Nagorska says to wet a manicure brush with soapy water and scrub the underside of your nails. Make sure to dry your hands and nails really well, as moisture can cause odors and even lead to infections. Consider trimming your nails, too. It’s typically harder for dirt and debris to get trapped under shorter nails, which can also help prevent odors from forming."

[8] X Research source Ensure the spots where you don’t want flocking powder are completely dry before you add the powder.

It’s generally easier to keep the underside of your nails clean when they’re shorter rather than longer."
