      "content": "Yes, but not all species fear them and they're not 100% effective solutions. Scarecrows can definitely work, but they’re most effective when moved around frequently or used alongside other deterrents like flashy objects or noisemakers. Scarecrows may also be less effective on certain species that are accustomed to humans, like pigeons or seagulls. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Most birds avoid scarecrows initially because they're afraid of humans.",
      "content": "Most birds avoid scarecrows initially because they're afraid of humans. Crows, ravens, sparrows, and other small birds that eat or play with plants will typically forgo a visit to your crop if they think there's a person close by. The key is dressing and moving the scarecrow to make it look alive. [2] X Research source Hawks and owls will avoid your scarecrow as long as you move it around periodically and combine it with other bird deterrent methods, like repellants, motion, and loud noise. [3] X Research source Birds that are comfortable around people, like pigeons or doves, probably won't be deterred (at least not for long) by a scarecrow that moves, so you'll need to use other repelling methods for those species."

      "content": "Deer that aren't used to humans will also shy away from scarecrows. If a wild deer sees your scarecrow and assumes it’s a human, it’ll likely become fearful and run off. However, if a deer is accustomed to seeing people in their environment, you may need to combine the scarecrow with another deterrent, like motion, loud noises, or an odor-based repellent.

      "content": "Motion-activated scarecrows frighten squirrels and other rodents. Rodents and squirrels aren’t necessarily afraid of humans, so you may need a motion-activated scarecrow to spook these pests. You can also use a scarecrow that’s designed to look like their natural predator— owl decoys are especially effective at scaring away squirrels that try to steal seeds from your garden or bird feeder.

      "content": "Hang clothes loosely on the scarecrow to create a motion deterrent. Everyone is familiar with scarecrows clothed in old straw-stuffed shirts and pants, but empty clothes move more in the wind. Movement scares birds and animals, so leave out the straw when you make the scarecrow and let the clothes hang off it. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Add bright, reflective materials to distract pests. Birds – especially crows and ravens – get distracted by bright, shiny things such as Mylar balloons, colorful flags, and bird tape. Rather than pick at your plants, they will flock to the scarecrow instead. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Hang chimes, pie pans, or cans to scare pests away with noise. Wild animals and birds dislike loud sounds, which are startling and may indicate a predator is nearby. Dangle your noisemaker from the scarecrow frame and let the wind shake them throughout the day and night. [8] X Research source"

When birds and animals like deer near the area, they'll be put off by the sight of the scarecrow and its terrible odor. Even if the scarecrow doesn't fool them, the repellant will act as a second line of defense. [9] X Research source"

A recent study by scientists at the University of Florida and the University of Rhode Island found that birds tend to avoid damaging fields that are protected by laser-emitting scarecrows.

The sound covers 5 acres and scares birds, so it's definitely effective – and humane, as well! [12] X Research source However, if neighbors live close by or you want to protect a small garden in the city, avoid using the bird cannon so you won't cause a disturbance."
