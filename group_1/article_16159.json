      "content": "Find a counselor. Given the stigma surrounding mental health treatment, you may feel hesitant to seek counseling services. Don’t be. Feelings of sadness and anger are common and unavoidable, but when those feelings are negatively affecting your day-to-day life you may need a therapist to help you work through your thought processes to understand why you feel the way that you do. [1] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. Ask friends or family for counselor recommendations. While you may be hesitant to disclose to others that you are seeking therapy, you could find a valuable resource. You may even be able to have a great discussion about the process of going to counseling with someone whose opinion you value. Search for a therapist in your area. Depending on where you live, you might have numerous options for a counselor, or you might have very few. In either case, you go find a directory of counselors in your area by visiting the website for the National Board for Certified Counselors.

In these times, it’s helpful to have a trained professional to help you analyze the situation. [3] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. Be aware of feelings of resistance while talking to your counselor. Inevitably, there will be times when you'll feel misunderstood or as if your therapist doesn't understand why you feel so strongly about certain things. Remember that your therapist can see the situation more clearly than you can."

      "content": "Be open with whoever is willing to help you. Don't worry about trying to make your counselor think that you're a normal, well-adjusted person. They can only help you if they understand how you process your emotions and think about them. Your counselor is the one person with whom you should feel comfortable saying every ugly or embarrassing things you'd be hesitant to say to anyone else. Ask questions. If, at any point, you feel confused about why you're feeling the way you do or how you should react in certain situations, ask your therapist for feedback. He or she is there to give you feedback and to help you monitor your thoughts and feelings, and asking questions will help both of you clarify what is important for your treatment."

      "title": "Talk to a friend or family member.",
      "content": "Talk to a friend or family member. In some situations, such as feeling sadness over the death of a loved one, you probably have friends and family who are feeling many of the same emotions that you are. Be brave. Though it might be scary to express those feelings to loved ones, it could be helpful for both you and them to acknowledge the situation. After doing so, you won’t feel quite so alone. Be careful, however: in situations where you are expressing anger toward someone, it’s possible that they’ll respond with anger, as well. If that happens, don't allow your emotions to escalate. Simply take a deep breath and walk away until you can continue your conversation calmly. Getting into a screaming match isn't going to make anyone feel better. Speak honestly but tactfully. Especially if you're confronting a friend or family member about something that bothers you, try to approach them with calm and humility. Say something such as, \"I was wondering if we could talk. There's something I'd like to get off my chest, and I'm hoping that I can be honest with you.\""

You'll possibly come off as uncaring and arrogant, and you won't have the possibility of clearing up any misunderstandings because you won't hear what the other person is saying.

Despite the commonly held belief that people need to vent their anger to help alleviate its damaging effects, research indicates that this method is counterproductive and can actually increase anger. [6] X Research source However, exercise is very effective at relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The benefits of exercise for regulating anger are debated. Some studies suggest that because vigorous exercise actually increases physiological arousal, it may make feelings of anger worse. [8] X Research source Bushman, B. J. (2002).

Photography can be very helpful because it doesn't require any special skills to get started — all you need is a camera. Try taking photos that express how you feel. Try dance. Dance connects the movement of your body to your inner emotions, allowing you to express how you feel through how you move.

In order to help you process your pain, it encourages you to explore the stories you are telling and think about them from different angles. Writing a story, poem, or other creative piece to express your feelings may help you express your pain in a different way and bring you to a new understanding of it. Use self-compassion when you write about your pain. Studies suggest that merely writing about your pain might make you feel worse, unless you approach it from a place of self-compassion. Don't beat yourself up over your emotions or judge yourself harshly."

      "content": "Allow yourself to feel your emotions. Many of us bury our feelings if they become too intense or embarrassing, thereby denying their presence. Doing so can prolong the healing process, simply because we fail to confront the root causes of those feelings. Remember, those intense emotions, as threatening as they may seem, are only temporary. There is no shame in feeling sad or angry in certain circumstances, and denying those emotions only means you’re pushing them deeper inside where they might do more damage – both psychological and physical.

Identifying intense feelings can slow or attenuate emotional responses. [22] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Monitor your internal dialogue. People who are experiencing strong emotions tend to think in very black or white terms, such as \"Everything is terrible\" or \"This is hopeless.\" Instead, try to reframe your thoughts to something less extreme, such as \"This is frustrating, but I'll get through it\" or \"I have a right to be disappointed, but getting angry won't help anything.\" Try to avoid terms such as \"always\" and \"never.\" That kind of polarized thinking will only escalate the intensity of your negative emotions and allow you to feel justified for feeling that way.

Once you've identified what tends to make you lose your temper or feel unpleasant emotions, there may be times you'll want to simply avoid that situation instead of allowing it to trigger you. If your kid's room is always such a mess that you feel rage when you see it, close the door or look the other way when you walk past. Of course, this isn't a solution for all situations, as many can't and shouldn't be avoided.

For instance, if you feel yourself getting red in the face and angry when you're talking with someone, take a moment to pause to perceive what emotion you are feeling, and then put a name to it. Once you’ve learned to identify your emotions, you can own them when you speak to others. For instance, try not to use words such as “You make me feel bad,” when you’re talking to others. Instead, say “I feel bad because of...” Doing so will allow your tone not to sound accusatory, and the person with whom you are talking will come to a better understanding of how you are experiencing your emotions.
