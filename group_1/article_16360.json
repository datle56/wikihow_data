      "content": "Fast for 1-2 meals if you're just starting out. Your fast might be just a couple hours or go on for a few days. How long you decide to fast is completely up to you and what you feel you need most. If you’re new to fasting, start off slowly with a fast that lasts just one meal. If you feel confident afterward, fast for 2 meals and work your way up. [3] X Research source If you have medical conditions that make fasting for long periods of time difficult, talk to your doctor first to see if your condition will allow you to participate in the fast."

      "title": "Choose between an absolute, partial, or juice fast.",
      "content": "Choose between an absolute, partial, or juice fast. The most extreme form of fasting is an absolute fast, which means you don’t eat any food or drink water during the fasting period. Many people often go for a milder version where they don’t eat any food but still drink water or juice. This is considered to be a “normal” fast and is also sometimes called a “juice fast.” A partial fast just eliminates foods and beverages of certain categories, such as sweets or meat. Talk to your doctor about how to take any medications you’re on while fasting. Don’t fast if it will put your health at risk. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re unable to perform a fast that involves abstaining from food, give up other things like social media, your phone, coffee, soda, television, etc. Prepare your body for fasting by eating smaller meals during the days leading up to your fast. Going from eating full meals to nothing at all can be dangerous for your body, so work yourself up before starting. The concept of fasting appears many times in the Bible, and there are many kinds of fasts that people followed. Some of the most notable fasts and their passages in the Bible include: Daniel Fast (Daniel 1:8-17): partial fast for 10+ days Esther Fast (Esther 4:12-5:2): absolute fast for 3 days Paul’s Fast (Acts 9:1-19): absolute fast for 3 days Elijah Fast (1 Kings 19:1-8): normal fast for 40 days"
