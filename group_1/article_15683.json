      "content": "Remove and rinse the filter under cold water. The filter location depends on the Dyson vacuum model you have, but they’re usually found near the top of the canister and can easily be pulled out. Alessandra Mendes, a cleaning specialist, says to “rinse it with cold water until the water runs clear. Make sure you don’t use soap or place it in any kind of washing machine as it will damage your filter. Gently squeeze the water out and allow it to air dry completely before using it again.” Regina DeCorte, a residential cleaning specialist, recommends cleaning the filters on a regular monthly schedule to keep your vacuum running properly."
