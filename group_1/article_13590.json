      "title": "Prepare the child's skin for makeup.",
      "content": "Prepare the child's skin for makeup. If you don't apply makeup to your child's face they will look ghostly and washed out on stage. To make sure the makeup doesn't negatively affect your child's skin, you need to clean their face before applying makeup. Use a gentle face cleanser and warm water to wash their face. After washing, apply a light facial lotion for sensitive skin. Wait to apply the makeup for at least thirty minutes to make sure the moisturizer completely soaks in. If your child has dry skin, use a cotton ball to apply a thin layer alcohol free toner before doing their makeup."

      "title": "Apply the foundation.",
      "content": "Apply the foundation. Foundation is a kind of makeup for your skin that mimics your skin tone. Choose a shade that is one or two shades darker than your child's face even if they already have a very dark skin tone. Otherwise, they may look washed-out on stage. Use a compressed pancake foundation instead of liquid foundation as it won't streak or rub off if your child gets sweaty under the stage lights. Apply the pancake foundation with sponge or soft brush, starting with the cheeks and blending outward. Make sure to blend the makeup into their neck and hairline. Otherwise your child may look like they're wearing a mask. You don't need to buy an expensive makeup brand. Any brand that is made for sensitive skin will work fine."

      "title": "Apply the blush.",
      "content": "Apply the blush. Blush will help give your child's face a healthy glow on stage. Choose a shade that's slightly darker than your child's normal cheek color. Stay away from dark purples and bright oranges; choose a natural shade instead. Ask your child to smile and apply the blush to the apples of their cheeks. Blend the blush across their cheekbones and towards their ears. Use a large soft brush to apply the blush. The blush will look slightly unnatural if you choose the correct shade. However, the bright colors and contrast will look great on stage. Remember, people will be viewing your child from a distance."

      "title": "Apply translucent powder.",
      "content": "Apply translucent powder. Translucent powder is a loose, clear powder that helps makeup stay on your face. Some translucent powders come with “illuminators,” causing the makeup to look shiny when you put it on. Avoid powders that have illuminators as they will make your child shine like a beacon onstage. When applying the powder, start from the cheeks and gently brush the powder all over the rest of the face. Apply the powder in a thin layer. If it's too thick your child's skin will look strange and powdery. Use a large, soft brush to apply the powder."

      "title": "Apply the eyeshadow.",
      "content": "Apply the eyeshadow. Choose a light gold or peach eyeshadow that has a bit of shimmer. Apply this shade over the whole eyelid with a small makeup brush. Blend the color up towards the eyebrows. Next, choose a darker, natural color such as a chocolate brown. Apply a line of darker eyeshadow to the crease of the eyelid. Using a clean eyeshadow brush, blend the dark line of eyeshadow into the lighter eyeshadow. [1] X Research source When blending with a brush use light, gentle strokes. If you press too hard you may scrub away the eyeshadow. If your child has blond or light brown eyebrows, use a light brown eyeshadow to fill them in."

      "title": "Apply the eyeliner.",
      "content": "Apply the eyeliner. Use a black pencil to line the top and bottom of your child's eye. To line the top lid first ask the child to close their eyes. Gently pull up on the eyebrow and apply the makeup in small strokes, lining the lash line of the eyelid. To line the lower lid, ask the child to look up. Gently pull down on the cheek to put on the lower line. Be patient and careful while applying the makeup; if you get it in their eyes, they might start watering and mess up the makeup. Have younger child lean against wall or lie on floor to reduce fidgeting."

    {
      "title": "Apply the mascara.",
      "content": "Apply the mascara. Use black mascara that's not waterproof. Waterproof mascara is very difficult to clean off of a child's face. Gently pull up on eyebrow and ask the child to look down. Apply a thin coat of mascara to the ends of their eyelashes. Let the mascara dry before applying some to the lower lashes. When doing lower lashes, ask the child to look up and gently pull down on their cheek. Be patient. If you move too quickly or don't let the child blink when they want to they might become uncooperative. It may help to lean the child against a wall to reduce fidgeting."

      "title": "Apply the lip color.",
      "content": "Apply the lip color. Choose a shade of lipstick and lip liner that's a few shades darker than their natural lip tone. First, line their lips with lip liner by carefully drawing a thin line around the edges of their lips. Next, apply the lipstick. Ask the child to open their mouth in a loose “O” shape and carefully dab the lipstick onto their lips. Blend it all over their lips using your finger. Lip liner is optional, but it helps keep the lipstick in place. If the lipstick is too thick dab some of it off with a tissue. This is called “blotting.”"

      "title": "Use baby wipes to fix mistakes.",
      "content": "Use baby wipes to fix mistakes. If you accidentally smear the child's makeup while you're applying it, simply wipe the affected area with a baby wipe. Wait for the area to dry and reapply the makeup completely. For example, if you smear mascara onto your child's cheek, it's not enough to wipe away the mascara. You must also reapply the foundation and the blush, finishing with translucent powder. This technique is best for quickly removing small mistakes. The longer the makeup sits on the face, the harder it will be to get off with baby wipes."

      "title": "Use a mild cleanser.",
      "content": "Use a mild cleanser. Choose a mild facial cleanser that is formulated for sensitive skin. Gently splash the child's face with water while standing over a sink. Put a pea-sized amount of the facial cleanser in your hand. Rub your hands together to create a thick lather and gently rub the lather on the child's skin. Avoid the eye areas. After a few minutes wash the soap off with warm water and pat their skin dry. [2] X Research source Use gentle makeup wipes to remove eye makeup. To do so, ask the child to close their eyes and wipe the makeup off in a downward motion. Be careful not to get makeup in their eyes. If you're concerned about irritated skin, apply a gentle, non-scented lotion after washing their face."

      "title": "Use coconut oil as a makeup remover.",
      "content": "Use coconut oil as a makeup remover. If your child has very sensitive skin you may not want to use a cleanser at all. If this is the case, use coconut oil instead. First, rub a teaspoon of coconut oil all over your child's face, avoiding the eyes. Next, use a warm damp washcloth to wipe away the makeup. When wiping away the eye makeup, ask the child to close their eyes and gently wipe the makeup away in a downward motion. [3] X Research source If there is a lot of makeup you may need more than one teaspoon of coconut oil. Wrap a towel around the child's shoulders to avoid dripping coconut oil on their clothing."
