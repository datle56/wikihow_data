      "content": "Bring the water to a rolling boil. Place the saucepan or pot on a large burner and turn the burner up to high. Wait until large bubbles begin floating to the surface or the water, which gives the surface of the water the appearance of rolling. [3] X Research source The time this will take will vary depending on the amount of water you use, the surface area of the pot, and how much salt is in the water. However, expect 12 cups (2.8 litres) of water to take about 7 to 10 minutes to boil."

      "content": "Boil the crab claws for 6 minutes. Use tongs or oven mitts to grasp the claws and gently place them in the pot of hot water. Once the claws are in the water, cover the pot and let them cook. Don't leave the claws in the hot water for more than 6 minutes or the crab meat will get tough. [4] X Research source Quickly throwing the crab claws in could create splashes that could potentially burn the skin. Keep in mind that every 2 lb (0.91 kg) of crab claws will give you about 1 lb (0.45 kg) of meat. Crab claws that float to the top of the water are called floaters—they tend to have less meat, but are still delicious."
