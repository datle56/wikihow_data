      "content": "Use honey. Honey can be used to treat not only acne scars but also acne itself. It is gentle on your skin and reduces redness and irritation. Honey contains antibacterial properties which help to fade acne scarring and dark marks. It is moisturizing and makes your skin soft. Dab a little honey directly onto the scars at night, and wash off in the morning. [1] X Research source Read the ingredients list. Sometimes cheaper honey is diluted with corn syrup or isn't even real honey at all!"

      "title": "Use rosehip oil.",
      "content": "Use rosehip oil. Rosehip oil is loaded with vitamins and antioxidants which help to keep skin looking smooth and healthy. While the use of rosehip oil on fresh acne spots is still being evaluated, its use has been proven effective in repairing acne scars as well as other forms of scars and skin blemishes. Through regular use, marks and scars will fade and become less prominent over time. Simply massage the oil gently into the affected area once or twice a day. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use coconut oil.",
      "content": "Use coconut oil. Due to the lauric, caprylic, and capric acid found in coconut oil, it makes an excellent cream to help diminish acne scars. Coconut oil also helps to prevent new acne scars from forming. To fade acne scars, massage coconut oil into the affected area at least once a day, but 2-4 times daily is best. It may be too rich, so use carefully. Coconut Oil can also be used as a cleanser."

      "title": "Use aloe vera.",
      "content": "Use aloe vera. Aloe Vera is known in the cosmetic field for its healing properties, and it can be used to gently, yet effectively heal acne scars over time. Although you can buy many aloe-based gels commercially, the best thing to do is purchase an aloe plant. [3] X Research source To use the aloe from an aloe vera plant, break off a leaf and rub the gel-like contents directly onto the skin. Let it dry, then leave it on for 30 minutes. Wash off with a mild cleanser. Try to do this every day."

      "title": "Use an ice cube.",
      "content": "Use an ice cube. This treatment works best for new, or inflamed scars as the ice will reduce swelling and shrink blood vessels. Over time, ice will also help to reduce the appearance of minor scars and discoloration. [4] X Research source Wrap an ice cube in a piece of tissue or cloth and rub it over the inflamed areas for 10-15 minutes a day."

      "content": "Use an aspirin mask. Aspirin possesses effective anti-inflammatory properties and it contains a form of salicylic acid, which is used in many acne treatments. An aspirin mask can be used to soften your skin and reduce discoloration. [5] X Research source To make the mask, crush 4-5 aspirin tablets into a powder, then mix the powder into natural yogurt or pure aloe gel. Apply the mask to your face and let it sit for 15 minutes. Wash off with lukewarm water, pat your face dry, and moisturize."

      "title": "Try over-the-counter creams.",
      "content": "Try over-the-counter creams. There are tons of scar treatment products available over-the-counter which can help to even out redness and discoloration. They are usually branded as either scar-fading or lightening creams. Look for creams with active ingredients such as kojic acid, licorice extract, arbutin, mulberry extract, and vitamin C. These ingredients exfoliate the skin, removing the discolored top layers and leaving the skin smooth and tight.

      "title": "See a dermatologist.",
      "content": "See a dermatologist. If the over-the-counter products aren't packing enough of a punch, consider seeing a dermatologist who can prescribe a stronger, medicated cream. You can also discuss other options for fading acne scars, such as laser treatments or chemical peels.

      "title": "Get laser resurfacing treatment.",
      "content": "Get laser resurfacing treatment. Laser resurfacing treatment works by removing top layers of skin from the acne scars, which are damaged and hyper-pigmented, leaving the skin underneath tighter and smoother. This treatment doesn't even need to be done in a hospital, a dermatologist can perform the laser resurfacing right in his or her office. [8] X Research source The laser can feel a little painful, but the doctor usually numbs the skin with a local anesthetic first, so it's not too bad. The treatment can take up to an hour and may require several sessions, depending on the severity of the scarring."

      "title": "Try a tissue filler.",
      "content": "Try a tissue filler. If your acne scars are more like indentations and scoops than raised bumps, a tissue filler can work wonders to plump up and smooth out the skin. Tissue fillers - such as hyaluronic acid - are injected underneath the skin by a dermatologist, producing immediate results. Unfortunately, the effects of this treatment are not permanent, so if you like it, you'll just have to keep coming back every few months for more! [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Silicone micro-droplets are a newer type of filler that stimulate your skin's production of collagen, allowing skin to regenerate on its own. You will need several rounds of injections for the treatment to take effect, but once these are complete the results are permanent."

      "title": "Get a chemical peel.",
      "content": "Get a chemical peel. Chemical peels are concentrated acidic solutions that exfoliate the outer layer of your skin, exposing the softer and smoother skin underneath. They are effective for fading acne scars, as well as evening out skin tone, improving fine lines and treating sun damage. Chemical peels are available at your local dermatologist or plastic surgeon's office.

      "title": "Try dermabrasion.",
      "content": "Try dermabrasion. Dermabrasion wears down scarring by removing the top layers of skin using a rotating wire brush. This treatment is quite harsh and your skin can take up to three weeks to heal, but once it does, you will have a new layer of lovely fresh, smooth skin.

      "title": "If all else fails, try surgery.",
      "content": "If all else fails, try surgery. If no other treatments seem to be working, consult with your dermatologist about having your scars surgically removed. Be aware that surgery is the highest-risk option, as it often involves anesthesia, and can be very pricey - so you should only consider this option if your scars are very deep or extensive. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Most of the time, surgery involves having each scar cut out individually, though sometimes a surgeon will need to break up the fibrous tissue which causes scarring, beneath the skin. It will take some time for your skin to heal after surgery, and you may also need to get a resurfacing treatment to smooth out the top layer of skin."

      "title": "Wear sunscreen every day.",
      "content": "Wear sunscreen every day. Exposing scars to the sun can cause them to darken and slow the healing process. This is because ultraviolet rays stimulate the pigment-producing cells in your skin, leading to further discoloration. To avoid this, you should wear a sunscreen every day, summer or winter. [13] X Research source Before heading outdoors, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher that contains the ingredient zinc oxide. Reapply after swimming, sweating, or after more than 2 hours in the sun. Wearing sunscreen every day will also prevent skin damage and premature aging.

      "title": "Exfoliate daily.",
      "content": "Exfoliate daily. Exfoliating your skin on a regular basis can help your acne scars to fade naturally, by removing layers of old, blemished skin to reveal the fresh new skin underneath. [15] X Research source Try an over-the-counter exfoliant, containing the active ingredients AHA or BHA, which have strong anti-inflammatory properties and can help with discoloration. If your skin is red, inflamed, or irritated, you actually want to avoid exfoliating until you restore your skin's barrier first. Otherwise, you'll irritate your skin more and make things worse. Applying a layer of petroleum jelly to your skin before bed each night can help restore your skin's barrier.

      "title": "Use gentle skincare.",
      "content": "Use gentle skincare. It's tempting to try abrasive scrubs and all sorts of irritating treatments in a desperate effort to get rid of acne discolorations, but irritation only causes more harm, which impedes your skin's ability to heal itself. Stick to gentle, non-irritating skincare which is kind to your skin."

      "title": "Don't pop your acne.",
      "content": "Don't pop your acne. Scars are made up mainly of collagen and are the body's way of healing itself. However, by picking or squeezing pimples, you cause pus and bacteria to filter deeper into the skin, damaging your skin's natural collagen. Picking also leads to skin damage and inflammation, which delays the healing process. Avoid picking or squeezing spots, and eventually the collagen-based scars will disappear on their own.

      "title": "Stay hydrated.",
      "content": "Stay hydrated. Drinking water is not going to get rid of acne scars on its own, but staying hydrated is essential for healthy skin and will help to speed up the skin's natural rejuvenation process. Try to drink 1–2 liters (0.3–0.5 US gal) of water a day and eat lots of fresh fruit and veg."
