      "content": "Entering a search term and adding “blog” will give you tons of results. The easiest way to find blogs that interest you is through your favorite search engine. Include a keyword or two based on the topic you’re interested in and tack on the word “blog” at the end of it. For example, if you’re interested in blogs about baseball, you might search for “baseball statistics blog.” Use modifiers like “best,” “top,” or “new” to find fresh or popular blogs in a given subject. For example, you search for something like “best cinema blog” or “new interior design blog.” You can always group your search terms together if you want to find something specific. Use quotation marks to only pull up results with words that appear in that order. For example, “top “Chicago street art” blog” will only pull up results that specifically mention the phrase “Chicago street art.” [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the search function on blog sites to find what you're looking for. Alternatively, you can use a standard search engine and simply add the hosting site in quotation marks at the end of your search term to pull up results for whatever you’re searching for. [2] X Research source WordPress is arguably the most popular blogging platform. If you’re looking for individual blogs, WordPress will have tons of results for you. Blogspot is another incredibly popular blogging platform. Blogspot is the host for blogs created with the Blogger platform—this means you'll see \"blogspot\" in the URL for a Blogger blog (unless the blog has a custom domain). Medium is a publishing platform that anyone can use, although it tends to be more popular among professionals and full-time writers. If you’re looking for in-depth content, this is a great site to dig through. Tumblr is a microblogging social media platform. Some of the most popular blogs you'll find on Tumblr are fanblogs for music artists, actors, TV shows, anime, subcultures, or just about anything else you can think of. Ghost is an open-source blog platform that hosts a number of blogs focusing on tech, business, education, and more. LinkedIn is technically a social media site, but they also offer the LinkedIn Publishing Platform so LinkedIn page members and admins can write articles that essentially function as blog posts. Content hosting sites like Huffington Post , Buzzfeed , Engadget , and Gizmodo technically qualify as blogs, and they all offer a ton of content. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Directories are kind of like encyclopedias for blogs. You may need to sign up for a free account to use some of them, but they make it much easier to find content. Most of them have a search function, although all of them allow you to sort and scan results based on a category. Some of them even track your searches to customize the kind of content you see based on your preferences. Bloggeries is a great resource with more categories than a lot of the other directories out there. Bloglovin' is a great site if you’re specifically looking for fashion, beauty, or home décor blogs. Blogarama is one of the oldest blog directories, boasting over 170,000 active blogs in their directory. Ooh.directory is a smaller blog directory, but it's been going for over 20 years and is still getting updated."

      "content": "Think of an RSS feed reader like a collection bin for content. You enter a topic or website domain, and all of the most popular or recent content pops up. You can also set notifications up for keywords, authors, or topics to get the quickest scoop on new info. RSS feeds used to be extremely popular, open, and free, but most now require you to sign up for an account. Some of them require a monthly subscription as well. The Old Reader is one of the best free RSS readers out there. You can bookmark certain sites and track multiple sites and authors at once, and all you need is a Google or Facebook account to sign up. Flipboard is a popular mobile app geared specifically towards news. It does include blogs and regular news articles in its results, though. Get it on the Google Play Store or App Store . Feedly is another popular option, although you do need to pay a small fee. It’s a great option if you like to organize and collect sites from all over the internet in one place. Inoreader is a really popular RSS feed reader with a free version. It has a built-in podcast player if you like to listen to things while you’re scanning the news."

      "content": "There are a ton of sites out there that publish lists, rankings, and suggestions. Go into your search engine and search for something like “Top 10 automotive blogs” or “50 most popular photography blogs” to pull up a ton of lists and recommendations. Some of these will pop up naturally in your initial search results, but don’t discount them! You’re going to run into some advertising by doing this, but you can still find plenty of great content by perusing these lists. You could also search based on specific recommendations. For example, you could search for something like “Anthony Bourdain’s favorite food blogs.” Sites like Cracked, Buzzfeed, Ranker, and Listverse specialize in this kind of content if you want more."

      "content": "Poke around on social media to find new content and writers. Bloggers and sites that host bloggers tend to be extremely active on social media, so searching Facebook and Instagram can be a great way to find new content. This is also an especially solid option if you want to find popular stories and topics that are trending in the news. [4] X Research source Searching the trending tab on X/Twitter is a great way to find popular content as it’s breaking in the news. Pinterest is a great platform if you’re looking for visual content. Bloggers often post recipes, links, and design ideas on there. You can follow or subscribe to your favorite blogs on social media to get notifications whenever they post new information."

      "content": "You can always ask others for help finding interesting bloggers. Since your friends know you best, asking a question on Facebook can be a great way to get recommendations. You can also create a Reddit thread asking for great authors to follow online. If you’re interested in any kind of niche subjects, like pet hedgehogs or model trains, look for online forums where people in that subculture gather to exchange info. Asking a question on your favorite wikiHow article is another great way to get recommendations! Just scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the question & answer section. Depending on the article, someone may have already asked for recommendations!"

      "content": "You may be limiting the scope of your search if you stick to written articles. A vlog, which is shorthand for “video blog,” can be just as interesting or insightful as a written article. To find a vlog, go to one of the video platforms listed below and search for topics that interest you plus the word \"vlog\". YouTube is by far the most popular vlogging platform. If you sign up for an account, you can also subscribe to your favorite vloggers so you get a notification whenever they post something new. [5] X Research source TikTok mostly focuses on short-form video, but some users also use it for vlogging. Using TikTok to find vlogs has the added benefit of using their algorithm to easily find more content you'll like. Vimeo is a popular platform among professionals. If you’re looking for quality content, Vimeo’s search results are probably going to be less amateurish than YouTube’s. There aren’t a ton of folks making content there compared to YouTube, though. Twitch (specifically the IRL section) is a fun alternative if you want to watch live video and interact with the vlogger while they talk."
