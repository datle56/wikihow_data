      "content": "Tape your template to your canvas. The most popular canvas for this type of project is a piece of wooden board, such as plywood, a rustic wood disk , or a cutting board . Decide where you want your string art design to be on your piece of wood, and secure the template in place with pieces of tape. [2] X Research source Paint your piece of wood to match your decor if you’d like. [3] X Research source Play with medium by covering your wood with felt , ribbon , or lace . Use double-sided or rolled-up tape to keep the tape on the back of the template."

      "content": "Hammer the nails around your template about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) apart. Use your template as a guide and outline it with your chosen nails or pins . [4] X Research source The standard is placing a nail every 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm), but you can place them as far or close apart as you’d like. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to help you hold the nails in place while you’re hammering. [5] X Research source Only hammer the nail into the wood so it stays in place, leaving enough room to wrap the string around. The closer the nails are to one another, the tighter your design and string will be. The farther the nails are from one another, the more gaps there will be. Add some extra flare to your string art by using gold or colored nails or pins. Try using nails with decorative tops for a more eclectic look."

      "content": "Tie a knot around your first nail. Take the string of your choice and do a simple overhand knot on one of the nails. Any excess string can be cut off or tucked into your design later. Embroidery floss works well for delicate and intricate designs, while yarn and crochet thread look best on large and wider patterns. [7] X Research source Consider using color-changing string to make your string art even more mesmerizing. Opt for glittery thread to add a bit of sparkle. Try to start on a nail that’s on a corner of your design so the knot isn’t as noticeable. [8] X Research source Put a drop of super glue or hot glue on the knot to help it stay in place."

Begin wrapping the string around each nail individually in whatever direction you deem fit. If you mess up, unwind and reweave! [9] X Research source For a smooth outline, wrap the string around each nail clockwise. For a wavy outline, wrap the string around each nail in an alternating pattern: clockwise, counterclockwise, clockwise, counterclockwise. Keep your string or thread on its spool while you do this. If you run out of string, no biggie! Tie another knot on the nail you left off on and continue weaving."
