      "content": "Wear a fitted suit. A suit jacket and dress pants are perfect (and expected) for semi-formal events. Anything less than a suit and you’ll be underdressed. You want to get your suit tailored so it fits you perfectly."

      "title": "Attend evening/nighttime events in a darker suit.",
      "content": "Attend evening/nighttime events in a darker suit. A good rule of thumb is the later the event, the darker your suit should be. Wear a navy, dark gray, or black suit if you’re going to a later event."

      "title": "Wear a crisp button-up shirt under your suit jacket.",
      "content": "Wear a crisp button-up shirt under your suit jacket. Make sure it’s clean and ironed. Don’t forget to tuck it in. Your button-up shirt is an opportunity to show off some of your personal flair, so don’t be afraid to wear patterns or a color other than white. Be careful though; don’t wear anything too bold or flashy that will detract from your polished look. For example, you could jazz up your suit by wearing a lavender button-up with a subtle pinstripe pattern. But you definitely wouldn't want to wear a shirt with a watermelon print all over it."
