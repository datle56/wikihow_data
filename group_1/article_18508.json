As the most popular dating app worldwide, it seems like everybody is on Tinder , regardless of preference. [1] X Research source No matter who you're interested in, you will likely find someone who checks at least some of your boxes on Tinder. Pros If you're gay, bisexual, or otherwise queer-identified, you can easily filter your matches to show other people who match your gender and orientation preferences. You can list the type of relationship you're looking for (e.g., polyamorous, monogamous, open relationship) and filter matches to only display users who seek that same relationship style(s). [2] X Research source You can specify your gender, pronouns , and preference/orientation on your profile, and many options are available for each. [3] X Research source Cons Filtering by gender and orientation doesn't always keep straight people out of your matches. [4] X Research source While you may find people looking for long-term relationships on Tinder, the app is better known for short-term flings and hookups. If you're in the closet , Tinder's large user base may be intimidating, as people of any gender or preference can discover you."

If you leave your orientation blank and just search by gender, you'll see plenty of straight people in your matches who may not be interested. Just choose the Edit Profile option, then choose the LGBTQ orientation that most closely matches how you identify. [5] X Research source"

For example, if you're trans, there are multiple trans options that might be seen as similar (e.g., Transmasculine and FTM). If you identify as Transmasculine but also want to be seen by people who specify that they're looking for looking for \"Male,\" \"FTM,\" and \"Transgender Man\" on Tinder, you can select other descriptors here."
