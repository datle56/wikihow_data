      "content": "It may help dry it out a bit, but it’s not a particularly good solution. Baking soda will certainly dry out your skin, which may help if your pimple is caused by oily skin. However, there are better options out there when it comes to combatting oily skin and pimples. The main problem is that baking soda is a skin irritant, and while it’s not the world’s most dangerous thing to put on your skin, it’s definitely not the best option if you’re spot-treating pimples since the irritation cause make the problem worse.

      "content": "It’s probably not super dangerous, but it may irritate your skin. Baking soda is alkaline, and it has a pH of 8-9 which makes it moderately basic. [4] X Research source However, human skin has a natural pH of 4.5-5.3, meaning that it’s naturally acidic. [5] X Research source As a result, skin treatments that are slightly acidic or neutral is going to be much safer for your skin. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Baking soda may help your pimple a bit if it’s caused by oily skin, but it’s just as likely to irritate your skin which may cause more pimples in the future. This is why scary-sounding ingredients like glycolic acid and alpha-hydroxyacid are commonly found in skincare products. The word “acid” conjures all kinds of fear-inducing ideas, but many acidic compounds are actually awesome for your skin.

      "content": "No, this combination can seriously damage your skin. Baking soda on its own is capable of irritating your skin, but lemon juice is seriously going to damage your skin barrier, which is the outermost layer of your skin. While many slightly acidic ingredients are safe for skin, lemon juice is not one of them; it has a pH of 2, which is wildly acidic. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you just think about it in this context, combining one skin irritant with another skin irritant isn’t going to create a winning combination that’s safe for your skin. [9] X Research source Your skin barrier is really important when it comes to protecting your skin from damage, disease, and dehydration, so you really don’t want to wear it down with something caustic, like citrus.

      "content": "Spot treat a single pimple with benzoyl peroxide. Go to your local pharmacy and pick up an acne-fighting cream that contains benzoyl peroxide. After you clean your face, simply work a pea-sized dollop of the cream into the pimple and leave it alone. The benzoyl peroxide will reduce inflammation and kill any bacteria that’s clogging your pores, which is the most effective way to clear up any pimples. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are also benzoyl peroxide patches and gels out there. If you want to use one of these, go for it! Benzoyl peroxide creams come in concentrations ranging from 2.5% to 10%. If you have sensitive skin, opt for the weaker concentrations. If you want to combat the pimple as aggressively as possible, pick up the stronger stuff. Don’t reapply the benzoyl peroxide multiple times a day. If you keep using it over and over again in the same spot, you may irritate your skin."
