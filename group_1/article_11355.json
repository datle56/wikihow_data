You likely won't need one for much else than this, but bottle cutters are helpful, cheap tools if you're doing this a lot. Otherwise, a glass cutting knife or sharp, precision blade will do just fine. [3] X Research source"

This clamp will provide your guidance line when scoring the bottle, like using a ruler to draw a straight line. You could also use a roll of masking tape with the bottle shoved in the center to provide a nice, straight line."
