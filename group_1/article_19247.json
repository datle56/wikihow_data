      "content": "Bleach your hair to get the most vibrant purple results. If you have dark hair and you want your purple dye to be very bright, you’ll need to lighten your hair as much as possible first by bleaching it. [1] X Expert Source Brianna Bowling Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 25 February 2022. Since bleaching is a harsh chemical process, it’s best to have it done at a salon by an experienced colorist, but you can do it yourself if you're comfortable experimenting with your hair. [2] X Research source Most rainbow-colored dyes, including purple shades, are semi-permanent or temporary, which means they will not lighten your hair when you apply them. Because of this, they may not show up as well on dark hair. Bleaching may not be safe for your hair if it’s been previously colored or chemically treated. Also, if your hair is very thick or dark, it may take several bleaching sessions before you get the color you desire. If any of these are true for your hair, consult a stylist before attempting to bleach at home."

      "content": "Apply coconut oil to your hair the night before you bleach it for extra protection. Soaking your hair in coconut oil the night before can help prevent damage due to bleaching, especially if your hair is thick or coarse. Rub a small amount of coconut oil into your palms, then distribute it evenly through your hair. Only use a little, since you don’t want the oil to prevent the bleach from soaking into your hair the following day. [3] X Research source The amount of coconut oil you need will depend on your hair thickness and length. Start with a pea-size amount, then use more if needed."

      "content": "Protect your workstation and skin from the bleach. To prevent the dye from staining your skin or the surfaces in your home, lay down towels on the floor around you and drape a towel over your shoulders. Rub a little petroleum jelly around your hairline and the tops of your ears, then put on the gloves that came in the bleaching kit. [4] X Research source It may be helpful to have an extra pair of gloves nearby in case yours tear."

      "content": "Mix the ingredients according to the package directions. Typically, bleaching kits will come with a packet of bleach powder and a developer. Read the instructions thoroughly, then mix the products together, either in the provided container or in a glass or plastic bowl.

      "title": "Use a brush to apply the dye to your hair.",
      "content": "Use a brush to apply the dye to your hair. If you want your whole head to be purple, you’ll need to bleach all of your hair. Part each section of hair and brush on the bleach as close to your roots as you can without applying it directly to your scalp. Then, brush the bleach mixture all the way down your hair before moving to a new section. [6] X Research source If you only want a few purple streaks, you only need to bleach those areas."

      "title": "Leave the bleach on for the recommended amount of time, then rinse.",
      "content": "Leave the bleach on for the recommended amount of time, then rinse. Since bleaching is a harsh chemical process, it’s important not to leave the dye on for longer than instructed. Set a timer, and when the timer goes off, rinse your hair with cool water. [7] X Research source If your hair isn’t the color you wanted, you’ll need to wait a few weeks before you bleach it again. In the meantime, deep condition your hair frequently to keep it as healthy as possible. If you’re happy with the color, you can proceed to the purple dye. Since most purple dyes are non-toxic, you can apply them immediately after you bleach your hair."

      "content": "Condition your hair if you won't be dyeing it purple right away. Some bleaching kits come with a nourishing conditioner. If you're using the purple dye as soon as you finish bleaching, you may choose to wait and use this conditioner after that process. If you're not planning to dye your hair purple immediately, apply the conditioner according to the packaging instructions, then rinse it out after 3-5 minutes, or as directed. [8] X Research source Many temporary and semi-permanent dyes should be applied to clean hair, so a thick conditioner might interfere with your hair's ability to absorb the purple hue."

      "content": "Use plum or burgundy dye first if you have dark hair and don’t want to bleach it. If you have dark hair and you want to dye it purple without using bleach, start by creating a base with a purple hint dye like plum or burgundy shade. [9] X Expert Source Brianna Bowling Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 25 February 2022. You can visit a stylist for this, or you can use a box dye at home. If you use a box dye, you can either apply it all over your hair or just to the areas you want to dye purple, such as highlights, the ends for an ombre effect, or the bottom layer of your hair for a peekaboo effect. Leave it on according to the package instructions, then rinse it out. [10] X Research source This will create a purplish base that will help your color show up better. The final result will depend on your hair’s color and texture, but if you use a highly-pigmented purple dye over this base, you should get a deep, rich purple hue. Keep in mind that using a box dye may be cheaper, but a color correction with a professional stylist will be expensive if you don’t like your results."

      "title": "Protect your work area before you apply the purple dye.",
      "content": "Protect your work area before you apply the purple dye. Rainbow hues are notorious for getting everywhere when you use them, so before you dye your hair purple, you should probably remove anything from the area that you don’t want to get dye on, and lay trash bags on the floor. That way, if you spill or splatter the dye, it can’t soak through and stain your floors. Also, wear gloves and old clothes that are okay to get stained, and drape a towel or hairdresser’s cape around your shoulders so the dye doesn’t get on your skin. You might also want to keep a damp towel nearby to clean up any spills."

While most permanent dyes work best on unwashed hair, semi-permanent and temporary dyes are best applied on freshly-washed, damp hair. The color will fade with each wash, so starting with clean hair will help to reduce the amount you need to wash your hair after dyeing it. Just use your regular shampoo, then blot your hair with a dry towel to get rid of excess moisture. [12] X Research source There’s no need to condition your hair. Conditioner seals your hair’s cuticle, so you don’t need to apply it until after rinsing out the dye. If your hair tangles easily, you can use a small amount of a lightweight conditioner. Just be sure to rinse it thoroughly."

Some of the dye is likely to get on your skin when you’re coloring your hair, and while semi-permanent and temporary dye are typically non-toxic, it can still leave stubborn purple stains. To keep the dye off of your face, create a barrier by spreading petroleum jelly all the way across your forehead, on the tops of your ears, and behind your ears around to the back of your neck.

Comb your hair to detangle it, then use your comb to part your hair into sections, and clip each one up. The exact number of sections you’ll use will depend on the length and thickness of your hair, but the idea is that you want it to be easy to fully saturate each section with dye. [15] X Research source If your hair is short and thin, you might only need to divide it into 2 sections in the front and 2 in the back. However, if you have very long, thick hair, you might need to clip your hair into 8 or more sections. It’s important to comb your hair before you dye it, since tangles could make the dye go on unevenly."

      "content": "Apply the purple dye all-over if you want to dye your whole head. You can use your hands if you like, but make sure to put on a pair of gloves first! For a more precise application, use a paintbrush or a foam craft brush to apply the dye to your hair. Starting with one of the front sections and working your way back, saturate the section with dye from the roots to the tips. Clip that section back up, then move to the next one. Continue until you’ve dyed all of your hair. [16] X Research source With most semi-permanent and temporary hair dyes, there’s no mixing required. Unless the instructions state otherwise, all you have to do is open the container and apply the color to your hair. If the dye came in a bottle, you may need to squeeze it into a bowl if you want to use a brush. Keep in mind the bowl may get stained. Some people prefer to dye from back to front, since the back of your hair takes longer to accept color."

      "content": "Brush the dye on in sections for a highlight-like effect. If you only want to dye certain sections of your hair, clip all of the rest of your hair out of the way, then apply your purple dye with a brush. The brush allows for precision, although keep in mind that when you shampoo, some of the purple dye will probably transfer to the rest of your hair. To minimize this, rinse your hair quickly focusing on the highlighted sections first. [17] X Research source For instance, you might dye just the underside of your hair, or just your bangs."

      "content": "Dye just the ends of your hair for an ombre effect. If you only want to dye the ends of your hair, you can either brush the dye on, or you can dip your hair into the bowl or container of dye. Try to create a straight line where the dye ends. If some of your hair has the last 2 in (5.1 cm) dyed but the rest only has purple on 1 in (2.5 cm), it will look messy. [18] X Research source This is a fun way to try out a bold color without committing to an all-over look."

      "content": "Cover your hair with plastic wrap and leave the dye on for 45 minutes. Once you’ve applied the dye, wrap your hair in plastic wrap or cover your head with a shower cap and let the dye soak into your hair for however long the directions say—typically about 30-45 minutes. However, if you’re using a non-toxic dye, it won’t hurt your hair to leave the color on longer if you want, and it can help produce a more vivid purple hue, especially if you have coarse or thick hair. [19] X Research source If you don’t have plastic wrap or a shower cap, you don’t have to use them. However, this will help lock in the heat from your scalp, which can help the dye penetrate deeper into your hair, helping it last longer. A plastic grocery bag will also work as a cover for your hair."

This can take a while, so be patient. Once the water is clear (or mostly clear), wash your hair with a mild shampoo and rinse it again. Pour white vinegar over your hair, then rinse it well and condition your hair as usual When you’re finished, towel-dry your hair with an old towel, as a little of the dye might still transfer. [20] X Research source Do not use clarifying shampoo to wash your purple hair, as it will strip the color. Sulfate-free shampoo is best for color-treated hair. If you don’t want to use vinegar, you don’t have to, but it may help your new hair color last longer."

Since most rainbow-colored dyes just color the outside of your hair’s cuticle, they’re going to fade a little every time you wash your hair.

If you want to preserve your purple dye as long as possible, look for a sulfate-free shampoo wherever you normally buy your hair supplies. Hot water can also fade your color, so use the coolest water you can stand when you wash your hair. Many drugstores and supermarkets now carry affordable sulfate-free shampoos."

You can enjoy the range of purple shades as your color fades, or you can re-color your hair to keep it looking bold and bright. Luckily, since these products are typically not damaging to your hair, you can use them as often as you like! Many semi-permanent dyes contain rich conditioners, so they can actually make your hair healthier when you use them, as opposed to permanent dyes, which contain harsh chemicals."
