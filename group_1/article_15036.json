[1] X Research source Breezy barns, basements, [1] , or sheds make great locations as long as there’s good airflow, no bright sunlight, and the temperature stays consistently under 90 °F (32 °C). [2] X Research source Lay garlic bulbs in a single layer on a [2] and a fan, or hang them from the ceiling with [3] , [4] , or mesh bags . [3] X Research source Small bulbs cure faster than large ones, and curing takes less time in low humidity. The minimum time to cure garlic completely is 10 to 14 days. Curing is complete when the outer skin is dry and crispy, the neck is constricted, and the center of the stem is hard."

Trim the shoots so there’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) left on top of the bulb. If you plan on braiding the garlic bulbs together for storage, leave the shoots long. [4] X Research source The stems and roots can be trimmed before, during, or after curing. [5] X Research source"

Store them in breathable containers like mesh bags or loosely woven baskets to allow air circulation around the entire bulb. [6] X Research source When the humidity is low (below 75%), cured garlic bulbs can last up to 2 months at room temperature. [7] X Research source For long-term storage, keep cured bulbs around 30 °F (−1 °C). With good airflow, they’ll last up to 7 months. Replant the biggest bulbs for next year’s crop.

      "content": "Braid garlic bulbs together for long-term, decorative storage after drying. The best time to braid is when the stems are half brown, but still pliable. Braid the stems like you’d braid hair—lay 3 stalks on a flat surface and complete 1 or 2 braids, then pull on the stalks so the bulbs are clustered together. [9] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Lay additional stalks over the piece in the center of the braid with the bulb hanging just below the cluster to add them to the braid. Tie the end of the braid with [5] or [6] . It’s easier to braid soft-neck varieties of garlic than hard-neck types. To braid hard-neck garlic, wrap the stems in a warm, damp towel to soften them up first. Hang your garlic braid away from heat and light to prevent sprouting and extend the bulbs’ shelf life."

[32] X Research source If needed, use a soft brush or old toothbrush to help remove dirt. Use damaged bulbs or those with exposed cloves right away instead of drying them. Since the cloves are protected by skin, there’s no need to wash your garlic. It’ll only add moisture and reduce the garlic’s shelf life."
