      "title": "Section out your hair.",
      "content": "Section out your hair. The number of sections you’ll need to create depends on two things: how much hair you have, and how tight or loose you want your curls. The more hair that you use in each twist, the looser the curls will be. In other words, a thick twist using two big chunks of hair will create looser curls than a skinny twist with two small pieces of hair. If you have thin hair and you want loose curls, you may only need to twist two sections. If you have very thick hair and want tight curls, you’ll need much more. When it comes to this hairstyle, this is the step that you’ll want to experiment with a bit. It will take a little bit of practice to determine which kinds of twists create your favorite kinds of curls."
