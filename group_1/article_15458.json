      "title": "Devour a tamale straight out of the wrapper.",
      "content": "Devour a tamale straight out of the wrapper. Simply peel back one end of the wrapper (typically a corn husk or plantain leaf) and start munching. Once you’re done, toss the wrapper in the trash and continue going about your day. Tamales were originally meant to be eaten as a handheld food, the way you might nibble a sandwich or bagel wrapped in deli paper. [1] X Research source Look for tamales being sold as street fare in places with a strong Mexican heritage, or anywhere that food trucks tend to be spotted. Their size and portability makes them perfect for scarfing down on the go. Never eat the wrapper itself."

      "title": "Eat your tamale with a fork and knife.",
      "content": "Eat your tamale with a fork and knife. Unwrap the tamale and discard the wrapper. Then, throw it on a plate and cut it into bite-sized pieces. That way, you won’t have to hold it the whole time you’re eating or worry about getting your hands dirty. Be sure to remove the wrapper entirely from tamales steamed in corn husks. While plantain leaves are edible (though they’re not usually consumed with the tamales), corn husks aren’t, and could cause choking or an upset stomach if swallowed. [2] X Research source Cutting up tamales makes them easier to feed to children, who might make a mess if trusted with the entire portion. Eating with your hands is also an option, but it'll be more messy."

      "title": "Add some salsa or mole for extra flavor.",
      "content": "Add some salsa or mole for extra flavor. Top savory tamales with tangy tomato salsa or salsa verde. Mole, a Mexican sauce made from chocolate, chile peppers, and spices, can also be used to spice up an otherwise plain tamale. Pour your condiment of choice directly onto the unwrapped tamale or dip it to control how much you get with each bite. [3] X Research source Feel free to substitute your own favorite salsa recipes, such as black bean and corn, mango-habanero, or chunky pico de gallo. [4] X Research source If you don’t have any salsa handy, ordinary hot sauce can make an acceptable substitute."

      "title": "Order a sweet tamale for dessert.",
      "content": "Order a sweet tamale for dessert. While most tamales contain spicy or savory fillings, some are made with sweet ingredients like chocolate, raisins, or bananas. It's not uncommon to find sweet tamales on the dessert menu at restaurants that specialize in tamales. [5] X Research source Sweet tamales are often flavored with potent spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom, and may be finished with a spritz of whipped cream or a drizzle of honey."

      "title": "Reheat leftover tamales before enjoying them.",
      "content": "Reheat leftover tamales before enjoying them. If you have a few extra tamales sitting in the refrigerator, there are a number of ways to warm them up without losing that soft, tender texture. Try steaming them in a pot of boiling water using a steamer basket, or throw them into the oven or a hot pan with a little bit of cooking oil for a slightly crispy finish. You can also microwave tamales as a last resort if you have no other options available. Sticking a small glass of water in with them will help keep them from drying out and becoming crumbly. It's not strictly necessary to reheat your tamales before chowing down. While they're most often eaten hot and fresh from the pot, there's no rule that says you can't enjoy them cold!"

      "content": "Wash down a tamale with a steaming mug of atole . Atole is a hot beverage made by simmering ground corn with water and assorted sweet flavorings like chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, and fruit. It is often sipped alongside tamales, making it a perfect addition to your meal. [6] X Research source Freshly-brewed atole is often available at restaurants and food stands that sell tamales. If you want to try your hand at making atole, you can do it using the same masa corn dough that’s used to coat tamales. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Plate tamales with a side of arroz con leche . Arroz con leche, also known as Mexican rice pudding, is another traditional item that’s frequently paired with tamales. It is prepared by boiling long-grain white rice with milk and cinnamon sticks until it takes on a custard-like consistency. Refrigerate the pudding to help it thicken and serve it chilled. [8] X Research source Sprinkle a small handful of raisins, chopped nuts, or ground cinnamon over the top to apply the finishing touches. A cup of arroz con leche makes a great companion for mild tamales eaten with breakfast."

      "content": "Smother hearty tamales with chili. Place a tamale at the bottom of a bowl and cover it with a few ladlefuls of homemade chili. Dress your smothered tamale with shredded cheese , sour cream, diced tomatoes and onions , or any of your other favorite chili fixin’s. Chili is most often served with heavier types of tamales filled with ground beef, pork, or cheese."

      "content": "Try a Chicago-style “Mother-in-Law” sandwich. If you’re looking for a somewhat unconventional take on the old-fashioned tamale, stick a fresh beef tamale in a hot dog bun along with a generous amount of chili. Save some room for signature Chicago toppings like yellow mustard, onions, pickle relish, tomato slices, sport peppers, and celery salt. [9] X Research source A Mother-in-Law may be served in a bun, but when fully-loaded, it’s anything but a finger food. Be sure to have plenty of napkins nearby!"
