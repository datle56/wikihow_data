Use a utility knife to cut along the edges and remove any jagged pieces of drywall paper. [1] X Research source The goal is to clean the hole up enough that the wall repair patch will sit flat on top of it with no loose debris or ragged paper edges pushing against it or interfering with the adhesive. This method works for holes that are up to about 6 in (15 cm) in diameter. Wall patches come in sizes up to 7–8 in (18–20 cm) in diameter, and the patch needs to be slightly bigger than the hole to adhere to the wall around it."

      "content": "Create a repair patch that is about 1 in (2.5 cm) bigger than the hole. Use sharp scissors to cut a wall repair patch so that it is approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) taller and 1 in (2.5 cm) wider than the hole in the wall. This will allow it to adhere firmly to the intact wall surrounding the hole. [2] X Expert Source Agustin Renoj Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. [3] X Research source You can buy wall repair patches in different sizes, so you can also just buy one that is the right size. Wall repair patches are made of a mesh material that is able to support spackling on top of it."

      "content": "Peel the backing off the patch and stick it over the hole. Remove the lining from the adhesive on the back of the patch. Center it over the hole and press down firmly around all the sides to stick it to the wall. [4] X Research source You don’t need to wait for the patch to dry on the wall, the adhesive patch will be sealed and ready to cover up as soon as you stick it on."

[5] X Expert Source Agustin Renoj Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. Overlap the coat onto the surrounding wall by about 1 in (2.5 cm). [6] X Research source Overlapping the joint compound onto the surrounding wall will make it easier to blend in so the patch isn’t noticeable."

      "content": "Sand the patch with fine-grit sandpaper until it is smooth. Attach a piece of 120- to 150-grit sandpaper to a sanding block or just sand by hand. Lightly sand the entire patch down until it is smooth and blends in with the surrounding wall. [8] X Research source Don’t sand too hard or you might expose the mesh patch below the compound. Just focus on smoothing out any rough spots and blending it in with the wall."

Let it dry for 24 hours, then sand it down with fine-grit sandpaper until it is smooth and blends in with the wall. [9] X Research source If you want to make the joint compound textured, you can dab it with a sponge while it is still wet or use a textured paint roller to apply a final thin layer of watered-down compound. If you’re ready to paint the wall , use a water-based primer to prime the patch before applying wall paint."

Cut a piece of drywall to the same width as, or just slightly wider, than the hole but a full 2 in (5.1 cm) taller. The extra height will allow you to attach it to the inside of the hole with adhesive. [12] X Research source You can purchase small pieces of drywall for patching that are 2 ft (0.61 m) in diameter."

Twist or push a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) or 2 in (5.1 cm) drywall screw through the middle of the drywall patch you made so there is still enough sticking up for you to grab onto. This will allow you to hold it against the inside of the hole while you let the adhesive dry. [13] X Research source If you don’t have a drywall screw you can use a wood screw instead."

Straighten it out so it is oriented correctly and pull it towards the inside of the wall so the adhesive makes contact. Hold it in place for about 15 minutes until the adhesive has dried enough to hold it in place. [15] X Research source You can either push the screw through the patch into the wall void once it has dried or unscrew it and pull it out."

      "content": "Let the first layer of joint compound dry for 24 hours. Leave the patch to dry for about 24 hours so it is totally cured before sanding. This is especially important since this layer is relatively thick and it will take longer to dry than a thin layer of joint compound. [17] X Research source If you don’t let the joint compound dry completely, there will be moisture trapped inside that can cause the patch to fall apart."

[19] X Research source If you need to make the joint compound textured to match the rest of the wall, use a textured roller to apply the watered-down compound as the final layer or dab the final layer with a sponge while it is still wet. Remember to let the final coat dry for at least 24 hours before priming the patch and painting the wall ."
