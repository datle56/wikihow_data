      "content": "Feel below the puppy’s belly button for a raised spot. Just like you, a dog has a belly button—it’s usually located almost at the center of the belly, just below the rib cage. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source If your puppy is male, there will be another small raised spot or “button” of flesh about an inch or so below their belly button. This is the prepuce, or sheath, of the puppy’s penis. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source The prepuce also has a small hole at the center. There may be little wispy hairs around or in the prepuce. The belly button or umbilicus forms from the scar left behind after the umbilical cord falls off. If the puppy was born within the last few days, the umbilical cord may still be attached. Once the umbilical cord shrivels and falls off (which happens within a few days), there will be a little, slightly thicker scar left behind on the belly. Warning: Do not attempt to pull out or unsheathe a male puppy’s penis until the puppy is at least 6 months old. Dogs have an os penis or “penis bone.” You may damage the penis or penis bone if you attempt to forcibly unsheathe a young male dog’s penis."

      "content": "Examine the puppy’s rear end for a fleshy mound. A puppy’s anus is located directly under its tail. If your puppy is male, you will only be able to see its anus. If your puppy is female, you will see a raised, fleshy area just under the anus. This is the vulva. [4] X Research source The vulva of a female puppy is small and leaf-shaped. It has a vertical slit. It is usually located almost directly between the puppy’s hind legs. The vulva may have some wispy hairs on it."

[5] X Research source If the puppy is 8 weeks or older, the testicles can be seen high up between the puppy’s hind legs. [6] X Research source When a male puppy is born, his testicles are inside his body. After 2 weeks, the testicles start to drop into the scrotum. Both testicles typically drop within 6 months.

      "content": "Pick up the puppy gently. Newborn and young puppies are very delicate, so make sure to handle them with care. Puppies can’t see or hear very well before they’re a few weeks old, so picking them up and holding them may make them nervous or fussy. So, when you do have to pick them up, do so gently and slowly. [11] X Research source Never pick up a puppy by its tail. Slide your hand under as much of the body as possible to offer the best support as you pick up the puppy. Handle puppies as little as possible during their first 2 weeks after birth. Over-handling them could upset the mother dog or harm the puppies. [12] X Research source"

Make sure not to squeeze the puppy. [13] X Research source When trying to determine the sex, it may be easier if someone else holds the puppy so you can do the visual inspection. You can also rest them on their backs on a warm towel spread on a table. This can help keep the puppy warm."

If you notice signs of her getting distressed, such as barking at you, put the puppy back with the mother.

At the end of the day, pick a dog that best fits your lifestyle based on temperament, energy levels, and physicality. Female and male dogs have many similarities, but they can also differ in size and personality. For instance, female dogs tend to be more sociable and smaller in size, while males are more protective and larger in size. Here are the leading differences between a boy and girl dog: [17] X Research source Male dogs have testosterone, which can cause roaming, mounting, and urine marking. Female dogs have ovaries and produce estrogen and progesterone, which can lead to heat cycles or vaginal bleeding (unless spayed). Males tend to be larger in size and weight when compared to females. Females tend to be more social, while males prefer alone time. Females are considered more trainable when compared to males. [18] X Research source Keep in mind that a dog’s breed, environment, and upbringing can play a big part in their personality and overall temperament."
