      "content": "Scout for small nests on your property in the early spring. Hornet nests are small and easier to remove in the early spring. A nest that's around the size of a ping pong ball probably only contains a queen and unhatched eggs, so you can just spray it down with a hose. [1] X Research source You'll need insecticide to get rid of a larger nest. By summer, nests can grow to the size of a basketball and contain thousands of hornets."

At a minimum, wear a thick, long-sleeved shirt, pants, thick leather or rubber gloves, and boots. Coveralls can add extra protection, and a beekeeper's veil can protect your head and face. [3] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. If you can't access a veil, you should wear protective goggles and a hat that covers your ears. To prevent hornets from getting into your clothing, use rubber bands or duct tape to secure your sleeves to your gloves and your pants to your boots."

      "content": "Lure and track the hornets if you don't know the nest's location. If you've seen hornets buzzing but aren't sure where the nest is, observe which direction they fly. When they find food, hornets collect what they can and bring it back to the nest. [4] X Research source Try leaving out bait, such as pieces of fruit or meat, then watch it from inside your home. When hornets show interest, look for the direction they fly away, then follow them. Eventually, you should be able to track down the nest."

      "content": "Place a marker 15 to 20 ft (4.6 to 6.1 m) away from the nest. A hornet's nest is gray or beige, shaped like a rounded teardrop, and can be as large as a basketball. They usually hang from trees, but you might find one on the ground. Once you find the nest, stay a safe distance away, and mark your spot so you can find the nest later. [5] X Research source While you're at the nest, see if you can find the opening. Hornet nests usually have a single small opening toward the bottom. You might want to use binoculars to look for the hole so you don't have to get too close. You'll need to apply insecticide at night, so mark your spot with a brightly colored flag that you'll be able to see in the dark."

Find a pressurized can of aerosol insecticide labeled for wasps and hornets at a home improvement store or garden center. Check the label, and make sure that it produces a solid stream that reaches at least 15 ft (4.6 m).

      "content": "Treat the nest with insecticide at night. [7] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. The best time to treat a hornet nest with insecticide is around 2 hours after dusk. Hornets are least active at night, and most of the workers return to the nest after dusk. Since they remain active after sunset, European hornets are an exception to this rule. [8] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. For this species, the best time to spray is just before sunrise when it's still dark. European hornets can grow over 1 in (2.5 cm) in length, and have a reddish-brown head and thorax (the middle section of the body). Other wasps and hornets don't have this reddish-brown coloring."

      "content": "Use a flashlight with a red filter to find the nest. Hornets have trouble seeing red light, so secure a sheet of red cellophane over your flashlight with a rubber band. That way, you'll be able to see where you're going without disturbing the nest. [9] X Research source You'll attract unwanted attention if you use an unfiltered flashlight. Remember to wear protective clothing when you approach the nest. Keep in mind treating a hornet or wasp nest yourself is risky, and protective clothing does not make you invincible."

Again, binoculars can help you get a good view without getting too close. When you find the opening, spray a steady stream of insecticide at it for at least 5 to 10 seconds. [10] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. The goal is to keep the nest intact as you soak the opening. That way, any hornets that come out and try to attack with come into contact with the insecticide. Do your best to hold the stream for several seconds, but don't stick around longer than necessary. If you hear angry, swarming hornets, cover your head with your hands and run toward shelter."

If you see any remaining active hornets, go back to the nest after dark and apply more insecticide. [11] X Research source Larger nests might take 2 or 3 applications. When you're sure the nest is vacant, swat it down from a tree branch or, if it's on the ground, cover it with soil."
