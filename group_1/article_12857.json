      "content": "Severe pain It is normal to experience severe pain right after you break your thumb. The pain happens because your bones have nerves surrounding them. When a bone breaks, it can irritate or compress the surrounding nerves, which causes pain. If you don’t experience severe pain right after the injury, there is a chance that your thumb is not broken. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If your thumb is broken, you will also most likely experience severe pain if something touches your thumb or when you try to bend it. If you’re experiencing intense, acute pain, you’re probably dealing with a break, rather than a sprain, the latter of which involves less intense, more manageable pain. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Generally, the closer the pain is to the joint where your thumb meets the rest of your hand (closest to the webbing between your thumb and forefinger), the more cause for concern and the greater the potential for complication of the injury."

Also check to see if there is any bone protruding out of the skin. If you notice any of these characteristics, it is very likely that you have broken your thumb. [3] X Research source If broken, your thumb will also most likely have bruises on it, which is a sign that the capillaries in the tissue of the thumb have broken open. While a sprained thumb may also be misshapen due to swelling, broken thumbs often involve much more prominent or irregular deformities.

Your ligaments connecting your bones will also most likely be unable to function properly, which can also make it difficult to move your thumb. [5] X Research source In particular, check to see if you can move your thumb backwards. If you can move it backwards without pain, your thumb may be sprained rather than broken."

      "content": "Numbness, tingling, or coldness Aside from causing pain, compressed nerves can also make your thumb go numb. Your thumb might also begin to feel cold. This is because a fractured bone or a lot of swelling can block the blood vessels that carry blood into your thumb and surrounding tissue. [6] X Research source Consult a doctor immediately to treat any numbness in your hand . Your thumb might also turn blue if it is receiving very little or no blood. A sprained thumb often isn't accompanied by numbness or tingling. [7] X Research source"

After the thumb swells, it may begin to stiffen. [8] X Research source Since thumb sprains can also cause severe swelling, swelling alone isn’t enough to diagnose a broken thumb. It’s best to see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. [9] X Research source The swelling in your thumb might also affect the closest fingers to your thumb."

If you wait too long, the swelling caused by the broken bone can actually make it too difficult to realign the bones, which means that your thumb could be permanently bent. [10] X Research source In addition, broken thumbs in children can permanently affect their growth by damaging their growth plates. Even if you suspect the injury might be a sprain (or torn ligament) rather than a bone fracture, see a doctor anyway for an accurate diagnosis.

This will determine the complexity of the treatment options available. Extra-articular fractures are those that take place away from a joint along the length of 1 of the 2 bones in the thumb. While painful and requiring 6 weeks to heal, these fractures do not typically require surgical intervention. Intra-articular fractures take place along the joint, often requiring surgical intervention to help the patient retain as much movement in the joint after recovery as possible. Of the intra-articular thumb fractures, the 2 most common are a Bennett fracture and a Rolando fracture . In both, the thumb fractures (and likely dislocates) along the carpometacarpal joint (the thumb joint closest to the hand). The major difference between the 2 intra-articular fractures is that a Rolando fracture involves 3 or more bone fragments that almost always require surgical realignment, while a Bennett fracture is a single, clean break and may occasionally forgo surgery [17] X Research source"

[20] X Research source Note that some Rolando fractures, especially those where the bones are shattered into too many pieces to screw or pin together, may also be treated in this method with the surgeon molding the fragments to the best of his ability (known as an open reduction).

Having a surgeon open the hand to place small screws or pins into the bones in order to keep them properly aligned. This is known as “internal fixation.” Potential complications from surgical options include nerve or ligament injuries, stiffness, and increased risk of arthritis. [23] X Research source"
