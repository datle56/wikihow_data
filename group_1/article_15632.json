If you are not sure, use a formal and respectful tone. [7] X Research source Personalize your email. If you are excited about the job, then say so. If you have any unique skills or experience that make you stand out from the crowd, make sure to mention them. An employer will be more likely to remember you if you impress them with your passion.
