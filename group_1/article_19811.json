Then you can market yourself on social media, web forums, Discord, or in other Roblox games. The following are some trades you can develop and market: Scripting — Scripting is one of the most important jobs when developing a game. It's also one of the highest-paying jobs. If you are talented at scripting, you may be able to earn some Robux by scripting for Robux games. Building — Another thing you can do to earn Robux is to develop your building skills and make things for Roblox games . This could be anything, including buildings, weapons, or vehicles. While you can build things inside Roblox Studio, many builders are utilizing external 3D modeling software, such as Blender 3D to create things. So if you have skills as a 3D modeler, you may be able to earn some Robux building objects and worlds for games. Graphic Design — Graphic designers create image graphics. They use graphic design programs like Photoshop and Illustrator to create icons, and game thumbnail images. Sometimes they create the HUD or user interface for a game. Animation — Animators use their skills to create animations for objects, non-player characters, and avatars. This is a little different skill from 3D modeling. If you have experience animating, you may be able to make some Robux creating animations for games."
