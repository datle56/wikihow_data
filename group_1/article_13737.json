      "content": "Master the candlestick. The “candlestick” position in gymnastics involves lying flat on your back, then raising your legs and torso into the air perpendicular to the floor so you resemble a candle stick. [1] X Research source Stretch your arms out at a forty-five degree angle from each side of your body to support your core and legs as you raise them up at straight as you can. [2] X Research source Practice rolling up and into then back from the “candlestick” position."

      "content": "Run through your approach and punch. The way you make your approach and execute the punch (your departure from the floor) will determine the height and distance of your jump. Practice your approach by taking a five rapid steps toward your jump. Put your feet together and launch yourself as high into the air as you can with your feet together and toes pointed. Keep your arms up with your elbows straight through your practice jumps."

      "title": "Execute a forward roll.",
      "content": "Execute a forward roll. The forward roll makes up the second half of the dive roll, after the approach and punch. Start by squatting down on the balls of your feet. Place your hands flat on the floor, then tuck your head and lean forward the back of your head is aligned with your hands. Push forward with your legs until you begin to roll, then tuck your body and keep your back rounded. Complete the technique on your rear end or roll up onto your feet. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Begin your approach.",
      "content": "Begin your approach. Take five strong running steps before jumping off the floor and make sure your body is tight as you jump off of the floor or mat. Ensure your arms are above your head and your feet are together. Tighten your stomach and rear end in the air to prepare to tuck. Imagine there is an invisible bar in front of you that you need to dive over and past in order to land safely. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Prepare yourself to land in the air.",
      "content": "Prepare yourself to land in the air. Think of yourself as jumping out of a window to help yourself put your body into position. Keep your chin tucked to your chest to protect yourself as you jump. [5] X Research source Move your body so your hands, while still above your head, are the first part of you to make contact with the floor. Try to avoid bending your body at a ninety degree angle, instead try to keep relatively straight. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your hands to control your landing.",
      "content": "Use your hands to control your landing. Your hands should come into contact with the floor first. Keep the pressure on your hands from the moment they touch the floor until you roll through and complete the movement. [7] X Research source Let your arms bend slightly to slow your descent as your roll forward. Be careful not to land on your head or neck, as either can cause serious injury. Instead try to roll onto your shoulders, then to your back."

      "title": "Let your momentum carry you.",
      "content": "Let your momentum carry you. As you land, allow your body to continue to roll until you are back on your rear end. Keep your chin tucked until you are done rolling forward. Bend your legs as you come down to better allow your body to roll. As you reach your rear end, stretch your hands out straight from your body as though you’re reaching for a bar to help pull you up."

      "title": "Place your feet flat on the floor.",
      "content": "Place your feet flat on the floor. By bending your legs as you roll, you will be able to place your feet on the floor. Bring your feet close to your rear end, so as you roll they end up flat on the floor. Keep your hands extended outward to help you gain your balance as you roll onto your feet."

      "content": "Stand up with your arms outstretched above your head. Once your feet are on the ground, you need to stand up to complete the technique. As you stand, shift your hands from reaching out in front of you to straight above your head. Straighten your elbows and hug your biceps to your ears for proper competition form. Keep your heels together as you stand."
