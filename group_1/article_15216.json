      "content": "Cut the stem at a 45 degree angle with shears or a sharp knife. Hold the stem under water as you cut it down to 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 centimeters). Cutting the stem at an angle will prevent it from sitting flat against the bottom of the cup. Cutting it under water will prevent air bubbles from forming. Both of these will help the rose absorb the dye better. [1] X Research source Take this time to trim off any thorns and leaves as well. Cut the stems shorter if you want the roses to soak up the dye faster. This will also help the roses turn out brighter. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Set the rose into the water, then wait for it to change color.",
      "content": "Set the rose into the water, then wait for it to change color. This will take at least 4 hours, so be patient! The longer you wait, the deeper the color will become. After 4 hours or so, the rose will take on a pastel color. If you want it to be a deeper color, you will have to wait 1 to 2 days. Keep in mind that the roses will be streaky and speckled. [5] X Research source Rose petals will have small veins. They will look darker after you finish dyeing the rose. If this bothers you, leave the rose in the dye longer. [6] X Research source For an interesting effect, dye the rose in one color for about 3 hours, then put it in a different color for 2 hours, then a third color for 1 hour."

[8] X Research source If you are using shorter glasses, you can split the stems only 3 inches (7.6 centimeters). [9] X Research source If your rose had a very thick stem to begin with, you can cut the stem into three or four sections instead. [10] X Research source If you snap the stem by mistake, cut the entire stem down to 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2 centimeters), and dye it a single color. [11] X Research source"

Choose your preferred dye, then prepare it in one of the following ways: [18] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Mix ink or food coloring into 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Stir in 1 tablespoon (13 grams) of alum. Mix fabric dye in 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Use enough dye to get the color you want. Prepare floral dye according to the instructions on the package."

While the rose dries, you can dye more roses, if you need to. Don't get impatient, however; if you use the rose while the dye is still wet, you will risk staining your skin, clothing, and other items in your arrangement. If you dyed a fresh rose, make sure that you fill the vase with water so that it doesn't wilt. Dried roses do not need water, however."

Because you only dyed the flower part, you do not have to worry about the dye leaching back into the water. This means that you can use a clear vase without worrying about the water changing color."
