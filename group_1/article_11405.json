      "content": "Slice off the top of the pomegranate with a sharp knife. Drag a small knife around the top of the pomegranate (about ¼ in or 0.6 cm down), just deep enough to pierce the skin. Then, peel the top off with your hand and discard. If you can’t easily peel it off, cut a bit deeper with the knife. [1] X Research source If you’re worried about making a mess, go ahead and submerge the pomegranate in a bowl of water now. This way, the juice won’t splatter all over you and your kitchen. It’s also okay to do this on a cutting board, however. Cigliano recommends “using a paring knife to remove the little stem, known as the flower, at the top of the fruit.”"

      "title": "Score the pomegranate into sections.",
      "content": "Score the pomegranate into sections. Scoring refers to cutting slits in the surface of food. When looking at the top of the pomegranate, you’ll notice the seeds are separated into 5-8 sections with white pith between them. Run your knife down each white area, being careful to pierce just the skin of the pomegranate and no deeper. [2] X Research source Some pomegranates may have gentle ridges on the outside of the fruit where the sections separate. Try aligning your knife with these ridges to cut in the right place. If you can’t find them, Cigliano says “just make about six evenly spaced cuts around the fruit.” Cigliano says it’s okay if you accidentally cut too deep, as “it’s just going to be a little messier.”"

      "title": "Peel it open and submerge in a bowl of water.",
      "content": "Peel it open and submerge in a bowl of water. Gently peel back each section of the fruit so you have access to all the seeds (or arils). [3] X Research source Fill a large bowl with water and add the pomegranate. Submerging the fruit in water will make it easier (and less messy) to remove the seeds. If you have trouble peeling back the sections, hold the pomegranate upside down over the water and press your thumb into the bottom of the fruit to pop out each section. It’s important to do this over the water in case some seeds come loose in the process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the seeds.",
      "content": "Remove the seeds. Gently run your thumb over the seeds to loosen them. Because the pomegranate is submerged in water, most of the seeds should come off fairly easily, though there may be a few that are stubborn. Just keep working the seeds with your hands until they all come loose. [4] X Research source It’s also possible to remove the seeds this way without submerging them in water. However, the water helps prevent the seeds from staining your skin and juice from squirting all over your kitchen. If you’re having trouble removing the seeds, Cigliano suggests you “pull the edges of each section back towards you to push the seeds out and into the bowl.”"

    {
      "title": "Skim the pith and drain the seeds.",
      "content": "Skim the pith and drain the seeds. As you remove the seeds, they’ll sink to the bottom of the bowl while the pith will float to the top. Scoop the pith out with a spoon and discard it. Then, drain the seeds into a colander and pick out any remaining pith with your hands. The pomegranate seeds are now ready to eat! [5] X Research source It’s okay if you miss a bit of the pith. Cigliano says it’s safe to eat, but “it’s bitter and most people choose to discard it.”"

      "title": "Cut or score the pomegranate and hit it with a spoon to knock the seeds out.",
      "content": "Cut or score the pomegranate and hit it with a spoon to knock the seeds out. Either cut the pomegranate with the scoring method listed above or slice it in half horizontally. Hold the open pomegranate over a bowl and whack the outside skin with a wooden spoon repeatedly. This should loosen most of the seeds and cause them to fall into the bowl. There may be a few stubborn ones you’ll need to remove with your fingers. [6] X Research source While cutting the pomegranate in half will work, you’ll have better access to all the arils if you separate it into sections. It may be helpful to do this method over a bowl of water so it’s less messy, but this is also a good option if you don’t have access to water when cutting your pomegranate."

In fact, whole pomegranate seeds contain 4 grams of fiber, compared to the 0.1 grams found in strained pomegranate juice. These arils are a healthy, crunchy, and flavorful snack.

      "content": "Press pomegranates with a juicer. Cut your pomegranate into small enough pieces to fit in your juicer. It’s okay to include the rind and the pith for this method. One at a time, add each piece to the juicer with the cut side (the side with the seeds) facing down. Steadily squeeze the juice into a large bowl. The juice will likely splatter, so it may help to work over a sink. [10] X Research source Be sure to press, not twist, the fruit as you juice it. Pomegranate rind contains tannins, so the juice will be bitter. Feel free to mix in your preferred sweetener."

      "content": "Or, mash the seeds in a plastic bag. Remove the seeds from the pomegranate and place them inside a sealable plastic bag. Make sure the bag is properly sealed, and push out as much air as possible. Then, run a rolling pin over the seeds to cause them to burst and release their juice. When all the seeds have burst, pour the juice through a strainer into a bowl and discard the crunchy parts. [11] X Research source It’s also possible to crush the seeds with a sieve, food mill, or in a blender."
