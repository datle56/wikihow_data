      "content": "Find casual pants with a masculine fit. Casual pants that fit well are a staple in a male wardrobe, as they can be worn in most everyday situations. [1] X Research source Jeans are the most versatile pant. They should be worn an inch or two lower on the waist than chinos or corduroys, about three to four inches below your navel. Jeans should have a consistent fit throughout the leg. Avoid jeans that are too tight in the thigh and loose under the knee. Slim-style jeans flatter most body types. Sweatpants are the most casual pant, usually worn in athletic or relaxing situations. When wearing sweatpants out in public, try brands that also make formal pants; they're more likely to fit slimmer and look better than the typical gym sweatpants found in discount stores. Pair sweatpants with other well-fitting clothes and a pair of high-end sneakers to avoid looking too aloof. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the right fit for dress pants. Formal pants are important for presenting a clean, conservative look- perfect for the office and special events. Suit pants and dress trousers are the most formal pant option. The top of the pants should come to the top of your hip bone. They should fit well enough in the waist that you don't need a belt, but drape more loosely over the legs. Avoid wearing pleated pants, as they can add the illusion of extra weight, especially in the seat. Chinos and corduroys offer a more casual look than suit pants, but can still be worn in most professional environments. These should fit slimmer than suit pants and worn an inch or two lower on the waist. If you're wearing chinos in a conservative setting, opt for a slightly looser fit. If wearing casually, you can size them slimmer. You can tell when these pants are too tight if the pockets don't lay flat against the pants, creating \"pocket flares.\" When shopping for chinos, keep in mind that the waist and seat tend to stretch with wear."

      "title": "Wear casual shirts that fit well.",
      "content": "Wear casual shirts that fit well. Casual shirts, despite their informality, can look great when sized and worn correctly. They can be worn with chinos, jeans, or sweatpants. T-shirts and long-sleeved shirts are more casual than button-ups and sweaters. They should fit looser around the neck. If a shirt has a V-neck, the cut of the V should go no deeper than your sternum. A t-shirt or long-sleeved shirt should have a slim fit through the torso, a little looser than a button-up. The shirt should be long enough to cover the belt loops of your pants without going past the pants zipper. Longer, looser T-shirts are best for a laid-back vibe, while more fitted, shorter T-shirts look sleeker. Many T-shirts and long-sleeved shirts are made primarily of cotton, which shrinks easily when washed. Size up or hang dry your shirts to avoid shrinkage. Undershirts should be worn under other kinds of shirts. They should fit tighter than a T-shirt, and have the same kind of collar as the shirt you're wearing over it. Choose a color like gray that will match most kinds of shirts and be inconspicuous under other clothing."

A well-fitted dress shirt rounds off an outfit to create a crisp, professional look. [3] X Research source Button-up shirts can be worn for professional and casual situations. The collar of a button-up shirt should fit as closely to the neck without constricting it. The sleeves should fit well, without being too tight or too loose. The shirt cuff should come to where your wrist meets your hand. The body of the shirt should fit closely to your torso, without being skin-tight. A button-up should come down just past the belt loops in length. They should be worn tucked in to pants for a refined look; however, they can be worn untucked with jeans or chinos in a more informal climate. Sweaters can also be worn in both formal and informal settings. They should fit slim throughout the body. Thin sweaters can fit tighter while chunky sweaters can fit a little looser. Thin sweaters should be worn to your belt loops; thicker sweaters and cardigans can be worn long. Crew neck sweaters should allow plenty of room for your neck and a collared shirt underneath. The neckline ofV-neck sweaters should dip down no further than the middle of your sternum. Turtleneck sweaters should fit tighter in the neck, while shawl neck sweaters are loose in the neck. No one kind of sweater is considered more or less formal; they all can be worn in a variety of situations. [4] X Research source"
