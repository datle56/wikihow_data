You can buy white shoes and have them dyed, or go with a neutral; nude or black heels look amazing with almost any dress color. Bring your dress to the shoe store so you can try them on together to make sure they work. Break in your heels before the big day. Wear them around the house and outside on the concrete to scuff the soles up a bit. This will make your shoes more comfortable and less likely to slip when you're walking around on the night of prom. Consider bringing backup flats. If you aren't used to wearing tall heels, your feet might start to hurt. Have a backup pair of neutral ballet flats you can slip on just in case."

Either way, it's fun to go with a big group of people you have dinner with before prom and party with after.

Once your group is set, you can all start planning together. Make a Facebook group that includes everyone who is part of your prom group. You can talk about where you're going to meet, where to have dinner, etc. Decide how your group is going to handle prom photos, too. Who will be in the pictures? Do you want to take them at someone's house, or will you have them professionally done at prom? Discuss with the group."

If your parents aren't happy about your plans, a good strategy is to try to include them a little more. Ask them to take pictures beforehand, or ask their opinion on what restaurant to choose. The more involved they are, the more likely they'll be to help you have a fantastic night your way. If your parents haven't met your date or the people you'll be spending the night with introduce them in advance so they'll feel like they're in the loop."
