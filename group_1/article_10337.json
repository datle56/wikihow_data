      "content": "Hold your mouth tightly when you speak. It doesn't do any good to learn words in German if you're not saying them right. Remember that Germans have a lot of tension in their cheeks when they speak. To sound like a German, you need to hold your mouth right. When you open your mouth, shape it as if you are forming a large \"o\" or a lowercase \"u.\" Try to find videos of people speaking German so you can understand how they keep their mouth when speaking. Germans also pronounce some consonants and vowels differently than English speakers would."

      "title": "Learn how to pronounce German vowels.",
      "content": "Learn how to pronounce German vowels. Although German does share some things in common with English, some of the vowels are pronounced differently. This will be very important when you try to count in German. [1] X Research source In German, the vowel combination of \"ei\" is pronounced like the \"i\" in \"lie\" or the \"y\" in \"dry.\" For example, the word \"drei\" in German means three. However, it's pronounced \"dry.\" Similarly, the word \"frei\" means free in German. It's pronounced \"fry.\" It's the opposite for the vowel combination \"ie.\" This combination is pronounced like the \"ee\" in the English word \"free.\" So when you say the German word for four (\"vier\") remember to pronounce the \"ie\" in it as \"ee.\" The vowel combination of \"eu\" is pronounced \"oy\" in German. If you see an umlaut over a vowel, you pronounce that vowel differently. The German word for \"five\" has an umlaut: fünf. To make the \"ü\"-sound, say \"ee\" as in the English word \"see\" while pursing your lips as if you were whistling, almost closing them completely. Keep your tongue in the same position as when saying \"ee\", but change the shape of your mouth as if you were saying \"oo\"."

      "content": "Understand how to pronounce German consonants. One of the key ways that speaking German differs from English is how you pronounce some consonants. Some will be pronounced similarly to English, but not all. [2] X Research source The consonant \"v\" is pronounced as an \"f\" sound. So make an \"f\" sound, not a \"v\" sound, when you pronounce the German word for four. In German, the consonant \"s\" is pronounced as a \"z\" when it starts a word, such as \"sieben\" (the German word for seven). When the letter \"r\" ends a word, it's pronounced lightly, as in \"uh.\" The letter \"r\" is also pronounced very lightly when it's in the middle of a word. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth as you say it. [3] X Research source So, the word in German for four \"vier\" is pronounced \"feeah.\" When the consonant \"z\" starts a word, pronounce it as \"ts.\""

      "content": "Understand how to count past 10 in German. Once you've mastered basic German pronunciation and how to count past 10, try counting higher! It's easy. [14] X Research source Put the word \"zehn\" after each number to indicate you've added 10 when counting from 13-19. So, \"neunzehn\" is how you say 19 and \"achtzehn\" is how you say 18, and so on. However, the German word for 16 is \"sechzehn\" (zekh-tsehn), not \"sechs-zehn\" (zecks-tsehn). It is best to listen to it to get the German \"ch\"-sound right. The word for 17 is \"siebzehn\" (zeeb-tsehn), not \"sieben-zehn\" (zeebhen-tsehn). Eleven is \"elf\" and 12 is \"zwölf.\" Twenty is \"zwanzig.\" To count past 20, start with the German word for the second number and add the word for the number 1-10 and \"und\" and then \"zwanzig.\" So, 21 is \"einundzwanzig,\" which literally means \"1 and 20\" (while dropping the \"s\" in \"eins.\") To say 22, follow the same process. The word for 22 is \"zweiundzwanzig.\" And so on through 29. Follow the same process all the way up to 100. However, instead of zwanzig, put the words for 30 (\"dreißig\" - the ß is like a double \"s\" and pronounced the same as the \"s\" in English), 40 (\"vierzig\" - pronounced \"feahtsig'), 50 (\"fünfzig\"), 60 (\"sechzig\"), 70 (\"siebzig\"), 80 (\"achtzig\"), and 90 (\"neunzig\"). The German word for 100 is \"(ein)hundert\" (pronounce \"u\" like \"oo.\")"
