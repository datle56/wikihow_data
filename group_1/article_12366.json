Search your files until you find one or more you want to eliminate. If you don’t remember where you put a photo or aren’t sure which folder your PC saves to automatically, you can use your PC’s file search option to locate it. Simply type in the name or keyword from the photo and the file and its location should appear. For the sake of convenience, save all your photos in one location (i.e. a folder labelled “Photos” in your “Documents” folder). Creating different folders to categorize photos can help keep them organized."

Look for the “delete” option near the bottom of the list. Left click this option once to delete the photo. [1] X Research source Deleting a file relocates it to the trash folder on your desktop. You can pinpoint specific files you want to delete by holding the “Ctrl” key and then clicking the files individually. This is a much faster and more efficient way to get rid of multiple photos than deleting them one at a time. [2] X Research source"

Then, move your pointer to the trash can icon on your desktop and release the photo to drop it in. On computers that run Microsoft Windows, the trash folder is known as the “Recycle Bin.” [3] X Research source Drag multiple photos to the trash simultaneously by clicking and dragging your pointer around a group of files to select them all.

      "content": "Empty your trash can to free up storage space. The trash folder holds files that have been deleted but not erased entirely from the hard drive, so they’ll still take up memory. To permanently remove these files, you’ll need to empty the trash can. Right click the trash can icon and select “empty trash can” from the drop-down menu. After you empty your trash can, the files you’ve deleted will no longer be on your computer. Make sure you’re okay with losing the photos you’ve deleted before emptying your trash can. Once they’re gone, the only way to recover the deleted files is to run a system restore, which reverts your computer to the way it was at an earlier date. Empty your trash can regularly. This can help to free up storage space on your PC."

For non-iPhone users, your photo manager app may appear among your other app icons or in a scrolling bar at the bottom of the screen. Inside your photo app, you’ll find all of the photos you’ve taken or saved, along with the various subfolders they’ve been grouped into—selfies, Panoramas, Instagram photos, etc."

On most devices, this appears as an icon in the form of a trash can. Tap this icon to select the photo for deletion. [7] X Research source Most devices will ask you to confirm whether or not you want to delete the photo. Simply choose “delete” to move forward with the process, or “cancel” if you’ve changed your mind. Choosing to delete a photo doesn’t actually remove it from your phone. Instead, it sends it to a “recently deleted” folder, where it can be either be recovered or permanently erased."

After you’ve finished selecting the photos, your phone will erase all of them at the same time.

Be careful not to accidentally select a photo you want to keep."

To erase it from your device once and for all, go back to the main screen of your photo app and look for the “recently deleted” folder. All the photos you’ve deleted will remain here for a certain amount of time before they’re erased automatically. To speed up this process, tap the “select” option and either choose which photos you want to delete permanently or hit “delete all” to clear the photos out of your storage. [9] X Research source It’s impossible to recover a photo after it’s been erased from the deleted files folder, so be certain you can live without it. Photos will usually stay in the “recently deleted” folder for 30 days before they’re automatically deleted. [10] X Research source"

The Cloud is an non-local form of mass storage, which means it saves files separately from your device. Most new smartphones and PCs provide users the option of uploading files to the Cloud so that they can free up space on the device itself without losing things they want to keep. [11] X Research source On iPhones and iPads, the default cloud-storage service is called iCloud; devices that run Android and Other operating systems typically come equipped with Dropbox or Google Drive.

Your photos will then remain there safe and sound in your email so that you can re-download them whenever you choose. Just make sure you have enough available storage in your email to house the attachment. Most email programs offer storage of up to a few gigabytes, more than enough for the average person that doesn’t often exchange large files. Group lots of photos into a folder in order to send them as a single large attachment rather than numerous smaller ones. [13] X Research source"

Your photos will be saved physically on the drive, which you can reconnect to download, modify or remove.
