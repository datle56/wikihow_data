It can be pretty overwhelming if you try to declutter everything at once, explains professional organizer Keith Bartolomei. [1] X Expert Source Keith Bartolomei Professional Organizer & Certified KonMari Consultant Expert Interview. 2 January 2020. Instead, ease yourself into it one step at a time, starting with a short, 5-minute decluttering session on a daily basis. [2] X Research source This helps you chip away at the clutter bit by bit, and as your home starts to look cleaner and less cluttered, you’ll likely feel more motivated to incorporate longer decluttering sessions into your schedule. During each short decluttering session, “Start where it’s easiest...where you can have a quick win,” says professional organizer Kathi Burns. “The last thing you want to do if you’re a novice is start tearing apart your master closet…you’ll feel defeated very quickly because it’s a giant project.” [3] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Begin with something super simple, like clearing off clutter from your bedside table one day, then organizing your sock drawer the next day. These small decluttering projects give you a sense of accomplishment, which motivates you to keep going. “Then you can move in baby steps up to larger projects,” Burns explains.

Grab a jumbo trash bag, then quickly go around your home and pick up any trash or junk that you’ve been meaning to get rid of. Look for things like old papers, opened mail, empty shampoo bottles, old shoes you haven’t worn in years, expired food items in your fridge or pantry, and empty medicine bottles in your bathroom cabinet. You’ll be surprised by how much cleaner and less cluttered your space looks after getting rid of all of these unused items!"

Maybe there’s a cute dress you never wear because it just doesn’t fit you right, so now it’s just taking up space in your closet. Or, maybe someone gifted you a book that you aren’t interested in reading, and it’s overcrowding your bookshelf. Try to think of a friend or family member who would have a use for the item, and give it to them. If you commit to giving away at least one item per week, over the course of one year you’ll get rid of 52 things. That’s sure to clear up some space and reduce clutter in your home! If you can't think of anyone specific who will have a use for the item you want to give away, try donating it to Goodwill ."

[5] X Research source 20/20 rule: Find items that you think you might be able to give away or donate. Ask yourself these two questions: Can you replace the item for $20 or less? Can you replace it in 20 minutes or less? If the answer to both of these questions is “yes,” go ahead and give it away. [6] X Research source 90/90 rule: If you’re on the fence about whether to donate or get rid of something, ask yourself two questions: Have you used the item in the past 90 days? If not, will you use the item in the 90 days ahead? If the answers to these questions are “no,” give away the item. [7] X Research source"

When your items don’t have designated places to be stored, you’re more likely to toss them onto a counter, couch, or chair, which can give your home a more cluttered appearance. To avoid this, try to make sure each of your things has its own place, and make an effort to put them back in these specific places after using them. For example, try getting a hook or a small catch-all dish for your keys. Every time you get home, place your keys in this designated place, rather than tossing them on your counter. You could also get an umbrella stand with hooks for coats to put by your front door, so that you don’t end up tossing jackets over chairs or on your couch when you get inside. If you participate in a hobby that requires a lot of supplies (like painting, sketching, or crocheting), get a plastic storage bin or a storage unit with a few shelves to keep your items in when you’re not using them. When all your things are stored in their specific places, rather than strewn around your home, your space will feel much tidier and less cluttered!"

Working with others to declutter your space will make the time pass by much faster, and it will also make the entire process more enjoyable. Having other people help you is also valuable because they may have better insight into the things you really need. A trusted friend or family member can give you the courage to throw out an item that you're attached to for no good reason. To make the whole process feel more like a party and less like a cleaning session, try playing some music while you work and ordering takeout, suggests Fogle.

It may take several decluttering sessions over the course of several days or weeks, and that’s completely okay! To help you feel less overwhelmed with the entire process, break up your decluttering tasks into small, manageable chunks, and designate specific times for them in your schedule. For example, if you’ve set aside a weekend to declutter your home, you could start with your bedroom and bathroom on Saturday, then move on to your kitchen and living room on Sunday. If you’ve got quite a bit of clutter in your home, try spacing it out over a few weeks. For instance, you could plan to tackle one room in your home (your bedroom, the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom, etc.) each weekend until you’ve decluttered them all."

If you have old or damaged items you don’t use anymore, throw them out. If you have duplicates of anything, set aside one of them to donate (you don’t need two can openers, for example).

Bath & Shower: Throw away any empty bottles of shampoo, conditioner, or body wash, and get rid of old razors or loofahs that need to be replaced. If you don’t have a lot of cabinets or drawers in your bathroom, consider getting a storage unit with shelves or an over-the-door organizer , so that you don’t have to store items on your counters (which can make your bathroom appear more cluttered)."

Couch: Straighten up your couch pillows and fold throw blankets to give the room a more polished look. [17] X Research source Electronics: Decide on a specific place to keep your TV remotes, such as your coffee table or media stand, and put them there. Toys: If your children play with certain toys in the living room on a daily basis, consider getting an aesthetically pleasing storage container, such as an ottoman or side table with drawers or a wicker basket with a lid, to keep the toys in.

Extra storage: If you don’t have enough storage space for items for your room, try getting some plastic storage containers that can fit under your bed.

This could be on a monthly, bi-weekly, or weekly basis, depending on how quickly your home gets messy. Incorporating these cleaning sessions into your schedule will help prevent clutter from getting out of hand. Assess your buying habits. If it feels like clutter keeps appearing out of nowhere, it may be because you're buying too many new things. If you're in this situation, try the one in, two out rule. For every new item you buy, donate, give away, or sell two items you already have. Work on keeping counters and floors clear. Storing things on countertops or on the floor can instantly make your home look more cluttered. Every time you notice a toy sitting on the floor, a jacket hung over a chair, or a magazine on a counter, pick it up and put it back where it’s supposed to be."
