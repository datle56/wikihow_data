      "content": "Remind yourself that the person is probably just busy. In most cases, people are just caught up in their daily lives and can't answer texts right away. Ask yourself if you actually know their schedule. There could be some time commitments you aren't aware of. Here are a few other reasons for a delayed response: [1] X Research source They want to give you a longer response but can’t right now. They put their phone away to focus on work or school. They accidentally forgot to reply. Maybe they thought about what they wanted to say but didn’t actually text it."

If you send a lot of follow-up texts, it’ll be hard for them to keep up and they might get overwhelmed. Leave them with just one text to catch up on—the other person will probably appreciate your patience. [3] X Research source If they just have one recent text from you, they’ll be able to respond more easily once they have time."

      "content": "See if there are any confusing texts that you need to clarify. It’s okay if you review your message again and notice that it might’ve been a little vague—it happens! You might feel relieved because you found something that was easy to misread. Some common situations that can come up might look like: [4] X Research source You told them you’d love to see them again. They might just think you two will make plans sometime soon. They mentioned they’re traveling and you said you’d like to catch up when they come back. They might think you’d rather talk in person. You asked them a thoughtful question. They might think you want them to spend more time coming up with an answer."

Do they usually give you their full attention or do they always leave you on “read”? Do you feel like you can reach out to them and talk about a problem? If they’re usually consistent with their responses, great! If they leave you waiting around a lot but eventually get back to you, periods of silence might just be normal for them. [6] X Research source Decide if their explanations feel valid. For example, maybe they recently mentioned that work or school has been super stressful for them lately. You can also set some limits and boundaries. For instance, if they constantly hit you up at random times, remind yourself, “Their patterns make it obvious that I need someone who’s consistent in my life.” Ask your friends if they’ve noticed any patterns, too. They might have picked up on something you missed."

      "content": "Ask yourself why being left on “read” frustrates or confuses you. A delayed response gives you a great opportunity to learn more about yourself. First, identify the emotion you’re experiencing and pay attention to how it feels in your body. Then, reflect on why you react this way when you’re left on “read.” Finally, describe the connection you feel with the other person right now. Your three-step process might look something like: “The emotion that comes up for me is anxiousness, and it feels like a knot in my stomach.” “The reason I’m worried when I’m left on ‘read’ is that I think that my message doesn’t matter to them.” “I’m not sure how close we are. I would feel better about our connection if I knew they valued what I have to say.”"

[9] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Studies show that many people spend over 10 hours on devices per day. You’ll cut down on all that screen time if you get outdoors. Research has found that “green spaces,” like forests and parks, will lift your mood, so head anywhere with lots of trees and flowers!

My friends say I’m a blast and tell the greatest jokes—who am I to argue with them?” “I have a huge heart. I love supporting others and making sure they feel seen.” “I’m a thoughtful person.
