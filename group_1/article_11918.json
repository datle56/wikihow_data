If you deny yourself the opportunity to grieve and mourn your loss, your grief may manifest as a physical illness or some other type of condition later on. [4] X Research source Some people expect grief to move through the 5 standard stages (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance), but this isn’t actually true. Grief manifests differently in each and every person. You might not experience your grief in set “stages,” and that’s completely fine and valid!

Don't think that you have to get rid of these items or put them out of sight to \"get over\" the loss of your grandparent. You can keep them near and dear to your heart and honor the memory of the person you love. If they gave you a special jacket or hoodie, wear it sometimes and think about them as you go about your day.
