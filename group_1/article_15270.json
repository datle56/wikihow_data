      "title": "Ask your parents to pay you for doing big chores.",
      "content": "Ask your parents to pay you for doing big chores. Talk to them to see if they’d be willing to pay you for doing more difficult chores around the house, like mowing the lawn, cleaning the bathroom, and doing laundry. If they say yes, create a list of chores you could do for the week and put a price next to each one. Make sure you do enough chores to reach $100! [1] X Research source Chores that take more time and energy should have a higher fee. At the bottom of the paper, write a short paragraph stating the date that all of the chores need to be done by and promising to complete them on time. Have your parents sign the paper in agreement. If they don't agree with your prices, negotiate. It might take longer than one week to make $100."

      "title": "Offer to help neighbors with cleaning or yardwork for a small fee.",
      "content": "Offer to help neighbors with cleaning or yardwork for a small fee. Once your parents say it’s okay, go around the neighborhood and ask people if they need help with chores for a small fee, like $20. If you’re younger, ask a parent to go with you. Explain that you’re trying to make $100 in a week, and you’re happy to help with anything they need! For example, if one of your chores is running the vacuum at home, you could offer to help do cleaning around the house by running the vacuum throughout their house. To help elderly neighbors, offer to come by 2-3 times per week to take out trash, do dishes, help them with laundry, and do other household tasks that might be too difficult for them to do on their own."

      "content": "Do seasonal yard work if you like being outside. There’s always plenty of yard and garden work to do, and the exact chores you can do will change with the seasons. In the fall, offer to rake a yard of leaves for $20-25 per yard. In the winter, ask neighbors if they will pay you $20-25 to clear their driveway of snow by shoveling. In the spring and summer, you can offer to mow lawns , pull weeds, and help with general gardening. If you’re a younger kid, yard work may be too difficult for you."

      "content": "Become the neighborhood dog walker if you’re comfortable with dogs. If you have neighbors who own dogs, ask if they need the dogs to be walked during the day or in the evenings when you’re available. Check with busy neighbors first, as they’ll probably be more likely to take you up on your offer. Before you walk a new dog for the first time, go over to the neighbor’s house and play with the dog so it knows who you are. Then, when you come over to walk it, the dog probably won’t be afraid of you. You can charge around $5 per walk per dog, which adds up quickly!"

      "content": "Become a babysitter if you’re responsible and like kids. If you're at least 12 years old and like being around younger kids (such as your siblings), consider babysitting . Ask family members, friends, and neighbors with kids if they need someone to watch their kid for a night out. At first, try babysitting for only a few hours to make sure you like it. Then, take on more hours and clients. [2] X Research source When you start out, plan to charge between $8-10 per hour for each kid that you watch. As you get more experience, you can charge more for your services. To find more clients, ask for referrals from parents who are happy with your babysitting services. They could recommend you to their friends and family. This is a great job around holidays and during the summer, since parents are more likely to need someone to watch their kids while they go to an event or party."

      "content": "Offer to pet sit for your neighbors when they go to work or on vacation. If you have pets at home that you take care of, or if you’ve taken care of pets before, you’re probably qualified to pet-sit for money. Ask your neighbors to call you when they need someone to watch their pets. Let them know when you’re available, and plan to charge around $25 for each day that you watch the pets. [3] X Research source Even if they don’t need a pet sitter right now, you can leave your phone number with them so they can contact you when they’re ready. Pet-sitting involves walking the pets, feeding them, cleaning their messes, checking on them, and even playing with them."

      "content": "Collect cans and bottles to recycle if your state pays for recyclables. Put on a pair of thick rubber gloves, get a trash bag, and walk around your neighborhood to pick up empty cans and bottles to exchange for cash. In states that offer money for cans and bottles, you can normally make around 5 cents per each item that you turn in to a recycling center. Every nickel counts toward your $100! You can also go around to neighbors you know and ask if you can have some of their cans and bottles from their recycling. Read up on what’s recyclable in your area. Some cans and bottles aren’t recyclable, while others are. Most recycling centers only take empty recyclables."

Set up a table with your things and a table with their things outside. Make sure you keep the proceeds from your sales separate. Ask your parents if they’ll give you a cut of their sales for organizing and working the sale. Put up signs around the neighborhood before the big day Remember to choose items that are in good condition, like video games that you only played a few times or books that you don’t want anymore.

      "content": "Tutor younger students if you're good at a specific subject in school. If you're doing well at math, science, English, or history, offer to tutor other students who aren’t doing so well in the class. Talk to parents in your neighborhood to find kids to tutor, and offer your services at a fee of $20 per hour. For more advanced subjects, like physics or calculus, you can charge more. Before you begin tutoring, ask your teachers if they’ll vouch for your abilities. “I think that almost anybody can be trained to be an effective tutor if they care to learn—even kids,” says education expert Soren Rosier. Don’t think you’re too young to help others in school—it might be easier for them to learn from a peer. You can also ask your guidance counselor or teachers if there are any paid peer tutoring positions open at your school. This is a great way to get started as a tutor. This can also help you study for tests in that class, as you’ll be reviewing class material repeatedly as you help teach others."

If they are, organize to have the papers dropped off to you in the morning, then ride your bike along the route and drop off the daily papers at every house on the provided list. [5] X Research source This is a great option for younger kids for a first job—all you need is a bike you can ride. If there isn’t a position available, ask the newspaper if they can keep you in mind if a spot opens up."

      "content": "Look for a part-time job that’s close to home if you’re under 16. You can easily make $100 each week working at a nearby grocery store, library, or restaurant, although you might only get your paycheck every two weeks. Look for a job that’s easy for you to get to, whether you walk, your parents drive you, or you take public transportation. Make sure you still have enough time to do your schoolwork as well. Most part-time jobs for young teens pay minimum wage, but they’re usually flexible when it comes to setting your schedule. If you’re 15 or younger, check the laws in your state to make sure you’re able to have a job. In some cases, you might have to get a work permit from your school stating that you have good grades and a job won’t interfere with your schoolwork."

      "content": "Find an after-school job where you can earn tips if you’re over 16. If you can drive and want to make cash quickly, get a job as a waiter, restaurant host, bellhop, golf caddy, or busboy. These jobs normally get paid in cash tips in addition to a regular paycheck, so you’ll have money in your pocket from the first day that you work. Make sure they’re willing to work with your school schedule, especially if you have to drive to and from work. Keep in mind that waiters sometimes make less than minimum wage since they make tips, so your paycheck might be smaller than you expect. However, you make up for that money with the cash tips that you receive."

Unfortunately, you need to have an engaged following of at least a few thousand followers before you’ll make any money. Be wary of scams, such as people messaging you to buy followers or pay for their product in order for them to feature you on their page.

      "content": "Self-publish a book on a site like Amazon. If you like to write and you have the dedication to write an entire novel, you can earn money by self-publishing it. Have a parent or friend read the book and give you feedback, and revise it before publishing it on Amazon . Aim for at least 60,000 words to have a complete book. Amazon lets you self-publish for free through Kindle Digital Publishing because they take a small percentage of what you earn. Don’t pay to self-publish a book—that’s usually a scam. [7] X Research source Set a low price for your book since you’re a novice author competing with older writers. If you charge one to two dollars, you only need one hundred or even just fifty readers to earn 100 dollars in one week. Make a cool cover using a digital art software like Canva that features the title of the book, a royalty-free image, and your name. People are more likely to buy a book with an interesting, professional-looking cover."
