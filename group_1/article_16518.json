      "title": "Look for a crowded public area as soon as you think you’re in trouble.",
      "content": "Look for a crowded public area as soon as you think you’re in trouble. The moment you think someone is approaching you to abduct you, take a quick look around. Scan the area and look for a busy street, a large group of people, or a business that looks fairly crowded. If you’re in a fairly quiet residential area, look for people on their porch or a couple walking their dog. The more people you can run towards, the better. In a rural area, look for an escape route where you can outrun and hide from the attacker. A wooded area is ideal for this. One of two things is very likely to happen if you’re attacked in a busy public area. Either people will come to your aid to help you, or the attacker will be spooked off by a large number of witnesses. At a bare minimum, someone will call the police."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run as fast as you can toward the busy area if the kidnapper gets close.",
      "content": "Run as fast as you can toward the busy area if the kidnapper gets close. When the suspicious person approaches you or talks to you, run towards your escape route. If it is a busy street, head that way. If you saw a large group of people, run towards them. Get in the busiest area you can to increase the odds that you can find help. The attacker is more likely to give up if they think other people may intervene. If the attacker doesn’t have a weapon, it’s always better to run. If you’re carrying a backpack or purse, drop it. It’s only going to slow you down and whatever valuables you have can always be replaced."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shout and make as much noise as possible to call attention to the situation.",
      "content": "Shout and make as much noise as possible to call attention to the situation. As soon as you take off or if you get cornered and you can’t run, start shouting. Yell for help, shout for people to call the police, and yell that you’re being attacked. Make as much noise as possible to call attention to yourself. The kidnapper may flee in fear, or you may attract someone to come to your aid. If you’re in a forest reserve or remote location, this probably isn’t going to help much. You’re better off yelling for 2-3 seconds to let anyone nearby know, then staying as quiet as possible while you flee to try and lose your attacker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw something at the assailant to disrupt their balance.",
      "content": "Throw something at the assailant to disrupt their balance. If they chase after you and you’re holding something, throw it at them. It’s also possible they’re only after your money, so if you can find your wallet quickly, throw that as well. They may simply stop to grab the wallet. If they keep pursuing you and they leave the wallet behind, the police could find your ID and know you were taken. [3] X Research source Don’t go out of your way to find something to throw. If this isn’t practical during the initial moments of the attack, you’re better off just running and focusing on making noise."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call the police as soon as you get away.",
      "content": "Call the police as soon as you get away. If you are successful and the attacker leaves or stops pursuing you, find a local business or a responsible adult and let them know what happened. Stay in a busy, public area to make sure you stay safe and contact the police immediately. Wait for the police to arrive. [4] X Research source Your nerves may be all over the place after you get away. This is completely normal. Just take a deep breath and remember that you’re safe so long as there are other people around."
    },
    {
      "title": "Describe the attacker to the police to help them catch the person.",
      "content": "Describe the attacker to the police to help them catch the person. It’s important to tell the police what the attacker looked like, even if you’re already safe, since filing a report may help the police catch the attacker before they strike again. Describe their clothing, height, hair color, and include any info that may make the attacker stand out. This may be a tattoo, a scar, or a piercing. [5] X Research source It’s okay if you can’t remember every tiny detail. You were under stress and it’s reasonable that you were more focused on getting away. Just give the police any info you can to the best of your ability."

    {
      "title": "Do not fight if the kidnapper has a weapon and you’re cornered.",
      "content": "Do not fight if the kidnapper has a weapon and you’re cornered. If the attacker has a gun or knife and you really have nowhere to go, try to relax and comply with the kidnapper. [6] X Research source The vast majority of kidnappings do not end in violence and if you comply and the odds you are let free or rescued are roughly 90%. There’s no possible way to know how a person with a gun or knife will respond if you upset them by fighting. [7] X Research source If you are taken, maintain eye contact with the attacker whenever they talk to you. This can subconsciously remind the kidnapper of your humanity and drastically reduce the odds that your attacker harms you. Try to drop your wallet, ID, or some personal item at the spot you are taken. This will give the investigators something to work with."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend to comply if you see no escape route and prepare to fight.",
      "content": "Pretend to comply if you see no escape route and prepare to fight. You may not be able to run if you’re cornered or the attacker is faster than you. If they don’t have a weapon, you can try fighting them off. You may be injured in the process, but it’s preferable to being taken against your will. When they’re within 10–20 ft (3.0–6.1 m), put your hands up, catch your breath, and prepare yourself mentally to fight. [8] X Research source You can throw in a simple, “Okay, okay…you win” to really sell them on your act if you’d like. Many people freeze up when they’re confronted with a threat. If you do this, don’t be too hard on yourself. It’s extremely hard to maintain total control over your emotions when you are unexpectedly attacked. If you resist and other people are around, you’re more likely to get away than not. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Strike when they aren’t looking or are focused on something else.",
      "content": "Strike when they aren’t looking or are focused on something else. Pay attention to their eyes and body language as they get close. If they’re about to try and wrap you up, that’s your time to strike. If they take a second to look around and check for witnesses, this is the best time to hit them. If an opportunity doesn’t present itself, you can start fighting them off at any point. [10] X Research source Do not let them restrain you while you’re pretending to comply. If they go to put a zip tie or handcuffs on you, this is your time to fight. The goal here is to catch them when they’re focused on something else. They have a fight or flight response just like you do, and if you surprise them, they may back off and run away."

      "title": "Poke or jab them in their eyes if you get close enough.",
      "content": "Poke or jab them in their eyes if you get close enough. If you have quick access to their eyes, make a V-shape with your fingers and stick them in their eyes as hard as you can. If you can blind your attacker, it will give you plenty of time to run away. You can also spit in their face to make them close their eyes which will give you time to line your fingers up with their eyes. [11] X Research source This is also the best chance you have if they lift you up since you’ll have limited mobility and won’t be able to hit very hard. Luckily, it doesn’t take very much effort to injure someone’s eyes."

      "title": "Punch them in the throat or neck to cripple them temporarily.",
      "content": "Punch them in the throat or neck to cripple them temporarily. If you can’t reach their eyes, punch or strike them in the neck. People have a natural response to protect their neck and your attacker will either take their hands off of you or jump back. This will give you another chance to strike or run away. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick or punch them in the genitals to knock them down.",
      "content": "Kick or punch them in the genitals to knock them down. This is particularly helpful if your attacker is male and bigger than you. Either knee, kick, or punch them in between the legs. If you can hit them in a sensitive area, they may keel over or collapse on the spot. This will give you enough time to run or solicit help. [13] X Research source The goal when fighting off an attacker is to get away, not win a fight. If they do keel over, run. Don’t keep kicking or hitting them—you may only be giving them time to recover."

      "content": "Bite the kidnapper if they get their arms around you or restrain you. If you can’t fend them off and they do grapple you, bite them. Look for an exposed portion of skin and bite down as hard as you possibly can. Try to really tear their flesh off. It sounds nasty, but a strong bite will send your attacker reeling in pain. [14] X Research source This is also a great option if they get you on the ground and they’re on top of you."

    {
      "title": "Scratch and claw at the attacker if they get you down on the ground.",
      "content": "Scratch and claw at the attacker if they get you down on the ground. If they tackle you or pull you to the ground and you can’t bite them, get those fingernails out. Scratch and claw at their face, neck, or arms. If you’re on the ground and can’t swing your arms around, this is likely the best way to injure your kidnapper. [15] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Shout to scare the attacker while you fight if possible.",
      "content": "Shout to scare the attacker while you fight if possible. If you can manage to make noise while you’re scrapping with the attacker, you may catch someone’s attention to come help you. Alternatively, it may also freak the attacker out and make them nervous about fighting you. [16] X Research source Keep in mind, it’s better to not shout threats. Threatening the attacker may just make them angry. Just yell, “Help!,” or, “I’m being attacked!” to alert people nearby that you’re in trouble."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run at the first opportunity to create distance between you and the attacker.",
      "content": "Run at the first opportunity to create distance between you and the attacker. If at any point in the fight you see a window to take off running, do it. The goal when fighting an attacker is to get away, not win the fight. If they fall over, back up, or appear to be losing their confidence, sprint as fast as you can towards a busy area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay vigilant while you’re out to spot suspicious people.",
      "content": "Stay vigilant while you’re out to spot suspicious people. When you’re out and about, keep your eyes out for people that may be following you or studying your movements. Avoid staring at your phone while you’re walking around and don’t wear headphones when you’re out to keep your ears open. If a potential kidnapper sees you notice them, they’re less likely to attack. [17] X Research source This is particularly important if it’s late at night. Attacks of opportunity are always more likely to happen when it’s late out. Spotting a kidnapper as early as possible also gives you more time to respond to what’s happening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go out with other people and avoid walking alone at night.",
      "content": "Go out with other people and avoid walking alone at night. The buddy system is a great way to stay safe, since a kidnapper is unlikely to attack more than one person at a time. Whenever you’re going out, take someone with you or travel in a group with others to reduce the odds that someone tries to take you. [18] X Research source Take a cab or rideshare if it’s late at night and your friend or partner won’t come with you to avoid walking alone."

    {
      "title": "Stay in well-lit public areas to avoid dangerous situations.",
      "content": "Stay in well-lit public areas to avoid dangerous situations. The odds that you are kidnapped in a public place are extremely low. Take routes along busy roads and stay out of alleys and smaller side streets, especially if there aren’t any street lights and it’s dark out. [19] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let people know where you’re going when you go out.",
      "content": "Let people know where you’re going when you go out. If you’re heading out for the night or going out to do something, tell your parents, roommate, or friends to let them know where you’re headed. That way, if something does happen, they’ll know where to start looking for you. [20] X Research source Hopefully, nothing ever happens to you, but you want to increase the odds that you’re found if you do end up being kidnapped."

      "title": "Do not get into the car with anyone you don’t know.",
      "content": "Do not get into the car with anyone you don’t know. Unless you’re getting in a taxi or rideshare, do not accept rides from strangers. Offering free rides is a common way for kidnappers to lure you away, so if you refuse free rides you’re really keeping yourself out of harm’s way. [21] X Research source Every time you take a rideshare, confirm that the driver’s name matches the name on your app before getting in and closing the door. Some kidnappers will pretend to be rideshare drivers to lure people inside. [22] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Carry pepper spray or mace if you’re really worried about attackers.",
      "content": "Carry pepper spray or mace if you’re really worried about attackers. Check to see if pepper spray and mace are legal where you live. If they are, pick up a protective spray. If anyone ever tries to kidnap or attack you, spray them in the eyes. Either keep the pepper spray or mace on your keys so that you never forget it, or keep it in an easily accessible pocket to bring it out quickly. Carrying a knife is usually a pretty bad idea. Mace and pepper spray can be used from a distance, but if an attacker gets close to you, they can always take your knife. It’s also better to use nonlethal force if you have the opportunity."
