IPv4 is the most common IP address type and has the formatting that you might expect of an IP address (four groups of numbers separated by dots, i.e., 10.0.0.1). IPv6 is another type of IP. Most notably, it is longer and has letters and numbers, not just numbers, and it was created as a successor to IPv4. You likely won't need to worry about the IPv6 unless someone specifically asks you for it. If you want to learn more about the differences, jump to our section on IPv4 vs. IPv6 below. You can also view your own IP by clicking the MY IP tab."

What's the difference, and why do we have both? The first big difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is how they look. IPv4 only uses numbers, while IPv6 uses both numbers and letters. IPv4 is a 32-bit address, which means there were approximately 4.3 billion unique IPv4 addresses. These addresses ran out in 2011, but experts started anticipating this issue back in the 1980s. In contrast, IPv6 is a 128-bit address, and it's estimated to have so many addresses available that the number is too large to write normally. It's referred to in scientific notation—3.4 x 1032, to be exact. To put this in more illustrative terms, there will be enough IPv6 addresses available that every single atom on the planet could be assigned one, and there will still be enough left over to repeat this over 100 times. [9] X Research source Functionally, IPv6 also has some improvements over IPv4. It allows for better performance and security when browsing online. However, you're not likely to see much of a difference in using IPv6 vs. IPv4 at the moment. You still have an IPv4 address since multiple devices can share a public IPv4 address. This is because a number of internet infrastructures still depend on IPv4, and rolling out IPv6 is a gradual process that takes quite a long time. It's not 100% certain when we will fully transition to IPv6, but some experts estimate it will be in the year 2030 or even later. [10] X Research source However, IPv6 has been rolling out since 1998!"
