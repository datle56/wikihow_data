Our elbows take extra abuse, so particularly while you are working on curing them, you may want to wear long sleeves. Wear natural fibers, such as cotton, and avoid synthetic fabrics which may be irritating. Wool, while a natural fiber, can often be irritating to the skin, so you may want to avoid shirts and sweaters spun from wool, regardless of their wintry appeal."

      "content": "Change your diet. Foods that are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to help protect our skin from harsh environmental factors and bolster our oil-protecting barriers. Fish such as salmon, halibut, and sardines are excellent sources of Omega-3. Walnuts, safflower oil and flaxseed are similarly good sources of Omega-3 and are relatively easy to add to your diet. Before making any changes to your diet or taking fish-oil supplements, you should of course consult with your physician."
