      "content": "Hold your left hand in front of you with the palm facing up. Position your left hand comfortably in front of you at approximately chest level. Your palm should be face up and your fingers loose. The fingertips should be reaching up slightly. In cardistry, the straddle grip is usually done with the left hand, whether that’s your dominant hand or not. You’ll eventually learn to do tricks with both hands using straddle grip, so if you want to learn with your dominant hand first, that’s totally fine!"
