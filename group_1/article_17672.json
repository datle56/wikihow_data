      "content": "Call a dentist as soon as possible. Losing a crown is not a true dental emergency. Still, you should contact the dentist so the crown can be repaired. The dentist can tell you what to do and how to care for it until you can get it fixed. Your tooth will be weak, possibly sensitive, and at a greater risk of decay until the crown is fully prepared so do not delay in contacting your dentist for a solution.
