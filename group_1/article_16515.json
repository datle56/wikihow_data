Also, grab some torches . Of course, if you can't get to those tiers yet, your best bet is to start with a wooden sword and try to get to a stone sword soon. Stone swords prove to be adequate weapons early in the game. If possible, get your equipment enchanted . Don't forget to bring a shield. Be careful not to take all of your good items, because if you die, it will be hard to retrieve them unless you have keep inventory on, which is often considered cheating. Also in the 1.9 update, you can dual wield a bow and sword, so you can shoot and use melee attacks almost at the same time."
