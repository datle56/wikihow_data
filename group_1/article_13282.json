      "content": "Understand the concept of equitable distribution. Most states follow the law of equitable distribution. This doesn't mean split down the middle. It means fair, based on factors including the earning power of each spouse, contributions during the marriage, age and health, and future financial needs of each person. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source If you create a property agreement with these requirements in mind, you are increasing the chances that the judge will accept it without amendment. In California, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, New Mexico, Nevada, Wisconsin and Washington, the standard is community property. In these states, there is an assumption that there will be an even split of all property owned or held in the name of both spouses. The court will still look at fundamental fairness, but the presumption is that there will be a 50/50 split of the assets.

      "content": "Consider what is separate property and what is marital property. Marital property, often called community property, are assets that were acquired during the course of the marriage. Whether it is tangible items such as furniture or intangibles such as investments or retirement accounts, all marital property is subject to equitable distribution or division as community property. [5] X Research source Conversely, separate property includes assets that were wholly owned by each party before the marriage. This can include real estate, vehicles, inheritances, and heirlooms. In general, unless it is co-mingled, separate property goes to the owner with no claim by the other spouse. The lines blur when couples have shared their separate property. For example, when one spouse uses inherited money to make improvements on the house owned solely by the other party. If you have mixed up and mingled your individual property and cannot agree on how to divide it, you should consider consulting with an attorney to help craft a settlement agreement."

      "content": "Decide on an asset valuation date. You and your spouse need to decide on a date where you will fix the value of your property. This is especially important for volatile assets such as stocks. Get an updated balance on retirement accounts and interest-bearing financial accounts such as savings, CDs, and money market accounts. Calculate the equity in the real estate for buy-out or asset trading purposes. A good day to affix a value to the house is the statement date for the mortgage payment. You will need an appraisal and the pay-off amount to calculate the equity."

For example, if you have two cars, even if they are both titled jointly, know that the court will award one to each party. Usually, each party will keep the vehicle they drive most often. Each should expect to keep any loan debt associated with the vehicle and assume the payments."

If you and your partner can't agree, consider seeking legal assistance to determine your rights and options. If you cannot agree, the judge will be the one making the decision.

Failure to correctly categorize your retirement assets could lead to not only complications in the divorce, but also tax consequences. Seek the assistance of a lawyer or accountant if you are unsure how to handle different accounts. A \"qualified plan\" is set up by your employer and you receive tax breaks for your contributions. This includes pensions and 401(k) plans. [15] X Research source Qualified plans are split using a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO.) A QDRO is a court order instructing the plan administrator to pay out a portion of the balance to the receiving spouse. The amount is typically 50 percent of the value of the assets dated from the time of the marriage to the date of the divorce. The receiving spouse is responsible for all taxes and penalties of this distribution. [16] X Research source A QDRO is a very specific document that must contain certain information to be valid. IRAs and other private retirement accounts are divided using a procedure called \"transfer incident to divorce.\" A property settlement can designate individual retirement accounts, in part or in full, to one spouse. The financial institution will either treat it as a rollover or a distribution depending on how the decree is worded. Poorly worded QDROs and IRA transfers can trigger significant taxes and penalties. If the transfer is not approved by the court, the IRS may require amended tax returns. It is not recommended that you write your own QDRO or transfer unless you have significant legal or financial experience. A lawyer or account can prepare these documents to attach to your property settlement."
