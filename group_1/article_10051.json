This cut is large, but contains a lot of extra bone, such as the rib tips and sternum. You will need to take into account that much of the weight you pay for will be thrown away because of the extra bones. St. Louis rack. The butcher removes the rib tips and sternum portion, so that more of the cut you are buying is meaty. It is also more expensive. Kansas City rack. The butcher removes rib tips, sternum and breast bone. This is the smallest rack and can be even more expensive per lb."
