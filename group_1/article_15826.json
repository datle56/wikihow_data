      "content": "\"Amen.\" When you say “amen,” you’re agreeing with what was said in God’s name. In the Old Testament, it also refers to the will and judgment of God. [1] X Research source To show you wholeheartedly believe in your prayer, simply say “amen” when you’re finished. Feel free to add “amen” to any other prayer ending, as well. Jewish prayers are also often ended with “Amen.”"

      "content": "\"In Jesus’s name, amen.\" In John 14:13-14, Jesus tells the people around him that he will do anything that they ask in his name. [2] X Research source This popular prayer ending follows Jesus’s teachings and acknowledges his role in Christian salvation."

      "title": "\"All God’s people said, amen.\"",
      "content": "\"All God’s people said, amen.\" This is a great way to end a group prayer. If you’re working with a congregation, encourage the group to say “amen” together when they hear this phrase to help build the community aspect of the prayer. In Deuteronomy 27, Moses explains the 10 commandments and says “and all the people shall answer, ‘Amen.’” [3] X Research source"

      "title": "\"We pray this trusting and believing in you.\"",
      "content": "\"We pray this trusting and believing in you.\" According to Christian performance artist Olivia Woodford, trust is a core part of your relationship with God. “God is always answering your prayers…[even if] the situation might feel really hard, [it] might be exactly what you need.” When you’re troubled, surrender yourself to God."

    {
      "title": "\"To God be the glory, forever and ever. Amen.\"",
      "content": "\"To God be the glory, forever and ever. Amen.\" Whether you believe God is everything or that God is the creator of everything, all glory is God’s glory. When you recognize that, it’s easier to surrender to the Will of God, which can answer your prayers in unexpected ways. This is similar to the ending of the Lord’s Prayer—“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever, amen.” Alternatively, say “In all that we do may the glory be to you. In Jesus’s name, we believe and pray, amen.”"

      "title": "\"Help us keep your word in our hearts so we may not sin against you.\"",
      "content": "\"Help us keep your word in our hearts so we may not sin against you.\" As you ask God for help, it’s good practice to finish your prayer by asking for the strength to act selflessly. One early definition for sin is to “miss the mark,” so through this prayer, you’re asking to be set on the right path and not be led astray. [4] X Research source You can also add “Through Jesus’s name, we pray. Amen.” at the end. This ending comes from Psalm 119. [5] X Research source Always feel free to bring scripture into your prayer."

      "title": "“Help us be more like you, and hear when you are speaking to us.\"",
      "content": "“Help us be more like you, and hear when you are speaking to us.\" This prayer ending, like the previous one, sums up what you’re asking of God. It tells God the most important thing to you is to be better to the world around you (and yourself). Or, ask God for continued help by ending your prayer with “Please bless us as we go throughout our week, and be grounded and rooted in your word.”"

To be sure everyone’s on the same page (and knows that it’s time to end the prayer), pick a few phrases to regularly close with. You could say “in Jesus’s name,” or always end each prayer by thanking God. This will cue the congregation to say \"amen\" together. Use any common prayer ending that resonates with you, such as: “We pray this trusting and believing in you,” or “Help us be more like you, and hear when you are speaking to us.”"

[6] X Research source Use a few phrases like “and all God’s people said” or “in Jesus’s name” to signal to your group it's time to come together as one and say “amen.” Consider starting with a shared song and ending with “amen” to section off your prayer from the rest of your service."

      "content": "Try ending with a moment of silence. If you’re leading a prayer, having a few moments of silence at the end gives the others time for their personal relationships with God. Like any relationship, it’s based on giving and receiving, so let everyone have a moment to listen to God at the end of your prayer. Optionally, end the moment of silence with “amen.”"

Ask for blessings, safety, or for the strength to be more aligned with God, and feel free to alter the words below to resonate with your spirit more strongly: We want to thank you, Lord, for being with us in this meeting, and for guiding us through it. We’re endlessly grateful for the love you have given us—the love that we see in the faces of our other community members. Now, as we have to leave each other, stay with each and every one of us, keep us safe in your presence, and accompany us in our joys and hardships. We pray this believing and trusting in you, amen. God, thank you for being present with us today, for sending your good word through our wonderful speaker, for touching our hearts in song and prayer. We pray that everyone searching for answers was led in the right direction and that everyone looking for comfort was held in your word.
