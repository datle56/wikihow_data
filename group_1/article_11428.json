      "content": "Pin your wig in place on a wig stand. Place several T-pins along the lace line, which is where the hairline starts, and place a few more near each ear to secure the wig to the stand. If you have a full-lace wig, place the pins near the hairline. If you have a lace-front wig , place the pins within the lace line. [1] X Research source Check that the wig stand is straight. If it’s at an angle, your wig could end up with an accidental asymmetrical haircut!"

      "content": "Comb or brush the hair to remove any tangles. Spend a few minutes gently brushing out your wig. You want to ensure that there are no tangles or sections of hair that aren’t falling where they should. Since your wig doesn’t grow back, you need to be patient when preparing to cut it. [2] X Research source This is a great time to think about what length you want your wig to be if you don’t already know.

      "content": "Start with the back of the wig and work in small sections. Move your fingers down the hair until they are at the length where you want to wig to be. Try to hold the hair so that it’s flat between your middle and index fingers, rather than bunched together. [4] X Research source If you want to make a drastic change and go from long hair to medium-length or short hair, just adjust where you’re going to make the cuts to get the length you desire."

      "content": "Cut the hair at a 45-degree angle, taking care to not cut your fingers. Use your hair-cutting scissors and cut up into the hair, trimming it across the entire length of your fingers. Make small, even snips to prevent any accidents. [5] X Research source You could cut straight across rather than at a 45-degree angle, but the angle helps the hair look more natural than a straight, blunt cut would."

      "title": "Trim the entirety of your wig until all the ends are the same length.",
      "content": "Trim the entirety of your wig until all the ends are the same length. When moving on to a new section, use some of the hair from an already-cut area to guide the trimming so everything ends up being the same length. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that you can always trim or cut your wig shorter if you want to in the future, but you can’t make it longer!"

Walk all around the wig, checking the ends for any long, scraggly hairs you might have missed in the trimming process. Snip them off to clean up your wig.

      "content": "Clip the front sections of hair in front of the ears to hold them back. Use 2 hair clips, and gather the front sections of the wig into your hands. Clip the hair in front of where the ears would be to ensure it doesn’t accidentally get cut while you’re layering the back sections. [9] X Research source You’ll layer the front sections, too, but it’s easier to start with the back and finish with the front since the back is the area that normally needs the most work."

      "content": "Decide where you want your layers to fall. Separate the top layers from the bottom layer of the wig hair. Leave the bottom layer in place—that will be the length of your wig. Then decide how long or short you want the layers to be. For example: [10] X Research source You could layer the middle section to fall 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) above the bottom layer and then layer the top section to fall another 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) above the middle layer. Or, you could create multiple layers by separating the middle and top sections into even small portions. It all depends on how layered you want your hair to be!"

Use another hair clip and gather the top portion of hair so just the bottom and middle sections are left hanging down. Secure the top section of hair away from the rest of the wig by clipping it down near the front of the wig. [11] X Research source It helps to use a comb to separate the sections if you’re having a hard time doing it by hand."

Similar to how you layered the back sections of the hair, cut the middle and then the top portions of the front of the wig, but cut at a downward angle rather than straight across. Section off the top portion as you work on the middle, and then end by layering the top. [16] X Research source Remember to cut the front layers at a downward angle so that the hair will lay nicely with that front outline you created."

For full-front bangs , try to use more hair. For side-swept bangs , you can get away with a thinner section. [19] X Research source Use a comb or brush to detangle the hair thoroughly before you start cutting."

Keep in mind where that bobby pin is, and position the wig hair between your middle and index fingers at that length. Then take your scissors and cut up at a 45-degree angle toward your fingers to create the edges of your bangs. [20] X Research source Be careful to not accidentally snip your fingers as you cut! If you’re concerned about the bangs being too short, cut slightly below the bobby-pin. Once you’re done, you can put the wig on and check the length and decide if you want to go any shorter."

Each time you move on to cut the next section of your bangs, bring along a little bit of a section that’s already been trimmed. That way you’re more likely to keep your bangs even. [21] X Research source Take your time when creating bangs in your wig—it might take a little longer, but remember that it’s much harder to fix a wig than it is to fix or grow out natural hair."

You can pin or braid them back if you need to, and they can add a lot of style to your look."
