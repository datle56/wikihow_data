      "content": "Touch the cat’s fur to see if it appears greasy. Since Stud Tail is caused by an accumulation of skin oil, you should be able to feel what appears to be greasy fur toward the cat’s back. If you feel greasy fur, the cat may have Stud Tail. Greasy fur most often appears toward the back of the cat’s body or on its tail. Verify there are no other reasons your cat’s fur may appear greasy, like if another caretaker has applied medicine, or the cat is excessively dirty."

Say, “I noticed what appeared to be some dry skin on Yoda’s tail last month, but early this month Yoda had lost hair and had some larger pimples or growths.” Don’t hold anything back. While you may think that your cat licking their back or tail a lot over the course of the last month is unimportant, your vet might think it is important. [4] X Research source"
