[11] X Research source Who sells the property depends on the terms of your mortgage. Most mortgages will specify that the bank earns the right to foreclose on the property if the homeowner fails to meet the agreed upon repayment terms. [12] X Research source In some states the foreclosure auction may be run by the local sheriff's department, called a Sheriff's Sale. [13] X Research source Some states permit the lender to foreclose without having to go to court or involve the sheriff's department. These foreclosures are called a Trustee's Sale, and typically involve a trust deed instead of a mortgage. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand who is at risk. Anyone who defaults on a mortgage runs the risk of having the property foreclosed. A homeowner is considered to have defaulted on the mortgage after one month of missed payments. After a payment is 10 to 15 days late, lenders may begin to tack on late fees. The homeowner then typically has an agreed upon grace period in which to make up the missed payments plus all accrued late fees before the lender may begin the foreclosure process. [15] X Research source Some mortgage lenders will allow borrowers to work out a special forbearance, which adjusts the terms of the mortgage to avoid going into foreclosure. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Know your local ordinances. In some places, a homeowner who has lost his home due to foreclosure has up to 12 months to acquire the necessary funds to buy back a foreclosed home. This is good for the homeowner who initially defaulted on his loans but bad for investors, who may buy a foreclosure property only to lose that property within a few months of the auction. [17] X Research source This is known as the redemption period. Generally banks will not resell a foreclosed property during the redemption period and will maintain the property during this period of time."
