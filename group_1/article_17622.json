      "content": "Close the hole with a safety pin for a simple solution. With your shirt buttoned-up, hold the gaping area together using 1 hand. Hold an open safety pin and insert your arm through the top of your shirt. Use the hand that's inside the shirt to push the pin through the inside of both shirt panels, then push it back through both panels. Secure the safety pin on the inside of your shirt to keep your shirt together. [1] X Research source It’s unlikely that people will notice the safety pin. If it's super noticeable, take it out and try inserting it again so that there's less pin visible."

      "title": "Apply fashion tape to both button panels to keep the gap closed.",
      "content": "Apply fashion tape to both button panels to keep the gap closed. Fashion tape is a special double-stick tape that’s strong enough to hold your clothes together. Pull off a strip of fashion tape that's the length of the shirt section that gapes. Stick 1 side of the fashion tape on the inside of the panel with the buttonholes. Then, apply the other side of the fashion tape to the front side of the panel that has the buttons. Press the 2 pieces of tape together to close the gape. [2] X Research source The fashion tape should hold for the rest of the day. However, it’s not a long-term fix."

      "title": "Wear a camisole under your shirt and leave it open at the top.",
      "content": "Wear a camisole under your shirt and leave it open at the top. The easiest way to fix a gaping shirt is to embrace the gape. Instead of trying to stop your shirt from gaping, leave the buttons open. Wear a camisole under your button-up shirt to cover up your chest or cleavage. Then, unbutton the top 1-3 buttons of your shirt if the gape is over your chest. If the shirt gapes lower down on your torso, leave it completely unbuttoned. [3] X Research source For instance, you might wear a lace-top camisole for a feminine look. Alternatively, wear a muscle tank in place of a camisole."

      "title": "Mark the center of the gape on each panel with a fabric pencil.",
      "content": "Mark the center of the gape on each panel with a fabric pencil. Lay out your shirt and expose the inside of the panel that has the buttonholes. Then, find the spot exactly between the buttonholes on the section that’s gaping. Use your fabric pencil to mark the inside of the button hole panel so you know where you want to add a snap or hook-and-eye closure. Use a measuring tape to find how far from the upper button hole your mark is, then measure from the top button on the button panel to find the same spot on the other panel. Mark the front facing side of the button panel where you’ll attach the other end of your snap or closure. [4] X Research source A snap is typically easier to close, but it may pop open more easily. You might prefer a hook-and-eye enclosure if you have a very large chest."

Push a hand-sewing needle through the holes around the closure to secure it. Then, use your needle and thread to attach the other snap on the mark you made on the button side of the panel.

Then, sew the eye enclosure onto the front-facing side of the button panel.

You’re going to sew the new button on the side of your shirt that has the buttonholes. Place your shirt on a flat surface and expose the inside of the flap with the buttonholes. [7] X Research source Choose a button that's the same size as the buttons on your shirt or smaller. You'll need to cut a buttonhole for the new button, and a large button will require you to cut a longer hole."

      "content": "Insert a thread that matches your shirt into a hand-sewing needle. Cut about 2 ft (0.61 m) of thread. Then, push the end of the thread through the eye of a hand-sewing needle. Pull about 12 in (30 cm) of thread through the needle, then make a knot at the end of the thread. [9] X Research source The thread may be slightly visible from the outside of your shirt, so hold the thread up to your shirt to check that the color matches."

Then, cross the thread over the buttonholes. Make several passes with your needle and thread to secure the button to your shirt. [10] X Research source If you're using a 2-hole button, push the needle and thread up through 1 of the holes, then loop the needle over and through the second hole. Make several passes with your needle to secure the button to the shirt, then knot and snip your thread. For a shank button that has only 1 hole, loop your needle and thread through the hole on the back of the button. Pass your needle through the hole at least 10 times to make sure your button is secure. Then, knot and snip the end of the thread. If you have a preferred stitch for attaching buttons, it’s okay to use that instead. Your button won’t be visible, so you don’t need to worry about it looking different from your other buttons."

Fold the shirt horizontally over the mark and use your fabric scissors to cut a small, button-sized hole.

Otherwise, the button may slide out and be ineffective."
