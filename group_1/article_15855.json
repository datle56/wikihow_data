      "content": "Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Massage the shampoo into your scalp for a few minutes to stimulate the follicles and increase circulation to the scalp. This will help keep your hair healthy. Apply the conditioner next, and leave it on for 1 to 2 minutes, or as directed on the bottle, before rinsing it off. Look for sulfate-free, antioxidant-rich shampoos and conditioners to keep your hair healthy and hydrated. [1] X Research source If your hair is oily or tends to suffer from a buildup of product, you can shampoo as often as once every other day."

      "title": "Wash away discoloration with a clarifying shampoo.",
      "content": "Wash away discoloration with a clarifying shampoo. Clarifying shampoo is formulated to remove stubborn dirt, oils, and built up residues that resist gentler shampoos. Use a clarifying shampoo once a week to combat dullness and discoloration in your grey hair. [2] X Research source Clarifying shampoo can be very drying, so use it sparingly, especially if you are using other products that might dry your hair or strip away natural oils. Skip the clarifying shampoo if you have highlights or lowlights, since it will strip the color out of your hair."

      "title": "Keep yellow tints at bay with a blue or purple shampoo.",
      "content": "Keep yellow tints at bay with a blue or purple shampoo. The tint in blue or purple-tinted shampoo cancels out yellow tones in grey hair. Apply the shampoo from roots to tips, then leave it on for the time recommended on the bottle before rinsing it out. Depending on the level of yellow in your hair, you can leave the shampoo on for up to 15 minutes. However, leaving the shampoo on for too long can leave you with obvious purple tints in your hair. Look for blue or purple-tinted shampoo made specifically for white or silver hair. Check for \"silver\" on the label. How often you use this shampoo depends on how yellow your hair is. [3] X Research source However, avoid using it more than once or twice a week. Overuse can result in a buildup of dye, causing your hair to look dull or bluish. If you are using a clarifying shampoo, do not use it on the same day as the purple shampoo, as the combination could dry out your hair. Wait a few days after using one before you use the other."

      "content": "Apply a violet-tinted gloss every 2 to 3 months if desired. If using purple shampoo is not convenient for you, consider applying a gloss instead. This will not only balance out the yellow tones, but also give your hair shine. [4] X Research source You can do this at a salon or use an at-home kit."

      "content": "Maintain your cut and style. Because everyone's hair is different, you should speak with your hair stylist to find a haircut is right for you. Choose something that is easy for you to maintain and style. Grey hair reflects light, so if your hair is unstyled or not cut properly, it will be even more obvious than usual. As a general rule, you should cut your hair every 6 weeks. If your hair starts to look shaggy or unkempt before then, however, it's time for a trim! [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Add dimension and texture with highlights and lowlights.",
      "content": "Add dimension and texture with highlights and lowlights . Highlights and lowlights have the advantage of having a less obvious grow-out period on grey hair than a solid color. Try to get a range between white/light grey, medium grey, and dark grey/black. You can try to do this at home using a kit, but it would be better to get it done professionally at a salon. [6] X Research source Keep the highlights 2 to 3 shades lighter than the rest of your hair. [7] X Research source Depending on how light your hair is to begin with, this may or may not be possible because there is nothing to lighten. Place the thickest, lightest highlights around your face. Have them get thinner the further you get from your face. [8] X Research source Keep the lowlights 1 to 2 shades darker than your base color. Use them alongside the highlights to help blend them in.

      "content": "Add a secondary color for a more dramatic look. Mixing a second color in with your grey hair can add excitement to your look. You can do it all over your hair as highlights, or even as a single, bold streak. Keep the color light so that it's still the same shade as the rest of your hair. Great options include: ice blue, dusty pink, or light purple."

      "title": "Match the shade of grey to your skin tone.",
      "content": "Match the shade of grey to your skin tone. There are different shades of grey, just like there are different shades of blond and brown. What looks good on one person may not look good on you. [10] X Research source If you dyed your hair grey and it just doesn't look right, or if you want to add depth or richness to your naturally grey hair, ask for your stylist's recommendation. Keep the following in mind: [11] X Research source If you have light skin that is not flattered by ashy tones, a pale champagne blond may be a better choice than grey. A pure white will also look nice. If you have medium skin, you can go with a creamy white or a steel grey. If your hair is naturally dark, you can even go with a bright silver shade. If you have dark skin, opt for a salt-and-pepper look with white highlights and dark lowlights."

      "content": "Use shampoos and conditioners made for color-treated hair. Select products that are formulated to be gentle, moisturizing, and easy on your dye. Some shampoos and conditioners will also boost your color as you wash. Even with color-safe products, limit washing to once or twice a week to avoid drying out your hair and washing out your dye.

      "content": "Repair dryness and damage with a weekly hair mask or balm. Wash your hair with shampoo first, then use the mask or balm in place of your conditioner. Leave the product in your hair for 3 to 5 minutes, or for however long is directed on the container, then rinse it out. Use a mask meant for color-treated hair. Avoid anything containing sulfates."

      "title": "Limit heat styling your hair.",
      "content": "Limit heat styling your hair. Dyed hair is often dry and brittle, and this is especially true of heavily bleached hair. Heat styling, including straightening and curling, will only damage it further. If you must heat style your hair, use a lower temperature and a heat protection spray."
