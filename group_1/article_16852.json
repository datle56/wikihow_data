      "content": "Visit a specialist website. The quickest and easiest way to find out when somebody was married is to visit a website of a company that can search through marriage records for you. There are a number of these online agencies. You will find them by looking for “marriage record checks” or “background checks” in a search engine. Before employing any agency to find out information, be sure you do some research on the company. Look for one that has positive feedback and a good reputation."

      "content": "See if there’s a free trial. Online agencies will charge you for their services, but in some instances you may be able to utilise a free trial period, or have one free trial search. If you only want to look up the records for one marriage, you may be able to take up an offer and do the search for free. Remember that results are not guaranteed, even if you pay. Using a free trial will give you an idea of the service you can expect. Some of these databases will not go right up to the present day. Make sure you know they cover the approximate year you think the wedding occurred in before proceeding."

These agencies are often used by people such as private investigators, so membership is generally based on subscription. In some cases you will be able to pay on a pay-as-you-go basis. In the UK, a subscription could cost you £15 a year, or 3 months for £5. With deals like these, there will often be a limit to the number of searches you can perform. [1] X Research source"

The records of marriages are held by your County, and the way the information is kept and made available can vary from place to place.

If you haven’t been able to find the information you are looking for online, the next step is to visit the country records office or courthouse in person. To do this you will need to know where the marriage took place, so that you can go to the relevant office. Marriage licenses, which show the date of marriage, are given by the county clerk and a search can be conducted at the County Recorder's office. You need to go with as much information as you have about the marriage in question. This should include at least the names of the couple and the place of the marriage. If you know approximately when they were married, this could help narrow the search."

      "content": "Look for church records. The US did not require civil registration of marriages until the twentieth century. If you are looking for information on an earlier marriage, it’s a good idea to try and check church records, which in some cases go back to the 1600s. To find the church records you will need to know where the person lived, as well as the denomination of the church they attended. Church records are generally kept in churches and their archives, at historical and genealogical societies, and in libraries. If the church doesn’t hold the archives, the headquarters of the denomination may do. [2] X Research source"

You may also be able to search for the records at the newspaper's headquarters. You can find archive copies of newspapers in good public libraries, and access should be free of charge in most cases."
