If you wrote your note on a rectangular piece of paper, fold one of the long edges inward to make your note into a square. Position the note so the writing is face-up and the corners are at the top, bottom, and each side of your work surface. [1] X Research source If you want to make your note extra special, write it on the non-colored side of a square piece of origami paper."
