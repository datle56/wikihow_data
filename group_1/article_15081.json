      "title": "Identify an edema blister.",
      "content": "Identify an edema blister. Anyone can get blisters, especially when clothes or shoes chafe your skin. Since edema blisters are caused by excess fluid leaking into your tissue, these blisters aren't caused by things rubbing against your skin. Edema blisters are filled with clear liquid, which is some of this excess fluid. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the blister is filled with blood or colored pus, it's probably not caused by edema.

      "content": "Apply soft padding around the blister if it's on your foot. If your blister is on your foot, putting pressure on it can be painful. Give the blister some comfortable support as it dries up. Cut a piece of soft moleskin into a donut-shape and stick it around the blister. Then, apply a bandage over the blister. [3] X Research source You can find moleskin near first-aid supplies or around shoe inserts at most stores."

      "title": "Cover the blister with a bandage.",
      "content": "Cover the blister with a bandage. Choose a bandage that's large enough to completely cover the blister. Position the bandage over the blister and press down the ends. Avoid pulling the bandage taut across the blister. Instead, stick the ends closer to the blister so the center of the bandage is raised a little. [4] X Research source If you pull the bandage tightly across the blister, it can cause chafing, which will irritate or pop the blister."

      "title": "Avoid popping the blister.",
      "content": "Avoid popping the blister. It may be tempting to pop the blister if it's getting large, but this increases your risk for infection. Don't attempt to pop the blister at home. Instead, contact your doctor if the blister is very painful and they can drain it for you. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If the doctor advises you to drain the blister at home, sterilize a needle with rubbing alcohol and carefully poke the tip into 1 side of the blister so fluid drains."

      "title": "Wear comfortable shoes if the blisters are on your feet.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable shoes if the blisters are on your feet. If you frequently wear heels, they can put extra pressure on your blisters. Switch to shoes with a low heel or no heel at all. For extra comfort, choose shoes that are wide and have a soft sole. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you're struggling to find comfortable shoes, visit a specialty shoe store or ask a podiatrist to design shoe inserts specifically for your feet."

      "content": "Elevate your affected limbs for 30 minutes 3 or 4 times a day. To relieve some of the fluid buildup that's causing the blister, raise your affected limb so it's above your heart level. For example, if you have blisters on your feet, lay down with cushions under your legs to raise your feet above heart level. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you can't take time during the day to elevate the blisters, try to elevate them overnight while you sleep."

      "content": "Eat a low-sodium diet. Help your body reduce fluid in your tissues by cutting back on sodium. Limit how often you eat salty foods and avoid processed foods, which are higher in sodium than the food you prepare at home. Try to eat fresh fruits and vegetables instead of canned produce since these usually have salt added to them.

      "content": "Schedule a doctor's appointment if your blisters don't go away or get worse. Although most blisters caused by edema dry up on their own, you may need medical attention if it gets bigger or feels painful. To make a diagnosis, the doctor will do a physical exam and take your medical history. [10] X Research source Try to track the size of the blisters and how long you've had them. You should also contact your doctor if your skin begins to weep. This is a sign of lymphedema, which occurs when your parts of your lymphatic system become blocked."

      "content": "Treat the underlying cause of your edema. As long as your body releases excess fluid into your tissues, you'll continue to get edema blisters. Once you have a medical diagnosis, follow your doctor's treatment plan. Keep in mind that treatment will depend on your specific condition. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you're taking a medication that's causing edema, your doctor will prescribe something else. If a high-sodium diet is causing the edema, you might need to adjust what you eat, for instance."

      "content": "Ask your doctor if compression bandages are right for you. If your edema affects your legs or arms, talk with your doctor about whether or not you should wrap your limbs with compression stockings or gloves. The compression can prevent fluid from building back up in your tissues, which could make your blisters dry up faster. [13] X Research source If your doctor thinks compression may help, ask them to specify a type of compression therapy."

      "title": "Take prescription diuretics to reduce fluid build-up.",
      "content": "Take prescription diuretics to reduce fluid build-up. If you have moderate to severe edema, your doctor might recommend taking a diuretic, such as furosemide. This medication helps your kidneys flush excess fluid from your body so it doesn't build up in your tissues. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Diuretics aren't effective at relieving edema caused by other medications."
