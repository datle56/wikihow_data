Warning : Always ask the owner of the car for permission before doing this step. If you want, have a sample repair that you can show the owner of the car of what the process will look like. If it's done well, this sample will be reassuring."

Leather or vinyl interiors: Interiors with leather or can be cleaned with a leather or vinyl cleaner and then hit softly with a leather brush.

      "title": "Wash your car's exterior with a car wash soap, not dish detergent.",
      "content": "Wash your car's exterior with a car wash soap, not dish detergent. Park the car in a shady spot and wait until the car's surface is cool to the touch. Use a deep-pile terrycloth microfiber towel which will trap contaminants and not grind them into the car's surface. Tip : Use two pails — one with sudsy cleaner, the other with water — when you clean. After you dip your cloth into the sudsy water and clean a portion of the car, dip the dirty, sudsy water into the pail with water so that you don't contaminate the cleaning pail. Dishwashing detergent strips the polymers off the paint surface and accelerates the oxidation process. Work from the top down, washing and rinsing a section at a time. Do not allow soap to dry. Take the spray nozzle off the water hose before doing a final rinse to minimize spots. Use a chamois or terry cloth towel to dry; do not let air-dry or soap spots will form."

Polish is for a glossy look. Wax is a protectant. Use in length-wise sections. Do not move the machine in a circular pattern. Pay attention to doorjambs, around door hinges and behind bumpers, which you will need to do in a circular motion by hand. Let it dry to a haze. Then finish the auto detailing by buffing with the machine. The hard-to-reach areas can be buffed by hand."
