Instead of thinking forward and back, you're thinking to the left or right. This way you can add in swivels and turns. In most tango forms, the follower swivels on the axis while the leader stays mostly in place. [14] X Research source For example, if you are the follower, you take two steps to the right (slow, slow). Immediately after that second step (and before the third), throw your torso to face the left. Then you resume moving backward. For turns, the leader turns toward his partner 180 degrees on the first quick step and the one following steps between his feet. Now we're getting fancy!"
