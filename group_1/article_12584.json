      "content": "Encourage others to vouch for you and your integrity. Request “character reference letters,” written statements from people closest to you—like friends, relatives, or co-workers—that will enhance your reputation in court and explain how reasonable you are. Ask your “character references” to expand on your strong morals and values. Prioritize people who have known you for a long time and have lots of background knowledge about you. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source While character witnesses may not have seen narcissistic abuse, they are a great source of information about how kind and mature you are. Your attorney will speak to character witnesses in order to confirm that they’ll help with your case.

      "title": "Support your case with perspectives that match your version of events.",
      "content": "Support your case with perspectives that match your version of events. Reach out to anyone—such as teachers, family friends, or neighbors—who were present when you had any disputes with a narcissist and during any time that the narcissist mistreated you. Make sure that what they saw aligns with the facts as well as your testimony, or personal account. Request that they write a “witness statement” that outlines what they experienced and that they sign it to confirm that it’s true. Witnesses may not know you well, but they’re important for a court case because they provide first-hand details about how a narcissist disrespected you. Review witness statements in advance so you’re confident that it captures what you want the court to know about the narcissist. Witness statements can include what a person saw, heard, or felt when they were around the narcissist."

      "title": "Record any interaction that highlights narcissistic abuse.",
      "content": "Record any interaction that highlights narcissistic abuse. While it can be a lot of work, it’s important to write down every negative encounter with this individual. Keep a notepad on hand—either on paper or on your phone—where you can create a daily log of every conversation, phone call, and email you’ve exchanged with the narcissist. Your documentation will be invaluable for establishing the routine behavior of this person. [3] X Research source When you write everything down right away, a narcissist doesn’t have a chance to gaslight you, which happens when they use emotional manipulation to persuade you that events happened differently."

      "title": "That way, you can reach out to people who will testify on your behalf.",
      "content": "That way, you can reach out to people who will testify on your behalf. A “subpoena” is an order that requires an individual to appear in person. They can share their account with the judge and “substantiate,” or verify, that a narcissist has abused you before and that you’ve handled yourself with grace and composure. A subpoena from an ally can prove your case and convince a judge to file for a legal outcome—like a divorce—in your favor. [4] X Research source Your attorney will usually request a subpoena for you, but a court clerk, justice of the peace or notary public actually issues it. A subpoena is typically served in person. You can also use a subpoena to access documents important for your case, such as proof that a narcissist was involved in a domestic abuse case or never paid child support. Anyone who receives a subpoena and appears in court will be paid an “attendance fee” and reimbursed for their transportation, so you don’t have to worry about them being inconvenienced."

      "content": "Entrust trained advocates with all your sensitive information. Avoid any discussion about the case with the narcissist, who is very likely to misrepresent any details you share with them or to claim you’ve acted in a way that you did not. Instead, speak only with your own attorney and any support figures—like victims’ rights advocates—who are trained to prepare you for your day in court. You’ll benefit from professionals who are invested in your success. [5] X Research source You can contact victims’ rights advocates at a shelter or non-profit organization that assists anyone who has experienced domestic abuse. Victims’ rights agencies have trained staff who can help compile legal resources for you. ”Legal clinics” offer free advice if you have general questions about your case. Depending on your income, you may receive legal assistance at a reduced rate. Court staff will not be able to recommend lawyers, but you can search a local directory. Read their bios or reach out and ask if they’ve handled cases with narcissists before."

      "title": "Keep yourself away from a narcissist and stay close to your advocates.",
      "content": "Keep yourself away from a narcissist and stay close to your advocates. When you show up well before the court case, this individual won’t have the chance to approach you and try to speak to you. A good rule of thumb is to arrive at least 20 minutes before you appear in court. Meet your attorney in the court building’s consultation room, where you can review the case and decompress. [8] X Research source You and your attorney can book a consultation room for a certain time that you can have to yourselves. Consultation rooms typically have WiFi and projectors so you can go over different documents and rehearse your statements. Let your legal advocate know if you need some space and would prefer to sit in silence or distract yourself for a moment."

      "content": "Your lack of reactions could upset a narcissist. Since an abusive person thrives off of power dynamics and stirring up negative emotions, refuse to give them the satisfaction. [9] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Instead, only discuss the facts and objective details. When you address the way you’ve been mistreated and remain mature, you’ll expose the narcissist for who they truly are. As a consequence, they’re likely to melt down in court and engage in “melodrama,” or over-the-top stories, which will probably cause the judge to take your side. Narcissists often need constant praise and attention, so if you, your attorney, or witnesses critique them, a narcissist is unlikely to remain level-headed throughout the case. If a narcissist does make degrading comments or lose their temper in court, then a judge is likely to compare that to any documentation that suggests the narcissist is abusive."

When your attorney or the narcissist’s lawyer asks you any questions, look toward the judge and answer in a neutral tone of voice. You’ll take control of the situation, and you might build rapport with the judge. [10] X Research source Make it clear that you’re speaking to the judge with a comment like, “Your Honor, I’d like to address that claim.” Thank the judge for listening to you—you’ll probably come across as polite and respectful. A narcissist might “drag you down” and try to bully you in court or even use sad body language to make you pity them. If you avoid any eye contact with them, you’ll be able to think clearly."
