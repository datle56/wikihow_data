      "content": "Seek help from a therapist. Therapy is commonly the first treatment option for people suffering from BPD. Although there are several types of therapy that may be used in treating BPD, the one with the strongest track record is Dialectical Behavior Therapy, or DBT. It is partially based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles and was developed by Marsha Linehan. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source Dialectical Behavior Therapy is a treatment method specifically developed to help people with BPD. Studies show that it has a consistent success record. DBT focuses on teaching people with BPD to regulate their emotions, develop frustration tolerance, learn mindfulness skills, identify and label their emotions, and strengthen psychosocial skills to help them interact with other people. [3] X Research source Linehan, M. M. (1993). Skills training manual for treating borderline personality disorder. New York; Guilford Press. Schema-focused therapy can also be used to treat BPD. This type of treatment combines CBT techniques with techniques from other therapy approaches. It focuses on helping people with BPD reorder or restructure their perceptions and experiences to help build a stable self-image. Another common treatment for BPD is Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP). TFP focuses on the emotional dynamic between the therapist and the patient. People with BPD have often experienced trauma from events or relationships during their formative years. TFP helps patients understand how these past experiences influence their current thoughts and behavior. The ultimate goal of TFP is to help the patient develop more self-awareness and better emotional regulation. Therapy is commonly conducted in both one-on-one and group settings. This combination allows for the best effectiveness."

Taking some time to slow down during an emotional experience and think about what you are experiencing can help you learn to regulate your emotions. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try “checking in” with yourself several times throughout the day. For example, you might take a brief break from work to close your eyes and “check in” with your body and your emotions. Note whether you feel tense or achy physically. Think about whether you have been dwelling on a particular thought or feeling for some time. Taking note of how you feel can help you learn to recognize your emotions, and that will help you better regulate them. Try to be as specific as possible. For example, rather than thinking “I'm so angry I just can't stand it!” try to note where you think the emotion is coming from: “I'm feeling angry because I was late to work because I got stuck in traffic.” Try not to judge your emotions as you think about them. For example, avoid saying something to yourself like “I'm feeling angry right now. I'm such a bad person for feeling that way.” Instead, focus just on identifying the feeling without judgment, such as “I am feeling angry because I am hurt that my friend was late.” [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

Learning to uncover all of the feelings you may experience in a given situation is an important step toward learning emotional regulation. It is common for people with BPD to feel overwhelmed by a whirl of emotions. Take a moment to separate out what you feel first, and what else you may be feeling. For example, if your friend forgot that you were having lunch together today, your immediate reaction might be anger. This would be the primary emotion. That anger could also be accompanied by other feelings. For example, you might feel hurt that your friend forgot you. You might feel fear that this is a sign your friend actually doesn't care about you. You might feel shame, as though you don't deserve to have friends remember you. These are all secondary emotions. Considering the source of your emotions can help you learn to regulate them."

It can take awhile to feel comfortable or natural doing this, but it's helpful. Research has shown that using positive self-talk can help you feel more focused, improve your concentration, and relieve anxiety. [6] X Research source Remind yourself that you are worthy of love and respect. Make it a game to find things about yourself that you admire, such as competence, caring, imagination, etc. Remind yourself of these positive things when you find that you are feeling negatively about yourself. Try reminding yourself that unpleasant situations are temporary, limited, and happen to everyone at some point. For example, if your coach criticized your performance at tennis practice, remind yourself that this instance does not characterize every practice in the past or future. Instead of allowing yourself to ruminate on what happened in the past, focus on what you can do to improve next time. This gives you a sense of control over your actions, rather than feeling as though you are being victimized by someone else. Reframe negative thoughts in positive terms. For example, if you did not do well on an exam, your first thought might be “I'm such a loser. I'm worthless and I'm going to fail this course.” This is not helpful, and it isn't fair to you, either. Instead, think about what you can learn from the experience: “I didn't do as well as I hoped on this exam. I can speak with my professor to see where my weak areas are and study more effectively for the next exam.”"

      "content": "Stop and check in with yourself before reacting to others. A natural reaction for a person with BPD is often anger or despair. For example, if a friend did something to upset you, your first instinct might be to react with a screaming fit and make threats to the other person. Instead, take some time to check in with yourself and identify your feelings. Then, try to communicate them to the other person in a nonthreatening way. For example, if your friend was late to meet you for lunch, your immediate reaction might be anger. You might want to yell at them and ask them why they were so disrespectful to you. Check in with your emotions. What are you feeling? What is the primary emotion, and are there secondary emotions? For example, you might feel angry, but you might also feel fear because you believe the person was late because they don't care about you. In a calm voice, ask the person why they were late without judging or threatening them. Use \"I\"-focused statements. For example: \"I am feeling hurt that you were late to our lunch. Why were you late?\" You will probably find that the reason why your friend was late was something innocuous, such as traffic or not being able to find their keys. The \"I\"-statements keep you from sound like you are blaming the other person. This will help them feel less defensive and more open. Reminding yourself to process your emotions and not to jump to conclusions can help you learn to regulate your responses to other people."

The next time you feel that sinking, think about what feelings you are experiencing. It could be that this sinking feeling is related to nervousness or anxiety.

You can practice this skill by becoming familiar with your emotions, and gradually exposing yourself to unfamiliar or uncertain situations in a safe environment. Keep a journal throughout the day that notes whenever you feel uncertain, anxious, or afraid. Be sure to note what situation you were in when you felt this way, and how you responded to it in the moment. Rank your uncertainties. Try to place things that make you anxious or uncomfortable on a scale from 0-10. For example, “going to a restaurant alone” might be a 4, but “letting a friend plan a vacation” might be a 10. Practice tolerating uncertainty. Start with small, safe situations. For example, you could try ordering a dish you've never had at a new restaurant. You might or might not enjoy the meal, but that's not the important thing. You will have shown yourself that you are strong enough to handle uncertainty on your own. You can gradually work up to bigger situations as you feel safe doing so. Record your responses. When you try something uncertain, record what happened. What did you do? How did you feel during the experience? How did you feel afterward? What did you do if it did not turn out as you expected? Do you think you will be able to handle more in the future?"

Setting your own personal boundaries, based on your own needs and level of comfort, can help keep you safe and calm as you interact with your loved one. For example, you may tell your loved one that you will not answer phone calls after 10 PM because you need adequate sleep. If your loved one calls you after that time, it's important to enforce your boundary and not answer. If you do answer, remind your loved one of the boundary while validating their emotions: “I care about you and I know you're having a hard time, but it is 11:30 and I've requested that you not call me after 10PM. This is important to me. You can call me tomorrow at 4:30. I'm going to get off the phone now. Goodbye.” If your loved one accuses you of not caring because you do not answer these calls, remind them that you set this boundary. Offer an appropriate time when they could call you instead. You will often have to assert your boundaries many times before your loved one understands that these boundaries are genuine. You should expect your loved one to respond to these assertions of your own needs with anger, bitterness, or other intense reactions. Do not respond to these reactions, or get angry yourself. Continue to reinforce and assert your boundaries. Remember that saying “no” is not a sign of being a bad or uncaring person.
