      "content": "The only way to get armadillo scutes is from an armadillo. However, there are two ways to get scutes from an armadillo: Wait for the armadillo to drop a scute. Armadillos will drop scutes every five to nine minutes [1] X Research source (similar to how often chickens take to lay eggs [2] X Research source ). Brush the armadillo. When brushed, armadillos will drop one scute. One unenchanted brush will get you four (Java Edition) or five (Bedrock Edition) scutes. [3] X Research source Theoretically, if you had enough brushes, you could get an infinite amount of armadillo scutes by brushing them off of the armadillo. A brush is made by combining one feather, one copper ingot, and one stick. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Armadillo scutes are used to craft and repair Wolf Armor. To craft a set of Wolf Armor, you need 6 armadillo scutes. One armadillo scute will also repair 8 points of durability to Wolf Armor. When crafting the Wolf Armor, place one scute in each of the slots in the left-hand column of the 3x3 crafting grid. Then, place one scute in the middle slot, one scute directly to the right of the middle slot, and then one scute in the lower-right corner. The finished pattern should look like a lowercase \"h.\""

      "content": "Armadillos are a passive mob found in badlands and savanna biomes. This includes savanna plateaus, windswept savannas, eroded badlands, and wooded badlands. They are small and brown, and are usually found in groups of two to three. [5] X Research source Armadillos will roll up when injured, or if they are close to an undead or a player that is sprinting or on a mount. When rolled up, their head and feet are not visible, and they look like a brown block."

      "title": "Armadillos can be captured and bred.",
      "content": "Armadillos can be captured and bred. If you need a lot of armadillo scutes, you may want to bring some armadillos back to your base and breed them to get more. Armadillos can be captured with a lead, but they will also follow any players that are holding a spider eye within range. For Java Edition this range is within 10 blocks. For Bedrock Edition, the range is within 16 blocks. To breed an armadillo, you must feed two armadillos each a spider eye. If the armadillo rolls up after eating the spider eye but before it reaches the other armadillo, you must feed it another spider eye for it to breed. Once born, a baby armadillo will grow into an adult after 20 minutes."
