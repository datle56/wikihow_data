With your car in park and your seat belt off, insert your key into the vehicle and turn it on, then immediately turn the key to turn the car back off again. This starts the sequence to reset the alarm in most cars. [1] X Research source This sequence will disable a seat belt alarm in most vehicles, but not all of them. If you try these steps and they don’t work, check your user manual for specific instructions."

      "content": "Turn the car back off. Either turn your key or press your engine button. When you do this, you’ll probably hear a “ding” to indicate that your seat belt alarm is off. [4] X Research source When you turn your vehicle back on, there will be no more alarm! The seat belt light on the dashboard will still come on, but your car won’t ding. Typically, disabling the alarm will last for multiple trips. If the alarm ever comes back on, you can follow the same steps to turn it back off again."

      "title": "Get an unattached seat belt clip if you don’t plan to use the seat belt.",
      "content": "Get an unattached seat belt clip if you don’t plan to use the seat belt. An unattached seat belt clip will stop the seat belt alarm, but you won’t be able to use the seat belt anymore. To use one, simply insert it into the seat belt clip like you would the actual seat belt. Remember that driving without using a seatbelt is very dangerous, and against the law in most areas. These clips are great to put into unused seat belts that aren’t being used on drivers or passengers."

      "title": "Purchase an extender if you plan to use the seatbelt.",
      "content": "Purchase an extender if you plan to use the seatbelt. The other stopper option, called an extender, is a piece that clips into the receptacle, but also provides an additional receptacle so that you can use your seat belt without removing the alarm stopper. If you plan on using the seat belt in the future, get an extender with a seat belt receptacle that will stop the seat belt alarm. [5] X Research source Be sure to buy a seat belt extender that fits snugly inside of your seat belt. That way, it will still be safe enough to use."
