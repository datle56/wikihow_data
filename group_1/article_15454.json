      "content": "Fry your Spam in a skillet to give it a crisp finish. Pour 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of oil into your skillet and place it on the cooktop over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Cut the Spam into 1 in (2.5 cm) slices and fry them for 2-3 minutes, then flip them and let them cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Once you're all finished, they’ll have a perfect crusty exterior and a soft, meaty center. [1] X Research source Be careful not to burn your Spam. The meat product is precooked, so you won't need to fry it for very long. Frying Spam is one of the best ways to prepare it if you’ve never eaten it before because its texture is such a crowd-pleaser. Add a drizzle of maple syrup to the skillet to balance out the saltiness of the Spam and give it a candy-like caramelized crust. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Bake your Spam in the oven to reduce its fat content. Set your oven to 425–450 °F (218–232 °C) and let it preheat. While the oven is warming up, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and slice up your Spam and arrange the pieces on top of it, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each. Bake the Spam slices for 10-12 minutes, or until they start to brown around the edges. If you want to cut back on even more calories, bake your Spam slices on a grill pan or wire rack to drain off some of the excess fat."

Once the cubes are heated through on their first side, flip them over and give them 1-2 more minutes, or until they reach the desired doneness.

      "content": "Eat Spam right out of the can. One of the best things about Spam is that it comes fully cooked, which technically means it needs zero prep and can be eaten raw. This can be a major plus if the power goes out, you find yourself in a situation without any cookware, or you’re just looking for something quick, easy, and filling to wolf down. Bring a few cans of Spam along with you on your next all-day hike or camping trip. Since it doesn’t require heating, it makes a perfect high-protein snack to gobble down on the go. Keep in mind that when eaten straight from the can, Spam has a softer, gelatinous texture, so it's definitely an acquired taste. [4] X Research source"
