      "content": "Eat star fruit with yellow skin. Ripe star fruit is firm and has vibrant yellow skin. [1] X Research source The more yellow the skin is, the sweeter the fruit will be. A yellow star fruit with a bit of brown along the edges is ideal. A star fruit has approximately 28 calories. It is also a worthwhile source of fiber, vitamin C, carbohydrates, and water."

      "content": "Cut the star fruit in slices and eat plain. Use a sharp knife to cut the fruit across the broad side, dividing it into star-shaped slices that are roughly 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (6.35-mm to 1.27-cm) wide. [2] X Research source Wash the fruit well before slicing it. Rinse it under running water, scrubbing it with your fingers until any loose dirt hiding in the crevices comes free. The entire star fruit is edible, so you do not need to peel it or seed it before eating it. Star fruit can be enjoyed plain and on its own without adding it to anything else."

      "title": "Remove the edges and seeds before eating if you wish.",
      "content": "Remove the edges and seeds before eating if you wish. Even though every part of the star fruit is edible, for presentation purposes, you may want to remove any brown edges or seeds. [3] X Research source Wash the fruit, using your fingers to scrub away any dirt while rinsing it under cool, running water. Hold the star fruit steady with one hand. You can either hold it in your hand or brace the bottom against a cutting board or counter. Glide a sharp, smooth kitchen knife along the edge of the star fruit. Make the cut where the green or brown part of the edge begins and slice thinly to only remove the discolored portion of the edge. Slice off the ends. Cut 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) off both ends of the star fruit, removing any green or brown pointed tips. Use a sharp knife to cut the star fruit into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (6.35-mm to 1.27-cm) slices. Cut across the broad side of the fruit to form star shapes. Poke through the center of the star fruit with the tip of your knife to remove any visible seeds."

      "title": "Avoid star fruit if you have kidney problems.",
      "content": "Avoid star fruit if you have kidney problems. The fruit contains a neurotoxin that healthy kidneys can filter out, but damaged kidneys are unable to do so. [4] X Research source Go to a hospital if you experience symptoms of \"star fruit intoxication\" after consuming the fruit. Symptoms include insomnia, hiccups, vomiting, numbness, muscle convulsions or decreased strength, and confusion. These symptoms usually manifest themselves 30 minutes to 14 hours after an individual consumes the fruit. Rarely, star fruit intoxication can even cause death."
