You want to show any prospective bosses or customers your very best work, so gather your most polished and highest quality drawings, sketches, and artwork. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re really great at sketching with charcoal, choose your best pieces to include in your portfolio, but also include your best watercolor or acrylic paintings as well. Avoid including any unfinished pieces or pieces that you aren’t satisfied with. Your portfolio should display art that you’re proud of."

If you’ve already tattooed people, including high-quality pictures of your work will show prospective employers and clients your talent and ability. Collect all of the pictures of tattoos that you’ve completed so you can add them to your portfolio. [2] X Research source It’s often not a requirement for you to have completed tattoos on people to try to become an apprentice at a tattoo shop. Ask anybody tattooed to send you photos of the healed tattoo. Oftentimes, tattoos look much better after the skin has fully healed, especially for designs with lots of colors and detail.

      "content": "This really helps show off your range. Most tattoo shops need artists that are able to do a variety of different styles so they’re able to serve a wide range of customers. When you’re gathering your materials for your portfolio, take some time to whip up a few flash sheets, which are single pages with 4-5 small pieces of art on them. Make flash sheets of different styles to show your versatility as an artist. [4] X Research source A flash sheet is a page of several tattoo designs that people can use to choose a tattoo from. Make flash sheets of some of the standard tattoo styles such as American traditional, black and white, Japanese style, and lettering, which is essentially calligraphy. Use a single flash sheet to display your ability to do a certain style. For instance, you could have a sheet that includes 4-5 small pieces done in American traditional style, or a sheet with different styles of lettering."

Make it a habit to update your portfolio anytime you tattoo somebody or come up with a new design that you like. Snap a picture of a tattoo whenever you finish it and ask people to send you a photo of the tattoo once it’s healed. You could even add a section titled something like, “New Designs” so people can flip through your latest work and look at designs that haven’t been tattooed on anybody yet."

[10] X Research source Try to get the highest quality image possible by making sure the scanner glass is clean and the artwork is completely flush against the surface.

You need to have customers seek you out and using social media to broadcast your work is a great way to get people to notice you and build your personal brand. Post regular content and images of your latest work so people get a sense of your style and want to go to you for their tattoos. [11] X Research source Instagram has become a big resource for many tattoo artists to showcase their work as well as announce openings and book clients. Other social media sites, such as Tumblr and Pinterest, allow you to post lots of images of your artwork and write blog posts that let people get to know you, which is a great branding tool. If you don’t have an Instagram, no worries! You can make one in about 5 minutes."

Visit a domain name and website host website and make a site with a branded domain URL and a photo gallery that includes images of your artwork as well as any tattoos that you’ve done.

Include a section for customers to upload photos and testimonials of tattoos that they got from you. Popular website hosting sites include GoDaddy.com, Squarespace, HostGator, and Google Sites.
