      "content": "Refuse to pay the blackmail. You may be tempted to just give the blackmailer what they want so they’ll go away. Unfortunately, that rarely works. Giving them money or doing special favors for them will only make them ask for more. Trust us, blackmailers will always come back for more if you pay up, so ignore their requests. [1] X Research source Some blackmailers will just go away when they realize you're not going to give them anything. On the other hand, others will follow through on their threats.
