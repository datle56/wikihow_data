[7] X Research source If you can’t tell if they have feelings for you, read their body language right after they kiss you. Do they blush? Do they have trouble looking you in the eye? It might be a sign that they want you to make the first move. If you’re interested in them, take some small risks to determine whether they like you. Make eye contact with them when they’re across the room to see if they return it. Or, ask them for more favors than usual and catch their reaction. If you don’t have feelings for them, you can simply say, “I’m sorry, but I just want to be friends.” Or, “I’m flattered, but I don’t see you in a romantic way.”"
