      "content": "Look on the driver's side front door panel. In most cases, the color paint code in Ford vehicles is written on a manufacturer’s label located on the driver's side front door panel, usually along the rear edge of the door. If you open your door and look along the side of the door, towards the bottom you should see a manufacturer's label. This will contain the color code. [1] X Research source These labels are rectangular and may be printed with a Ford watermark and/or a patterned background. They typically say “MANUFACTURED (or MFD.) BY FORD MOTOR CO. (or COMPANY)” at the top. Modern manufacturing labels typically have a barcode printed on them, while older examples may not."

      "content": "Check the driver's side front door jamb. The majority of Fords will have the manufacture's label on the front door panel. However, it may be on the rear part of the front driver’s side door jamb. Open the front car door on the driver's side. Look at the small ridge around the doorframe on the inside of the car, usually blocked when the door is closed. [2] X Research source The manufacturer's label may be towards the bottom of the jamb, on the rear side (closer to the back of the car)."

      "content": "Locate the color code on the manufacturer's label. Once you've found the manufacturer's label, you can use this to locate the color code. The color code is found below the bar code and is usually marked by 2 characters, which can be either numbers or letters. The 2 digits are listed above or next to the words \"exterior paint colors.\" For example, if you saw the letters \"PM\" written above \"exterior paint colors,\" this would mean the color code is PM. [3] X Research source Some Ford color codes—especially for older vehicles—may be longer than 2 characters. They may also consist of a mixture of letters and numbers. For example, the color code for the shade “Maroon,” used on the 1964 Ford Fleet, is MX705160."

In the event your manufacturer's label is missing, you can use your vehicle identification number to find your color code. You can either contact the Ford company or look the code up online. Your VIN is usually listed on the lower left-hand corner of the dashboard, just in front of the steering wheel. You can read your VIN by looking through the windshield. [4] X Research source"

However, if your VIN does not appear there, you can look in a variety of other locations. [5] X Research source If you pop the hood, look at the front of the engine. The VIN may be listed here. You may also find the VIN near the front of your car's frame, next to the frame of the windshield. You can try opening your driver's side door and looking inside the door frame. You may see the VIN roughly where the side-view mirror would be if the door was closed. You may also see the VIN near where the door latches closed."

The website will be able to provide you with your color code based on your VIN. You may want to call the Ford Company, however, just to double-check that your code is accurate, as websites you find through an Internet search engine may not be officially affiliated with the Ford Company.

      "content": "Do a search for an online paint color library. Sometimes, particularly if you have a vintage Ford, you may have a hard time finding a manufacturer’s label or a VIN number. Fortunately, there are numerous websites that allow you to search for Ford color codes using basic information about your vehicle. Do a web search for something like “car color code library” or “auto paint code database.” You can also do a more specific search, like “1949 Ford paint color codes.” Sites like AutoColorLibrary.com or PaintRef.com are good places to start. Websites for Ford enthusiasts, such as MustangAttitude.com, are also great resources for finding color codes."

Ask around on communities such as FordForum.com if you’re having trouble narrowing down the most likely color matches."
