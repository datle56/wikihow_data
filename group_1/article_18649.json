      "content": "Yes, so long as you increase the weight over time. You can absolutely bulk up with dumbbells, but you’re going to hit a wall if you don’t keep adding weight. Every few weeks, increase the amount of weight you’re lifting by 5–10 lb (2.3–4.5 kg) or so to keep those gains going. [1] X Research source The goal here is to increase the weight so that you’re exhausting your muscles after 6-10 reps for each exercise, and that won’t happen if you don’t keep adding weight. [2] X Research source If you just lift the same 20 lb (9.1 kg) dumbbells for a year, you’re certainly going to stronger, but you won’t get huge muscles. You need to use heavier weights as you get stronger to keep bulking up."

If you can’t even get up to 14 reps before your arms give out, start out with dumbbells that are 5 pounds (2.3 kg) lighter than what you’re currently using. If you get to 22 reps and you aren’t feeling a burn, add 5 pounds (2.3 kg) and repeat the test. When you find a weight where your muscles are strained between 14 and 22 reps, you’ve found your starting weight.

After every day of dumbbell training, take a day off to stretch, use a foam roller, or get your cardio in by running, swimming, or riding a bike. Staying active on your off days will keep your metabolism up which will also help you get that cut, muscular look you’re going for. [17] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 March 2020. You can lift every day so long as you’re working out alternative muscle groups. For example, if you work your arms out one day, do your legs the next. It’s especially important to take rest days if you’re lifting heavier weights. Overdoing it and working out every day can increase your risk of injury, harm your performance, and contribute to poor sleep and mood swings. [18] X Research source"
