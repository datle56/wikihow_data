      "content": "Pull your chicken wing apart at the hinge if it is V-shaped. If your chicken wing has a larger side and a shorter side, break the wing in half. Doing this lets you easily get the meat from the bones. [2] X Research source The V-shaped wing includes the wingette (larger part) and tip (smaller part) of the chicken wing. The wingette is attached to the drumette, which is the most common form of prepared chicken wings. [3] X Research source If your wing is not V-shaped, you do not have to do this."
