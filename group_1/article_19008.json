      "title": "Soak the stained garment in a 4:1 mixture of white vinegar and water.",
      "content": "Soak the stained garment in a 4:1 mixture of white vinegar and water. In a clean bucket or sink, mix 1 cup (237 mL) of distilled, white vinegar with ¼ cup (59 mL) of water. Wet the garment in the mixture, then rub the stained portion against itself to loosen the detergent. Let it soak for up to an hour, then wash as normal. [1] X Research source When you run the garment through the machine again, wash it by itself or with only a few other items. If the stain remains after the wash cycle, repeat this process until it disappears. Don’t run the item through the dryer until the stain is totally gone (the heat will set the stain into the fabric and make it harder to remove)."

    {
      "title": "Soak the stain in rubbing alcohol for about 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the stain in rubbing alcohol for about 15 minutes. First, soak the garment in the hottest water it can tolerate for 10 minutes (check the tag for guidance). Rub the stained spot with your fingers, then wring the garment out. Then, douse the stain with a generous amount of rubbing alcohol and let it sit for 15 minutes. Afterward, rinse the garment and run it through the washer again without any detergent. Repeat this process if the stain remains. Once the stain is gone, dry your garment like normal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash the garment with baking soda",
      "content": "Wash the garment with baking soda instead of detergent. Put the stained garment in the washing machine and add ½ cup (110 g) of baking soda (no detergent). Run the machine like normal to get rid of the stain. For brighter and softer fabric, add 1 cup (237 mL) of white vinegar to the rinse cycle. Alternatively, rub the stain with a paste of equal parts water and baking soda and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then, run it through the washer like normal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub detergent or fabric softener stains with bar soap.",
      "content": "Rub detergent or fabric softener stains with bar soap. To tackle fabric softener stains , lay out the dry garment and rub the stain vigorously with bar soap (no need to add water or soak the item). For extra tough stains, use a soft brush to help work the soap into the fabric. [2] X Research source Then, run the garment through a regular wash cycle in your laundry machine. [3] X Research source Repeat until the stain is 100% gone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply grease remover for fabrics to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply grease remover for fabrics to the stain. Add a small amount of it to a mixture of water and laundry detergent in a bucket or clean sink. Add your garment into the mixture and agitate the stain with your fingers. Then, let it soak for about 30 minutes. Rinse the garment with clean water. If the stain is still there, soak and rinse the garment again. Too much grease remover can make your clothes go slack, so err on the side of using too little than too much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the stained garment in saltwater for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the stained garment in saltwater for 30 minutes. Dissolve ½ cup (137 g) of salt in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, then soak the item for a half hour. Afterward, run the item through the laundry like normal and check to see if the stain is gone. Soak and wash again if the stain lingers. Alternatively, soak the garment in plain warm water for 30 minutes and then wash like normal."

    {
      "title": "Rub dish soap into the stain with a soft brush.",
      "content": "Rub dish soap into the stain with a soft brush . Wet the stain with hot water, then add a drop of degreasing dish soap onto the affected area. Rub the soap in circular motions with a soft-bristle brush until the stain is removed. Then, rinse the garment clean with cold water. Repeat until the stain is gone."

      "title": "Rub lemon juice directly into detergent stains on white clothes.",
      "content": "Rub lemon juice directly into detergent stains on white clothes. Squeeze fresh, 100% lemon juice onto the stain and then pour salt over it. Rub the mixture into the stain gently with your fingers or a brush, then rinse the stain with cool water. Keep repeating until the stain has disappeared. The acetic acid in lemon juice acts as a natural bleaching agent, similar to vinegar."

    {
      "title": "Dissolve powder detergent in the water before adding clothes.",
      "content": "Dissolve powder detergent in the water before adding clothes. If you have a top-loading washer, start your wash cycle and add your powder detergent first. Then, use your hands or a mixing utensil, like a large spoon, to make sure it's fully dissolved before adding your clothes. [4] X Research source If you have a front-loading washer, fully or partially dissolve your powder detergent in a bucket of water, then pour it into your machine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch from powder to liquid detergent.",
      "content": "Switch from powder to liquid detergent. If hard water or powder detergent are consistently giving you stain problems, switch to a liquid detergent that dissolves and circulates more efficiently in your washing machine. If you’re opposed to liquid detergents, add laundry water softener to your washing machine to help powder detergent dissolve and rinse away. [5] X Research source To prevent residue buildup over time, try alternating between powder and liquid detergents if you don’t want to give up powder completely."

      "title": "Wash smaller loads to avoid overloading the washing machine.",
      "content": "Wash smaller loads to avoid overloading the washing machine. It’s tempting to cram as many articles of clothing into the wash as you can to minimize loads, but make sure to only load the machine to its capacity. Fill top-loading machines about three-quarters of the way up the metal drum, or make sure you have a hand’s width between the top of your load and the side of the drum in front-loading machines. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Dilute fabric softener before adding it to your washing machine.",
      "content": "Dilute fabric softener before adding it to your washing machine. To prevent fabric softener stains or residue, mix equal parts softener and water in a bucket or tub before you add it to the wash cycle, rinse cycle, or the dispenser. This helps it circulate through the washing machine easier and cling less to your clothes. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add only the recommended amount of detergent.",
      "content": "Add only the recommended amount of detergent. Read the directions on your detergent packaging (powder or liquid) and make sure not to add more than the indicated amount. Instead of “eyeballing” it, use the detergent bottle cap or provided measuring scoops to portion out the correct amount. [8] X Research source Excess detergent forms a thick paste inside your washing machine that’s difficult to rinse away. This leaves stains or a stiff residue on your clothes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the correct water temperature for your detergent.",
      "content": "Use the correct water temperature for your detergent. Check your detergent’s instructions to see if there is a recommended water temperature—almost always, warmer water will help detergent dissolve better than cooler water. Go with the temperature that most closely matches the directions while still being safe for your clothes. [9] X Research source When in doubt, err on the side of using hot water over cold water. Hot water helps most detergents, powders, and dirt dissolve and rinse away more easily."

    {
      "title": "Your home has hard water.",
      "content": "Your home has hard water. Hard water contains lots of dissolved minerals, like calcium or magnesium, that make it hard for detergents to dissolve in the water too. If your washer runs on hard water, your detergent, fabric softener, and even dirt can circulate in your machine and leave stains on your clothes. Try softening your laundry water with water conditioner and scrubbing away hard water deposits in your washer that might leave stains. In addition to stains, undissolved detergent and dirt can lead to quicker wear and tear on your clothes, towels, sheets, and more."

    {
      "title": "Your powder detergent isn’t dissolving correctly in the water.",
      "content": "Your powder detergent isn’t dissolving correctly in the water. Undissolved powder detergent can leave streaky, white patches on clothes (especially dark colored ones). There are several factors that could affect how powder dissolves, including: [10] X Research source Hard water Too much detergent Incorrect water temperature for the detergent (usually too cool) Too many clothes in the washing machine"

    {
      "title": "The washing machine is overloaded.",
      "content": "The washing machine is overloaded. When there are too many clothes in the washer, the water may not be able to circulate properly among the load or drain properly. This results in pockets of detergent or dirt that get “stuck” in one area and leave stains or streaks on your clothes. [11] X Research source Too many clothes also limits the washer’s ability to tumble the clothes and agitate the water, meaning the detergent is less likely to dissolve properly."
    },
    {
      "title": "You’re adding too much detergent to the load.",
      "content": "You’re adding too much detergent to the load. Laundry detergents are tough chemical cleaners when used in the correct amount, but they can damage your clothes if used in excess. The extra soap can cling and set into fabric, leaving waxy blue or white stains, streaks, or making your clothes stiff."
