      "title": "Pick snails off by hand.",
      "content": "Pick snails off by hand. If you have the time and aren’t squeamish, one of the easiest ways to get rid of snails is by picking them off plants individually. Don a pair of gloves and dispose of them by tossing them in a bucket and taking them somewhere far away from your yard or garden. [1] X Research source Snails tend to hide during the day, so you’ll have the most luck if you search for them early in the morning or at night when they’re most active. To make the process quicker, put an overturned pot or bowl near where you’ve seen the snails. They’ll likely hide under the pot, which will make it easier for you to find them . If you prefer to kill the snails rather than move them, fill the bucket with soapy water. Meservy says to “start looking closely at the plant, holding the leaves, looking under them, [and] picking those snails up and throwing them away. Just [remove] as many as you can possibly find.” [2] X Expert Source Melinda Meservy Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020."

      "title": "Use copper tape or wire to discourage snail activity.",
      "content": "Use copper tape or wire to discourage snail activity. Copper gives snails a tiny shock, so they will instinctively avoid it. Meservy recommends “[buying] a little copper tape and [putting] it around where you don't want the snails to go,” like around potted plants or garden edges. [3] X Expert Source Melinda Meservy Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. If you’re using copper wire , tie it around your pots or make copper garden stakes. [4] X Research source As another option, sprinkle pennies, which contain copper, around the area."

      "title": "Make a beer trap to capture the snails.",
      "content": "Make a beer trap to capture the snails. Snails are attracted to the yeast in beer, making this an effective way to catch and dispose of them. Meservy suggests pouring beer into a small container, “like a little bowl.” [5] X Expert Source Melinda Meservy Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. Bury the container in your garden or wherever you saw the snails, leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the container above the soil. The smell of the beer will attract the snails, which will then drown in the container. [6] X Research source Adding yeast will make the traps more enticing to the snails. You may need to put out multiple traps, as they will only be effective for snails that are close by. Other great options for your beer container include a plastic cup, yogurt cup, old tuna can, or pie dish. Don’t bury your beer trap at soil level, as other beneficial bugs might accidentally die in it."

      "title": "Spray the snails with vinegar.",
      "content": "Spray the snails with vinegar. The acetic acid in vinegar is lethal to snails, as it causes them to dehydrate and die. Mix equal parts of vinegar and water in a spray bottle, then spray the solution around the edges of your yard or garden, plant pots, or anywhere you’ve seen snail activity. Don’t spray your plants directly, however, as vinegar can damage them. [7] X Research source A similar option is to create a garlic spray. Soak 3 crushed garlic cloves in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil overnight. Then, strain the liquid into 1 litre (4.2 c) of water. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of liquid soap to the solution, shake the bottle, then spray the solution around your yard and garden."

      "title": "Use a commercial snail bait.",
      "content": "Use a commercial snail bait. Commercial snail baits can be very effective at killing snails, but many contain chemicals that can harm beneficial insects and wildlife. Whichever you choose, use it according to its directions. Here are a few options to consider: [8] X Research source Iron phosphate : Iron phosphate is the safest snail bait to use because it’s non-toxic to humans and pets. It typically comes in the form of pellets you can scatter around your garden or mix into the soil. This will make the snails stop eating, though it may take as long as a week to kill them. Boric acid : Boric acid is a chemical compound that is deadly to snails but poses minimal risk to other organisms. Sprinkle it around the edges of your yard or garden, or mix it with water and spray it on infested areas. Molluscicide : Molluscicides are pesticides designed specifically to kill mollusks, like snails and slugs. Sprinkle a light layer of a molluscicide that contains ferric sodium EDTA around the area you’ve seen the snails. After they ingest it, they’ll die within 3 days. This can harm other animals, however, so keep children and pets away from the area."

      "content": "Get a pet chicken that will eat the snails. Chickens enjoy munching on snails, so allowing one to roam around your yard or garden is a great natural solution for snail control. The chicken will find the snails for you, so you don't have to do any of the snail removal yourself. Make sure your local laws and ordinances allow you to keep a chicken in your yard before purchasing one, however. [9] X Research source Ducks may also eat snails, but they prefer slugs over snails."

      "content": "Encourage natural snail predators to live in your garden or yard. These include frogs, toads, turtles, birds, possums, and snakes. Which predator you choose will depend on your environment, so talk to your local agricultural extension office or gardening club for recommendations for biological controls that will work in your area. [10] X Research source They can also recommend which plants or shrubs to grow, as well as natural habitats you can build, like rock gardens. Additionally, search online for the best ways of encouraging natural predators in your area."

      "title": "Water your soil in the morning to reduce egg laying.",
      "content": "Water your soil in the morning to reduce egg laying. Snails need to lay eggs in moist soil, and they typically lay eggs while they’re active at night. By watering your plants in the morning, the ground will dry out over the course of the day and will hopefully be dry by the time the snails emerge. [11] X Research source If you can, opt for a drip irrigation system or a soaker hose , which will help manage the ground moisture so that snails can’t easily procreate."

      "title": "Remove moist, decaying debris from your yard and garden.",
      "content": "Remove moist, decaying debris from your yard and garden. Snails are very attracted to moist, decaying organic matter, like dead leaves, so they’ll likely stick around if you don’t clean up often. Check your yard and garden for debris at least once a week. Remove these items and place them in a compost pile or your trash. [12] X Research source Keep in mind that a compost pile is going to be a carnival for your snails. If you have one, keep it far away from your yard and garden. Additionally, surround it with an abrasive barrier to reduce snail activity. Meservy says “if it’s too wet, it’ll attract snails.” [13] X Expert Source Melinda Meservy Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. Even if you put mulch in your garden or flower bed, check regularly to make sure the area isn’t too moist."

      "content": "Put up an abrasive barrier to deter snails. Surround your home or garden with material like broken eggshells, diatomaceous earth , gravel , wood ash , or cedar chips . These items are hard for snails to cross, and in turn, help keep them away from your home. Sprinkle a thin layer around the location you want the snails to avoid.

      "content": "Sprinkle used coffee grounds around your garden. Because snails are sensitive to caffeine, they will naturally avoid used coffee grounds. Spread the coffee grounds on top of the soil or around the base of your home, as needed. As a bonus, coffee grounds add nitrogen to your soil, which can aid in plant growth! [15] X Research source If you don’t drink coffee, check with your local coffee shops, as they may give away their used coffee grounds. This may not be the most effective method, as some people have found that the snails crawl over the grounds anyway."

      "content": "Add plants that naturally deter snails. These include foxglove, euphorbias, Japanese anemones, day lilies, geraniums, astrantia, begonias, salvia, and fennel. Each of these plants has either a smell that snails don’t like or an uncomfortable surface that makes it hard for the snail to climb around it. If you have these in your garden or around your home, snails are less likely to stick around. [16] X Research source For example, put a potted plant near the area where snails are crawling on your home. Keep in mind that foxglove is toxic, so it may not be a good option if you have children and pets in your home."

      "content": "Slime trails One of the most obvious signs of snail activity is the presence of a slime trail. Check on and near your plants for signs of snail mucus. If there are visible trails, it’s a good sign snails have been munching on your plants. [17] X Research source Slugs often leave behind the same signs as snails, so it may be difficult to tell which infestation you have without seeing them directly. Luckily, snails and slugs are generally removed the same way."

      "content": "Quarantine plants for 2 weeks before putting them into your aquarium. Aquarium plants are the most common source of unwanted snails. They often harbor eggs or baby snails, which then reproduce once they’re in your tank. Quarantining them for 2 weeks before putting them in your tank allows you to spot and remove unwanted snails before they infest your aquarium. [22] X Research source If you see any snails during the quarantine period, pick them off the plant as soon as you notice them."

Move your fish to a temporary tank, then empty the water from the aquarium. Remove everything, including the gravel and substrate, then scrub all the snails from the sides of the tank. Sanitize your tank , then move your fish back in. [24] X Research source Replace your gravel and substrate with fresh material for the best results. Before you put your plants and other decorations back in the aquarium, clean them . One way to do this is to dip them in a cleaning solution that’s 19 parts water and 1 part bleach. This will kill any snails or eggs that are on them. If you don’t want to take everything out of the tank, use a siphon to suck out just the gravel and substrate. Additionally, you’ll need to pick the snails off the sides of the tank."

When selecting a predator fish, check its fact sheet to make sure it won’t eat your other fish. Additionally, make sure it’s not too big for your tank. Zebra or dwarf chain loaches are often good for small tanks, while clown loaches, pictus catfish, koi, or large goldfish work well for larger tanks.
