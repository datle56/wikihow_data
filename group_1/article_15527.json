      "content": "Understand where to find DLL files. DLL files—which are binary files used by Windows in order to perform basic tasks—are usually found deep within your computer's system folders. Because of this, it's usually a good idea not to mess with them; if you're positive you want to edit a DLL file, though, you may have to unhide your computer's hidden folders and files. You'll typically find DLL files in the C:\\Windows\\System32 path, which can be found by opening This PC, double-clicking your hard drive, double-clicking the \"Windows\" folder, and double-clicking the \"System32\" folder. If you want to edit the DLL files for a specific program (typically a program you installed yourself), you'll usually find the pertinent files in the installation folder."
