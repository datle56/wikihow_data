      "content": "Make pesto . Chop garlic and fresh basil. Combine in a food processor with toasted pine nuts , and grated Parmesan or pecorino, pouring in olive oil as you blend. Spread on rustic bread or toss it onto freshly cooked pasta — the residual heat from the noodles won't affect the properties of raw garlic. This recipe is very easy to adjust by taste as you go. Start with one clove of garlic for a large bowl of pesto and increase if desired. Two cloves may overpower other flavors. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Whip up some aioli . Another Mediterranean sauce that understand the value of garlic, aioli can add flavor to sandwiches, chicken salad, and many other dishes. You can make the mayonnaise style recipe in a blender, or labor over this handmade Spanish recipe that uses only garlic and olive oil: [4] X Research source Place peeled garlic cloves in a mortar with a pinch of salt. Crush the garlic to a smooth paste with a pestle. Pour olive oil drop by drop into the garlic paste as you continue grinding it with a smooth motion. Keep this up for at least twenty minutes, as the garlic slowly absorbs oil. The finished aioli should be so thick you can turn the mortar upside-down."

      "content": "Go Mexican. Every Mexican dish needs salsa, every salsa needs spice, and garlic is a great way to fill that need. Try these recipes for jalapeño salsa, chipotle salsa, or cooked salsa (with raw garlic added after cooking). If avocados are in season, make guacamole . If your usual recipe doesn't use garlic, try adding one clove. Any more and you may need to reduce the amount of onion or peppers to compensate."

      "content": "Eat it on toast. Better hold your next meeting over the phone — this will leave its mark on your breath.

      "content": "Add garlic to mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes can hide anything, right? Well, raw garlic might test its limits. If you're eating raw garlic purely for health benefits, mince it as finely as you can and stir it into your potatoes once they've cooled down a little. You'll still taste it, but the cream and starch should help spare your sinuses."

      "content": "Munch on apple and garlic. This may sound like a strange combination, but the goal is to hide the garlic, not to create a new favorite snack. Ohio State researches discovered that raw apple can break down the compounds that cause garlic breath. Place thinly sliced garlic between two slices of apple and you may manage to hide the flavor as well as the evidence. The compounds that cause garlic breath are part of the same group of compounds that are often credited with health benefits. The exact link is unclear, but it is possible this method could undermine your goals. Parsley, spinach, and mint had the same effect in this study, making them good choices for a post-garlic breath freshener."

      "content": "Pickle the garlic in a home canner . This garlic isn't exactly raw; the pickling process does reduce the amount of beneficial compounds, but not as much as prolonged cooking does. [5] X Research source Pickled garlic is less intense than raw garlic, so you can add several cloves to sautéed vegetables, salad dressings, and other recipes without overpowering other flavors. [6] X Research source The easiest way to peel large numbers of garlic cloves for canning is to blanch them. Keep them in the water for less than five minutes to minimize the effect on nutrition.

Although the linked recipe blanches the garlic for three minutes, this is probably not long enough to break down the raw nutrients.
