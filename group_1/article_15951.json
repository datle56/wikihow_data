      "content": "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED means your browser thinks your IP address has changed. The full error is usually accompanied by messages that say \"Unable to access the network\" or \"Your connection was interrupted,\" along with \"A network change was detected,\" and usually appears when you're trying to load a website in Chrome, Edge, Brave, or another Chromium-based browser on a Windows PC or Mac. If you click the Refresh button in your browser, you'll usually be able to load the webpage without another error. Still, if this error occurs frequently, it can be annoying."

      "content": "A temporary glitch. In most situations, ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED is temporary, and you'll only see it once or twice before it goes away. The Fix: Refresh the page . If the error goes away and doesn't come back, you're good to go. If not, give your computer a quick reboot. And, if you're at home or have access to the router you're connected through, Oppido recommends unplugging the router for about 30 seconds or so, and then plugging it back in, allowing it about five minutes to boot back up. These quick reboots alone will often resolve ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED errors."

If you are using a VPN or proxy server, it may have temporarily disconnected and reconnected while you were browsing the web, or it may have changed your IP address.

If you switched to Wi-Fi from cellular or vice versa, changed wireless networks, or switched between Wi-Fi and ethernet, ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED could pop up due to the change in your IP address and/or DNS. The Fix: Doing a quick page refresh should fix the error once you're on a new network. If not, try clearing the browser cache and cookies . You also may consider disabling the \"Connect automatically\" feature for certain Wi-Fi access points to prevent your computer from connecting to them when you briefly lose your connection."

Whether the issue is with your DNS cache or the DNS servers automatically assigned to you by your internet provider or router have changed, DNS problems are a common cause of ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED errors.

If you don't want to reboot, you can flush it manually by running a quick command from the Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal for Mac. Windows: Open Command Prompt as an administrator.

      "content": "Software on your PC or Mac is messing with your connection. Software utilities that use your network connection sometimes prompt ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED errors in your web browser. This is especially common with the Home app and Xcode for macOS, but could also occur with certain overzealous antivirus programs, privacy software, and any third-party utilities that use your network connection. The Fix: Close applications that are running in the background. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus protection, closing the Home app if you're using a Mac, and anything else you know of that uses the internet in the background. If the network change error goes away, you'll know that app was the problem."

      "content": "Other connected devices are interfering with your connection. Some Windows and Mac users have found that having internet-enabled devices connected to their computers or the network can sometimes cause ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED. This could be something as innocent as an iPhone or iPad plugged into your computer or as complex as a switch or Wi-Fi extender. The Fix: Disconnect unneeded devices from your computer or network. If you're using a mesh Wi-Fi router, try disabling the mesh feature, or features like \"Client Steering\" and \"Thread\" in your router settings. If you have a network switch, try bypassing it to get a direct connection to the internet and see if the issue is resolved."
