      "content": "Watch for flushing on your face and neck. The color of your skin can range from light pink to red or purple, and your skin will feel hot. Some people experience flushing for no reason at all, but it can also be triggered. Skin may be flushed for just a few minutes, but it could also last for hours.

      "content": "Watch for difficulty breathing, especially if you don’t have asthma. People who have carcinoid syndrome may experience symptoms similar to asthma, even though they don’t have it. This can include wheezing, shortness of breath, and feeling like you can’t breathe. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may experience this during an episode of skin flushing. If this happens, talk to your doctor as soon as possible to rule out possible causes. Seek emergency care if you cannot get your breath."

      "content": "Notice repeated episodes of diarrhea with no clear cause. Diarrhea is a symptom with a lot of causes. If you do have carcinoid syndrome, it can cause watery, loose stools that are accompanied by abdominal cramps. While it's a common symptom of people with the condition, diarrhea alone does not mean that you have carcinoid syndrome. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Talk to your doctor to rule out other causes of diarrhea before settling on carcinoid syndrome."

      "content": "Watch for episodes of rapid heartbeat, along with the other symptoms. Rapid heartbeat may last for short or extended periods of time. While rapid heartbeat alone does not mean you have carcinoid syndrome, it could be an indication of the condition if other symptoms are present. A drop in blood pressure may occur concurrently with changes in your heartbeat."

      "content": "Notice a persistent cough when you haven’t had a respiratory illness. If the tumor is in your lungs, then it may also result in a persistent cough. This is usually only a concern if you haven't had a prior infection. [6] X Research source You may also cough up blood. If the condition goes undetected for an extended period of time, you could develop pneumonia."

      "title": "Watch for unexplained weight gain.",
      "content": "Watch for unexplained weight gain. Since carcinoid syndrome can lead to extra chemicals in your bloodstream, you may gain weight with no explanation. It’s best to keep track of what you’re eating and how often you exercise so that your doctor can determine if the weight gain could be caused by a medical condition. [7] X Research source Remember, weight gain alone does not mean that you have carcinoid syndrome."

You should also let the doctor know if anything in your life has changed recently. Ask your doctor if there are any pre-appointment restrictions you should follow, such as fasting. If you doctor suspects carcinoid syndrome, they’ll refer you to a specialist, such as an oncologist, endocrinologist, or surgeon."

You can get a CT scan or MRI, depending on what your doctor recommends. The doctor may give you a radionuclide before conducting the test so they can look for a tumor. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Radionuclide is a small amount of radioactive substance, so it will show up on the CT or MRI. This allows the doctor to check for abnormal areas or masses, which could indicate a tumor. The doctor will start with your abdomen, which is where these tumors are most often located.

Octreotide or lanreotide is usually given along with other treatments, such as surgery. [16] X Research source These medicines are more commonly prescribed when the tumor has spread. In some cases, the doctor will also prescribe alpha-interferon, which helps improve your immune system. Together, these medications can help reduce the size of your tumor."
