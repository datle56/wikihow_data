Knowing these things could help you to determine the direction of your character. Your DM may also want you to fill a certain role amongst the group. Your DM may also have some restrictions on your character creation process such as having classes, origins, or alignments. They may have these restrictions for a multitude of reasons, but it's important to ask before even thinking about designing your character. Your DM may also have specific rules about how they want you to design your character —one of the most common being determining your ability scores. Your DM may also want to talk to you about any of the number of decisions you'll have to make about your character throughout the creation process."

Take what you have so far to them, and when you finish, write down a brief description of the story in the \"Backstory & Personality\" slot on the character sheet. It's a good idea to write down a longer version of the story somewhere else; it's likely that the character sheet will not provide an adequate amount of space. A few ideas could be: Do you want to be running from the law? Has your character stolen from an archwizard? Do you want to be running away from your royal responsibilities? Do you want to be hunting for some hidden treasure? Has your character been seeing hidden messages within their dreams? Perhaps a prophetic dream will lead your character on an adventure. The sky's the limit; now that you have a better idea of who your character is, it's time to flesh out those details."

But, like everything, character sheets have moved along with the digital age. There are dozens of online services that you could use to make your D&D character sheets. There are also various paper character sheets that you could choose from. The three best options for the D&D 2024-character sheet are D&D Beyond, Roll20, and good old pencil and paper. There are also a lot more character sheet creators for D&D 2014, but a lot of their information could be wrong or outdated. Your DM may also want a copy of a character sheet and also may have a preference for which one you use. For examples of where to write things down, this article will be using the standard 2024 paper character sheet. You also may want to borrow or buy a copy of the D&D 2024 player’s handbook."

The 7 basic races are: [2] X Research source Aasimar: Mortals who carry the spark of Divinity in their souls, whether being descendants from angels or infused with Celestial power. They can arise in any population and look like their parents, but with hints of their Celestial nature. They retain the celestial's ability to heal with their hands and to even potentially sprout divine wings. Dragonborn: Proud, self-sufficient, and loyal. Dragonborn are descended from dragons and possess attributes of both dragons and humanoids. Stat modifiers: +2 Strength, +1 Charisma Dwarves: Short, stocky, stern, and strong. They have a connection to the earth and often live in mountains or underground lands. Stat modifiers: +2 Constitution Elves: Tall, long-lived, aloof, and connected to nature. Elves live in harmony with the natural world around them. Stat modifiers: +2 Dexterity Gnomes: Mysterious, adventure-seeking, and strange. Gnomes are the smallest common race. Stat modifiers: +2 Intelligence. Goliaths are descendants of Giants. Goliaths can manifest their ancestor's powers. Half-elves: Solitary, long-lived, graceful, and hearty. Half-elves are fewer in number and tend to be wanderers due to their lack of homeland. +2 Charisma, +1 in 2 abilities of your choosing Half-orcs: Independent, strong, and distrusted. Half-orcs are considered monstrosities by the common folk. They are tall and powerfully built. Stat modifiers: +2 Strength, +1 Constitution Halflings: Optimistic, cheerful, curious, and small in stature. Only 3 ft (.9 m) tall on average, they are agile but physically weak. Stat modifiers: +2 Dexterity Humans: Adaptive, ambitious, and well-balanced. Humans are the dominant race and are diverse in appearance and culture. Stat modifiers: +1 to each ability Orcs: were created by their God as an instrument of War and God equipped his children with gifts to help them survive planes.

The types of dragon and their associated damage types are as follows: black (acid), blue (lightning), brass (fire), bronze (lightning), copper (acid), gold (fire), green (poison), red (fire), silver (cold), and white (cold). Elf: As an elf, you can choose between the drow (dark) elf, high elf, and wood elf. The Dark Elves were corrupted by a Dark Elf goddess named Loth. High Elves build mighty castles and fancy architecture—high elven cities are magnificent places. Wood elves live in the forest amongst the trees, and each of them get abilities that reflect that. Gnome: Gnomes can choose between the forest and the rock gnome. Forest gnomes normally live on the surface amongst the trees, and rock gnomes normally live beneath the surface tinkering and constructing. They get abilities to reflect that. Goliath: Goliath ancestry only affects one ability. You can choose between the different types of giant ancestors such as Cloud, Fire, Frost, Hill, Stone, and Storm, and they get an ability related to that ancestry. Tiefling: this lineage determines what type of fiend was your ancestor or from which fiend type you originate. The options are Abyssal, Chronic, and Infernal, and you can obtain resistances and spells related to them. Once you're done choosing your lineage, you can decide to include that either next to your species or alongside your species traits."

As your character completes adventures, they’ll gain experience points (XP), which are used to raise your level and earn abilities and powers. Wizards of the Coast, the creators of Dungeons & Dragons, may add more classes in future books that expand upon the rules. As of now, there are 12 basic classes: Barbarian: Uncivilized and strong, barbarians are considered brutal berserkers. Although of average strength, their might in battle comes from their rage. Bard: Charismatic and crafty, bards use skills and spells to help and harm. They're considered a jack of all trades and invoke magic through music, dance, or verse. Cleric: Firm believers in a deity, clerics heal, raise the dead, and direct the wrath of god to perform miracles. Druid: At one with nature, druids cast spells, interact with animals, and shapeshift into animals and plants. They are considered wise and belong to an ancient order. Fighter: Firm and brave, fighters are capable with weapons and comfortable in armor. They're unparalleled on the battlefield. Monk: As martial masters, monks train their minds and bodies for offense and defense. Rigorous combat training and mental discipline mean they can fight without weapons and armor. Paladin: Followers of the good and just, paladins are devoted knights. United by an oath to stand against corruption, they heal their allies and smite their enemies. Ranger: Masters of woodcraft and wildlife, rangers track and hunt foes. They use the magic of nature to protect the world. Rogue: Stealthy assassins, rogues are cunning thieves and able scouts, with a knack for finding their way out of any predicament. Sorcerer: Natural-born spell casters, sorcerers command strange, ancient energies. Innate magic courses through their blood, sometimes running in the family, others unsure of their power's origin. Warlock: As people who gained magic from a bargain with an extraplanar entity, warlocks have fewer magic charges but regain them more easily. They are thirsty for power and knowledge. Wizard: As lifelong magic students, years of study allow wizards to use awesome magic powers. [3] X Research source"

Dexterity (Dex): A measure of agility. This includes balance and reflexes. Important for rogues, light- to medium-armor-wearing characters, and ranged attackers (like bow and sling users). Constitution (Cons): A measure of health and fortitude. Constitution increases your character’s hit points, which, if depleted, can result in fainting or death. Intelligence (Int): A measure of knowledge. Important for wizards and classes requiring reason or learning, like paladins. Wisdom (Wis): A measure of correct judgment. Wisdom contributes to common sense, awareness, and willpower. Important for clerics, druids, and rangers. Charisma (Cha): A measure of magnetism.

Think about the following, then fill in your ability score modifier and ability score into the slots on your character sheet.: When deciding on where your stance goes, take into account the ability score increases that you get from your background. There are three ability scores associated with every background. You can increase the ability scores in two different ways: either you increase all three of the ability scores by one, or you can increase two of the ability scores—one of them by two and one of them by one. On your backgrounds page, it should say which ones are associated with the background. Something else that might influence where you put your ability scores is the ability score modifiers.

Make a distinction, e.g., writing them down in a different color or just writing down next to the spell where it comes from, like burning hands Tiefling or Detect Magic Initiate. Some classes like the Druid or Cleric allow you to change which prepared spells you have on a long rest from their entire spell list. The Bard, Sorcerer, and Warlock have you select some spells equal to the prepared spells on their class feature table of a level that you can cast in that class You can't change that list unless you level up.

When you select your Spells at first level, you're only picking first-level spells. The class itself should also tell you how many cantrips that you would get. Cantrips are separate from spells being the spell level zero. Cantrips will increase in Effectiveness after certain level milestones. You can also use them as many times as you would like. The act of the spell but just a free spell which is normally weaker. You should have a good idea of what spells and cantrips you choose or are given. Write down the spells or cantrip in the \"cantrips and prepared spells section\" of the character sheet. Notably, you're going to want to include the spell level. Use C or 0 for a cantrip. Spells can vary in casting time: this may be an action, bonus action, reaction, or number of minutes. For short you can write 1A, 1AB, 1R, or X mins. You'll also need to write down if it is a concentration, ritual, or requires a material. Jot down beside it where you got the spell from, especially if it's not from a class."

In some cases, like with very heavy weapons and armor, there may also be penalties. A high armor class (AC) will make your character more resistant to damage. Attack bonuses help you land damaging hits. Use the following calculations to determine your AC and attack bonuses: AC = 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity Modifier + other modifiers (like racial or class) Melee attack bonus = base attack bonus + Strength Modifier + size modifier Ranged attack bonus = base attack bonus + Dexterity Modifier + size modifier + range penalty (if any) Size modifiers are determined according to the following scale: Colossal (-8), Gargantuan (-4), Huge (-2), Large (-1), Medium (+0), Small (+1), Tiny (+2), Diminutive (+4), Fine (+8). Small characters are generally more agile, whereas large ones are generally strong. Larger characters can also carry larger and heavier objects. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill in the numbers.",
      "content": "Fill in the numbers. You'll need to fill in your level: this will most likely be level one. Below the level, you can put in zero XP. If your character is a higher level than level one, either after you play a first session, or you're starting at a higher level, complete the step before you start working on the higher levels. Put in the adjusted XP for your level. Your proficiency bonus at level one will be plus two—this will be shown on your class feature chart along with other places within the Player's Handbook. Your skills and saving throws should be whatever the ability score modifier is. If you're proficient in the saving throw or skill, add your proficiency modifier. Also, if you have expertise in a skill, you should add a proficiency modifier again at level 1—this would be a plus four instead of a plus two. For your initiative, it should just be your dexterity modifier, unless you have an ability that says you add something else to it. Your speed should be listed in your species. Some features can permanently increase this, and some features and spells can temporarily increase this. Your size will be listed in the species. There are also some features and spells that will temporarily increase or decrease this. Your passive perception will be 10 plus your perception skill. Your Max hit dice will be equal to your level. If you want to get fancy with it, you could also write down what the dice is in terms of dice. This will be listed on the core features of your class. The spent hit dice will be equal to the maximum hit dice unless you spend some, but it will come back on a long rest. How you calculate your maximum hit points will be listed on your class features for the first level; it should be something like 6, 8, 10, or 12 + Constitution modifier. At higher levels you will add 4, 5, 6, or 7 + your Constitution modifier. The amount you add is based on your class Barbarian being 12 and 7. Fighter Paladin Ranger being the 10 and 6. Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, and Warlock are 8 and 5. Lastly, the one Wizard and sorcerer are the 6 and 4. That's how you calculate your maximum HP, and your current HP will be your maximum until you take damage. Temporary HP is given to you by spells or abilities and will only last for however long they say, or until you take damage or a short rest. Armor class is calculated by the armor equipment that you have. If you are wearing no armor then you have a 10 plus your dexterity, but if you are wearing armor (For example, stud leather armor is a 12 plus your dexterity modifier.) If you had plate male armor, it would just be 18 plus nothing. If you have a shield and add a +2 to your AC. The Monk and Barbarian have a feature called unarmored defense: when they're not wearing armor they get something added to their AC, equal to their wisdom and Constitution modifiers respectively. Some magic items and spells might affect your AC both temporarily and permanently and some magical armors or magical Shields may have a higher pulse than their non-medical counterparts. More information on the AC of each armor is listed under the armor section. For those who have spells, you'll need to write down the spellcasting ability, that being the intelligence, wisdom, or charisma. You'll need to write down the modifier which is just the ability score modifier associated with the spell casting. You'll also need to note the DC, which is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting modifier. If you're playing a wizard with a plus 4 intelligence at level one, your spell save DC would be a 14. Your spell attack bonus will be your spellcasting modifier plus your proficiency bonus. Under the weapon in the cantrips section, you can write down the name of the weapon or cantrip, e.g., longsword or firebolt, and the attack bonus For a weapon, attack bonus would be the ability associated with it: normally strength, unless you have an ability that specifies otherwise, or if the weapon itself has a property that specifies otherwise, such as finesse or range. In the long sword's case, it would be strength, so it would be your strength modifier plus your proficiency modifier to your attack bonus. The damage here would be 1d8, plus your strength modifier or 1d10, plus your strength modifier if you're two-handed, because it has The Versatile property. Also for the long sword, you would want to write down that it does slashing damage. For example, back to Firebolt, the attack bonus would be your spell attack bonus and the damage 1d10 fire damage plus nothing - unless you have abilities to specify otherwise."

Note down your alignment under the backstory and personality section of your character sheet. Good characters are driven to protect innocence and life. Good sacrifices for others and cares for the dignity of sentient creatures. Evil characters undermine or harm life. Evil hurts, harms, and oppresses, usually for fun or personal gain. Morally neutral characters avoid killing, but usually lack a sense of obligation to sacrifice for or protect others. Lawful characters respect order, truth, authority, and tradition. They are often closed-minded, overly rigid, and self-righteous. Chaotic characters make decisions according to their conscience. They resent authority and love freedom, though they can be reckless and irresponsible. Order neutral characters are generally honest but susceptible to temptation.
