Most users can leave this as is, unless you are formatting the disk for use with a specific file system. FAT is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Allocation unit size - This should be set to Default allocation size . Most users can leave this at default. Volume label - Choose a name for the disk that will appear when it is inserted. Try to keep it to 16 characters or less. Format options. You can select \"Quick Format\" to format the disk quicker, but the data will not be securely deleted. The speed gains for quick formatting a floppy disk are negligible, so you're probably best leaving this unchecked. You can also choose to create an MS-DOS startup disk, which is useful if you're troubleshooting an older machine, but you won't be able to use the disk for storage."

Keep it under 16 characters for compatibility. /q - Performs a quick format. /c - Files added will be automatically compressed (NTFS only) /p: # - Overwrites the space on the disk with 0s and then random numbers for each count. Replace # with the number of counts you want to occur. This is best used for sensitive data you want to completely erase (Vista and later only). [1] X Research source"
