      "title": "Rinse the sweet potatoes thoroughly with cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the sweet potatoes thoroughly with cool water. Hold each sweet potato under your faucet and lightly scrub the skin with cold water to remove any dirt or debris. It’s especially important that you clean the potatoes off thoroughly if you plan to leave the skins on. [1] X Research source Clean the potatoes even if you plan to remove the skin. This prevents dirt and bacteria from spreading from the skin to the freshly cut potato flesh."

      "title": "Pat the potatoes dry with a paper towel or soft cloth.",
      "content": "Pat the potatoes dry with a paper towel or soft cloth. Sweet potatoes can be slippery, so it’s important to dry them off well before you start slicing them. Place the rinsed potatoes on a dry paper towel. Use a dry paper towel or cloth to soak up excess moisture on the potato skin. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer skin (if desired).",
      "content": "Use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer skin (if desired). Hold the sweet potato vertically in your non-dominant hand. Hold a serrated or regular vegetable peeler in your dominant hand. Make long, even strokes along the potato’s skin from root to tip. [3] X Research source After skinning the first section, turn the potato and continue the root-to-tip strokes until all of the skin is gone. You don’t have to remove the skins if you don’t want to. Many people enjoy the skin’s texture, and it's packed with vitamins and minerals. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice off both ends of each potato.",
      "content": "Slice off both ends of each potato. Hold the potato horizontally on a flat surface, like a sturdy cutting board, with your non-dominant hand. Pick up a sharp knife with your dominant hand. Slice about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off both ends of each potato that you're using. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Roll the potato on an even surface to find the flattest side.",
      "content": "Roll the potato on an even surface to find the flattest side. Holding the potato horizontally against the cutting board, roll the potato gently with your hand until you find the flattest, most stable side. This will make slicing the potato much easier and safer. [6] X Research source If there isn’t a stable side, slice a thin sliver off one of the sides to create one. A 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) sliver will do the trick."

      "content": "Slice the potato lengthwise in 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) planks. Starting on 1 of the long sides, slice the potato from end to end into pieces about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Work your way systematically to the other side of the potato until the whole thing has been sliced into 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) planks. [7] X Research source Make the planks as even as possible so you'll end up with consistently sized fries."

Hold the 2 planks steady with your non-dominant hand, then slice them lengthwise into sticks approximately 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. [8] X Research source Make the matchsticks as consistent as possible to ensure even cooking."

      "content": "Cut each potato in half. After rinsing each potato and removing the skins (if desired), hold 1 potato against a flat surface with your non-dominant hand. If the potato has a flat side, place that against the surface for the most stability as you make the slice. Cut the potato in half crosswise down the middle. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Slice the pieces in half lengthwise one more time. Return to your pile of potato pieces, then cut each piece in half once more. Be sure to cut each one lengthwise so you end up with long wedges rather than short, stumpy ones. Make each wedge approximately 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) thick.

For something simple, try 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of paprika. [17] X Research source Consider adding 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of rosemary. For Cajun-inspired fries, sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoons of oregano, 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon of dried thyme. [18] X Research source For a Tex-Mex flavor, sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and sea salt. Customize the amount used for each seasoning according to your personal taste.
