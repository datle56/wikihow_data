      "content": "Know what to avoid. When cutting a SIM card, you don't want to cut into the gold or metal part of the card, as doing so will render the SIM card useless (and irreparable). The best way to ensure that you don't accidentally cut into the metal is by cutting wider than is necessary and then using your file or sandpaper to get the SIM card down to the size you need. If you're trying to install a SIM card in an Android or iPhone , be sure to contact your carrier first. In most cases, you'll receive a new SIM card instead. Otherwise, the old SIM card can be transferred or switched to your new device."

Standard SIM : Measures 15 millimetres (1.5 cm) by 25 millimetres (2.5 cm)."

      "content": "Trim the excess from a standard SIM card. If you're trying to cut a standard SIM card, start by cutting along the line created by the cut-out sections on the left side of the card. This should leave a couple of millimeters' worth of space between the left edge of the card and the metal part of the SIM card. The left side of the standard SIM card is the side that doesn't have an angled piece missing from the corner. Skip this step if you have a micro-SIM card."

      "content": "Place your nano-SIM card on top of the other SIM card. You cannot adequately measure the amount of space to cut without using a nano-SIM card as a guide. To ensure that you do this in as uniform a way as possible, do the following: Place the standard or micro-SIM card on a flat surface. Make sure that the angled corner of the SIM card is in the top-right corner of the card when looking down at it. Place the nano-SIM card on top of the SIM card. Make sure that the angled corner of the nano-SIM card is in the top-right corner of the card when looking down at it. Make sure that the bottom-left-most corner of the nano-SIM card is lined up over the bottom-left-most corner of the SIM card that you're going to cut."

      "content": "File down the remaining plastic. With your nail file or sandpaper, remove most of the plastic border on the bottom and sides of the SIM card. Use the existing nano-SIM card that you have as a reference for this step. Keep the majority of the plastic at the top of the SIM intact until after you've tested the SIM card's fit. Keep in mind that a nano-SIM card still has about a millimeter of plastic around its perimeter, so stop short of removing 100% of the plastic."

If it fits, you've successfully cut down the SIM card to a nano-SIM size; at this point, you're free to test the nano-SIM card in your phone by inserting the SIM card and powering on the phone. If the SIM card still doesn't fit, you'll need to file it down some more."
