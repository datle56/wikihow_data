      "content": "Cover your cap in artificial flowers, butterflies, or other baubles. If you’d rather not fuss with stick-on letters, paint, or printing, decorate your cap with pretty ornaments instead. Use hot glue to glue artificial flowers directly to the cap. [6] X Research source Or, apply other cute craft items like rhinestones , fake butterflies , craft glitter , bows , and stickers. Leave space in the middle for the button you attach your tassel to. If you’re worried about baubles falling off the cap itself, attach the decorations to a piece of cardstock with hot glue. Use fabric glue to attach the cardstock to the cap. If you don’t want to cover the entire cap with fake flowers or another decorative item, cluster them on one side. That way, you leave room for a quote and create a cool asymmetrical design. Shout out to your friends by gluing Polaroid photos of your favorite memories together to your cap."

      "content": "Decide if you want to DIY or order a pre-made design. Not everyone is naturally crafty. Plus, it might be cheaper to order a premade graduation cap than to hit the craft store yourself. Find a premade graduation cap on a site like Etsy. Make sure you order well in advance so it arrives on time for commencement. Read reviews and look at pictures from past orders to make sure the seller is legitimate and the design is what you want. Read listings for pre-made designs carefully. Some have to be assembled by you—they send you the materials and instructions. Others sell a pre-made design that you can glue to your cap or a generic cap that’s already decorated."

      "content": "Plan out your design before you decorate. Sketch your design on paper or in a graphic design app like Canva. If you’re applying fake flowers, stick-on letters or numbers, or other baubles, first trace around your grad cap with a pencil on a blank piece of paper. Then, arrange the decorations within the penciled area to see how they’ll fit on the cap."

      "title": "Apply your decorations one at a time.",
      "content": "Apply your decorations one at a time. Think about the design in terms of layers. First, glue or paint the background of the design, if it has one. Next, add letters and numbers. Save artificial flowers, glitter, rhinestones, and the like for last, since they’ll be the hardest to move once they’re in place. To get glitter to stay on the cap once glued, spray clear spray paint or apply a sealant like Mod Podge , says arts & crafts specialist Claire Donovan-Blackwood. Spray it in a well-ventilated area or outside so you don’t breathe in the fumes. Allow adequate time for paint and glue to dry completely before the ceremony—let the design sit overnight, at a minimum. You don’t want it falling apart during the ceremony!"

      "content": "It’s usually okay to decorate your grad cap, but check first. Review your school or university’s graduation attire policies for confirmation that decorating your cap is allowed before you start. If there are no specific guidelines, reach out to the commencement committee and ask. Also note that if you’re renting your cap and gown, you have to use removable decorations that won’t damage the cap. Check if your school has a contest rewarding the best customized graduation cap. You might just win!"

      "content": "Avoid any inappropriate decorations or messages. Although you might want to throw in a swear word or a reference to how booze got you through college, school officials may deem your design inappropriate and keep you from participating in commencement. To be on the safe side, avoid using expletives, references to drugs and alcohol, and anything else that could be considered offensive in your design."

      "content": "If you’re renting or borrowing a grad cap, use removable decorations. You don’t want to ruin your graduation cap—especially if you have to return it after the ceremony. To prevent any permanent damage, use craft materials that leave no trace and are easily removed. For example, use washi tape and foam letter stickers to create a design that won’t leave adhesive residue over the cap’s fabric. Another option is to create your design on chipboard that has the same measurements as your grad cap and affix it to the cap with colorful binder clips . That way, nothing’s glued to the cap—and you can decorate the chipboard however you’d like. [7] X Research source"

Store the cap in a plastic bag that seals tightly so moisture won’t get in and cause mold or mildew. Keep it in a cool, dry, temperature-controlled place like a ground-floor closet. A plastic container with a tight lid is another option. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Frame your grad cap in a shadow box. Order a shadow box frame specifically for preserving graduation caps, or make your own from a regular shadow box . To DIY one, purchase a shadow box that’s a few inches larger than the cap and has a linen board. Then, follow these steps: Cut a hole in the center of the linen board that’s the same size as the fabric part of the cap that you wear over your head. Pull the fabric part of the cap through the hole so it sticks out the back. [9] X Research source Secure it in place with tape. Return the linen board to the shadow box frame, pressing it flat against the back of the frame. [10] X Research source Reassemble the shadow box and display. [11] X Research source"
