      "title": "Make sure you have enough Pokéballs.",
      "content": "Make sure you have enough Pokéballs. Ralts has a relatively high Catch Rate, so regular Pokéballs should work well for catching it. However, you'll want to make sure you have multiple Pokéballs with you, in case your first attempt at catching Ralts is not successful. [3] X Research source If you'd like, you can also bring a Quick Ball with you if you'd like to try and catch Ralts when your encounter first begins (which is when Quick Balls are more likely to work [4] X Research source )."

      "content": "Include Pokémon on your team that know Steel, Poison and/or Ghost-type moves. Since Ralts is a Fairy and Psychic-type Pokémon, it is weak to those types of moves, so including a Pokémon or two on your team that knows a move of one or more of a these types can help make catching Ralts even easier. [5] X Research source Note that Ralts is immune to Dragon-type moves, unless it is given a Ring Target, in which case Dragon-type moves will have a normal level of effectiveness.

      "content": "Learn where Ralts can be caught. In Pokémon X and Y, there is only one location where Ralts can be caught, and that is on Route 4 [7] X Research source , also known as Parterre Way [8] X Research source . You have a chance of encountering Ralts in either the red or yellow flowers on this Route, but in both instances its Encounter Rate is very low [9] X Research source , so be sure to keep that in mind and note that you may be looking for a little while."

      "title": "Decrease Ralts' health.",
      "content": "Decrease Ralts' health. Doing this is another way to help make catching Ralts even easier. You can also use moves that inflict status conditions such as sleep or paralysis [10] X Research source . Once Ralts' health is low enough or you've caused it to fall asleep or paralyzed it, throw a Pokéball. Eventually, you should successfully catch it. Once you've caught Ralts, add it to your party to ensure it is able to level up and eventually evolve."

      "content": "Trade with Diantha for Ralts in Lumiose City if you've become the Champion. If you've completed the game and defeated Diantha to become the Champion, head to Café Soleil in Lumiose City and find Diantha. Once you do, talk to her and simply trade a Pokémon of your choosing with her to receive a Ralts. [11] X Research source Like with a Ralts caught in the wild, make sure you add this Ralts to your party so it can level up. This Ralts will be at level 5 and holding Gardevoirite [12] X Research source , which allows Gardevoir to Mega Evolve into Mega Gardevoir if you have the Mega Ring. [13] X Research source To obtain the Mega Ring, you'll need to defeat either Calem or Serena in a battle, depending on your game. After that, complete the Shalour Gym and obtain the Rumble Badge. Then, visit the top of the Tower of Mastery, and Korrina will give you the Mega Ring. [14] X Research source"
