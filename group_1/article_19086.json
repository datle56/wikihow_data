If she asks for your advice or opinion on her smoking habit, use this as an opportunity to open conversation. Offer non-judgmental, open-ended questions to help her think through the issue. But remember, all you can do is help her reflect; you can't convince her to want to quit. [1] X Research source She may open up a discussion by asking for your opinion: \"I spend so much money a month on cigarettes. I wonder if I should find a way to cut back. What do you think?” When she does, you can help her to reflect: \"Yeah, I mean, it would save you a ton of money to quit. Do you think it would make you happier if you quit smoking?\" You may have to wait until she is ready to quit smoking.

      "content": "Understanding how her smoking affects you could inspire your girlfriend to quit. Gently let her know how her addiction affects you. The choice to quit will need to be hers, but that doesn't mean you can't express how much you'd love to see her quit smoking. Remind her that your motivations come from a place of love but be careful not to use guilt as a means of convincing her. Ask questions to help talk through her potential decision to quit. [5] X Research source \"You're really important to me and so is your health.\" \"I want to see you getting to be as happy as you possibly can be, and I don't think that'll happen as long as you're smoking.\" Just because a conversation happens, don't assume she'll quit right away. Stay positive, be patient, and don't give up on your girlfriend!"
