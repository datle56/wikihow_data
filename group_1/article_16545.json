      "content": "Read the tone of the texts to see if they're fun, playful, or coy. Most people won't obviously come out and text something like, \"I like you. Do you want to go out?\" You'll have to read between the lines and pay attention to the mood of their texts. Maybe they gently tease or joke with you, for instance. If they sound businesslike and professional, they're probably not trying to flirt with you. They might text, \"I'd love to visit Europe one day. Till then, I'll settle for Italian food. You don't know any good spots, do you?\" Jbara says one way to flirt via text is to give boring answers a fun and quirky makeover. If someone asks you, “How was your day?” He advises against giving one word answers like, “fine” or “good.” [2] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. “Instead of saying something like that, I'll usually say something like, ‘Oh, you know, the usual, just saved a group of kids from a fire and helped an old lady across the street. How about you?’” [3] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021."

      "content": "Messaging throughout the day means they're thinking about you. Scroll through your messages to see what times they texted you. If you see that they sent you a message in the morning, a few in the afternoon, some after dinner, and one before you went to bed, it might mean you're on their mind a lot! These don't have to be super flirty texts or serious conversations. Even just a quick text to check in shows that they care about what you're up to or how you're doing. The texts might also show that they're paying attention to you. For instance, you might get a message like, \"You slayed it at the game tonight. Maybe you could teach me a few tips?\" They may be into you if you can tell you're always on their mind. They might text you during the day to ask how a meeting or test went, for instance."

      "content": "They acknowledge their absence because they want you to know they care. If you and your crush are texting regularly throughout the day, and then there’s a sudden lull in their response, this can sometimes feel like they’re ignoring you. However, if your crush eventually texts back with an apology or an explanation for their lack of reply, this means they’re really considering your feelings. It’s likely that work or another obligation came up, and they’re not afraid to tell you about it. They don’t want you to think they’ve forgotten about you— and how could they? You’re awesome."

Why aren't you here?!\" or, \"Hey, I'm meeting up with some friends tonight at the coffee shop. Want to join?\" This might be tied to checking in on you.

      "content": "They recall small details about things you’ve mentioned. This indicates that your crush is not only a great listener, but that they actually care about what you have to say. For example, if you mention having a fear of dogs, your crush may store that in their memory bank so that they can warn or protect you in the event of an unwanted canine interaction. If you text them your favorite candy and they bring you some the next time you get together, they want to please and impress you. In many ways, memory is a form of flattery!"

Maybe the last thing you said to your crush was a statement agreeing with one of their opinions and you can’t figure out exactly how to pivot on to the next subject, so you take a pause. If your crush is proactive about continuing to talk to you, he might say something like, “So, what are you having for lunch today?” Or, “Seen any good shows lately?” They enjoy talking to you so they’ll find any excuse to keep those lines of communication open. Jbara notes that this kind of attentiveness is definitely a sign that they’re into you, although he warns not to enter needy territory.

If you have friends in common who can keep a secret, ask to read the person's texts to them. This gives you an idea of how they communicate. Are they flirty with others? Do they use lots of emojis? How often do they text? [18] X Research source For example, you might learn that the person doesn't actually text others very often and, when they do, it's fairly straightforward. This may mean that, if they're texting you a lot throughout the day and being really expressive, they're probably into you. Pay attention to when they're texting other people. If they're texting you late night because they can't sleep, it's probably because they want to build a connection with you."

Often, they fear judgement or ridicule, opting to keep their innermost thoughts, ideas, and feelings to themselves. But if your crush begins spilling their guts via text— even if it’s one little tidbit at a time—, that means they trust you. Maybe they’ve started sharing how difficult their relationship with their father is, or that they need a tutor for math, or that they’re afraid of heights. Whatever it is, try to embrace them and thank them for their vulnerability."

[19] X Research source Try sending a text like, \"Hey let's grab a drink this Thursday. 8pm?\" Keep in mind that if they like you but they can't meet up at that time, they might just suggest a time that works for them. If they don't suggest another time, you can totally wait a few days and try again."
