      "content": "Google the property address. A quick web search might yield relevant articles or other helpful info. Type in the full address of your property, including the city. For more precise results, stick part of your address in quotation marks so Google can find more exact matches (e.g., “300 Main Street”). [1] X Research source If anything really major happened at the property, it might show up in your search results. Try looking up the address in the search bar on different social media platforms to see if it matches up with any posts."

On the site, people can upload info about houses/addresses with violent or otherwise criminal pasts. This site isn’t completely exhaustive, but it might shed some valuable light on your property.

      "title": "Check newspaper archives and obituary sites.",
      "content": "Check newspaper archives and obituary sites. See if any old articles or obituaries mention the home’s address. Some obituaries and death notices go into a lot of detail about the deceased individual, including where they lived. Click here for a master list of great newspaper archive sites, or search an obituary site like Legacy to get started. Some sites might not let you search by an exact address. In that case, type in the city and state/region and narrow your research down from there. Tip: If you live in the US, search historical census records or public records to find out who lived at the property before you. Then, look up the previous owners’ names on an obituary site or newspaper archive to see what comes up."

      "title": "Ask your realtor for more info.",
      "content": "Ask your realtor for more info. Most realtors don’t have to mention property deaths, so it helps to ask. In the United States, only California requires realtors to mention any recent death on a property, while states like South Dakota and Alaska require realtors to mention any violent deaths on the property. Most states don’t require realtors to mention previous property deaths at all—but they aren’t allowed to lie or cover up the home’s history if you ask about it. [3] X Research source “Has anyone died on the property recently?” or “Are there any deaths associated with the property?” are good questions to ask. Keep in mind that realtors in states like North Dakota and Maine can only discuss previous deaths at the home if the current seller allows it."

      "title": "Speak with the homeowner directly.",
      "content": "Speak with the homeowner directly. The current homeowner might know about the house's history. If you have the chance to speak with the current property owner, feel free to ask more probing questions about the house and the people who lived there previously. If the person has lived there for a long time, they might know a little bit about the previous owners (and if they died on the property or not). “I’m so sorry if this is a strange question, but do you know if any of the previous owners died on the property?” “This house looks like it has a lot of history. Do you know anything about the previous owners?” “I heard that something strange happened at this house in the early 20th century. Do you know anything about that?” Depending on the circumstances of the house’s sale, you might not be able to speak with the owner directly."

      "title": "Chat with the neighbors.",
      "content": "Chat with the neighbors. Neighbors might be clued into the property’s history and previous owners. As you’re exploring the neighborhood, stop by the homes of the property’s next-door neighbors and see if they’re open to having a quick chat. Ask how long they’ve lived in the neighborhood, and if they know if anything violent or noteworthy happened at the property you’re interested in. “How long have you lived in the neighborhood? Has anything strange happened here in the past few years?” “What do you know about the property next door? I’m thinking about moving in and I just wanted to cover all my bases.” “Has anything criminal happened at the house next door? I don’t want to move into a property with any bad vibes or history.”"
