[1] X Research source Maintain your own schedule. If you're not sure how you feel about someone, you should not sacrifice a lot of your own time and needs for that person. While you're figuring out your feelings, keep up with your own hobbies and social obligations. If you have not yet settled into official relationship status, do not worry. You should not try to push for commitment when you're still unsure of how you feel, and there is no shame in being in a relationship gray area for a while. You should also take care of yourself. Eat right, exercise, and get adequate rest. Take care of yourself as you normally would."

You may both need to experience personal growth outside the relationship. Eventually, you may find you want to rekindle the romance. [5] X Research source If you decide to take a break, set clear boundaries. Make it clear to your partner how often you'll see each other during the break, if at all, and whether you'll be allowed to pursue other relationships and sex during the break. Decide if the break has a set end point, or if you'll leave things somewhat open. Be careful to assess your feelings before getting back together after a break. Be honest with yourself about how you feel. Do you honestly miss the person? Do you feel sad in their absence? Do you feel like you've grown as a person while they were away? If so, getting back together can be a good idea. However, if you feel freer and happier in your partner's absence, it may be a good idea to move on."

Allow your partner to share their feelings with you. Your partner may feel the same way, in which case the two of you will have to assess the relationship's future.

      "content": "Make a decision about the relationship eventually. After a while, you'll have to make a decision about where you stand. After weighing in a variety of factors, consider whether your feelings are genuine and, if so, whether you want to continue to pursue this relationship.

      "content": "Consider attraction. Attraction is key to most romantic relationships. If you're involved with someone romantically, you'll eventually become intimate physically. Spend some time considering the level of physical attraction you feel for this person. [8] X Research source Think about how you feel about the person in a physical sense. Do you feel attraction? Do you think it's mutual? If so, there may be potential for a romantic relationship here. Keep in mind mutual attraction should not be the deciding factor. Friends often feel mutual attraction towards one another that is sometimes similar to romantic attraction. For example, you may long for and miss a friend when they are gone. Try to evaluate whether the attraction you feel for this person is physical as well as romantic. Do you find yourself laughing and smiling with this person? Do you look forward to dates and get-togethers? Do the two of you have similar interests and passions that you pursue together? If so, this could be a good foundation for a romance. If you're having mixed feelings, however, evaluate whether the fun you have together feels romantic. Friends often make each other laugh and have fun together. If you don't feel a romantic spark during fun times, this relationship may be better suited for friendship."

Do you and this person have similar ambitions? Do you see a similar kind of future in regards to things like marriage and children? These things are important when it comes to navigating a romantic relationship. If your views differ in these areas, this may be why you're having mixed feelings.

Other times, you find yourself annoyed that he's so unpredictable. Try to accept that there will be a degree of mixed feelings in any relationship. If you still want to be with someone, despite mixed feelings, this is actually a good sign. You're willing to acknowledge imperfections and frustrations, but still want to be with another person."
