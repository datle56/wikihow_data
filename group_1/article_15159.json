      "content": "Determine what color you want to dye your hair. After you have bleached your hair, you need to decide which color you want to have. The cuticle layers of your hair strands have been disrupted in the bleaching process, which allows hydrogen peroxide (a key ingredient in hair bleach) to penetrate the hair strand and strip out color. Depending on your hair's natural color and how long you left in the bleach, your hair now might be yellow, white or reddish. Your hair is now ready to take on color, and will often take color much more quickly and deeply than if you hadn't bleached your hair. You might choose to dye your hair a natural color, such as shades of brown, black, red or blond. You might also choose a color like cherry red, blue, purple, pink, and so on. For more natural color effects, stay within 1-3 shades within your own natural color. Consider the base color of your hair after bleaching and the base color of the dye you are going to use. These might conflict and give you the wrong color. If your bleached hair is yellowish, and your dye has a blue base color, you might end up with greenish hair. Using a dye with a violet base color, however, will offset the yellow in your hair, giving you better results. Use a hair color wheel to select the right shade. [1] X Research source To figure out your dye's base color, check the dye manufacturer's website for a \"palette list\" or similar, which categorizes colors into warm, neutral and cool shades. You can also buy different components of a hair dye kit at a beauty supply store. These products will indicate their base color on their package (i.e., blue, blue-violet, violet, violet-red, red, etc.). [2] X Research source Paying attention to the color palette of hair dye will help reduce the risk of ending up with the wrong color in your hair. Look at your hair in childhood photos. This will help you determine how your hair will react to certain colors. If your hair was a warmer color (honey blonde or similar), your hair will likely react with a warmer color now. Similarly, if your hair was a cooler color (ash blonde, brunette), your hair will likely have cooler undertones when you dye it now. [3] X Research source Be sure to consider your work environment when choosing a color; many workplaces consider bright, unnatural hair color to be unprofessional. If you want to dye your hair a dark brown or black you may need to use a filler color to prevent your hair from becoming muddy or green."

      "title": "Determine how long you want your color to last.",
      "content": "Determine how long you want your color to last. There are numerous types of store-bought dyes available, including permanent, semi-permanent, and color rinses. Each of these lasts a different length of time in your hair. These can be purchased at beauty supply stores, drug stores, grocery stores, and box stores like Target or Walmart. Permanent dyes are long-lasting and can produce very natural-looking colors. They can also produce very strong or dramatic colors. Because they are very strong, however, they can damage your hair, since they need to be left on your hair for a longer period of time when dyeing. Demi-permanent dyes are a step down from permanent and typically last about 20-25 washes. These can dye your hair 1-2 shades darker and also can add striking highlights. Even shorter lasting temporary hair-color dyes are also available. Semi-permanent dyes are temporary, are more natural-looking, and typically last about 10 shampoos. They do not need to be pre-mixed and can instead be used straight out of the box. These dyes fade progressively, particularly with exposure to air and shampooing. They typically do not contain ammonia or peroxide and are therefore better to use on fragile or already-damaged hair. Temporary color dyes are useful for touch-ups and experimentation with different hair colors. These include rinses, mousses, sprays, chalks and hair color crayons. They typically coat the hair, rather than color the core of the hair strand. As a result, these types of dyes rinse out within 1-3 washes. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source You may experience an unwanted color in your hair after the temporary dye fades. For example, if you bleach your hair and use a temporary blue dye, you might get green hair after the blue fades."

      "title": "Pre-condition your hair with a deep conditioner.",
      "content": "Pre-condition your hair with a deep conditioner. Used a day or two before dyeing your bleached hair, a deep conditioner will help build up moisture in your hair, which was likely damaged in the bleaching process. There is a wide variety of types of deep conditioners, from less expensive ($5-$8) to more expensive ($30+) store-bought ones to more natural, DIY ones. There are recipes to make your own deep conditioner, which typically use foods as their base. Search online for “deep conditioner recipes” for suggestions using bananas, avocados, mayonnaise, yogurt, eggs, coconut oil, or other foods. This step will help minimize ending up with extremely dry and brittle hair after you dye it by increasing your hair’s moisture and elasticity, the hair’s ability to return to its natural shape. Ideally, you would have pre-conditioned your hair before bleaching it, but if not, you should still use a deep conditioner on your hair before you dye it again."

      "title": "Use a protein filler.",
      "content": "Use a protein filler. The protein filler will help fill in gaps in your hair so that color will go on more evenly, and they also will help add color back into your hair. Protein filler can also be added to the hair dye. To add protein filler directly to your hair, put a small amount in the palm of your hand and spread throughout your hair. You don't need to rinse this out before applying the dye. Alternately, add the protein filler to your hair dye by adding a very small amount (if you add too much, it will make the hair dye too runny and therefore really messy). To help adjust the color of your hair, add protein filler. For example, if you want to dye your hair from bleached blonde to a warm brown color, you need to have all three primary colors (red, yellow, blue) going into your hair color. Your bleached blonde hair, for example, provides the yellow color. Use a red protein filler along with an ash-toned brown color, which has blue undertones. Together, these will result in the correct color. [6] X Research source"

But it is an important step that will save you a serious skin rash (or worse) if you happen to be allergic to any of the dye’s ingredients. To do a patch allergy test, apply a dab of dye on a patch of skin behind your ear. Leave the dye on for 24-48 hours and check for any allergic reaction, such as a rash, itching or burning on that spot. If you do have an allergic reaction, however mild, you should try a different brand. Be sure to test the new brand for any allergic reactions as well."

[9] X Research source If, after washing, the hair dye hasn't held, you can try to dye it again, but you will risk damaging it further.

Use a deep conditioner (store-bought or natural) at least once a week, leaving it in your hair for 20-30 minutes and then rinsing it out. Results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place. If you have made your own deep conditioner with food, check to make sure it hasn’t gone bad. If it’s been mixed up for longer than a few days (or a week if kept in the refrigerator), throw it away and mix up a new batch. Stick with color-save shampoos and conditioners since they'll help the dye last longer without bleeding."

Just focus on dyeing your roots, applying dye at the base of your scalp and combing it through the rest of your hair just before you’ve reached the time limit to have the dye in your hair.
