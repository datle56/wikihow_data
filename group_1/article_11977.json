Gout causes inflammation and redness around the affected joint. Inflammation then leads to swelling which makes the pain worse. [3] X Research source Aspirin and Ibuprofen are highly recommended anti-inflammatories that can offer relief by reducing the inflammation and blocking the pain. 500 mg of ibuprofen or paracetamol can be taken 3 to 4 times a day, but only after checking with your physician for any possible adverse reactions to these reactions in FSGS patients."

[4] X Expert Source Mohammad Dar, MD Board Certified Internist & Health Policy Director Expert Interview. Friday, September 3, 2021. This will reduce the load of the kidneys as well as reduce the pain caused by gout. The exact dosage will be decided by the physician as steroids need to be monitored closely. [5] X Research source Colchicine (Colcrys) is suggested by many doctors in order to reduce the initial attack of gout. Colchicine causes inhibition of mitosis (inhibition of microtubule) and neutrophil activity leading to an anti-inflammatory effect.

The most important way to reduce the risk of gout in patients suffering from focal segment glomerulosclerosis is through a proper diet. [7] X Research source Remember that most of the purine in the body comes from the food we eat. Limiting purine consumption limits the uric acid in the body which decreases the risk of gout. [8] X Expert Source Mohammad Dar, MD Board Certified Internist & Health Policy Director Expert Interview. Friday, September 3, 2021. Another factor to consider is that due to FSGS the uric in the body is not excreted. Since purine it not excreted, limiting high purine food is necessary to prevent the accumulation of uric acid in the body."

You are advised against consuming more than 32 g (8 tsp.) of sugar based or fructose based foods daily in order to reduce the risk of gout.

The traditional medications used for gout such as prednisone, allopurinol and colchicine are not usually used in kidney patients suffering from gout, as medications have negative side effects on the kidneys. These medications may worsen the disease and since the kidneys are the root cause of gout, the integrity of the kidneys must be maintained. Immunotherapy is the one of the best options for kidney patients suffering from gout."

This type of therapy consists of six steps: exact diagnosis, blocking the immune reaction, immune tolerance, immune adjustment, immune clearance and immune protection. [16] X Research source In exact diagnosis, doctors run series of tests for autoimmune kidney damage. This test will confirm the type, amount and depositions of the antibodies the patient has. Blocking immune reaction is done to block the damages. Before progressing to the other steps of immunotherapy, it is important to block the autoimmune reaction of the body to the kidneys. This is because the body attacks the kidneys during the disease process. To stop that the immune system must blocked and reset. This is what immunotherapy does."

With any kidney biopsy a patient must fast the day before, and then lie flat on a bed for 4 hours after the procedure. When the type of antibody and immune complex that attacks the kidneys is determined, immuno-suppresants are given to weaken these antibodies. This is when the blocking happens. The antibodies are weakened and this stops the damage to the kidneys."

Therefore, precautions must be taken to ensure that the patient will not contract any infection. Wearing a mask and avoiding contact with sick people are good precautionary measures."
