      "content": "Yes, leftover hummus can be frozen for up to 4 months. Freezing hummus comes in handy when you’ve made a large batch of hummus or opened a package of hummus and can’t eat it before it expires. The texture and taste may change a bit when you freeze hummus, but it’s still perfectly good to thaw and eat. [1] X Research source Consume frozen hummus within a week of thawing. The longer hummus is left in the freezer, the more pronounced flavor and consistency changes will be."

      "title": "Spoon the hummus into an airtight container.",
      "content": "Spoon the hummus into an airtight container. Whether your hummus is homemade or from the store, you’ll need to freeze it in an airtight container . [2] X Research source Use a spoon or a spatula to scrape all of the hummus from the bowl or package that it’s in. Press the hummus down into the container’s corners to get the most out of the space. Avoid using Ziploc bags or glass containers when freezing your hummus, as a bag could freeze the hummus unevenly, and the glass may crack while thawing. Leave 1 in (2.5 cm) or so of space between the lid and hummus. This will allow the hummus to expand while it freezes. Freeze the hummus in small batches using smaller containers, so you can easily thaw a specific amount."

      "content": "Drizzle olive oil over the top of the hummus. A thin coating of olive oil over the top of your hummus will help retain moisture and not dry out during freezing. Pour the olive oil straight from the bottle or use a spoon to cover the top in a thin layer. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Label and date the hummus containers.",
      "content": "Label and date the hummus containers. Use a permanent marker or stick-on label to write the date you placed it in the freezer, including the month and year. This will help you track how long the hummus has been in the freezer."

      "title": "Consume the hummus within 4 to 6 months.",
      "content": "Consume the hummus within 4 to 6 months. Leaving the hummus in the freezer for longer than 4 months could cause it to become freezer-burnt, which will alter the taste and texture. Although you can safely consume frozen hummus within 6 months of freezing, it may not be as enjoyable as thawing and eating within 4 months. [4] X Research source If you still have too much hummus on your hands after freezing, ask friends and family if they’d like any—there’s no harm in sharing a delicious dip!"

      "title": "Frozen hummus takes between 24 and 48 hours to thaw in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Frozen hummus takes between 24 and 48 hours to thaw in the refrigerator. When it comes time to use your frozen hummus, place the container in the fridge for at least a day. This will let the hummus thaw slowly, helping it defrost evenly, so it regains its soft texture. [5] X Research source Stir thawed hummus with a spoon before serving to ensure everything is nicely thawed and the oils are combined. [6] X Research source Expect a slight change in taste and texture when you eat thawed hummus. The water inside the hummus expands and shrinks during the freezing and defrosting process, altering the flavor and consistency. Do not thaw hummus at room temperature, or it might spoil."
