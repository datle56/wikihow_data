Is one bigger than the other? [1] X Research source The swelling may be slight and you may only notice it when putting on clothing like pants, workout gear, or high boots.

Keep a log of when you notice different sensations in your leg. For instance, write down if the cramping starts during or after exercise or suddenly happens when you’re resting on the couch. This way, your doctor can rule out any other possible medical conditions or injuries. [2] X Research source Pain typically occurs when walking or standing but could happen at any moment without cause, so it’s important to document when it happens.

Does one side feel warmer than the other? Then, place your hands on your other leg. Is there a significant difference between the two? If so, you may have a blood clot. [4] X Research source Be aware that the increased warmth may only be in the swollen or painful area of the leg. Feel your entire leg to easily detect a section that is warm versus one without a temperature difference. [5] X Research source"

The most common diagnostic tests for DVT are: [12] X Research source Ultrasound: This is the most common test for DVT and involves taking pictures of the leg veins and arteries. D-dimer test: This blood test measures a substance in your blood released when a clot breaks up. High levels can indicate a deep vein blood clot. Spiral CT of chest or ventilation/perfusion (VQ): These scans are used to rule out a pulmonary embolism. Venography: This test is similar to an ultrasound but gives a doctor a clearer image of the arteries and shows the blood flow direction. The procedure requires injecting a dye and x-raying the vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT): These scans take pictures of the organs and are generally used to diagnose PE."

If your doctor diagnoses you with DVT, they may give you an anticoagulant or blood thinning medication to prevent future complications. These medications can be taken in the form of a pill, injection, or IV, depending on the severity of your condition. [15] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking the medication, as taking too much or too little could have serious side effects.

Common blood thinners include Heparin, Warfarin, Enoxaparin (Lovenox), Dalteparin (Fragmin), and Fondaparinux (Arixtra). Know that foods rich in vitamin K, like spinach, kale, and Brussels sprouts, can interfere with blood thinning medication. Patients with acute DVT often require hospitalization for anticoagulation therapy to treat and minimize the size of the blood clot."
