      "content": "Break a sweat. Your body sheds both water and salt when you sweat. Because of this, strenuous exercise, or other activities that bring on a good sweat, are good ways to get excess sodium out of your system. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try a high intensity workout, like circuit training, to help you get in shape and shed extra sodium. Alternatively, you can try more low-impact exercises that can get you sweating, like hot yoga.

Allowing yourself to get dehydrated while you exercise can actually cause your body to retain salt, potentially leading to a serious health condition called hypernatremia. [6] X Research source Always drink water while exercising, especially if you are hot or working up a sweat. How much water you should drink during exercise depends on your body’s individual needs and how intense and long-lasting your workout is. During light or every-day exercise, like a half-hour workout at the gym, an extra 1.5-2.5 cups (400-600 ml) of water is probably enough.

Pre-packaged meats, such as luncheon meats, bacon, or sausage, are often loaded with additional salt. Look for products that are labeled “low sodium.” Check pre-packaged food labels carefully for sodium content. Cut salt out of recipes, when you can. Try spicing up your food with other seasonings, like salt-free pepper or garlic powder, instead."

Many health fads, like the juice cleanse or the salt water flush, claim to detoxify the body, flush out impurities, and help reduce problems like bloat and water retention. However, there is little or no evidence to show that these types of fad diets or cleanses are effective. They can also seriously disrupt your body’s sodium levels, sometimes with dangerous results.

If you are forcing yourself to guzzle excessive amounts of water while exercising or simply as a way to flush out your system, you could put yourself at risk of developing hyponatremia, or a deficiency of salt in the blood. Hyponatremia can lead to fatal swelling of the brain. [19] X Research source It can be hard to judge how much water is too much, especially when you are doing an intense workout or endurance exercise. Your best bet is to listen to your body: drink when you feel thirsty, and stop when your thirst is quenched."
