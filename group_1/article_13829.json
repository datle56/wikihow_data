      "content": "Start in first position and bend with your knees. The first position consists of standing with your heels together and feet pointed out in each direction. Start by bending your knees just slightly, keeping your upper body straight with your shoulders down. Don’t stick your backside out or adjust your hips—simply lower at the knees while keeping the rest of your body straight. Johns shares, “You want to have your knees in alignment, dropping over your first two toes. Keep your stomach lifted and think of your waist as a bucket of water. You want everything just to go down perfectly straight.” [1] X Expert Source Geraldine Grace Johns Professional Ballerina & Ballet Instructor Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. She adds, “You have to use your core muscles, your turnout muscles, and to keep a long back. Think of just going down very evenly and carefully, keeping your back straight.” [2] X Expert Source Geraldine Grace Johns Professional Ballerina & Ballet Instructor Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. Turnout muscles refer to the external rotation necessary to do a plié. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Start in first position and bend your knees as you lift your heels.",
      "content": "Start in first position and bend your knees as you lift your heels. Since you are bending further down at the knees in a grand-plié, your heels will naturally come off the ground. Even though the weight shifts to the forward parts of your feet entirely, your upper body should be perfectly straight, meaning your center of gravity should still feel as though you are standing with your legs straight."

      "content": "Rise back to first position. Engage your quads and glutes to push your body back upwards into your starting position. When rising, use your feet and legs rather than simply the knees to straighten. Push down with your raised heels to reconnect them with the floor as soon as possible in the rising motion.

      "content": "A plié is a bent-knee ballet exercise usually done at the barre. It’s one of the first moves that you’ll learn, but you’ll have time to perfect it as you advance your technique. You can do a plié from all 5 ballet positions : first position, second position, third position, fourth position, and fifth position. [7] X Research source A plié is one of the 7 basic dance movements in the Cecchetti method. “Plié” is pronounced “plee-AY.”"

      "content": "Pliés are the building blocks of ballet. Pliés are essential in conditioning the necessary muscles required to perform many other aspects of technique, including leaps, pirouettes, and landing after a lift. Proper plié form is key, as improper form can lead to restriction of movement and potential injury. They’re used in jumps and turns to absorb shock and prevent injuries in the knees."

      "content": "A demi-plié is a bend in the knees with your heels on the ground. You won’t bend down as far in a demi-plié, and you might need to work a little more on your balance and control. This is usually the first type of plié that you’ll learn."

      "content": "Your leg muscles and glutes control your downward and upward motion. As you bend down, engage your glutes, quads, and hamstrings to slow your movement. When you rise, engage your glutes, quads, and hamstrings again to push yourself up slowly without jerking your body around."

      "content": "Do calf stretches for a deeper plié. Place your hands on a wall or the barre and stick one foot out about 12 in (30 cm) behind you. Bend your front knee and push your back heel down onto the floor until you feel a stretch in your calf, then hold it for about 30 seconds. Repeat this on the other leg. [10] X Research source Johns notes the importance of a good warm-up, advising, “If I was just doing a warm-up, I would do demi-pliés to the ground plié. Warming up your hip is also really important.” [11] X Expert Source Geraldine Grace Johns Professional Ballerina & Ballet Instructor Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. For warming up the hips, she suggests doing a “hip swing,” by “standing on one foot and just swinging the other leg forward and back.” [12] X Expert Source Geraldine Grace Johns Professional Ballerina & Ballet Instructor Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. Another hip stretch begins by lying on your back on the floor. You can either rotate your hips from side to side or “lift your knees up” one at a time, Johns adds.

To warm up your feet, she instructs, “Do little prances with your feet as if you're a horse. Do circles with your feet and pliés, relevés, and then do a few little jumps.” She reminds that blood flow to the heart and muscles is essential to avoid injury: “You need to get your heart rate up [...] The first thing we do [in class] is form a circle, and walk. From a walk, we go to a jog, and from a jog, we go fast, and then [the students] change direction.” [14] X Expert Source Geraldine Grace Johns Professional Ballerina & Ballet Instructor Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. Johns explains, “If you're going into a class cold, you're going to have an injury. If your body is warm, and your heart is pumping, then you're going to be fine.” [15] X Expert Source Geraldine Grace Johns Professional Ballerina & Ballet Instructor Expert Interview. 11 November 2020."

Sit down on the ground and pull your heels in toward yourself, letting your knees splay outward to create a diamond shape with your legs. Rest your elbows on your knees and slowly lean forward until you feel a stretch in your inner thighs. Hold the position for 30 seconds to 1 minute at a time."

      "title": "Fourth position",
      "content": "Fourth position Fourth position is often used to help dancers improve their balance. This position involves standing in third position, except that each foot pointing in an opposite direction should be perfectly aligned with the other, and there should be about 12 inches (30.4 cm) of space between the two turned-out feet."

      "title": "Fifth position",
      "content": "Fifth position Fifth position is typically achieved by more seasoned dancers as it requires the greatest level of balance and skill. This position is similar to fourth position, with the hips equally rotated outwards. The heel of the front foot should lean against the big toe of the back foot, perfectly balancing the dancer’s weight. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Doing a plié is an important and foundational dance move in ballet. Doing a plié may be considered basic, but it requires conditioning, stamina, and control over several muscles, like your hips and core. Don’t attempt a plié unless you’ve done warm-up exercises, as this could result in injury. Remember: in a successful plié position, your feet are arched and pointed outward in opposite directions— nailing this requires stretching beforehand! [19] X Research source In every position, divide your weight between both feet evenly so you don't topple over in the plié. Turn out from your legs at the hip joints. Don't force your knees and ankles to bend at uncomfortable angles because it will lead to injury."
