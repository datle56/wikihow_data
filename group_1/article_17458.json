      "content": "Understand the process. Windows Vista introduced new graphics drivers that enable effects such as the Aero desktop and better hardware acceleration. One of the downsides of these new drivers is that full-screen is no longer supported for console (Command Prompt) applications. This means that you can no longer make the Command Prompt full-screen in Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 8.1. You can use the following workaround to make the window take up the whole screen, but it won't be true full-screen. Windows 10 allows you switch the Command Prompt to full-screen by pressing Alt + ↵ Enter . You can disable your video card drivers, but you'll lose the Aero theme in Windows and your screen resolution will max out at 800 x 600. See the next section for details. If you run a lot of DOS programs and want to use them in full-screen mode, you may want to try the DOSBox emulator. This program emulates the DOS environment and allows you to run programs full-screen. See the last section for details."

Because of this new driver, Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1 do not support full-screen command prompt. If you absolutely need the Command Prompt to be full-screen, you can disable this new driver. This will limit your image options and restrict your display to 800 x 600, but it will allow you to use the Command Prompt in full-screen. If you need to return to your normal display, you just need to re-enable the drivers."
