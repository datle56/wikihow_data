Some free VPNs include the following: [3] X Research source Hotspot Shield includes both a free and a paid premium subscription. It's easy to use and has a data allowance of 500 MB per day.

Proton VPN has a free option that includes unlimited data per month, but only allows you to connect one device. You can sign up only using an email address and it doesn’t log the websites you visit.
