      "content": "Inspect your current wardrobe. Lay your favorite clothes on your bed or on a table. Choose pieces that you like or wear often. Look at all the possible combinations of clothing, and see if you tend towards a particular style (such as bohemian, rock chick, vintage, geek chic, etc.). Note which pieces are your favorite, and ask yourself why. Once you determine this, you can start looking for pieces that have similar features. For each individual article of clothing, you should note the: Fit: How does the piece adhere to your body? Is it tight in certain places or baggy? Does it flare at the hips, or is it a straight piece? Texture: Does the material lie flat, or is there a 3D effect? Are there ruffles, ruching, or pleats? Are there sequins, rhinestones, or other embellishments? Color: Is it a neutral, such as black, navy, khaki, or white? Is it a jewel tone, such as teal, emerald green, or gold? Or is it a pastel, such as mint, light pink, or lavender? Print: Is it patterned or solid? Are the stripes vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or a mix? Is there a flower or animal print? Are there blocks of color?"
