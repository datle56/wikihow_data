      "title": "Dating is when a romantic couple spends time getting to know each other.",
      "content": "Dating is when a romantic couple spends time getting to know each other. This typically happens at the beginning of the relationship and is a step above just talking or hanging out. The goal is usually for the two people to get to know each other so they can determine if they're compatible enough to have a real relationship. But other times, they just want to have fun (and sometimes be physically intimate) without being forced to make any real commitments. Dating doesn't have to include a sexual relationship, but it does for a lot of modern-day couples. It's a good idea to discuss sex early on in dating, so each person can set boundaries for what they're comfortable with doing."

      "title": "Casual dating",
      "content": "Casual dating Casual dating is all about having fun. A couple who is casually dating enjoys spending time together and might have a sexual relationship, but it usually doesn't go any deeper than that. They don't have serious expectations of each other, like living together or getting married. Some people who casually date also have more than one such relationship, although they can also decide to be exclusive. [1] X Research source This is also known as no-strings-attached or NSA dating , meaning the couple avoids the emotional ties and expectations of exclusivity that typically come with traditional romantic relationships."

    {
      "title": "Exclusive dating",
      "content": "Exclusive dating Exclusive dating involves a bit more commitment. A couple who dates exclusively have decided not to pursue other romantic relationships and is faithful to their partner. Exclusive relationships may progress to long-term commitments, or can fizzle out if one or both partners decides they're not compatible. In that case, they usually stop dating each other and may begin to see other people."

      "title": "Intentional dating",
      "content": "Intentional dating People who date with intention are careful and deliberate with their choice of partner. They're usually motivated by a desire for exclusive commitment and a long-lasting relationship. So, instead of dating just for fun and sex, they’re also interested in figuring out if they're compatible, share the same values, and have similar goals for the future. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ethical non-monogamous (ENM) dating",
      "content": "Ethical non-monogamous (ENM) dating In ENM relationships, the people involved agree to have more than one romantic or physical relationship at the same time. Instead of being exclusive, or monogamous, one or more partners in the relationship may have additional partners outside the relationship, with the consent of their partner(s). This relationship structure is called \"ethical\" because everyone in it communicates openly and honestly with each other. [3] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source One popular type of ENM dating is open dating, where the partners go outside their relationship to have sex with other people. They do this with the other partner's full approval. Another is polygamy, in which there are more than two partners in a relationship."

    {
      "title": "Hanging out",
      "content": "Hanging out \"Hanging out\" is different from dating because the partners haven’t committed to an exclusive romantic relationship. They go places and do activities together on occasion, but the vibe is much more casual and low-key. They might even go with a group sometimes and not just with each other. The bottom line is that they haven’t committed to a romantic relationship. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Just talking",
      "content": "Just talking When two people are \"just talking,\" it means that they’re getting to know each other. They may be thinking about dating but haven't decided if they want to take the plunge. It could also refer to a more NSA-style relationship in which there's no commitment, only hanging out (and possibly hooking up). [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Friends with benefits",
      "content": "Friends with benefits Friends with benefits (FWB) is a type of relationship where a couple is together purely for sexual reasons. Outside of having sex, they're just friends, and they don't refer to themselves as dating or in a relationship. They may not even talk at all until they decide to meet up for some physical intimacy. Some couples may begin a FWB relationship but still be open to graduating to a real romantic partnership at some point in the future. But, their immediate goal is to keep it physical with no emotional attachments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hooking up",
      "content": "Hooking up Hookups are similar to FWB relationships, except they're even more casual. When people say they want to \"hook up,\" they’re purely interested in a physical relationship. They're not looking to get to know the other person, date them, or start a relationship. [6] X Research source And that's okay, as long as both people are consenting and comfortable with the arrangement. The frequency of hooking up can vary. Some people hook up regularly whereas others only do it once with a single partner."

      "title": "Situationship",
      "content": "Situationship In a situationship , two people are physically intimate without committing to each other. The kicker, though, is that one person usually has feelings for the other and hopes that they can become something more in the future. The \"something more\" often never materializes, either because the other person isn't interested or neither party clearly communicates with the other. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "In a relationship",
      "content": "In a relationship When two people are \"in a relationship,\" they’re committed to one another in some way. It’s a step beyond dating, and typically, they’ve agreed that they’re compatible enough and like each other enough to forge an emotional (and probably physical) connection that they don't share with anyone else..
