If your hand ranks higher, than the dealer pays out for your bets.

Your Super Bonus bet still pays if you have a straight or better in your hand. If the dealer doesn’t have at least a King high card in their hand, then their hand does not qualify. You get your Ante wager back, but your Play and Super Bonus bets still pay out.
