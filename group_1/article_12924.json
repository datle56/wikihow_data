  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "\"In closing\"",
      "content": "\"In closing\" This phrase is a great alternative for both written essays and verbal presentations. It has the same meaning and level of formality as “in conclusion,” but it’s slightly less common. You can use this phrase before providing a short review of your argument, or before a “call to action\" (the part of a conclusion where you tell your audience what they should do next). [1] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Here are some examples: “In closing, Mary Shelley's work was groundbreaking, and she should be considered the mother of the Science Fiction genre.” “In closing, we should do everything we can to address the problem of bullying in schools, so I urge you to sign this petition.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"In summary\"",
      "content": "\"In summary\" “In summary” is an extremely similar phrase to “in conclusion,” so you can easily substitute it in any paper or presentation. The phrase works best if you’re planning to go over your ideas and synthesize your main points one more time, to really drive them home for the reader or listener. For example: “In summary, Gutenberg’s printing press led to an increase in literacy and access to information, which makes it one of the most important inventions in human history.” “In summary, rabies is deadly but the vaccine is almost 100% effective, so it’s imperative to vaccinate your pets to prevent the spread of the disease.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"To review\"",
      "content": "\"To review\" “To review” is basically interchangeable with the phrase “in summary.” It signals that you’re coming to the end of your paper or speech, and that you’re about to go over the important points one final time. It’s also pretty formal, so it's appropriate to use in academic essays and presentations. “To review, the success of Stephanie Meyer’s Twilight heralded a boom in vampire literature and media that continues to this day.” “To review, eating a vegetarian or vegan diet has positive effects on both your health and the environment.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"As has been demonstrated\"",
      "content": "\"As has been demonstrated\" If you’re looking for something a bit more flowery, the phrase “as has been demonstrated” (and other variations of it) may be the right choice. It’s a particularly formal phrase, so it’s a good option if you’re hoping to elevate your language. It's appropriate for verbal presentations, but it works especially well in written essays. Here are some examples: “As the research has demonstrated, the use of mobile devices before bedtime can disrupt sleep due to the emission of blue light.” “As has been demonstrated in the book’s reviews, Wuthering Heights was not well-received in its time, though it’s considered a masterpiece by many literary scholars today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"As a final observation\"",
      "content": "\"As a final observation\" “As a final observation” is a great phrase to use if you’re hoping to present one last idea before closing out a formal essay or presentation. It signals that you’re going to leave the reader or listener with a final thought-provoking insight, rather than listing out things you’ve already covered. For example: “As a final observation, the negative perceptions about romance novels may have more to do with the way society views women, as opposed to the merit of the books themselves.” “As a final observation, the benefits of drinking coffee could be more profound than expected, and more research should be done on the subject.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"On a final note\"",
      "content": "\"On a final note\" This phrase also lets your reader know that you’ll be offering one more point in your argument, just like “as a final observation.” It’s formal enough to use in an academic essay or important presentation, but it’s not too stuffy or flowery. This makes it a great option if you want to maintain an elevated and polished tone without being over-the-top. Here are some examples: “On a final note, the explosion of the popularity of superhero movies has interesting implications for the things we value as a society.” “On a final note, the study suggests that there are some important unanswered questions that researchers will need to tackle in the future.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Finally\"",
      "content": "\"Finally\" “Finally” is a concise and effective alternative to “in conclusion.” It’s a great choice if you want to keep things simple, but maintain a formal and elevated tone in your essay or speech. Like “as a final observation,” it works best when you’re offering one more idea or insight in your conclusion, rather than reviewing the ideas you’ve already covered. “Finally, it’s important to mention that exercise has a profound effect on mental health, as well as physical health.” “Finally, it’s imperative to discuss the cultural and societal context that Dickens was writing in when he published David Copperfield. ”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Lastly\"",
      "content": "\"Lastly\" “Lastly” works in the same way as “finally,” as it allows you to bring up one last thought-provoking observation before closing out your paper or presentation. It has a slightly less formal connotation, so it’s a great choice if you’re trying to loosen up your language a bit without making things too casual. For example: “Lastly, it’s important to mention the author’s relationship with her family, since it mirrors her main character’s familial situation.” “Lastly, I’d like to briefly touch on how these policy changes will affect productivity for individual employees.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Ultimately\"",
      "content": "\"Ultimately\" “Ultimately” is another concise option that works well in writing and speeches, and it's appropriate in both formal and informal contexts. It’s a good choice if you’re using your conclusion to synthesize your thoughts and drive your main idea home one last time. Here are some examples: “Ultimately, Romanticism was an artistic and intellectual movement that emerged as a response to The Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution.” “Ultimately, the research shows that there are several health benefits to eating more fiber, including lower cholesterol and better gut health.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Overall\"",
      "content": "\"Overall\" “Overall” is another great choice to sum up all your thoughts. Since it’s slightly less formal, it’s appropriate for papers and speeches that have a more casual tone. Like “ultimately,” it works best when you want to restate your big points or main idea one more time, so it’s fresh in your reader or listener’s mind. “Overall, the studies show that social media breaks can be beneficial for your mental health, so it’s a good idea to try one if you’re dealing with anxiety.” “Overall, the novel is about the dangers of judging other people based on their appearance and the importance of thinking for yourself.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"In short\"",
      "content": "\"In short\" “In short” is a great transitional phrase to use if you want to condense all the ideas you’ve covered into a final statement, so it’s easier for your reader or listener to digest. It tends to work best in informal writing or speeches. Here are some examples: “In short, the new training program will help new employees feel prepared and empowered to succeed in their roles.” “In short, Charlotte Brontë was one of the most important writers of the 19th century, and her works still captivate readers today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"In a nutshell\"",
      "content": "\"In a nutshell\" This casual phrase is perfect for informal writing and casual presentations. It lets your reader or listener know that you’re going to sum up your ideas one final time to really drive them home. Because of this, it works best when you want to restate your main points, rather than introduce new ones. “In a nutshell, artists like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter suggest that pop music is heading in an exciting new direction.” “In a nutshell, the The Wizard of Oz was an incredibly successful movie in its time, and it continues to delight audiences today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Long story short\"",
      "content": "\"Long story short\" “Long story short” is a pretty casual phrase, so it’s most appropriate for very informal presentations or writing. Just like “in a nutshell,” it signals that you’ll be repeating your big points or main idea one last time, so they're fresh in your audience's minds. For example: “Long story short, the popularity of recent movie musicals shows that the genre is not dead.” “Long story short, we need to make some changes to our process to support our employees.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"At the end of the day\"",
      "content": "\"At the end of the day\" “At the end of the day” is another casual phrase you can use in informal settings. Although it can be used in writing, it tends to work best in verbal speeches or presentations. It basically means, “the main idea is…” or “the point I’m making is….” Here are some examples: “At the end of the day, we need to dedicate more resources to cleaning up our beaches.” “At the end of the day, our mental and physical health is the most important thing.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"All in all\"",
      "content": "\"All in all\" “All in all” essentially means “overall” or “everything considered.” It’s a pretty informal phrase, so it’s more appropriate for casual writing or presentations. It lets your audience know that you’re going to sum up your main idea one more time, in light of all the points you’ve made. “All in all, it seems like our team is prepared to have an excellent year.” “All in all, the reports show that the problem has been taken care of.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Last but not least\"",
      "content": "\"Last but not least\" “Last but not least” is another informal phrase that works best for verbal speeches or presentations, rather than essays or papers. This phrase signals that you’ll be offering one more point before wrapping things up. For example: “Last but not least, I’d like to touch on the importance of reaching out to your supervisor for help if you have any questions.” “Last but not least, I’d like to discuss the exciting new projects we’re planning to start this year.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask a rhetorical question.",
      "content": "Ask a rhetorical question. If you don’t want to use a typical transitional phrase, consider asking a rhetorical question at the start of your conclusion. This type of question isn’t meant to actually get an answer from your reader or listener; instead, it creates a dramatic effect and gets them thinking about the final idea you’re going to cover. Here are some examples: “Is there more to the novel than meets the eye? The symbolism and the author’s later comments definitely seem to suggest this.” “So is it truly possible to prolong your life through healthy diets and frequent exercise? Not definitively, but the research suggests it certainly can’t hurt.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Try these other synonyms and transitions to flag your conclusion.",
      "content": "Try these other synonyms and transitions to flag your conclusion. Luckily, there are several different transition words and phrases you can use at the start of your conclusion, including: Single word synonyms: Overall, chiefly, essentially, briefly, considering, therefore, thus, primarily, indeed, altogether, principally More transition phrases: The bottom line is, to wrap things up, in the end, all things considered, on the whole, most importantly, in brief, to summarize, in the final analysis, to bring things to a close, as you can see, for the most part, for these reasons, generally speaking"

      "title": "Some people consider “in conclusion” to be an overused phrase.",
      "content": "Some people consider “in conclusion” to be an overused phrase. Because “in conclusion” is a go-to phrase for many writers and presenters, it’s now considered a bit of a cliché, and it may fail to impress your reader or listener. [2] X Research source As a result, many believe it’s best to go with an alternative phrase (such as the ones listed above), to keep your language fresh and unique. However, when it comes to the stylistic side of writing, there are always exceptions to the rule. Some also believe that using \"in conclusion\" in written work is unnecessary since the reader can see you're nearing the end of your work. There are definitely situations where the phrase “in conclusion” would work well, so don’t worry if you’ve already used it!"

      "title": "A good conclusion can make or break your paper or presentation.",
      "content": "A good conclusion can make or break your paper or presentation. Your conclusion is your last chance to summarize your main points and really drive them home, so they stay fresh in your reader or listener’s minds. It’s also an opportunity to explain why your argument matters, call your audience to action, and leave a lasting impression on them. In other words, a good conclusion can make your essay or speech even more effective as a whole, so it’s essential to write yours with care.

      "title": "There are a few essential components to any good conclusion.",
      "content": "There are a few essential components to any good conclusion. Here’s a breakdown of them, so you end your paper or presentation in an effective and engaging way: Restate your argument. Drive home the main point you're making in your essay or speech by repeating it one more time for your reader: “Ultimately, cutting down on red meat consumption is good for both your body and the environment.” Synthesize your main points. Reiterate the points you've made to support your main argument to remind your reader why you're right: “As we've seen, diets with less red meat are linked to lower cholesterol and less risk of heart disease, and they also reduce your carbon footprint.” Explain why this topic is important. This is also called the “so what” of your conclusion. Essentially, it explains why your argument matters and why the reader should care about the points you’re making: “With issues like global warming and obesity plaguing Americans today, any actions we can take to promote health and protect the environment are essential.” Include a “call to action.” Tell your audience what they should do next, ask them to take a stand on your argument, or point out further areas of research that should follow: “In closing, I urge you to consider swapping out red meat for plant-based alternatives, whether that be permanently, or just for a weekly Meatless Monday.” [4] X Research source"
