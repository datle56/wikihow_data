      "title": "Read the notice you get from the company carefully.",
      "content": "Read the notice you get from the company carefully. If you're billed for damages to a car you rented, the car rental company will send you a notice that lists the amount you were charged. It may describe the damages, but often does not. [2] X Research source If it includes the dates the car was rented, double-check to make sure those dates match your records. You also want to check the make and model of the car to make sure it's the one you rented. If they've simply sent you the bill in error, that should be easy to resolve. Figure out whether you've already been charged for the damages or are expected to pay now. If you provided a credit card for a damage deposit, the amount may have been charged to your card — especially if you rented the car relatively recently."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather any photos or documentation you have.",
      "content": "Gather any photos or documentation you have. If you saved the paperwork from the car rental or took photos of the car before and after you used it, those will help you prove that you're not liable for the damages. Even if you don't have a lot of evidence to back up your dispute, you can still get information from the company by forcing them to prove that you owe for the damage. If you completed any inspection forms either before or after you rented the car, the rental car company will have those in its files. You can check the damage against those documents."
    },
    {
      "title": "See if the company has an online claim form.",
      "content": "See if the company has an online claim form. Many larger rental car companies have a form on their website that you can use to dispute a damage claim. These are typically the quickest and easiest way to register your dispute with the company. If the online form allows you to attach documents, get digital copies of any documents or photos you have and attach them to the form. If attachments aren't allowed, include a statement to the effect that you have documents or photos to support your dispute. The company may contact you and ask you to submit them another way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draft a written letter if you can't submit your dispute online.",
      "content": "Draft a written letter if you can't submit your dispute online. While you can also call the rental car company's customer service line to dispute a damage claim, follow up in writing. Include the dates you rented the car, the location, and the make and model of the car you rented. Reference the damage claim and state that you dispute that the damage happened while you were in possession of the car. Then, outline any proof you have that you returned the car undamaged. If you have photos or other documentation, attach them to your letter. Make a photocopy of everything for your records before you send it. Mail your dispute letter using certified mail with returned receipt requested so you'll know when the company receives your letter. When you get the green receipt card back, keep it with your copy of the letter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for proof that the damage occurred while you had the car.",
      "content": "Ask for proof that the damage occurred while you had the car. It's possible the damage occurred after you drove the car — particularly if the company didn't send the damage claim to you until several months after you turned in the car. Request the car's utilization log so you'll know how often the car was rented in the time between when you turned it in and when the company sent you the damage claim. [3] X Research source If the utilization log shows that several other people rented the car after you did, ask the rental company to prove that the damage didn't happen after you'd already turned the car in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow up with your dispute after 30 days.",
      "content": "Follow up with your dispute after 30 days. The company may not contact you to let you know the claim was dropped after your dispute. If you don't hear from them within 30 days of the date you submitted your dispute, contact the company to find out what has happened with the claim. [4] X Research source If the company drops the claim, ask them to send you written notification that the claim was dropped so you have it for your records."
    },
    {
      "title": "Notify the regulatory authorities where you rented the car.",
      "content": "Notify the regulatory authorities where you rented the car. If the rental car company persists with the damage claim and you believe the damage isn't your fault, there are government regulatory agencies that might go after the company for you. Typically, you'll look for a consumer rights agency or the insurance regulator in the place where you rented the car. For example, if you rented a car in the US, the state attorney general in the state where you rented the car would typically investigate rental car damage claims. In the UK, you can work with Citizens Advice Consumer Service. In the EU, contact the European Consumer Centre in the country where you rented the car."

    {
      "title": "Check your credit card statement.",
      "content": "Check your credit card statement. If the rental car company has already charged your credit card for damages to the rental car, find the transaction on your credit card statement. Copy down all the information associated with the transaction, including the name of the company that charged you as it appears on your statement, the date of the charge, and the amount charged. [5] X Research source You might also print a copy of your credit card statement and circle the transaction on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Contact your credit card company to dispute the charge.",
      "content": "Contact your credit card company to dispute the charge. Typically, you can use the customer service number on the back of your credit card to initiate a chargeback. You can also start the process through your online account. [6] X Research source If you initiate a chargeback over the phone, send a written letter as well, so you have the details in writing in case you need proof later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide copies of your documentation and photos to your credit card company.",
      "content": "Provide copies of your documentation and photos to your credit card company. For your chargeback to be successful, you have to be able to prove to your credit card company that you are not liable for the damages. Any documentation you send to your credit card company will be forwarded to the rental car company. Typically, your credit card company will place a temporary hold on the transaction. That means that you don't have to pay it back while the credit card company investigates the transaction, and you won't be charged interest on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Work with your credit card company to dispute the claim.",
      "content": "Work with your credit card company to dispute the claim. After you dispute the transaction, your credit card company will contact the rental car company and request evidence that you are liable for the damage. If the rental car company provides that evidence, your credit card company may get back to you and say that they're not going to complete the chargeback. If you are certain that you didn't cause the damage, don't give up the first time your credit card company tells you they won't complete the chargeback. However, keep in mind that if you don't have a lot of concrete evidence, such as photos and documentation of any damages on the vehicle before you rented it and after you turned it in, you're unlikely to be successful with the chargeback."

      "title": "Take photos of the car before you drive it off.",
      "content": "Take photos of the car before you drive it off. Get time-stamped photos of both the interior and exterior of the car. Make closeups of the bumpers and door panels, as these are places on the exterior most likely to get damaged. Inside the car, take photos of the floorboards and the dash, including all the knobs. [7] X Research source It's also a good idea to pop the hood and take a photo of the engine. While it's unlikely you could tell any damage simply by looking at a photo, it might still prove worthwhile. Take photos of the tires and have an employee check the air pressure in each of them."

    {
      "title": "Ask an employee to inspect the car and document any unrepaired damage.",
      "content": "Ask an employee to inspect the car and document any unrepaired damage. Most rental car companies have a specific form to use to report any damage to the car before you rent it. In addition to any visible damage, test the operation of the car and note anything that doesn't work. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Even if you're not planning on using them, check the air conditioning and heat to make sure they function properly. Turn on the radio and make sure any auxiliary connections or computer-assisted services are working. If they're not, make a note of them. Start the car and make note if it doesn't start immediately or if it sounds sluggish. Even if you don't know much about cars, you can tell if something feels or sounds \"off\" about the way the car runs."

    {
      "title": "Read all documents carefully before renting the car.",
      "content": "Read all documents carefully before renting the car. When you go to rent a car, you're likely in a hurry to get to your destination. Additionally, if you've been on a plane all day, you're probably pretty tired. However, don't let these factors cause you to rush through the paperwork of renting your car. If there's anything in the rental paperwork that you don't understand, ask an employee to explain it to you."

    {
      "title": "Buy the rental company's collision damage waiver coverage.",
      "content": "Buy the rental company's collision damage waiver coverage. While this coverage can be pretty expensive, it protects you from potential damage claims. If the car is damaged while you have it, the collision damage waiver will cover it. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Even if you have collision coverage on your personal insurance policy, it's still a good idea to get the collision damage waiver. That way, you don't have to deal with your insurance company if the rental car company sends you a damage claim."

    {
      "title": "Check the car over carefully and take photos before you turn it back in.",
      "content": "Check the car over carefully and take photos before you turn it back in. When you're ready to return the car, take photos of the same parts of the car that you took photos of before you took it off the lot. If you notice any minor scuffs or other damage, you may be able to clean them off before you return the car. If you've had the car for several days, it's also a good idea to take it through the car wash and clean out the interior before you turn it back in. The rental car company is less likely to hunt for damage if you return the car in pristine condition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Return the car during regular business hours.",
      "content": "Return the car during regular business hours. If you return the car after-hours, you're also responsible for any damage that occurs to the car between the time you drop it off and the time an employee inspects it the next day. While it may be fine, it's also possible that another customer or even an employee could accidentally damage the car during that time, and there's no reason for you to be responsible for that. [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source When you return the car, don't simply hand over the keys and leave. Wait until an employee has inspected the car and pronounced it clear. It's also a good idea to get this statement in writing. It might help you if the company later decides to send you a bill for damages."
