      "content": "Tipping for furniture delivery isn’t expected, but it’s much appreciated. About half of Americans tip for furniture delivery. Some choose not to because they think the delivery fee they paid goes directly to the drivers, but this isn’t usually the case. [2] X Research source Others choose not to because furniture delivery people make at least minimum wage, unlike servers who get paid a low hourly wage and depend on tips. [3] X Research source Furniture delivery is a physically demanding and highly helpful service, so a tip to show your gratitude for a job well done is highly appreciated! If a delivery is left outside, like an unassembled piece you ordered online, a tip isn’t expected (you can leave an envelope with a tip outside if you wish). Tips for a third-party deliverer, like a UPS or FedEx driver, are not usually expected (or in the case of FedEx, even allowed). [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Tip $5 to $10 per delivery person for most uncomplicated deliveries.",
      "content": "Tip $5 to $10 per delivery person for most uncomplicated deliveries. For example, if 2 workers carried an armchair into your home and there were no tight stairs or doorways to navigate, give them each a $5 bill as a token of appreciation. If it were a larger item like a couch that was more difficult to maneuver into place, give $10 each for the additional labor and effort it took. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Tip $10 to $20 per person if your furniture is extra large or delicate.",
      "content": "Tip $10 to $20 per person if your furniture is extra large or delicate. Moving heavy furniture , like high-end couches or big wooden dressers, takes a lot of strength and endurance to move (especially if stairs are involved). Delicate pieces, like antiques, also need extra care. The workers have to move slowly and gently to avoid damaging them. [6] X Research source In this case, a tip shows your appreciation for keeping difficult furniture in great condition."

      "title": "Tip $15 to $20 (or more) per person for difficult or complex deliveries.",
      "content": "Tip $15 to $20 (or more) per person for difficult or complex deliveries. Bad weather, like rain storms or blizzards, make driving a delivery truck very tedious (and potentially dangerous). Home features like narrow alleys, tight staircases, or slim doorways that make it hard to get furniture inside warrant a tip, too. The delivery workers will definitely appreciate it after hauling all that furniture up stairs ! [7] X Research source Consider a tip if your stairs or doorways require the delivery workers to disassemble, move, and then reassemble your furniture just to get it inside. Lengthy deliveries due to weather or tight spaces can throw delivery workers off schedule for the rest of the day. A tip helps make up for potential lost work."

      "title": "Consider non-monetary gestures like offering water or a snack, too.",
      "content": "Consider non-monetary gestures like offering water or a snack, too. If your budget is tight or you don’t have cash on you, offer the delivery workers a cold drink, coffee, a snack, or a bathroom break. They typically have a stacked schedule and may not have time for a break, so kind gestures like these are always appreciated! [8] X Research source Feel free to offer a snack or coffee even if you give a cash tip, too."

    {
      "title": "Hand each delivery worker cash individually.",
      "content": "Hand each delivery worker cash individually. Estimate how much you want to tip before they arrive so you can make sure you have the right amount of bills to give them (it’s impractical to hand a large bill to one worker and expect them to split it up). Offer cash rather than a check or adding it to an account—it's the easiest way to make sure the money goes directly to the delivery workers. [9] X Research source Some workers can’t accept tips because of company policy. Try not to force them to take it in that case. Thank them with your gratitude and a snack instead!"

      "content": "Your furniture requires assembly If the delivery workers are also putting your new furniture together for you, tip them for the time and hard work they put in (if you’ve assembled furniture before, you know it can be tricky!). Give $10 to $20, depending on how long it takes. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "The delivery was punctual",
      "content": "The delivery was punctual If you were required to be home to sign for and accept your furniture delivery and the drivers arrived right on time, thank them for respecting your time and schedule with a tip of at least $5. If they were late without calling ahead or explaining extenuating circumstances, like horrible traffic, consider tipping less. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "The service was exceptional and friendly",
      "content": "The service was exceptional and friendly Offer a tip of $10 or more if the delivery workers were polite and professional, worked quickly, took extra care not to damage your furniture or home, and cleaned up any boxes or wrappings the furniture came in. If they performed their job well or went above and beyond (like moving your old furniture to the curb), offer at least $15 to $20. [12] X Research source"
