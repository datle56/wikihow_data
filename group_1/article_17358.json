This will allow the two sections of coving running from perpendicular walls to slide over each other. One section of the coving running into a corner should protrude at the top (with the cut sloping upward from the bottom), while the other should protrude at the bottom (with the cut sloping downward from the top). Plan out which sections will slope which way, and mark these lines."
