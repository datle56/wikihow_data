      "content": "Learn the difference between convex and concave. To understand inflection points, you need to understand when a function is convex or concave on a graph. Many functions have both convex and concave intervals, with an inflection point existing where a function changes convexity/concavity. Luckily, convex and concave are easy to distinguish based on what they look like. [1] X Research source A concave function is shaped like a hill or an upside-down U. It’s a function where the slope is decreasing. When it’s graphed, no line segment that joins 2 points on its graph ever goes above the curve. A convex function, on the other hand, is shaped like a U. It’s a function where the slope is increasing. No line segment that joins 2 points on its graph ever goes below the curve. In the graph above, the red curve is convex, while the green curve is concave."

      "content": "Find an inflection point where a function changes concavity. Remember how there’s a difference between convex and concave? An inflection point is a point on a function where its shape changes, either from convex to concave, or opposite. It is also the point where the second derivative of the function changes signs from positive to negative or negative to positive, thus being equal 0. For a point to be the point of inflection, it has to both switch convexity/concavity and change signs on the second derivative. [2] X Research source To find the inflection point on a graph, look for the point where the function switches concavity. On the graph above, it’s the middle point where the function changes from concave to convex."

      "content": "Take the first derivative of the given function. You’ll need your function's second derivative to find your inflection points. Before you get the second derivative, you have to find the first derivative of the function. First derivatives are denoted as f ′ ( x ) {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)} or d f d x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} f}{\\mathrm {d} x}}} . To solve your function’s first derivative, use the power rule. Multiply x by its exponent and then reduce the exponent by 1. [3] X Research source For example, find the inflection point of the function below. f ( x ) = x 3 + 2 x − 1 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}+2x-1} Use the power rule to find the first derivative. f ′ ( x ) = 3 x 3 − 1 + 2 x 1 − 1 f ′ ( x ) = 3 x 2 + 2 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}f^{\\prime }(x)&=3x^{3-1}+2x^{1-1}\\\\f^{\\prime }(x)&=3x^{2}+2\\end{aligned}}} The derivatives of basic functions are usually found in most calculus textbooks; you need to learn how to find basic derivatives before moving on to more complex functions."

To check if the second derivative changes signs, select 1 value that is greater than the candidate point and 1 value that is less than it. Then, plug each value into the second derivative. If the sign of the second derivative is different for both values, the candidate inflection point is an inflection point. If the sign doesn’t change, the candidate point is not an inflection point. [6] X Research source In our example function of f ( x ) = x 3 + 2 x − 1 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}+2x-1} , the second derivative is f ′ ′ ( x ) = 6 x {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime \\prime }(x)=6x} and the candidate inflection point is x = 0. {\\displaystyle x=0.} Choose a value where x > 0 {\\displaystyle x>0} and x < 0. {\\displaystyle x<0.} For this example, we’ll use x = 1 {\\displaystyle x=1} and x = − 1 {\\displaystyle x=-1} as test values.

However, this isn’t true. Remember, 0 can be graphed, so if you get 0 as your candidate point, it might be an inflection point. For example, if you get a candidate inflection point where x = 0 , {\\displaystyle x=0,} make subintervals at ( − i n f i n i t y , 0 ) {\\displaystyle (-infinity,0)} and ( 0 , i n f i n i t y ) . {\\displaystyle (0,infinity).} If the sign changes for the test values you choose at each interval, the inflection point is at 0.
