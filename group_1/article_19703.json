      "content": "Take a sitz bath several times a day for at least 3-4 days. Run warm water in the bath—just enough to cover your lower body when you're sitting. Sit in the bath for 15-20 minutes, then get out and pat yourself dry. This ensures the entire area surrounding the cyst is clean, which can prevent infection. The warmth also encourages the cyst to drain on its own.

This can be helpful if you're not able to take a full sitz bath—for example, if you're at work and only have a few minutes but want to help your cyst heal. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source A warm compress can also provide relief if the cyst is causing pain or soreness, or if the surrounding tissue is sensitive or inflamed. Don't add anything to your compress—just water! The tissue around your vagina is extremely sensitive and essential oils, fragrances, and other substances could make your situation worse."

Bartholin cysts can occasionally be painful or uncomfortable and an OTC pain reliever, such as naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or acetaminophen (Tylenol), can help you feel better. If your cyst causes you pain when you're walking, sitting, or doing certain activities, take a pain reliever—you don't need to suffer.

      "content": "Avoid any sort of vaginal penetration while the cyst is there. This includes penetrative sex, but it also includes using tampons or doing anything else that puts pressure on your vulva and the walls of your vagina. This could cause the cyst to become infected and rupture, which can trigger a life-threatening immune response called \"sepsis.\" You want the cyst to drain naturally, not become infected. [5] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Avoid non-penetrative activities that cause pressure as well. For example, riding horseback can put pressure on your vulva and cause the cyst to rupture, even though there's no penetration involved. Also avoid bath or skin products with fragrances or chemicals that might cause further irritation to the cyst and the surrounding tissue.

At the same time, they can be caused by an underlying sexually-transmitted infection (STI), so go ahead and get tested if you're concerned about that."

This permanent procedure creates an opening to keep the gland draining properly so the blockages that cause cysts don't continue to occur. If you feel as though you're having problems with Bartholin cysts more often than not—say, the cyst is gone for only a few weeks and then comes back—this procedure might be beneficial for you. Talk to your doctor about it and see what they recommend.
