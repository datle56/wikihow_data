      "content": "Listen to music to hear the beat. All music has a beat or basic rhythm to it that can be counted. Music has a certain number of beats per measure, which is usually 3,4 or 6 beats. In salsa music there are 4 beats per measure. The basic salsa dance step uses 2 measures of music, or 8 beats. [2] X Expert Source Jean Franco Vergaray Professional Dance Instructor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Try clapping the rhythm of the music while counting 1-8. Beginners should use salsa music that has a slower beat and an accented percussion. This will help you hear the beat in the music. Some good starter songs are \"Slow Salsa\" by Jimmy Bosch, \"Cuera Maraca y Bongo\" by Los Nemus, \"Cosas Nativas\" by Frankie Ruiz, or \"Yamulemau\" by Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz."

Your feet move on beats 1,2,3 with a pause on beat 4; you step again on beats 5,6,7 and pause on beat 8. Clap when you will be stepping, and don’t clap when you don’t step to understand the rhythm of the dance step. The rhythm will be clap-clap-clap-pause-clap-clap-clap-pause. Repeat this rhythm throughout an entire song."
