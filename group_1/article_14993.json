Think about your drow character’s traits, background, class, or any other details about them. Is there a name that’s particularly fitting? For example, if you’re playing a drow wizard, you might pick a name like “Phaeras” (“Phaer” (honored) + “as” (wizard)). And, if your drow character is known for being a seer or fortune-teller, you could name them “Valintra” (“Val” (dark) + “intra” (messenger, prophet)). Experiment and see what you can create!

They were banished to the subterranean Underdark long ago, and have adapted to its harsh environments. However, not all drow currently live in the Underdark; while some are under the sway of the evil spider goddess, Lolth, others live in independent settlements or seek their fortune in the surface world above. There's an ongoing struggle between Lolth and her good-aligned daughter, the goddess Eilistraee. Thus, Eilistraeean drow fight to free their people from Lolth's influence.
