      "content": "Be aware that clamping and cutting the umbilical cord are not necessary. In fact, some new parents decide to leave the umbilical cord and placenta attached to their baby’s navel and the placenta until it falls off naturally. However, the blood in the placenta may get an infection which could infect your baby. [4] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source Keeping the umbilical cord on until it falls off naturally can also be cumbersome. Most parents have the cord cut shortly after birth because they don’t feel comfortable with the idea of carrying the placenta with their baby until the umbilical cord separates. If you plan to bank your baby’s cord blood, the cord will need to be cut. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Since the umbilical contains no nerves (like hair or finger nails), neither the mother nor the baby will feel the cut.

Immediate clamping used to be a common practice because it may reduce postpartum hemorrhage and it allows the baby, especially if they are high risk or premature, to be evaluated right after they are born.

[8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source One study shows that cutting the umbilical cord at least 60 seconds after birth also reduces the risk of death or the development of a major disability at 2 years old by about 17%.

Recently, there has been a shift to delayed clamping, where the umbilical cord is not clamped until 30 seconds or longer after birth. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Waiting 30 to 60 seconds is considered the best amount of time for the infant to receive the largest amount of cord blood in the placenta. [11] X Research source Some physicians feel that delayed clamping is a more natural process, and provides better circulatory support during the baby’s transition out of the womb. [12] X Research source At birth, a significant amount of the baby’s blood is still in the placenta and umbilical cord. Delayed clamping allows the baby’s circulatory system to recover much more blood, often as much as ⅓ of the baby’s total blood volume. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Similar to the procedure in immediate clamping, the newborn is placed on the mother’s chest. Cesarean-delivered babies are held below the mother’s waist so the blood can return to the baby.

[20] X Research source With your baby’s first breaths in the first few seconds after delivery, your baby’s circulation shifts away dramatically from the placenta. In fact, flow of your baby’s blood through the placenta usually completely stops within the first 5 to 10 minutes of birth. You can determine when blood flow through the umbilical cord has stopped when you can no longer detect the umbilical cord’s pulse (similar to what the pulse in your wrist or neck feels like).

It can also delay the usual 7-14 days of cord drying and separation by a day or two. As the area heals, Yaeger says to look for signs of infection. If you see any kind of “oozing, pus, or the area becomes red or pink or swollen, that could be a sign of infection.
