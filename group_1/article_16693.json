      "content": "Circumcenter is where a triangle’s perpendicular, bisecting lines intersect. If you draw a line at the midpoint of each triangle’s side, you’ll have 3 perpendicular lines bisecting each side. These perpendicular lines all meet together at a point; this is the circumcenter. The circumcenter also forms the triangle’s circumcircle. It is the center of a circle, that when drawn, passes through each vertex of the triangle. [1] X Research source The main principle behind the circumcenter is that each vertex on the triangle is an equal distance away from the circumcenter. On right triangles , the circumcenter is located at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, or the longest side of the triangle. [2] X Research source On obtuse triangles , the circumcenter is located outside of the triangle. On acute triangles , the circumcenter is located inside the triangle."

      "content": "Find the midpoints of the triangle using the vertices’ coordinates. Most math problems give you the (x, y) coordinates of each of the triangle’s vertices. The circumcenter is at the intersection of the perpendicular lines at the midpoint of the triangle’s sides. Because the distance from the circumcenter to each vertex is the same, you only need to find the midpoints of 2 sides. [3] X Research source A triangle’s verticies are A = (-4, 2), B = (2, 4), and C = (4, -4). Use the midpoint formula: [(x 1 + x 2 )/2,( y 1 + y 2 )/2]. Plug in the coordinates for line AB: [(-4 + 2)/2, (2 + 4)/2]. Plug in the coordinates for line BC: [(2 + 4)/2, (4 + -4)/2]. Solve each midpoint: line AB's midpoint is (-1, 3) and line BC’s is (3, 0)."

      "content": "Calculate the slope of the 2 lines. The perpendicular lines at the triangle’s midpoints intersect to give you the circumcenter. So, calculate the slope of the lines to find out where they intersect. Because these lines are perpendicular, take the opposite reciprocal of the slope to find the perpendicular line’s slope . For example, a slope of 2/1 becomes -½. [4] X Research source A triangles vertices are A = (-4, 2), B = (2, 4), and C = (4, -4). Use the slope formula: m = (y 2 - y 1 ) / (x 2 - x 1 ). Plug in the coordinates for line AB: m = (4 - 2) / (2 - -4). Plug in the coordinates for line BC: m = (-4 - 4) / (4 - 2). Solve each slope: line AB’s slope is m = ⅓ and line BC’s is m = -4. Take the opposite reciprocal of the slope: Flip AB’s slope to 1/(⅓) and change the sign. The perpendicular slope is m = -3. BC’s perpendicular slope is m = ¼."

[5] X Research source Use the point-slope equation: y - y 1 = m(x - x1) Plug in the midpoint and slope for line AB: y - 3 = -3(x - -1). Plug in the midpoint and slope for line BC: y - 0 = ¼(x - 3). Solve and simplify each equation: line AB’s is y = -3x. Line BC’s is y = ¼x - ¾ (or 4y = x - 3 if you get rid of the fractions)."

Put the x and y values together to get the circumcenter’s coordinates! [6] X Research source Substitute line AB’s point-slope equation into line BC’s equation: (-3x) = ¼x - ¾. Solve for x: x = -3/13. Plug x into either equation: y = -3(-3/13) with y = 9/13. So, the circumcenter is located at (-3/13, 9/13)."

If the circumcenter is O and the triangle’s vertices are A, B, and C, the distance between A to O is the same as B to O and C to O. So, set AO and BO equal to each other, as well as BO and CO, using the distance formula . [7] X Research source A triangle’s vertices are A = (−2, 3), B = (2, −1), and C = (4, 0). Use a simplified distance formula: (x 2 - x 1 ) 2 + (y 2 - y 1 ) 2 . Set A and B equal to each other: (-2 - x) 2 + (3 - y) 2 = (2 - x) 2 + (-1 - y) 2 .

For AO = BO: x 2 + 4x + 4 + y 2 − 6y + 9 = x 2 − 4x + 4 + y 2 + 2y +1 For BO = CO: x 2 − 4x + 4 + y 2 + 2y + 1= x 2 − 8x + 16 + y 2 Solve and simplify each equation: AO = BO results in y = x + 1.
