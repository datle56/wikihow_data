      "content": "Raise your Eevee’s Friendship level to 160. Eevee starts with a base Friendship (Happiness) of 50 when you catch it or hatch it from an Egg. Boost your Eevee’s Friendship by keeping it in your party as you play the game, battling against wild Pokémon and trainers, and giving it items that raise its stats. [1] X Research source If you have an Eevee in a Pokémon game from Generation II–VII, it starts with a base Friendship level of 70 and needs to reach 220 to evolve. [2] X Research source Eevee’s Friendship level isn’t listed with its other stats, so you won’t be able to check its specific level. We’ll cover where to find NPCs that tell you your friendship level in each game later on."

      "content": "Level up Eevee during the day to get Espeon. Unlike other Pokémon, Eevee doesn’t need to be at a specific level for it to evolve. Go outside in the game and check the graphics. During the day, the graphics will look the brightest and on newer games, you’ll see the sun in the sky. Make your Eevee level up by using it in battle or giving it a Rare Candy and you’ll have your Espeon. [3] X Research source In Pokémon Scarlet, Violet, and Arceus: Legends , daytime lasts for about 20–30 minutes and occurs about once an hour. Pokémon games in Generation VIII and earlier use your console’s clock to set the time. Typically, daytime in these games starts around 10 AM and lasts until 5–7 PM. You can even manually change the time on your console to evolve your Eevee right away."

      "content": "Evolve Eevee into Umbreon by leveling them up at night. Go outside in your game and check if the graphics have a dark blue hue over them, which means that it’s night. In the most recent games, look at the sky to see if there are the moon and stars. Take your Eevee into battle or give it a Rare Candy so it can level up and turn into an Umbreon. [4] X Research source Nighttime lasts about 20–30 minutes in Pokémon Scarlet, Violet, or Legends: Arceus , and it occurs once an hour. Nighttime in games from Generation VIII and earlier usually starts around 6 PM and lasts until about 6 AM based on your console’s internal clock."

Tap on your Eevee and look at its stats to see how long it’s been walking with you. [6] X Research source Eevee collects 1 Candy every 5 kilometres (3.1 mi), so they will automatically appear in your inventory. [7] X Research source It’s a lot easier to keep Eevee set as your Buddy until you walk the full 10 kilometres (6.2 mi). If you switch your Buddy before you reach the full distance, you may not earn the Candies you need to evolve."

Even if you never send Eevee out into a battle, it will still gain Friendship levels just by being in your party and spending time with it.

As Eevee defeats Pokémon and levels up, it could gain anywhere from 1–5 Friendship levels at a time. [12] X Research source Avoid letting your Eevee faint since that will make its friendship drop anywhere from 1–10 levels. It’s okay to use Potions to heal your Eevee up, but avoid using Heal Powder, Energy Root, or Revival Herb since they all lower Friendship."
