      "content": "Perform an overhead triceps extension for a basic way to flex. Pick up a pair of dumbbells that aren’t too heavy for you, then stand up straight. Lift your arms straight up over your head. Then, bend your elbows to lower the dumbbells behind your head. Do 3 sets of up to 12 repetitions for a decent challenge. [1] X Research source This exercise can also be done sitting down. It’s a little easier when you’re sitting on a chair or bench since you don’t have to try as hard to stay balanced."

      "content": "Practice a dumbbell jab if you wish to increase your endurance. Pick up a couple of light dumbbells and stand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart. Hold the dumbbells up close to your body with your elbows bent and your palms facing one another. Then, push one of the dumbbells forward and across your body like you’re boxing. Repeat the motion with your other hand, doing up to 2 sets of 12 repetitions with each arm. [2] X Research source Keep the dumbbells level with your shoulders as you move them. Tense your core muscles to maintain your form. In addition to testing your endurance, jabs work your chest, abs, and other muscles. Work up a sweat as part of your routine or to warm up for tougher exercises!"

      "content": "Do triceps kickbacks with a bench for stable strengthening. Stand next to a weight bench, then plant one knee and hand on it. While holding a dumbbell at your side, raise your free arm up until it’s about level with your back. Do the kickback by moving the dumbbell back toward your feet until your arm straightens out and is parallel to the floor. Do about 3 sets of 12 repetitions on each side to complete the exercise. [3] X Research source This exercise is all about moving slowly, so take your time with it. Stop if your elbow feels stiff and switch to a lighter weight. You could do this exercise while standing. Bend forward to level out your back like you would while leaning on a bench."

      "content": "Try lying dumbbell extensions for an easy way to isolate triceps. Grab a pair of dumbbells, then lie down on a bench. Raise your arms straight up to the ceiling, then bring the dumbbells back down to the top of your head. Hold your forearms still while you do this so your triceps do the work. Go through 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions each to complete the exercise. [4] X Research source There are a couple of different ways to hold the dumbbells, so choose whichever one feels more comfortable. You could position them horizontally with your palms facing up or vertically with your hands wrapped around them."

Keep your elbows bent, then push the dumbbells up above your chest. Bring the dumbbells back down and repeat the motion for 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions each. [5] X Research source This exercise hits your triceps hard but it also engages your shoulders and chest. It’s a simplified version of the bench press done with a barbell.

      "title": "Do cross-body unilateral exercises to flex the sides of your triceps.",
      "content": "Do cross-body unilateral exercises to flex the sides of your triceps. Sit down on a bench, facing the side. Plant your hand near the edge of the bench and lean toward it so your body is at about a 75-degree angle. Using your opposite hand, raise a dumbbell straight up above your head. Bring the dumbbell down behind your head while keeping your forearm still. Complete 3 sets of up to 12 repetitions with each arm. Use this exercise to stretch out each triceps individually. The motion is a lot different than most other exercises, so it’s a good way to add variety to your routine. Another option is to lay down on the bench and bring the dumbbell down toward your forehead. Work on your triceps one at a time for greater strength and stability."

      "content": "Do a close-grip bench press to target your arm muscles. While lying on a weight bench, position your hands about shoulder-width apart. Tuck your elbows against your body before attempting to lift the barbell. Push the weight up as far as you can, then bring it down twice as slowly until it’s close to your chest. Repeat the lift for 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions apiece. [6] X Research source Start with the bar, which weighs about 45 lb (20 kg). If you’re comfortable doing the exercise and can handle more weight, add weight plates to the bar to increase your strength. The close grip you use focuses more of the strain on your triceps than the grip from a standard bench press. If you position your hands too close together, you lose stability, so shift your grip to compensate. Always have a spotter on hand in case you need help managing the heavy weights sometimes required for this exercise."

      "content": "Master the skullcrusher to strengthen triceps by pulling them. Lay down on a bench, gripping a weight bar with your hands about a shoulder-width apart. Start with your arms fully extended. Bend your arms at the elbows to bring the bar down close to your forehead. After lifting it back up, repeat the exercise 10 to 12 times, doing 3 sets total. [7] X Research source Skullcrushers are good compliments to bench presses since they use opposite motions. A bench press involves pushing a bar instead of pulling it down. Take advantage of both types of motions for super triceps! Skullcrushers can be done with dumbbells. Wrap your hands around a pair of dumbbells, then lower them to your head. The dumbbells can be easier to use, so try them if the regular version hurts your elbows. Consider having a spotter available on hand for this exercise. If you’re careful, you can put the bar down by moving it past your head. A spotter isn’t necessary but can help prevents accidents."

      "content": "Lower yourself on a dip machine for a natural way to build strength. Most gyms have a seated dip machine as well as an assisted weight dip machine with bars at waist level. If you’re using the bars or assisted weight machine, lift yourself up, then lower yourself until your arms are roughly level with your head. For the seated machine, push the handles down to strengthen your triceps. Go through 3 sets, doing about 8 to 12 dips per set. [8] X Research source Keep your elbows tucked in so they don’t bend out to the sides while you’re moving. A seated machine is the easiest way to do dips since it allows you to add on extra weight without worrying about balancing. Some gyms also have free bars you can use for dips."

      "title": "Pull down on a rope to flex your upper arms while standing.",
      "content": "Pull down on a rope to flex your upper arms while standing. You will need a rope handle attached to the pulley of a cable machine. With the rope at about chest height, grip the handles and begin pulling them down. Keep your arms tucked close to your sides and don’t move your forearms at all. After bringing your hands down until your arms are straight, slowly return to the starting position. Repeat this about 10 to 12 times through 3 sets. [9] X Research source The trick to this exercise is keeping your shoulders down so your back and upper arms don’t move at all. If you feel them moving, switch to a lower weight for more stability."

      "content": "Pull a rope up over your head for a way to extend your triceps. Secure the rope handle to the bottom pulley of a cable machine. Start with the rope behind your head, bending your arms at the elbows so your forearms are parallel to the floor. Raise your arms straight up into the air to stretch your triceps. Repeat the motion about 10 12 times, doing 3 sets. [10] X Research source You could also start with your hands up in the air and then lower them behind your head. It doesn’t make much difference to the exercise, so go whichever way feels more comfortable. The extension works the back ends of your triceps. Pair it with rope pulldowns to get more out of your workout."

      "content": "Perform a diamond push-up if you don’t have weights available. A diamond press is a variation of a regular push up, so it’s pretty simple. To do it, lay face down on the ground with your arms shoulder-width apart and raise yourself up. Turn your hands inward so your thumbs touch. Raise and lower yourself about 10 to 12 times for each of 3 sets. [11] X Research source Keep your elbows close to your sides so your triceps get most of the work. This exercise is easy to do both at home and when you’re on the go. Pair it with some dips to hit your entire triceps. If you’re looking for an easier variation, try doing a regular wide-grip push-up by keeping your hands below your shoulders. Another option is to plant your knees on the ground to reduce the weight your triceps have to bear."

      "content": "Do dips if you have stable furniture to lower yourself from. After you choose a piece of furniture you’re sure won’t move, stand in front of it. Place your palms on the edge of the furniture with your feet out ahead of you. Then, lower yourself down until your arms are parallel with the ground. Raise yourself back up until your arms are straight again and repeat, trying for 3 sets of 8 to 12 dips. [12] X Research source Try the exercise on a bench, chair, or table. Make sure the furniture you choose is sturdy and stable so you don’t end up on the floor. [13] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 22 January 2021."

      "content": "Rotate your arms in circles to warm them up and tone them. While standing up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart, extend your arms straight out to the side. Rotate your shoulders to make circles with your arms. Start with some smaller circles and work up to bigger ones. Do this for about 2 to 3 minutes, then try doing it in reverse. See if you can go through the exercise 2 or 3 times. [14] X Research source Arm circles are the simplest exercise possible and can be done anywhere to tone your triceps. It won't strengthen your triceps very much, so be sure to do some other exercises as well. This move is a great way to warm up your triceps before taking on more challenging exercises."
