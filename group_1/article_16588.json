      "content": "Choose the correct form. There are 3 different versions of the standard tax return: the 1040, the 1040A, and the 1040EZ. If you're filing a zero income tax return, you'll probably not be using a 1040EZ, which is for individuals with no dependents claiming no credits. Most likely, you'll be filing the 1040A. If you're using online tax preparation software, it will automatically choose the correct form for you based on the information you provide."

Since you didn't earn any income for the year, you'll enter a \"-0-\" in each blank.

Any adjustments would result in a negative number for your adjusted gross income (AGI). However, your AGI can't be less than zero, so you'd still enter \"-0-\" in the line for AGI.
