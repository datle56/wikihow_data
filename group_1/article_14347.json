      "content": "Draw a wavy line horizontally across the page. Make it look like rolling hills or gentle waves running across the middle of the page. Create random undulations and avoid making sharp angles (like mountain peaks). [2] X Research source The more “waves” you make, the more complex your finished drawing will appear. Start with about 3-4 waves if you’re a beginner."

      "title": "Place 8 dots along the line—2 near the edges, 6 randomly spaced.",
      "content": "Place 8 dots along the line—2 near the edges, 6 randomly spaced. Place a dot on the wavy line within about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the left edge of the paper, and place another one within about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the right edge. Draw the other 6 dots in between these 2, wherever you feel like putting them! [3] X Research source In your head, label these dots “1” through “8” from left to right—but don’t jot the numbers on the page! To increase the complexity, add more dots—but 8 is good for a beginner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw arches above the wavy line that connect the dots.",
      "content": "Draw arches above the wavy line that connect the dots. In other words, draw an upward-curved arch (like a rainbow) that starts at dot 1 and ends at dot 2. Do the same between dots 2 and 3, and so on. Also start arches at dot 1 and dot 8 that disappear off the edge of the page. [4] X Research source Vary the arches in height, making them about 0.25–0.5 in (0.64–1.27 cm) high. The smaller in height they are, the more complex your drawing will appear."

      "title": "Repeat the arches again and again until they extend off the page.",
      "content": "Repeat the arches again and again until they extend off the page. Draw a new arch on top of the initial arch between dots 1 and 2 (like a double rainbow!), and do the same between dots 2 and 3 and so on. Keep doing this over and over again until all the arches above the wavy line run off the top of the page. [5] X Research source The arches can vary in height as you go, but try to keep them within the 0.25–0.5 in (0.64–1.27 cm) height range if that’s what you started with. Creating arches on arches may get a bit tedious, so try to have fun with it! Watch closely to see how your op art is beginning to appear!"

      "title": "Replicate the arch pattern beneath the wavy line as well.",
      "content": "Replicate the arch pattern beneath the wavy line as well. Follow the exact same process under the wavy line as you did above it. The “upside-down rainbows” don’t have to be mirror images of the arches above them, but keep them within the same general height range. [6] X Research source By the time you’re done, your paper should be filled with arches upon arches!"

      "title": "Color the spaces between a single stack of arches in a 3-color pattern.",
      "content": "Color the spaces between a single stack of arches in a 3-color pattern. For example, use red to color the space between the wavy line and the arch between dots 1 and 2. Then, use blue to color the gap above the first arch and beneath the second arch, and black to color the gap above the second arch and beneath the third one. Keep repeating this until you go off the top of the page. [7] X Research source For an added 3-D effect, color more darkly around the edges of each gap, and more lightly near the center. This creates an appearance of light and shadow."

      "title": "Repeat the coloring process for each stack of arches above and below the line.",

For example, color the arch stack above dots 2 and 3 in a blue-black-red pattern, and the arches below dots 2 and 3 in a black-red-blue pattern. The goal is to avoid having consecutive gaps in the same color, although it won’t ruin your picture if this happens occasionally—it’s art, after all! [9] X Research source If you’d rather take a more random approach to your coloring, that’s fine too!"

A satellite view of a compact mountain range on another planet? You’ll see something different each time you look! [10] X Research source Also, your art will turn out differently each time you follow these instructions. Like snowflakes, each drawing is unique!"

Draw the initial rectangle in a 3:4 ratio—in other words, if you’re using 8.5 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) paper, make the rectangle 6 in × 8 in (15 cm × 20 cm). [11] X Research source If you want to get the 3-D effect with this type of op art, precision measuring and drawing is important."

It should pass straight through the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines you drew to create the 4 smaller rectangles.

From the top left and right corners, measure down and mark dots at 1.5 and 4.5 in (3.8 and 11.4 cm). [14] X Research source These measurements are all based on starting with a 6 in × 8 in (15 cm × 20 cm) rectangle. The horizontal dots should be at 1/4 and 3/4 of the total width of the rectangle, and the vertical dots should be at 1/4 and 3/4 of the total height."

Starting at the central intersection where all the lines meet, measure and mark each diagonal at the following lengths: 0.5 in (1.3 cm); 1.25 in (3.2 cm); 2.25 in (5.7 cm); 3.5 in (8.9 cm). [16] X Research source If you started with a 6 in × 8 in (15 cm × 20 cm) rectangle, each diagonal will be 5 in (13 cm) in length from the central intersection to one of the rectangle’s corners (as per the Pythagorean theorem !). If you started with a rectangle of a different size, mark the dots at 1/10, 1/4, 9/20, and 7/10 of the total length of each diagonal section."

You’ll end up with a small rectangle surrounding the central intersection. Follow up by connecting the 4 dots at 1.25 in (3.2 cm), 2.25 in (5.7 cm), and 3.5 in (8.9 cm), respectively. [17] X Research source You should now see a series of ever-larger rectangles that appear to be emanating from the central intersection."

      "content": "Alternate between 2 colors as you fill in the smallest rectangle. Due to all the lines that meet at the central intersection, the interior of the smallest rectangle should be broken up into 16 triangles. Choose 2 colors—for instance, black and red—to color in these triangles in an alternating pattern, so that you don’t have the same color in consecutive triangles. [18] X Research source For example, use black to color the first triangle to the right of the vertical line that points upward from the central intersection. Color the triangle immediately to its right red, and so on. Black and white is also a classic color combo for this type of op art, and will save you some time while coloring if you’re using white paper!"

      "title": "Fill in the remaining rectangles using the same checkerboard pattern.",
      "content": "Fill in the remaining rectangles using the same checkerboard pattern. Each rectangle has 16 triangles inside it, so keep using alternating colors (like black and red) within them. Start at the same spot within each rectangle and alternate the first color you use—this will give the drawing a 3-D checkerboard appearance. [19] X Research source For instance, start coloring inside each rectangle at the triangle directly to the right of the vertical line that points upward from the central intersection. Make the triangle black in the smallest rectangle, red in the second smallest rectangle, and so on."

Use the side of a pencil lead, for example, to slightly darken the area surrounding the central intersection. Use less and less darkening as you get further from the central intersection—which is in fact the “vanishing point” of your finished piece of op art! [20] X Research source Next time you try this style of op art, play with the geometry a bit so that your vanishing point is off-center on the page. Or, try using 4 colors instead of 2 to change up the final appearance!"
