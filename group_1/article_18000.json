      "title": "Pull up on the center of the playard floor.",
      "content": "Pull up on the center of the playard floor. Most models have a red strap located at the center of the playard floor. Grasp the strap and pull it up to begin the process of collapsing the playard. [4] X Research source Some models have a handle instead of a strap on the floor of the playard. Grab the handle, push it down, and turn it to release the center of the playard floor, then pull up. If you have a model that can be folded with the bassinet in place, such as the On the Go, pull apart the bassinet’s metal support tubes first. Reach through the slit in the center of the bassinet’s mesh base to grab the strap. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Lift one of the top rails up slightly. After you pull up the floor of the playard, grasp one of the 4 top rails at the center, where the release button is located. Pull up on the rail slightly. [6] X Research source Pulling up on the rail a little will help disengage the tubes on either side of the release button. You need to do this before or at the same time as you push the button, depending on the model. [7] X Research source You won’t be able to lift or release the rails until the playard floor is lifted."

      "content": "Press the button in the center of the rail to unlock it. While the side rail is slightly lifted, find the release button on the side of the rail and push it in. This button is located at the center of the rail on its outer side. [8] X Research source You’ll need to press fairly hard on the button to unlock the rail. [9] X Research source On some models, the button is located underneath the rail."

      "title": "Push the rail down to collapse it.",
      "content": "Push the rail down to collapse it. Keep the button pushed in and push down on the middle of the rail. The metal tubes on either side of the section with the button should both disengage, allowing the rail to fold downward. [10] X Research source If the rail doesn’t fold, don’t try to force it. Try lifting the floor higher to allow the rails to fold properly."

      "content": "Repeat this process on the other 3 top rails. After you’ve successfully folded the first rail, unlock the other 3 and fold them down in the same way.

      "title": "Bring the collapsed rails together.",
      "content": "Bring the collapsed rails together. Finish by making sure the floor is pulled all the way up and pushing all the collapsed rails together. Your Pack ‘n Play should fold up into a neat, compact bundle. [12] X Research source If the Pack ‘n Play doesn’t collapse completely, check to make sure none of the rails are partially locked. If you find a rail that isn’t completely collapsed, push the center button again to release the lock."

Bundle up any accessories that you’d like to pack with it, such as your mattress sheet, bassinet base and support tubes, and toy bar, next to the folded playard on top of the mattress.

After you secure the Pack ‘n Play inside its mattress, turn it so that the handle on the outside of the mattress is facing up. Take the travel bag and position it so you can line up the handle with the slot in the top of the bag. Slide the bag over the Pack ‘n Play and zip it shut with the handle sticking out. [17] X Research source To guide the Pack ‘n Play into the bag more easily, make sure to align the corners of the bag with the corners of the mattress."
