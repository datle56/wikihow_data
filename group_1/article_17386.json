      "title": "Be yourself.",
      "content": "Be yourself. If your first day in the school is the first day of the new year, then some people will notice you, especially if it is a small school. When people talk to you, don't be nervous, but don't be too loud. Be confident and make eye contact. However, sometimes you may need to make yourself loud so that you will get noticed, and but try not to constantly attract attention to yourself. Don't worry too much about what people think of you; you'll over-analyze the situation and they might judge you for that. Be genuine and be nice to everyone, no matter how mean they may appear at first. It's usually always the 'girl/guy that you hated at your new school' that ends up being your friend after a little sincerity. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself, if it's very clear that you should."

      "title": "Avoid worrying about getting to know the school too much.",
      "content": "Avoid worrying about getting to know the school too much. Know where your locker is and have a map in case of emergencies, but whenever possible, ask the person sitting near you or a teacher in the hallway where something is. Asking for directions to a class, for example, is a good way to talk to people and meet a lot of people on your first day. You're the new kid now. Mention that to people whenever you need some help."

      "title": "Refrain from being flirty.",
      "content": "Refrain from being flirty. When you talk to those of the opposite gender, don't flirt too much before finding out if they're already with someone. Once one person hates you, their entire group will hate you too. Remember these people grew up together, so it's their obligation to defend their lifelong friends.. Being flirty is more acceptable in a college environment since there are always new students to meet that are just like you. Be nice, and optimistic, even if there happens to be an annoyance. They might even let you be the annoyance to another new kid someday, it usually takes a year and a half, but they'll come around. Always remember to make a good first impression but it's also important to be yourself."

      "content": "Prepare for your first lunch. Talk to students in the class right before lunch. Usually, they will ask you if you're sitting with anyone, but if not, steer the topic towards school lunch (as in is the food good etc.) If no one specifically mentions eating together, but you're walking to the cafeteria together, then it's implied that you'll eat lunch together."

    {
      "title": "Be nice to everyone.",
      "content": "Be nice to everyone. It is important to talk to everyone, even if they seem weird, when you are a new student. They could always know people you'd rather be friends with or introduce you to more people. Try to meet new people. However, if they are hated by everyone, then it is advised not to become best friends with them unless you really want to, don't get too into people, hang out with everyone, and make sure you know a group or person well enough before deeming them your friend. It can be the most tricky, manipulative people that talk to you at first, and it's usually those who just talk to you later on, at the back of the classroom who are there for you later on."

Don't be too gullible, - people will sometimes even push your buttons to test what your 'limits' are, - like testing the waters. Just make sure you confidently (maybe even with a big smile on your face)... reply 'reasonably'. Like if they call you a \"jerk\" , - ask them why they called you a jerk. If they accuse you of something you didn't do, reply by saying you've never done whatever it is they are accusing you of, and then ask them who had said that."
