      "title": "Think of her specific, unique qualities that you love.",
      "content": "Think of her specific, unique qualities that you love. Telling someone you love her doesn't happen every day, and very few people will ever become such an important object of your affection. To genuinely express your love from the heart, think about the things that make this woman special. They can be little memories you share, a quirk she has you can't get enough of, or skills and a personality that still amazes you. You may bring these things up when you talk, you may not. What is important is that you understand why you feel in love. It is much easier to express something, after all, if you understand it."

    {
      "title": "Choose a quiet, safe, and generally happy time to talk.",
      "content": "Choose a quiet, safe, and generally happy time to talk. You simply want somewhere you can comfortably express your feelings and listen to her response. After a date, on a walk, or simply a quiet moment alone are all good places to talk, but don't stress too much over the location. The words, not the place, are far more important and exciting. That said, there are some not-so-great times to say \"I love you\" the first time: After sex While drunk or intoxicated Online or over the phone (unless you cannot see each other in person) During or after a fight or argument."

      "title": "Keep it simple and honest.",
      "content": "Keep it simple and honest. While movies may tell you you have to be special or original with your message, you don't. Spending all your time planning or waiting for a perfect moment grossly misses the point of your relationship. You are in love — so just keep it simple and let her know. It will be more than enough, guaranteed. This isn't to say there is no time for romance and spectacle in your relationship. But expressing your love for someone is a big emotional development — you don't need bells and whistles. How happy she makes you, good memories you've shared, your hopes and feelings — this is more than enough \"material\" to work with without feeling like you must write a poem or plan an event.

      "title": "Just put the words out there.",
      "content": "Just put the words out there. Take a deep breath and count to three. When you finish, tell yourself you're just going to blurt out \"I love you.\" This is all it takes — three seconds of courage for a potential lifetime of happiness. Don't get caught up in an intro, perfect wording, or anything fancy. Just tell her, \"I love you.\" \"I'm in love with you.\" \"These last months have been some of the best in my life, and I've been so lucky to meet you. I love you.\" \"I've had something on my chest for a while, and it feels good to let it out. I love you.\" Pull her in close for a hug or kiss and, before breaking the embrace, whisper, \"I love you.\""

      "title": "Once you're done talking, sit back and listen, no matter what the response.",
      "content": "Once you're done talking, sit back and listen, no matter what the response. Think of it this way — you are telling someone you feel one of the most powerful emotions you've ever felt, and you've been dealing with this feeling for a few days or weeks. She is hearing this for the first time, and she may need some time to process her feelings. You can't control how she is going to respond, nor should you try. Instead, listen to her response and let her lead the conversation. [2] X Research source It takes an immense amount of courage to tell someone you love them. Be proud of yourself."

      "content": "If you can't see each other in person, express your feelings through a phone call or letter. Don't feel like you must wait to be reunited with someone to express your love — if you feel it, let it out. That said, it's hard to understand from a short letter or text message what a quick \"I love you\" means (is it a joke, serious, semi-serious?) so don't leave any doubt. Take the time to express your feelings in a way that leaves no doubt in your beloved's mind. Let her know that you'd rather talk to her in person, but couldn't keep your feelings secret any longer. Elaborate on why you've suddenly started feeling this way, and can't keep it in any more. Give her the feeling and backstory. Say that you don't need a response or answer immediately, just that you needed to get this off your chest. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Say \"I love you\" when you feel in love, not because you think you \"must\" say it. Some people can comfortably say \"I love you\" multiple times a day. Others are more reserved, feeling like over-saying it might lessen its power and beauty. Wherever you fall, there is a good way to make sure your expressions of love only come when you really mean them. [4] X Expert Source Jin S. Kim, MA Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 14 May 2019. If expressing your love feels like a burden on you, then you need to re-examine how you actually feel about her.

      "title": "Use other words to express your love without always saying \"I love you.\"",
      "content": "Use other words to express your love without always saying \"I love you.\" You don't have to be a broken record to express your love regularly. Telling her that you're grateful for her presence, that you're excited just being around her, that you adore her, or any other synonyms for love will get the point across without making your words seem rote or unthoughtful. Try: \"I am better because of you.\" \"I cannot stop thinking about you.\" \"You drive me crazy on a daily basis, and I love it.\" Use cutesy terms she likes, like darling, honey, doll, etc. [5] X Research source If either of you can speak multiple languages, try saying \"I love you\" in one of those other languages."

Tell her that her spaghetti sauce is especially good on the days that it is, and remind her how important her support has been when you're going through tough times. A great way to express your love is to show that you're paying attention and are appreciative, making her a big part of your thoughts. [6] X Expert Source Jin S. Kim, MA Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 14 May 2019. Good times include: After taking care of you or chipping in during a tough time.

      "title": "Offer your forgiveness and withhold your blame.",
      "content": "Offer your forgiveness and withhold your blame. A loving couple is a team, getting through life's challenges together, not alone. When you hold a mistake over someone's head after she has apologized, however, or you keep a grudge going because you fault her for hard times, you're breaking up the bond. Love is easily expressed in forgiveness, as it shows that your bond is deeper than one issue or mistake. Blaming someone for a problem turns things into a me vs. you scenario. [7] X Research source Forgiveness can take time, and that is okay. The point is that you express your love through your willingness to look past honest mistakes, loving the person in her entirety, flaws and all."

      "content": "Be open and honest during arguments instead of hiding or sheltering concerns. Even loving couples fight, and that is okay. What is more important is how you fight. There will always be issues and differences, but loving couples know that getting things out in the open is more important than burying feelings for a later day. In its own way, this is an expression of love to a girl — the trust that you can be honest her, and that you can trust her to do the same. [8] X Expert Source Jin S. Kim, MA Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 14 May 2019.

When you close your eyes, she is there by your side, and letting her know this is a great way to express your love without saying the words. This doesn't mean you map out every detail from marriage to kids — it just means you let her know you're excited to keep her in your life. \"If we could retire together right now, where would you want to go with me?\" Talk about your career and living plans, dreaming, scheming, and planning together even if nothing comes of it."

If you make an effort to show your love once a day, whether with a good-night \"I love you\" or by simply putting his toothpaste on her brush for her, you'll keep the relationship strong for a long time. If you're worried about showing your affection, just think about finding one time a day where you can. Even an extra-long, passionate kiss is a great way to slow down time with her for a half-second.

When you show her that you're thinking of her when it's not a special occasion, she'll know that you love her without having to hear it. This is especially important when she is stressed out.

      "content": "Use date nights and little occasions to celebrate your love. Take time and effort to splash some color into your life. This doesn't mean blowing your whole paycheck on her; it means setting aside time each week or day for couple time. When you set aside your schedule to be with her and spend some blissful hours together, the message is clear — you love her, and you're willing to express it. A date night can be take-out and a movie or a fancy restaurant. Maybe you'd rather go camping, in the backyard or a national park. Perhaps you just want to go to a museum and wander for a few hours. The time and thought is the important part. Though you can't do it every time, surprises are a great way to express your love on a special day. Remember important dates and events — attention to your relationship on these days makes a big impact. Unfortunately, so does forgetting them. [12] X Research source"
