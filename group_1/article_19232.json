Most accounts can safely follow up to 200 people per day, if those are spread out across the day. For a new account, start with 50/day and gradually work your way up. [4] X Research source Careful—this limit actually includes both follows and unfollows. If you try the sneaky \"follow and unfollow\" just to try and get a follower, that will count as 2 of your follows for the day. The best follows are accounts that are interested in the same kind of content as you. Check the Explore and Reel feeds, and search for keywords and hashtags related to the hobbies and interests you like to post about. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Comment on popular accounts. Follow celebrities, brands, and any active, popular accounts that you think your followers would also be interested in. Get attention by commenting on their posts regularly. These comments can be witty, sweet, or snarky—whatever your style is—but it's best to keep them short and not ask for follows directly. [6] X Research source Spamming comments like \"Hey follow me!\" probably won't work. Write something that people like, and they'll check out your account."

      "title": "Follow people who like your pictures.",
      "content": "Follow people who like your pictures. When you use hashtags, you'll get some strangers liking your pictures. When you do, follow them back. If someone expresses an interest in your pictures and your profile, it's good to reach out and connect. Comment on one of their pictures or like a few in return. It only takes a minute or two and it helps to get a new follower. It's good to show that you're a real person, and not just a follower-gathering machine. Reach out and make a little comment, even if it's just \"Thanks!\""

      "content": "Look for shoutout opportunities. If you can get the right kind of account to give you a shoutout (tag you in their post), it can be worth a decent handful of followers. Here's some advice for how to do this while you're starting out: [7] X Research source Message other accounts asking if they're interested in trading shoutouts. This works best if you both make similar content and have roughly the same number of followers. (It's not a fair trade if the other account is 1,000 times larger than yours.) Give your followers a shoutout once in a while when they post about something relevant to your account. They'll often shout you back."

The more you can get people to interact with your posts, the more presence you'll have in their feed, and the more you'll be recommended to new potential followers. [9] X Research source Hold contests. Give away something fun to the \"best comment\" or to a particular follower for doing something. Make your prize somehow related to the theme of your page. Ask your followers questions and respond to their questions. Better yet, have actual conversations and express an interest in their lives and their pictures. Make a funny comment that people will want to share. If they share your post that will make your account visible to many more users."

When you're crafting yours, try to think about what you're likely to include in your photo feed. What are you passionate about? What are your interests? Music, humor, literature & news, movies & actors, and travel are some of the fastest-growing topics on Instagram.

[17] X Research source These are safe guidelines, but experiment if you're feeling bold or if a face doesn't really say what your Instagram is about. Is this account for your dog? Then she belongs in the profile pic. Craft beer enthusiast? Show us the suds.

Your followers want to see you as a real person who uses their platform for good, especially when it comes to priorities and values that are central to your brand. Social media influencer and model Lucy Bennett, for example, doesn't work with fashion brands with limited sizing or poor racial representation on their social media. Similarly, if you promote sustainable food, don't partner with brands that have a poor ecological reputation. [18] X Research source Working with companies can be a collaboration. If a company approaches you with a proposal that's not quite right, write back and suggest improvements that match your brand.

Try ending your captions with a \"call to action\" i.e. ask followers a question, ask them to post their own photos with your hashtag, or tell them to check your bio for a link to more content.

[26] X Research source It's not all about the raw numbers. It's better to have one of the best photos on a smaller hashtag than to be lost among a million #beach photos. If your picture is tied to a particular place, and you don't mind the lower privacy setting, set your Instagram so that it can tag your location. This shows your geotagged pictures to local people.

Never re-post the same picture that you've already posted, especially not the same day. If you didn't get as many likes as you wanted the first time, don't put the same picture back up."
