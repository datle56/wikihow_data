This is a common issue in palera1n. If you see the “dpkg error: Read-only file system” notification, try the following solution: [1] X Research source Open the palera1n loader app on your iPhone. Tap the gear icon. Select Remount R/W . Retry the operation that originally triggered the error."

      "content": "You may see this error when using tweaks that don’t support rootless jailbreaks. With the release of iOS 15, certain parts of your iPhone’s system are now completely inaccessible. These system files are locked inside the SSV, or Sealed System Volume. For this reason, many recent jailbreaks, such as palera1n for iOS 15+, are “rootless” (meaning that they work without accessing or changing parts of your system that require root privileges). [2] X Research source Trying to use an older tweak that was designed for full-root environment with one of these rootless jailbreaks may result in a “read-only file system” error. Check with the developer of the tweak you’re trying to use. They may have an updated version that works with rootless jailbreaks."

When other troubleshooting steps don’t work, your best bet may be to unjailbreak your iPhone and then jailbreak it again. To unjailbreak your iPhone, you’ll need to put it in Recovery Mode and restore it using Finder or iTunes. Once your iPhone is restored, you can attempt to jailbreak it again."
