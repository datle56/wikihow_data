      "content": "Check for payments Mondays and Thursdays. Uber pays every Monday, so you should get a notification about your earnings then. However, payments are usually not reflected in your bank statements until Thursday. On Thursday, check your bank account balance to make sure the payment was processed.

This explains the amount of money you made through trips and tips, as well as any reimbursement you received from Uber for things like tolls. [4] X Research source Uber provides an estimate of weekly payments through their app, but the estimate is rarely 100% accurate. Depending on things like tips and promotions, you may make slightly more or less than expected. Your rolling payment statements can help explain any discrepancies. [5] X Research source"

To set up Instant Pay, simply tap \"Earnings\" through your Uber account. Tap \"Instant Pay\" and then enter your debit card number. Not every Uber driver can sign up for Instant Pay.

      "content": "Stick to a central location. In general, chasing surges throughout the day is unlikely to make you a lot of money. Many cars will enter surge zones, driving up competition. When driving for Uber, try to drive around a central location in the city. This way, you'll be pinged to get rides from people in surrounding areas and can pick up steady work. [6] X Research source You should also avoid driving around areas like the suburbs of large cities. People often call Ubers to be taken into the cities, but the cost of driving miles and miles often outweighs the money you make."

      "title": "Go to surge zones only during predictable times.",
      "content": "Go to surge zones only during predictable times. While chasing random surge prices is not recommended, do not ignore surges altogether either. Some surge prices are predictable. When areas are packed with customers looking for a ride, the demand is high enough that you should get rides even with competition. [7] X Research source Bars closing and major events ending are generally the most predictable surge times. During these times, hovering around these areas increases your likelihood of getting a high paying ride."

Go to areas where there are less drivers on the road. [8] X Research source However, avoid completely secluded areas. Stick to central locations rather than driving to the middle of nowhere, where there may not be a high demand for rides."

When going to a surge area, log into the passenger's app until you reach the area. This shows Uber more people are heading to a particular area, which may lead to surge prices. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Track your costs carefully. Figure out the cost of owning and operating your car, the gas you use per mile, and IRS deductions from your final paycheck. Each week, add up the extra costs and subtract them from your paycheck. This will show you how much you really made. [10] X Research source By driving in far away areas or simply not working enough hours, you can actually lose money driving for Uber. If your number comes out negative, strive to get more rides and tweak the locations where you're driving."

      "content": "Be kind to passengers. Uber ratings actually matter a lot. Customers may not want to take rides from drivers with low ratings, so always be courteous to customers. Getting frustrated or crabby could knock your ratings. [11] X Research source Customers who are angry, emotional, or intoxicated are typical for Uber drivers. Deal with such customers with patience, even when they become unruly. While it can be frustrating, remember how much your ratings matter to power through unpleasant interactions."
