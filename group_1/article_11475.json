      "content": "Learn how to pop and lock. Chris Brown is known to do popping and locking when he dances. These two popular dance styles take a little practice and muscle control to get down. Popping is a bouncy dance style where you isolate your body parts to the beat of the music. When you practice popping, imagine a wave is moving through your body, causing your body parts to move one after another. Locking is a controlled dance style where you move quickly and then freeze, locking your body in one position. Then, you continue moving at the same speed as before, coming out of the lock. Locking is often done with jerky arm and leg movements, while your hips stay loose to the beat of the music."
