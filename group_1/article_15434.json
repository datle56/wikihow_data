      "content": "Make hot tea from ginger to help a cough. While there’s little evidence that ginger can help with a cough, this root's warming, anti-inflammatory properties may provide some relief. Try making a flavorful tea by cutting a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece of ginger into small pieces. Place the ginger in a mug, and pour in 1 c (240 mL) of boiling water. Allow the hot tea to cool for at least 5 minutes before drinking.

      "content": "Run ginger through your juicer before blending smoothies or juices. If you’re juicing as part of your diet, try adding a hint of ginger flavor to your juice. Before making your juice, slice a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece of ginger root and toss it into the juicer. Juice the ginger, removing the leftover pulp and remnants. Now, make your juice as normal. Placing the ginger through the juicer first will give your juice a zesty flavor without adding chunks of ginger to your beverage.

      "content": "Use ginger when making a root vegetable soup . The spiciness of ginger pairs well with creamy soups, especially those made with root vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and parsnips. Not only are these soups tasty, but the touch of zesty spice can warm you right up in winter! Make a simple root vegetable soup by following these steps: [5] X Research source Measure out 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of fresh chopped ginger, 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of ground coriander, and 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) of ground mustard seeds. Add your ingredients and 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) of curry powder to 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of hot oil in a heavy pot. Add 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of fresh minced ginger, 2 c (470 mL) of chopped onions, and 4 c (950 mL) of thinly sliced carrots to the pot. Sauté for 3 minutes, then add 5 c (1,200 mL) of chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 30 minutes. Once cool, blend the soup in batches in a food processor or blender until it’s smooth. Return it to the soup pot and add broth 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) at a time if it’s too thick."

      "content": "Grate fresh ginger into a stir-fry for a spicy flavor. Believe it or not, making stir-fry is super easy, and raw ginger happens to be a perfect ingredient. Simply mix your favorite protein and vegetables with a few ounces of oil in a frying pan. Once the oil starts sizzling, grate a bit of ginger into the pan to add extra flavor. Cover the stir-fry in your favorite Asian sauce (soy sauce, chili oil, and/or hoisin sauce), and you’re ready to serve. Ginger pairs beautifully with carrots and broccoli in a stir-fry. Try using cut chicken, beef, or tofu as your protein. Consider adding the ginger to the oiled pan first for a more mellow flavor. The longer fresh ginger cooks, the less flavorful it’ll be."

      "title": "Add fresh ginger to desserts that call for ground ginger.",
      "content": "Add fresh ginger to desserts that call for ground ginger. Believe it or not, you can add ginger to most cookie, cake, and pie recipes to spice them up. Many autumnal treats call for ground ginger; however, you can replace this powdered spice with fresh, raw ginger for even more flavor. For instance, fresh ginger adds a festive spice to pumpkin pie and banana bread. Fresh ginger is usually more potent than ground, dry ginger, so keep that in mind when baking. For instance, consider reducing the amount of ginger by ¾ or ½ when using fresh. The longer you let the ginger mingle with other flavors, the stronger the taste will be. If you’re making a pumpkin pie , for example, bake the pie the day before you want to serve it for a stronger ginger flavor. Experiment with using raw ginger in baked goods by making fresh ginger root cake, ginger cookies, gingerbread cake, and ginger oatmeal bars. [6] X Research source"
