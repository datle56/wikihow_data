      "content": "Don’t have a super long digital convo before officially asking them out. “When you're online dating, you should be using it as a tool to get offline. Your conversation should not turn into a pen pal conversation,” says professional matchmaker Maria Avgitidis. In fact, Avgitidis recommends acting pretty quickly. “You always want to set up your offline date if you meet someone online within two to three days,” she says. Dating app developer Jeremy Sharvit seconds this. “A lot of people make the mistake of talking too much. I think that dating apps should mainly be about logistics to actually meet up in real life and see if there's a connection there.” “Not everyone is meant for everyone, so I think getting to the point where you can meet someone and see if there's potential there—getting there faster—will increase your feedback loop and increase the likelihood of something more coming of it,” Sharvit explains."

      "content": "Go with a unique activity , rather than a sit-down meal or movie. Many people opt for a traditional dinner or coffee meet-up for the first date, but dating coach Lisa Shield actually cautions against this. “I really think it's a mistake, because it's such an awkward and artificial thing to be sitting face to face with somebody over a cup of coffee. So my best advice is to go out and do an activity,” she explains. According to Shield, your activity doesn’t have to be super elaborate; it should just be something a little more exciting to keep you two engaged. For example, Shield recommends getting your coffee to-go then exploring a different location. “Go for a walk through a cool neighborhood, or go to a museum and walk around. Commenting on the artwork is always fun.” Ultimately, the goal is to do something that “will actually start some natural conversation, rather than just being with someone at a dinner table or a table in Starbucks,” Shield says."

      "content": "Stick to what you know, and don’t experiment too much. You want to look your best on a first date , but you don’t want to wear something too different from your regular style. “A first date is not the place to wear something you just bought that you're not comfortable in yet,” explains Avgitidis. Instead, you'll want to \"wear something that you definitely feel comfortable in, something that makes you feel good and look good.\" Pick an outfit that fits you well, that’s comfortable to sit or stand in for a long period of time, and that’s appropriate for the activity you’re doing. For example, if you’re doing an adventurous or active date, like bike riding on the beach or walking through a farmer’s market, you’ll want to wear shoes and clothes that look good, but that you can also easily move around in."

      "title": "Confidence is a universally attractive trait.",
      "content": "Confidence is a universally attractive trait. Because of this, it’s a good idea to maintain a confident attitude on a first date. One way to do this is to have open, engaged body language, which means standing or sitting up straight, smiling, making eye contact, and staying in a relaxed and comfortable position, rather than squirming or fidgeting. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source There are also a few confidence-boosting exercises you can do before your date: Try standing in a “power pose” for a few minutes before your date. To do this, put your hands on your hips, feet shoulder-width apart, and keep your back straight. It sounds silly, but research actually shows that this can increase your sense of confidence and lower the stress hormone cortisol. [2] X Research source Try visualizing your ideal date beforehand. Positive visualization has been shown to improve performance and decrease stress and anxiety, so imagining yourself acting confident on your date could help you actually feel more confident when it actually happens. [3] X Research source Make a small physical change. According to relationship expert Joshua Pompey, a little stylistic tweak may be enough to boost your confidence levels. “Something as simple as getting some new clothes, looking a little bit more stylish, or getting the right haircut” might do the trick."

      "content": "The quality of your conversation can make or break a first date. It may sound silly, but coming up with a few interesting topics and questions beforehand can actually help you have an amazing convo. “You want to avoid awkward silences, and sometimes nerves may play a part in that. By coming in prepared, you make the first date that much easier,” explains Pompey. Pompey recommends having “some fun stories to tell to fall back on.” For example, maybe you have a crazy vacation experience or hilarious school memory. Stories like these can really come in handy if the convo starts to lag. Funny past dating experiences also make great conversation topics. “It can be a really fun icebreaker that releases the tension and gives you something to talk about. At the same time, if you're telling a story about somebody that was a little wacky, it implies that you're not like that and you're one of the good ones. So it kills two birds with one stone,” Pompey explains."

      "content": "Try not to ask them too many rapid-fire questions in a row. If you do this, the conversation may start to feel like an interrogation. “People will ask how many siblings do you have? Where did you grow up? What do you like to do for fun? Where did you go to college? Going from topic to topic,” explains Shield. Instead, she recommends sticking to one subject for a longer amount of time. “Really great conversation happens when you take one topic and go deeper with it.\" For example, if your date says they grew up in Detroit, you could follow up with questions like, “Wow, tell me about Detroit. What was it like growing up there?” or “I heard that Detroit is really having a Renaissance right now. What do you do for fun out there?” explains Shield."

      "content": "Don’t feel pressured to share your whole life story (or learn theirs). While it’s important to get to know each other on a first date, you don’t want to get into intensely deep or personal topics before you’ve actually built trust with this person. Remember, “The whole purpose of the first date is to go on a second date. It's not to determine if you're going to marry this person,” says Avgitidis. For example, it’s probably a good idea to steer clear of super heavy topics, like past traumas, toxic previous relationships, or major family dysfunction. These things will come up at some point if you end up seriously dating this person, but they’re not necessarily appropriate convo topics for a first date."

      "content": "When your date is talking, actively listen to what they’re saying. Active listening shows your date that you’re fully engaged and interested in getting to know them, rather than just nodding along or zoning out. This helps you make a good impression and deepen your connection, which are both key for securing a second date! [4] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good in Action An initiative by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center promoting science-based practices for a meaningful life Go to source Here are some specific tips: Use engaged body language. Face your date, make eye contact with them, and react to the things they’re saying by nodding and making appropriate facial expressions. Paraphrase what they say back to them. This shows that you’ve been paying attention to what they’re saying. For example, when they finish telling a story, you could say, “It’s so crazy that you ran into your old roommate! I bet you were happy to see them.” Ask thoughtful follow-up questions. This deepens the conversation and shows that you’re actually interested in what they’re talking about. For example, if they say that they just moved from a different city, you could say, “Wow, I’ve always wanted to visit! What were some of your favorite things to do out there?” [5] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good in Action An initiative by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center promoting science-based practices for a meaningful life Go to source"

      "content": "Physical cues can indicate how your date is feeling. For example, “When somebody is looking at you and smiling a lot, making eye contact, and engaging in little touches on the arm, elbow, or on the back while you're talking, those are tremendous signs of interest,” explains Pompey. If you notice a lot of these positive body language cues, the date is likely going pretty well! On the flip side, there are a few negative body language cues that could signal your date is uncomfortable. “People will turn their feet away from you, will start taking steps back, or will start nodding more and not really contributing to the conversation” if things aren’t going well, explains Avgitidis. If you notice that your date is starting to become more closed-off in their body language, give them some space and ask them if everything’s alright. It’s important to respect their boundaries and make sure they feel comfortable."

It can definitely be fun to have a drink or two with your date, but when you go beyond that, your judgment quickly starts to get impaired.

Because of this, it’s best to stick to a 2 drink limit on a first date."

If things like this happen, try to remain upbeat and be flexible about the plan. Let your date know that you don’t mind where you go, and you’re just excited and thankful to be getting to know them. An adaptable and optimistic attitude can save a wide range of first date crises!"

      "content": "Approach your date with an open minded and curious attitude. “Genuinely try to see the best and what you like about them, instead of what you don't like about them,” suggests Avgitidis. For example, maybe your date doesn’t share your taste in music, but they do have a bunch of other qualities that you love, like kindness, passion for their job, and a good relationship with their family. Someone who you wouldn’t usually go for might really surprise you! Of course, if they break one (or more) of your major dating dealbreakers, you don’t need to force yourself to like them. In that case, it would be totally understandable for you to let them know you probably aren’t a match."

[7] X Research source If you act differently than you normally would to try to impress them, you might end up getting into a relationship with somebody you aren’t actually compatible with. So don’t be afraid to share your true personality, express your real opinions, and share your actual interests. If you’re right for each other, your date will love these things about you! And if they don’t, at least you know you aren’t actually compatible in the long run. There are plenty of fish in the sea, and when you figure out that someone is the wrong person, it frees you up to keep looking for the right one."

Being direct and proactive like this saves you both a lot of stress and uncertainty, and it lets them know that you’re truly interested. Here are some example follow-up texts to inspire you: “Just wanted to say I had an awesome time tonight! Would love to grab drinks with you next weekend if you’re free🍷” “It was great to meet you today! We should go see that movie you were talking about sometime 😊” “Really loved getting to know you tonight. Let’s do it again soon!”"

The good news is that the more you push yourself out of your comfort zone and go on dates, the easier it will become. “Dating is a skill just like anything else in life. It does take practice,” says Pompey. “The more you do it, the more comfortable you’ll get, and it’ll just progress from there.”"
