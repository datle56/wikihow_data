      "content": "Play the game on a VAC-secured server. These are server's running Valve anti-cheat measures, which most major servers do. You'll see the VAC symbol in the TF2 server browser. If you don't play on VAC servers, you can't earn free items."

      "content": "Actively play for 30 to 70 minutes. You'll receive an item sometime within this timeframe, with the average being every 50 minutes. This doesn't have to be all at the same time. For example, playing 15 minutes here and there will eventually total up to enough time spent playing."

      "content": "Accept the notification to receive your item. In an effort to combat idling, you'll need to accept the notification that you've received an item before you can start earning your next one. This will add the item to your inventory. The item you receive is completely random, and items have varying chances of appearing based on rarity. You may receive a weapon or equipment drop, or you may receive a locked crate. You'll need to obtain a key to open the crate, either by purchasing one or trading for it."

      "content": "Play 10 hours a week to cap out your limit. While the exact time is unknown, you'll stop earning items after about 10 hours of play. With an average drop time of 50 minutes, this means you'll earn about 12 items a week. The weekly counter resets on Thursday at midnight (00:00) GMT. [1] X Research source If you don't play the full amount, that time is carried over to the next week, up to 20 additional hours. For example, if you don't play for a week, you can earn up to double the items in the next week by playing for around 20 hours."

      "title": "Avoid idling servers.",
      "content": "Avoid idling servers. Because of the changes to the drop system, you'll want to be around to accept your new item so that you can start earning the next one. Try to just earn items regularly by playing the game. You cannot run multiple instances of Team Fortress 2 to try and gain items faster. This will prevent you from earning items at all."
