      "title": "Rotate the peg clockwise to loosen the string until it’s slack.",
      "content": "Rotate the peg clockwise to loosen the string until it’s slack. If you leave your string as is, it could snap or break if you accidentally tighten the peg during your repair. Lay your guitar flat on a stable surface so the pegs face you. Rotate the tuning peg you’re working on clockwise until you don't feel any more tension on the string. [1] X Research source You can also remove the string completely from your guitar if you want, but it’s not required for this fix."

    {
      "title": "Tighten the screw at the end of the peg by turning it clockwise.",
      "content": "Tighten the screw at the end of the peg by turning it clockwise. Locate the screw sticking out from the end of the tuning peg, which controls how easily you can turn it. Hold the tuning peg still with your non-dominant hand and fit a Phillips-head screwdriver into the screw. Rotate the screw clockwise by a quarter turn at a time so you don’t accidentally overtighten the peg. [2] X Research source If your tuning pegs don’t have screws on the end, then this repair won’t work for your guitar. Conversely, if your tuning peg feels too tight, try turning the screw a quarter turn counter-clockwise instead."

    {
      "title": "Turn the peg to test if you feel slight tension.",
      "content": "Turn the peg to test if you feel slight tension. Your tuning peg shouldn’t feel loose, but it also shouldn’t feel too tight. Try spinning the peg by hand to see if there’s a small amount of resistance. As long as the peg stays in place after you turn it and you can still easily make adjustments, then you can move on to the next step. [3] X Research source If the tuning peg still feels too loose, rotate the screw another quarter turn and test it again. Be careful not to overtighten the tuning peg since you could damage the tuner or stock of your guitar."

    {
      "title": "Spin the peg counterclockwise to put tension back on the guitar string.",
      "content": "Spin the peg counterclockwise to put tension back on the guitar string. Hold onto the peg and turn it counter-clockwise so the string tightens up again. As you add tension back to the string, strum it a few times to check the pitch. Use a tuner to ensure your string plays the correct tone for the overall tuning you’re using for your guitar. [4] X Research source If you accidentally tune the string too high, rotate the peg clockwise by a half turn to lower the note. Slowly tune back up to your desired note to help keep your strings tight."

      "title": "Loosen the strings off of the pegs by turning them clockwise.",
      "content": "Loosen the strings off of the pegs by turning them clockwise. Rotate the tuning pegs clockwise so the strings loosen up and have some slack. If you want to save your strings, loosen the pegs enough until you can unwrap and slide the strings out from them. If you plan on installing brand new strings, then you can use a pair of wire cutters to clip the strings before pulling them out. [5] X Research source Avoid trying to unwrap or cut the strings if they still have tension since they could snap up and hurt you."

      "content": "Screw the mounting screws clockwise to ensure they’re tight against the stock. Lay your guitar upside-down on a table so you can see where the tuning pegs mount to the back of the stock, which is the piece at the end of the neck. Locate the small mounting screws along the edges of the pegs to see if any of them feel loose. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to turn the screws clockwise until they’re tight. [6] X Research source Avoid overtightening the screws so you don’t accidentally damage your guitar’s body. You might find the screws on the side of the guitar if that’s where the tuning pegs are mounted."

      "content": "Turn the screw on an open tuner’s gear clockwise if it wobbles. While most modern tuning pegs have covers, some acoustic and classical guitars leave the gears exposed. If you notice the gear shifting back and forth, fit a Phillips-head screwdriver in the screw in the center. Rotate the screw clockwise until it feels tight against the stock. [7] X Research source Adjusting the tightness on the gear will not affect the tension when you turn the peg."

      "content": "Use a wrench to turn the nut on the front of the stock clockwise if it feels loose. Some guitars have a nut on the front that holds the tuning peg in place. Flip your guitar over so it’s face-up and fit a wrench around the peg’s nut. Rotate the nut clockwise by a quarter turn and check if it still feels loose. Keep screwing the nut on tighter until the peg doesn’t move around anymore. [8] X Research source Your guitar might not have nuts on your tuning pegs."

Coat a toothpick with wood glue and push it as far as you can into the mounting screw's hole. Use a utility knife to cut off any excess toothpick still sticking out. Place the tuner back into position and screw it back in. [9] X Research source The toothpick adds extra tooth for the screw to hold onto so it’s less likely to slide out or feel loose."

Turn the peg counter-clockwise so the string wraps around it above the hole. Guide the string underneath the wrapped section and turn the peg another full rotation. Tune the string to the correct note and trim off any excess string with a pair of wire cutters.

If you plan on reusing the strings, keep turning the peg until you can easily pull the strings out from the tuning pegs’ holes. If you plan on using new strings, use a pair of wire cutters to slice through the strings before pulling them out. [11] X Research source You can leave the strings attached to the bottom of your guitar if you don’t want to remove them completely. That way, they’re easier to reinstall."

[12] X Research source You may also need to loosen nuts on the front of the peg if your guitar has them.

Turn the peg while you’re working to help spread the WD-40 throughout the whole mechanism. [14] X Research source If your peg still doesn’t move very easily, fill a small dish with some naphtha, which is a type of oil, and let the tuning peg soak for about a minute to help loosen up the gunk. [15] X Research source If you’re working with a tuning peg with an enclosed gear, then use a pipette to spray the WD-40 or naphtha into the opening at the bottom of the peg. If you use naphtha, work in a well-ventilated area with protective gloves. Naphtha can cause nose, throat, and skin irritation and is extremely flammable. [16] X Research source"

Tightening the screws too tight could damage your guitar, so stop as soon as you feel slight tension. [25] X Research source If your tuning peg has a nut on the front, tighten it by hand before giving it a few more turns with a wrench. If the screw holes don’t line up on the guitar and tuning peg, hold the tuning peg in position. Then use a drill with a bit one size smaller than the screw to make a pilot hole for the screw in the back of your guitar.
