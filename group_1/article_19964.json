      "content": "Know how to identify a tick and its preferred environment. Ticks enjoy tall grass and low shrubs. Some ticks are very small— almost flea sized—while others are much larger. Ticks are generally black or brown and oval in shape. Like spiders and scorpions, they belong to the group of arthropods called arachnids, and they have eight legs."

      "content": "Gather the correct tools before you look for ticks. You will need a pair of fine-tipped tweezers and a jar filled with alcohol. You will also want to have some disinfectant around such as a chlorhexidine solution (Nolvasan) or povidine iodine solution (Betadine) to clean the wound after removing the tick from your pet. If you live in an area where ticks are common, you may also want to get a device designed to remove ticks. These clever instruments looks like a spoon with a notch cut into the side and works great to remove ticks off people and pets. Though a common belief, you cannot actually kill ticks by flushing them down the toilet. The only way you can properly kill them is to put them in alcohol or spray them with flea and tick spray.

You should check your canine friend for ticks whenever he has been somewhere that is known to have ticks (hiking trails, yards with tall grass, etc.) You should feel for small bumps with your hands and look for dark, circular bumps with your eyes. Begin your search on the top of your dog's back and move down each side towards his chest and belly. Be sure to search in and around his:: Legs Between his toes and pads of his feet Under his legs (armpits), belly, chest, and tail On top of, inside, and under the ears Face and on the crown of the head Chin The front of the neck"

If you have a hard time going through your pet’s hair, you might want to enlist the help of a fine-toothed comb to search your dog for ticks. If that doesn’t seem to work, you can set a blowdryer on cool and use that to part your dog’s hair. Just be aware that some dogs are afraid of hairdryers. You should use these instruments in addition to your hands since feeling the bumps is still the best method."

Again, the chemicals will kill the ticks and make them easier to remove. If your pet is too young to use a shampoo or dip safely, don’t use the product. Proceed instead with manual removal of the ticks. Do NOT use on cats unless the product specifically states that it is safe for cats."

      "content": "Spray the tick with flea and tick spray. Carefully follow the directions on the bottle and wait for the chemicals to kill the tick. Do not overdo it. You don’t want to poison your pet. The chemicals will cause the tick to release its bite and fall off or at least make it easier to remove manually. As with shampoos, many sprays should be avoided on puppies. Read and follow the directions carefully. Some of the most effective sprays contain an ingredient called “fipronil.” This type of spray kills the tick, but it will not kill it instantly. If you are squeamish about removing the tick, then you can spray the tick and then wait 24 hours. By the next day, the tick will either have fallen off your dog or it will be easy to pluck off with tweezers."

      "title": "Use your tweezers to remove the tick.",
      "content": "Use your tweezers to remove the tick. Grab the tick by the head and mouth area, right where they have entered the skin. It is very important that you grab the tick by the head rather than the body. If you grab the tick by the body, the body will break off, leaving the head stuck in your dog’s skin. This can cause irritation and infection. [2] X Research source Use a quick pulling motion to remove the tick. This will avoid giving the tick any warning, which may result in the tick grabbing on tighter or vomiting into your dog’s bloodstream. You can also use a special tick hook to pull off the tick, which gets as close to your dog’s skin as possible. Do not use your fingers to remove the tick. If you use your fingers, you could squeeze the tick’s body and facilitate disease transfer to your pet. Using the special tick removing device or carefully using tweezers is highly recommended. If the tick does break off, your veterinarian will need to check the tick body parts left in the skin. Your veterinarian will determine whether there is a need to remove the leftover parts or not."

After removing ticks, make an appointment with the vet to ensure that nothing has been transmitted to your pet. It can be helpful to your vet if you save a few of the dead ticks when you go to dispose of them. Place them in a plastic bag and bring them to the vet. By identifying the type of tick(s), your vet will have an easier time assessing the potential for disease transmission."

Apply an effective and safe tick and flea control product to your dog. There are spot-on products, oral products, and collars to help manage ticks on your dog. Consult with your vet before administering a new medication. Other ways to keep your dog and home tick free include: Keeping your grass and weeds trimmed to below ankle height. Securing your trash cans with strong lids and take out any rock piles and brushy cover. This helps keep away rodents that may carry ticks. Staying on the trails when hiking with your pet and making sure that your pet remains with you. Avoid wooded areas and long grasses where ticks are common. If your dog runs off the trail (as they often do), make sure to check him for ticks when you get home."
