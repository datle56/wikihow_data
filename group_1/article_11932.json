By reassuring them that you can empathize with how they feel, they can feel more at ease with you, which can help them feel more secure in the relationship and shed some of their avoidant qualities. [2] X Research source You might say something like: “I know that your personal independence is important to you, and I won’t put too much pressure on you to make a commitment to me.” “I realize that you need your personal space, and I just want to say that I’m here for you when you want to spend more time together.” “I know this relationship can feel stressful for you.

[3] X Research source When your partner is taking some space for themselves, do your best not to text or call them too frequently. This can make them feel stifled. Your partner might also appreciate you giving them the opportunity to take some space. Tell them something like, “I love spending time with you, and would love to keep hanging out. But if you want to go back home, I understand.”"

When talking to someone with an avoidant attachment style, try your best to not place too much blame on them, or speak to them with accusatory language. Often, their first response might be to withdraw from you, which can hurt your relationship. Try using “I-statements” like: [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Instead of saying, “You’re selfish,” say, “I feel like my needs sometimes aren’t being met.” Instead of saying, “You don’t care about me,” say, “I feel like I want to be a higher priority in your life.” Instead of saying, “You treat me terribly,” say, “I feel hurt and sad when you cancel plans at the last minute.”"

Unlike people with an anxious attachment style, avoidant partners tend to not expect perfection in any relationship. They understand that good relationships are based on compromise, and working out these compromises can key your relationship strong.

How about if we meet twice a week instead?” “I realize that it’s tough for you to open up with me about your stress. Why don’t we spend time doing something that you enjoy, and then we talk about what’s on your mind this evening?” “I know that you love taking trips by yourself on the weekends. Why don’t we spend every other weekend together, so that you can still have some time to yourself?”"
