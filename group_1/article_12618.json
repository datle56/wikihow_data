The stages are: [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Stage 1, where the cancer is just within the lining of your rectum. Stage 2, where the cancer has spread to the surface covering your rectum or nearby organs. Stage 3, where the cancer has spread into your lymph nodes.
