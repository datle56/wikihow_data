      "content": "Open the Camera app and look around a darkened room. To check for a camera, make sure the room is as dark as possible, then use either the front or back camera on your phone to scan for odd lights. Many cameras that see in low lighting often use IR (infrared) light that the human eye can't detect, but it shows up as purple or light white lights on your phone's camera. [4] X Research source However, not all phones can detect IR, so a quick internet search will help you determine if yours can. Instead of searching online, you can also use a TV remote (or any remote that uses IR, like an AC remote) to see if your phone's camera picks up IR. [5] X Research source Simply open the camera app, make sure your environment is dark, aim it at the remote, then turn on the remote or press buttons to see if your phone's camera detects a small light. If you tried it with the camera on the back of your phone and didn't see a light, try again with the camera on the front of your phone. You need to have a dark environment to trigger the IR sensor on your phone, if there is one."

      "content": "Use a 3rd party app to scan for EM fields. Most hidden cameras emit some sort of electromagnetic energy since they are using power, so there are third-party scanners that offer to look for this energy to find cameras. Cameras that are plugged in, as well as those with batteries, emit this energy that can be scanned and traced to find the camera's location. There are plenty of apps available on both the Google Play Store and App Store for hidden camera finders. You can get Hidden Camera Detector for free on Android, but Hidden Spy Camera Detector has a small cost associated with it. Still, it has a lot of features bundled in, so you can find hidden cameras in multiple ways."

Just think of nanny cams that look like teddy bears or plushies. If you find a hidden camera, cover it with a blanket or unplug it (if it's wired)."

      "content": "Check your mirrors. Place the tip of your finger on the mirror, then check to see if there's a visible gap between them. If there is a gap, then it's a regular mirror. If, however, your finger appears tip-to-tip with its reflection, then you're most likely looking at a two-way mirror, where a camera could hide . Alternatively, knock on the mirror. A two-way mirror will have a hollow sound."
