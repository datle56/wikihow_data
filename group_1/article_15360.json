      "content": "Warm the tortillas in the microwave for 10-15 seconds. Take the tortillas out of the plastic wrap or bag and place them on a microwavable plate. Heating up the tortillas makes them easier to fold when making the fajitas. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Spread the soft fillings down the middle of the tortilla.",
      "content": "Spread the soft fillings down the middle of the tortilla. Soft fillings include things like beans, guacamole, or sour cream. Use a spoon to spread the soft filling, spreading it down the middle of the tortilla. [2] X Research source Keep the filling away from the edge of the tortilla. Adding the filling first will act as an adhesive for the other toppings to keep your fajita together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add equal amounts of meat and veggies on top of the soft fillings.",
      "content": "Add equal amounts of meat and veggies on top of the soft fillings. Choose a meat such as beef, chicken, or seafood, slicing it up into bite-size pieces with a sharp knife. Add vegetables like peppers and onions, similarly sliced, to the fajita as well. [3] X Research source Adding equal amounts of meat and veggies will create the best flavor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Top your fajita off with extra toppings or garnishes.",
      "content": "Top your fajita off with extra toppings or garnishes. This includes ingredients like shredded cheese or salsa. Add whichever other ingredients you’d like to your fajita until it's finished. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid overstuffing the tortillas.",
      "content": "Avoid overstuffing the tortillas. If you put too many ingredients in the tortilla, your fajita will be difficult to eat and won’t be able to contain all of the food properly. Try to make sure that you can fold each side of the tortilla over one another when adding ingredients. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull up the bottom edge of the tortilla to act as a barrier.",
      "content": "Pull up the bottom edge of the tortilla to act as a barrier. Once your fajita has all of its ingredients, pull the edge at the tortilla's end upwards roughly 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm). This will keep your toppings from spilling out of the bottom as you go to eat the fajita. [6] X Research source If you’d rather eat your fajita completely open, you don’t have to fold up the bottom of the tortilla."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold both edges of the tortilla to the center.",
      "content": "Fold both edges of the tortilla to the center. Hold the bottom fold in place and fold over the 2 sides of the tortilla so that they overlap each other in the middle. Depending on how many ingredients are in your fajita, the edges may overlap a lot or very little. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the fajita over so the tortilla doesn't come undone.",
      "content": "Flip the fajita over so the tortilla doesn't come undone. This is especially helpful if you have lots of ingredients in your fajita. As you pick up the fajita to eat it and put it back down, continue placing it so that the folded edges are touching the plate. You can also use a toothpick to keep the tortilla in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow everyone to choose their fajita ingredients.",
      "content": "Allow everyone to choose their fajita ingredients. This ensures that each person gets to make a fajita that is to their liking. Place each ingredient in its own container and let each person start with a tortilla on their plate so that they can choose which ingredients will go on their fajita. Create a fajita bar by setting up all of the ingredients and toppings in a line on the counter so that everyone can easily make their fajitas."

    {
      "title": "Serve a variety of toppings and sauces to add flavor to the fajitas.",
      "content": "Serve a variety of toppings and sauces to add flavor to the fajitas. Toppings for your fajitas might include grilled onions, bell peppers, shredded Mexican cheese, sour cream, guacamole, or salsa. Add a fajita seasoning, hot sauce, or soy sauce for even more flavor. [8] X Research source Some people also enjoy slices of avocado, lime wedges, chopped cilantro, tomatoes, shredded lettuce, or jalapeños on their fajitas. Choose to serve as many or as little toppings as you'd like, though a variety of toppings will make the fajitas even tastier."

      "title": "Choose side dishes to eat with the fajitas, if desired.",
      "content": "Choose side dishes to eat with the fajitas, if desired. There are several sides that go well with fajitas—a popular one is beans and rice. You might also consider serving guacamole salad or corn on the cob. Cilantro lime rice or black bean soup are other popular options."

    {
      "title": "Pick up the fajita and bite into the open end.",
      "content": "Pick up the fajita and bite into the open end. When you’re ready to eat, hold the fajita with one or two hands, using your pinkies to keep the bottom fold of the tortilla in place. Eat your fajita normally, ending your last bite with the folded up end. [9] X Research source Use a fork to eat any ingredients that fall onto the plate."
