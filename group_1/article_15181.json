      "title": "Ask a professional's advice at a salon.",
      "content": "Ask a professional's advice at a salon. Sometimes, you can remove dye at home using a kit or home remedy. Other times, it is best to get it done professionally at a salon. A professional hair dresser or stylist will be able to evaluate your hair and tell you whether you can remove the color yourself or if it would be better for a stylist to do it for you with professional supplies. [1] X Research source For example, if you have fragile hair and no experience, but your stylist specializes in this, it would be a good idea to let your stylist do it for you. Some stylists will tell you to get it done professionally in order to get more business. Don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion."

      "title": "Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to fade the dye.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to fade the dye. The less dye you have to work with, the easier the color removal process will be, regardless of whether you do it yourself or have it done professionally. If you can't find a clarifying shampoo, consider using something that contains sulfates instead. [2] X Research source Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents known to fade hair dye. They may make your hair feel dry afterwards, so be sure to follow up with a sulfate-free conditioner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your hair with hot water to help further fade the dye.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with hot water to help further fade the dye. You should still do this along with the clarifying shampoo. There is no need to burn yourself, however; just use the warmest temperature you can stand. [3] X Research source Hot water causes the hair cuticles to open up and become more porous. This allows the dye to come out to some extent. This may turn your hair frizzy. Consider using a good conditioner and rinsing with cool water afterwards."

      "title": "Wear a deep conditioning mask overnight, then rinse it out.",
      "content": "Wear a deep conditioning mask overnight, then rinse it out. Not only is this wonderful for your hair, but it can help the dye fade even sooner. Apply a deep conditioning mask to your hair, then cover your hair with a shower cap. Wrap your head with a towel, then leave it on overnight. Rinse the deep conditioner out the next morning. [4] X Research source Rinsing the deep conditioner mask out the following morning is key as it will take some of the dye with it. [5] X Research source Be aware that this won't lighten the dye or make it fade completely. It will simply speed the process up and make the removal process easier. Avoid leaving a protein mask on overnight because this can make your hair brittle and lead to breakage. Make sure that the mask is labeled as “moisturizing” or “hydrating,” not “strengthening.”"

      "title": "Give the dye a few weeks to fade a little on its own.",
      "content": "Give the dye a few weeks to fade a little on its own. You will need to wash your hair a few times with hot water and clarifying shampoo before you notice a difference. Spending time outside in the sun may also help fade the dye naturally. Don't do it all in one day, however; spread it out over a week or so. [6] X Research source Doing everything in one day is a bad idea because it will ruin your hair and make it turn dry, frizzy, and brittle. Again, this won't remove the dye completely. It will just make it faster and easier to remove."

      "title": "Get the color removed professionally at a salon, if needed.",
      "content": "Get the color removed professionally at a salon, if needed. Salons have special color removing products that you can't get in a store. The formula changes depending on what color you are starting out with and what color you want to get. It also changes depending on your hair type and the type of dye you used: permanent, semi-permanent, etc. [7] X Research source In some cases, a color remover won't be enough and your stylist will need to use bleach. This can get very expensive, and can cost you anywhere between $200 and $600."

      "title": "Get a color remover kit if you want to do it yourself.",
      "content": "Get a color remover kit if you want to do it yourself. Be aware that a $15 at-home kit won't have the same quality as a $200 process done at a professional salon. There is also a chance that you may damage your hair. You can find these kits in well-stocked beauty supply stores. Check the ingredient label to ensure that it does not contain bleach. Be aware that some chemicals may be just as damaging to your hair as bleach is; in some cases they may be more damaging. Most color removers won't remove black dye completely. This means you may not be able to dye your hair a light, strawberry red after; you may have to settle for a darker shade. Read the reviews. Some color removers may remove the color just fine, but when you go to dye your hair, it may not come out the right color. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the color remover according to instructions, then rinse it out. Each brand is a little different, but in most cases, you will need to mix 2 products together. Apply the product to your hair, rub it in thoroughly, and leave it on for the recommended time before rinsing it out. Again, how long you leave the remover in depends on the brand; it could be 20 minutes, or it could be 60 minutes. Wrapping your hair in plastic and applying heat can be helpful for breaking up the dye, but only if the product you are using recommends doing this. Check the package for any indications about using heat."

      "title": "Repeat the process, if needed.",
      "content": "Repeat the process, if needed. Sometimes, a single treatment is not enough and your hair re-oxidizes. If that happens, and if your hair doesn't feel dry or brittle, simply repeat the color removal process. This is best done immediately after the first treatment. If you need to do a third treatment, wait until the following day. [9] X Research source A color remover will not bleach your hair, so don't expect your hair to turn blond. If your hair is naturally blond, that the color remover may not take the dye out completely. You may end up with dark blond or light brown hair."

Go to sleep, then rinse the mask out the following morning. Allow your hair to air dry. [10] X Research source Avoid using a hair dryer, as it can damage your hair. If you must use a hair dryer, apply a heat protectant, and use a low-heat setting."

      "content": "Wait a few days or weeks, depending on how healthy your hair feels. While hair dye is not as harsh as other treatments (i.e. bleaching), it is still damaging to your hair. If your hair feels dry or brittle after the color removal process, it would be a good idea to wait a few days or weeks. When your hair feels strong again, you can dye it without damaging it as much."

If this is the shade of red that you are going for, you are done and don't need to dye your hair! If this is not the shade that you are doing for, then read on to learn how. [12] X Research source Be aware that the brassy color may affect the final outcome. It will make the final color look brighter with golden undertones. Even if the color is close to what you want to achieve, you may still want to cover it with a semi-permanent gloss that is a shade or two lighter than your hair color."

      "content": "Select a dye 1 to 2 shades lighter than your desired color. Stripping the color from your hair makes it more susceptible to hair dyes, which may yield a darker result than you want. To avoid going too dark, choose a shade of dye that is 1 to 2 shades lighter than the color you want to achieve."

Section off your hair, then apply the dye starting from the roots. Allow the dye to sit on your hair for the time recommended, typically 20 to 30 minutes, then rinse it out with cool water. [13] X Research source Do not use hot water to rinse the dye out, or you risk fading it. Use only the conditioner included with the dye kit. If you must use shampoo, use a color-safe, sulfate-free shampoo. However, if you are using a permanent color, then you will need to shampoo your hair after rinsing out the dye to prevent the dye from getting darker."
