      "content": "Yes, flexing can build muscle, but not very effectively. According to studies, simply flexing your muscles can, in fact, make them bigger, but not by a dramatic amount. One study found that people assigned to a four-week flex training program saw a 4% increase in muscle size which, hey, isn’t nothing, but 4% also isn’t the most impressive number. [1] X Research source Personal trainer Jesse Pichardo tells us if you only flexed during training, you “wouldn’t build any strength.” Flexing is what’s known as an isometric exercise , meaning it strains the muscles, but doesn’t move them. For this reason, it can improve your strength in that one position, but isn't super effective for improving overall strength. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For that reason, flexing also won’t burn fat or make your abs look better , at least, not when you're not flexing. As an exercise, it builds a little muscle, but doesn’t drop weight, like cardio does."

This also makes isometric exercises a good, low-intensity workout for people who want to maintain a physique without losing or gaining more muscle."

Isometric exercises like flexing improve strength in certain positions, like while holding a weight or keeping your body upright during an exercise. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Though it doesn’t build a whole lot of muscle, it helps your body and core stabilize, which primes you for exercises that do build muscle. For example, flexing might not help you bench press those huge amounts of weight, but it will improve your control and grip on the bar."

      "content": "Muscles grow by being torn and repaired on a microscopic level. “To build strength and muscle you need to overload the muscle,” Pichardo tells us. When you overload the muscle, you make microscopic tears in the muscle fibers, which your body then repairs with new tissue, which makes them grow and become stronger. [13] X Research source When the fibers tear, lactic acid acts as a signal for your body to repair them, like construction cones. Then, your muscle fibers enlarge in a process known as “hypertrophy.” During hypertrophy, “satellite cells” that surround your muscles fuse, grow, and divide, becoming new and thicker muscle fibers, making your muscles bigger and stronger. That’s why simply flexing doesn’t build much muscle —you’re not overloading your muscles by very much, so you’re not tearing them very much, so they’re not being repaired and reinforced very much."

[14] X Research source When you do resistance training, find your limits gradually by starting with a small amount of weight, and add weight in small increments, until you’re straining but not struggling. Then, keep adding small amounts of weight to help your body push past its limits. Generally, aim to work out each major muscle group (chest, abs, shoulders, arms, legs, hips, back) 2 or more times each week.
