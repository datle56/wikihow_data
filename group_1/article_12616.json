      "title": "Look for your apps.",
      "content": "Look for your apps. If almost all of your apps are missing from your home screen, then you probably have ransomware on your iOS device. Note, however, if your device is connected to an organization, they can manage your device remotely and hide all the apps except those related to your work at the company."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check your settings for a management profile.",
      "content": "Check your settings for a management profile. Go to Settings > General > Profiles and Device Management and look for any unknown management profiles. Most iOS devices cannot get ransomware. Ransomware is usually installed as an unremovable management profile from the Internet, sideloaded from an infected computer, or downloaded as the result of jailbreaking your iOS device."

      "title": "Watch out for push notifications from unknown apps.",
      "content": "Watch out for push notifications from unknown apps. If your phone or tablet is infected, you’ll see a notification from an app that demands payment to give you back your data or security. These pop-ups may appear out of the blue, or they may occur when doing a specific action (like pressing the Home button)."

    {
      "title": "Search for the message online.",
      "content": "Search for the message online. Ransomware hold your data for ransom until you pay up. If you don’t pay up, data in your phone or tablet will become encrypted, making it inaccessible. Try searching for the message you see in a search engine like Google to find out if other people have had success freeing their data."

    {
      "title": "Do not pay to get your data back.",
      "content": "Do not pay to get your data back. Even if you pay, there’s no guarantee the ransomware will be removed. In fact, it may just reactivate. Instead, find a way to remove the ransomware from your iPhone or iPad, and be prudent in trying to prevent it in the future."

    {
      "title": "Only install apps from the App Store.",
      "content": "Only install apps from the App Store. This is especially important if you’ve jailbroken your iPhone or iPad. Apps from the App Store are reviewed and vetted, so they should be safe for the most part. Occasionally some rogue app may appear on the App Store. Apple usually catches these pretty quickly. Just be sure to read app reviews and stick to apps you’ve heard of."

Tap on \"Remove Profile\" at the bottom of the screen, then enter your passcode. Some profiles cannot be removed, in which case, you will have to reinstall iOS."
    },
    {
      "title": "Back up your device.",
      "content": "Back up your device. Unless if you are jailbroken or on an outdated version of iOS, the most ransomware can do is hide your apps or control settings on your device, not encrypt your data. You will be able to restore your device from backup after all is done."
