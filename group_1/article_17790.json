You should apply it when your hair is wet because it allows you to evenly spread the serum around your hair without creating clumps. Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb after applying.

      "title": "Blow-dry your hair.",
      "content": "Blow-dry your hair. You want your hair to be as dry as possible when straightening. Not only will this allow your flat iron to work better, it will also prevent your hair from being shocked by the heat and breaking off. [6] X Research source Point the hair dryer downward with the flow of your hair while blow-drying. This downward motion away from your roots encourages your hair to dry straight. It also smooths down your hair and reduces the risk of frizz. Set your hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. If you have particularly frizzy hair, drying your hair on a lower heat setting for a longer period of time will prevent your hair from puffing up as you dry it."

      "title": "Plug in your iron and flick the switch to \"on.\"",
      "content": "Plug in your iron and flick the switch to \"on.\" There will also be a numbered heat setting near the \"on\" switch that you can adjust to your desired heat level. The thicker and frizzier your hair, the higher the numbered setting should be. If your hair is particularly thin and brittle make sure to set your straightener to the lowest number to avoid damaging your hair."

      "title": "Separate your hair into several sections.",
      "content": "Separate your hair into several sections. The number of sections will depend on the thickness of your hair. The key is to make sections one to two inches thick so that they can easily pass through the straightener. [7] X Research source Pin or clip the sections you are not using out of the way as you straighten each individual section. An easy way to do this is to pin all of the sections that you are not using on the top of your head or behind your shoulders. Then take each individual section in front of your shoulder to straighten it."

      "title": "Place the straightener as close to the roots as possible.",
      "content": "Place the straightener as close to the roots as possible. However, don't burn yourself. This will usually mean that your straightener will start about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your scalp if your hair is straight. For curly or textured hair, you should get the flat iron closer than 1 inch (2.5 cm) so that your roots won't remain curly. [8] X Research source Go slowly so that you don't burn yourself."

      "title": "Clamp the iron down.",
      "content": "Clamp the iron down. The heated sides should touch, with your hair resting between them. Be sure not to clamp too firmly, as this will create a ridge in the top of the hair section where you start straightening. Additionally, be sure not to hold the flat iron in the same spot for too long, as doing so will also cause a ridge to form in your hair. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Run the flat iron down the length of your section of hair.",
      "content": "Run the flat iron down the length of your section of hair. Your motion should be a fluid and steady sweep from the roots to the ends. The most important part of this technique is that you don't hold the straightener in any one place for too long. Doing so can damage your hair and create undesirable folds. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Run the straightener over the section up to 2-3 times.",
      "content": "Run the straightener over the section up to 2-3 times. Stop as soon as your hair is straight, but don't do more than 3 passes, as this will damage your hair. Depending on the thickness of your hair, you may only have to do this once, or you may have to run the straightener over a section of hair several times. [11] X Research source Smaller sections of hair will make it easier to get your hair straight with fewer passes. Keep your sections to smaller than .5 inches (1.3 cm). The strength of your flat iron will also determine how many times you will have to run over a particular section of hair. The lower the heating setting on the flat iron, the more times you will have to run your straightener over a particular section of hair. Set your temperature at about 300 degrees. If you have textured or curly hair, you may have to set it higher. Don't be alarmed if you see steam rising from the flat iron. Steam occurs as a result of the hot ceramic making contact with any leftover moisture in your hair. If you start to smell burning hair, however, turn down the heat setting on the flat iron immediately."

      "title": "Move the straightened piece out of the way and unclip a new section of hair.",
      "content": "Move the straightened piece out of the way and unclip a new section of hair. It is generally easiest to move around your head from one side to the other rather than taking random chunks so that you can easily separate the straightened chunks from the non-straightened ones. You may need to brush each section before straightening it if it got tangled while pinned. If your hair is prone to frizz, apply a hairspray or setting serum to each section immediately after you straighten it. Avoid getting any product on sections of hair that you have not straightened yet. The product can negatively interfere with the straightening process, causing damage to your hair or to your flat iron."
