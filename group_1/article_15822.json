[1] X Research source It's important to express your feelings as personally as possible so that your partner can get the closure that they need. Avoid breaking with a text message or using online messaging. These forms of communication are much less personal than a phone call or a video chat, and your partner may not be able to get the closure that they need. If you've been with someone for a long time, it may seem callous and anti-climactic to break up over text. Avoid posting the breakup publicly on social media like Twitter or Facebook. This may come across as passive-aggressive, and your partner may retaliate publicly."

      "content": "Tell your partner that you need to talk. Set a time and a medium for the conversation. This will prepare them for a serious conversation, and it will give you impetus to actually go through with the break-up. For example, send a message: \"Are you around for a phone call this evening at eight? There's something that I need to talk to you about.\" If you have a regularly-scheduled \"Skype date\" or evening phone call, consider breaking the news during this time. \"We need to talk\" is near-universal code for \"There's something wrong with this relationship.\" If you prime your partner with these words before the break-up conversation, they may go into the call with an inkling of what is to come. If you have been having trouble in your relationship for a while, they may even expect it."

For example: \"I can't handle the distance any more. It's eating me up and splitting me apart inside. You're a wonderful person, and I hope that you find someone who can give you what you need--but I can't be that person.\" For example: \"I don't see us winding up in the same city within the near future, and I don't want to keep pouring time and energy into something that isn't going anywhere.\""

[3] X Research source It's generally best to break up in person, if you can, so that your partner can get the closure that they need. Show respect for the time and energy that you have both poured into this relationship. This can be one of the hardest parts about ending a long-distance relationship. You may feel obligated to break up in person, but you have trained yourself to make the most of your time together. These visits can become a sort of fantasy--a vacation from everyday life--and it is difficult to break the pattern. If you have plans to visit your partner soon, then take advantage of this visit. If you don't have anything planned, then consider going to visit them as soon as you can. You don't need to make up a reason, but it also may not be wise to inform your partner that you are coming to break up with them. Just go. If you are holding on to any of your partner's possessions--say, their sweater, or their favorite book--this is a perfect opportunity to return them. Bring these things with you when you go. Try to break up while you're visiting their town, rather than while they are visiting yours. This will make it easier for you to leave."

Try not to leave any of your possessions in your soon-to-be-ex's home, where it may be awkward to retrieve them.

If you can maintain clear boundaries, feel free to do so--but be careful of letting a relationship linger on. Make sure that your ex understands this.

Absorb what your ex has to say, but do not let it sway you. Remember why you initiated the break-up in the first place.
