      "content": "Chop the carrot into 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) pieces. Peel the carrot with a knife and cut off the tips about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) out on each side. Cut the carrot into circles about 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) wide for easier storage convenience and preservation. [1] X Research source You can freeze carrots whole and unpeeled as well. Just chop off the greens on top. However, your carrots may stay fresher cut into small pieces. If you notice any residual dirt on the carrots, wash it away over a sink before chopping."

      "title": "Place the chopped carrots in a sealable bag or airtight container.",
      "content": "Place the chopped carrots in a sealable bag or airtight container. Fill a sealable plastic bag or airtight container with carrots and place a straw in the middle. If possible, fill the bag or container to 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) below the top to allow for expansion. Suck out as much air as possible with the straw and, after taking the straw out, seal the container shut. The less air left inside the container, the more preserved they'll stay while frozen. Using a vacuum sealer to close the bags is an alternate, equally efficient way to preserve your carrots."

      "title": "Set the carrots in the freezer on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Set the carrots in the freezer on a flat surface. Mark the container with the date so you know how long it's been since you sealed them. Place the carrots on a flat surface in your freezer, preferably near the back, and leave them inside until you're ready to use them. [2] X Research source Avoid taking the carrots out until you cook them, as freezing and refreezing vegetables can diminish their flavor over time."

      "content": "Keep the carrots in the freezer for up to 10-12 months. Although frozen, unblanched carrots can stay preserved for 10-12 months, their taste and texture may change over time. If possible, try to use the carrots within 1-2 months for the best flavor. [3] X Research source Frozen carrots, blanched and unblanched, can last longer than 10-12 months but are more likely to develop freezer burn."

      "title": "Wash the carrot over your sink before cutting.",
      "content": "Wash the carrot over your sink before cutting. Place the carrot over your sink and turn on the water. Use your hands to rub off any dirt, particularly if your carrots came from your garden. [4] X Research source Unlike chopping carrots, you do not have to peel them beforehand."

      "content": "Remove the carrot's top and bottom. Using a knife, cut off both tips from your carrot about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) out. Discard the top and bottom after cutting them off, as you will not need to shred them with the rest of your carrot. [5] X Research source"

Turn the food processor on and blend until all of the carrot pieces are shredded. [6] X Research source If your blender has a food processor setting, you can use it as an alternative. You can also hand grate the carrots as an alternative by positioning a carrot at the top of the grater and repeatedly moving it down the side until you completely shred it. [7] X Research source"

Flatten the bag as much as you can with your hands, then roll the rest of the air out with a rolling pin. When you've finished flattening out the air, set the bag in the freezer until you're ready to thaw them. [8] X Research source Mark the container with the date and time so you know when it expires."

      "content": "Steam, microwave, boil, or bake your carrots. Carrots blend best after they've been softened through cooking. Cook your carrots to help them blend easier as you puree them. [9] X Research source Pureeing carrots before freezing preserves their taste best and is ideal for making soups, baked goods, and baby food. Let the cooked carrots cool before pureeing them in the blender."

[11] X Research source If you want a thick puree, blend the carrots without adding any liquids. To preserve the carrots' overall taste, add the water you used to boil or steam the carrots.

Mark the container with the date so you know when you packaged it and when it will expire.
