      "title": "Leave the egg alone if possible.",
      "content": "Leave the egg alone if possible. In many places, it's illegal to remove bird eggs from their natural habitat. In the U.S., for example, according to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, it is illegal to take or possess any part, nest, or egg of a wild bird species. You could receive up to six months of jail time and a fine of up to $15,000. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Replace the egg.",
      "content": "Replace the egg. If you come across a wild bird egg and see a nest nearby that’s empty or contains similar looking eggs, you could try to return the egg to its nest. If you do not see a nest, do not go looking for one, and never assume that an egg is abandoned. Some birds nest on the ground. The Killdeer, for instance, prefers to nest on gravel! [2] X Research source Never take an egg from a nest."

      "title": "Find a wildlife rehabilitator.",
      "content": "Find a wildlife rehabilitator. Wildlife rehabilitators are licensed to care for injured or orphaned wild animals. If you find wild bird eggs and suspect that something’s wrong, contact your local wildlife agency or search online for a licensed rehabilitator. Do not take the egg(s) to a rehabilitator. Instead, be prepared to direct the rehabilitator to the egg(s). Be aware that a rehabilitator may only be interested in the egg(s) of endangered species."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify the species.",
      "content": "Identify the species. If you choose to care for a wild bird egg, you will need to know the species’ incubation period and what to feed the nestling should the egg hatch. Fortunately, wild bird eggs are relatively easy to identify."
    },
    {
      "title": "Acquire an incubator.",
      "content": "Acquire an incubator. If you don’t already have one, buy an electronic incubator with adjustable settings and a built-in fan. The incubation protocols for wild bird eggs are mostly unknown, so you will have to follow the protocol for domestic poultry eggs. Set up the incubator in an area free from direct sunlight and drafts. Before setting the wild bird egg(s), run the incubator for a couple of hours with water in the incubator’s pan. This will stabilize the incubator’s internal atmosphere."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be consistent.",
      "content": "Be consistent. Successful incubation depends on four factors: temperature, humidity, ventilation, and turning. Temperature is the most important factor, and you should maintain a constant temperature of 100 °F (37.8 °C) for the duration of the incubation. Keep the incubator’s pan full. Relative humidity within the incubator should be around 60 percent. Maintain air flow, and rotate the egg(s) a half turn at least three times per day. This ensures that the egg is warmed evenly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t be disappointed.",
      "content": "Don’t be disappointed. Most wild bird eggs that you find will never hatch. Incubation could have been interrupted, or the egg’s inner membrane could have been damaged. In each case, the embryo dies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be prepared.",
      "content": "Be prepared. If the incubation is successful, you will need to feed the nestling every fifteen to twenty minutes from sunrise to sunset for about two weeks. Wild bird diets vary a great deal from species to species, so make sure you have the right kinds of food on hand.
