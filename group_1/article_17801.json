      "content": "Decide whether you want straight fletchings, off-set fletchings, or helical fletchings and adjust your jig accordingly. Straight fletchings are those which sit on a straight line along the arrow shaft. Off-set or helical fletchings grasp the shaft at an angle or twist along the shaft, introducing torque in the arrow's flight for increased range."
