If you happen to have beets that have the leaves attached, make sure they are dark green in color, small, and crisp to the touch. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the roots of the beet and remove the greens. Although a knife can be used to cut the roots and greens, using a pair of scissors is easier. In some cases, if you have purchased from a grocery store or a farmer’s market, the greens and part of the roots may have already been removed. [2] X Research source When trimming the beets, leave at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the roots and 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of the stems. If any more is removed, the beets may bleed during the cooking process. [3] X Research source Don’t throw the greens away if they are fresh! You can use them in a salad or cook them like spinach and add vinegar, salt, and pepper for added flavor. [4] X Research source"

About 45 to 50 minutes is needed to cook medium to large-sized beets. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source If you are concerned about the beets bleeding while boiling, add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of vinegar or lemon juice to the water. [8] X Research source Boiling is the most common way of cooking beets, but they can also be oven roasted. To roast your beets, place the washed and scrubbed beets in a shallow baking dish filled with 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of water. Cover with aluminum foil, tightly wrap and cook for one hour at 400 °F (204 °C). [9] X Research source Some people choose to steam their beets in preparation for storing. To steam your beets, fill a large stockpot with water and bring to boil. Place the beets in the steamer insert, cover, lower the heat, and cook for about 30 minutes or until done.

If the knife or fork enters into the beet easily, it’s cooked. If you feel some resistance, the beets need more time to cook. [11] X Research source If your beets are not tender enough, keep checking on them in 15-minute intervals until ready."

At the open end, insert a drinking straw and suck out all of the remaining air and then quickly seal the bag. [17] X Research source Another way of removing air is to use a vacuum sealing system. This method is guaranteed to remove all of the air in the bag and reduce the chance of freezer burn. These systems can be costly, but if used frequently are quite valuable. [18] X Research source"
