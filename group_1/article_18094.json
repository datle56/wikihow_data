      "content": "There’s a lot of misinformation about forgiveness out there. Contrary to popular belief, forgiving your partner doesn’t erase the pain, excuse the affair, or repair the relationship. Above all, forgiveness is about freeing yourself from that pain and heartache. If you don’t feel quite ready to forgive your partner yet, that’s okay! Focus on healing and moving forward at your own pace. [3] X Research source Ultimately, forgiveness is about looking toward the future instead of dwelling on the past. Reader Poll: If you're looking for a way to practice forgiveness, we asked 847 wikiHow readers who've been emotionally cheated on, and 57% of them agreed the best way to practice forgiveness is by praying for their partner.

      "content": "Ask your partner to cut off all contact if they haven’t already. Take away any temptation, so the affair can’t and won’t spring up again.

      "content": "Understanding why the affair happened can help you grow and heal. Unfortunately, pretending that the emotional affair didn’t happen isn’t going to help anyone. Instead, ask your partner if you can both have a calm, honest conversation about their infidelity. Then, discuss why the affair happened, and where things went south in your relationship. It won’t be an easy conversation, but it will provide valuable clarity and insight about what went wrong. [5] X Research source During this conversation, you might ask, “Why did you feel the need to talk with someone else?” or “Is there something else going on that you want to talk about?” For instance, your partner might have felt emotionally unsatisfied in the relationship, or they weren’t able to communicate what they really needed."

      "content": "Open, honest communication is an essential part of healing and forgiveness. Relationship experts suggest using nonjudgmental “I” statements to talk things over with your partner. During the conversation, focus on expressing yourself in an open, transparent way. Discuss something hurtful that your partner has said or done, and how that action makes you feel. [6] X Research source You could say, “When you’re constantly looking at your phone, I feel hurt, because I have a need for your respect and attention.” You might also say, “When you close me out of your life, I feel upset, because I have a need for emotional intimacy and communication.”"

      "content": "Honesty and remorse are key for moving forward. After an emotional affair, your mind may be reeling with questions, like “Why did this happen to me?” or “How am I supposed to keep going?” Before you focus on healing, ask your partner if they regret what they did. This can be a really difficult conversation to have, but it will help you start moving forward. [7] X Research source You might say, “I need to know that you regret what happened” or “Are you sorry for cheating on me?” If your partner doesn’t show much remorse, you could say, “I really want to move forward and heal, but I need you to cooperate with me.”"

      "content": "Don’t blame yourself for the emotional affair or try to excuse their actions. Instead, focus on your partner as a human being, not on their affair. [8] X Research source It can be really difficult at first, but try viewing the affair with empathy. This doesn’t mean that you’re excusing or writing it off—you’re just viewing it in a new perspective. [9] X Research source Instead of thinking, “I’m not a good enough partner,” think, “Jake didn’t know how to communicate what he needed, and chose to have an emotional affair.”"

      "content": "Journaling is a great outlet for your negative emotions. After an emotional affair, your own thoughts and emotions might feel all over the place. That’s okay! Instead of burying those feelings, write out exactly how you feel, and how the emotional affair has impacted you. There’s no right or wrong to journal, as long as you’re getting your feelings out. For instance, you might write, “No matter how hard I try, I can’t stop feeling angry” or “It’s so hard to talk with Mike now that I know what he did.”"

      "content": "Trust can be earned, but it takes time, effort, and patience. In the aftermath, ask your partner to be brutally and fearlessly honest from that point on. Your partner may say some hurtful, shocking things, but it’s necessary to help you heal and grow. To truly forgive your partner, you’ll need to know everything that happened. [10] X Research source Rigorous honesty can be difficult in the beginning. Your partner might try to minimize their actions, not tell the full truth, or expect forgiveness right away. In each conversation, hold your partner accountable for their words and past actions."
