      "content": "Check the package for the baking temperature, then preheat your oven. Every brand of polymer clay is slightly different, so double check what yours says before you turn on your oven. Usually, the temperature is between 220 and 300 °F (104 and 149 °C). [1] X Research source If you don’t have the original packaging for your clay, look up the manufacturer's website to find the right temperature. Unfortunately, polymer clay and plasticine clay look and feel almost identical. If you aren’t sure which one you have, don’t try to bake your clay in the oven. Plasticine clay will melt and could start a fire. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your sculpture onto a piece of parchment paper.",
      "content": "Place your sculpture onto a piece of parchment paper. Polymer clay can stick to baking sheets, so it’s important to put a small layer of protection in between them. Cut out a small square of parchment paper and set it underneath your sculpture. [3] X Research source If you are baking more than 1 sculpture at a time, give each one their own piece of parchment paper to keep them separated. Try not to use aluminum foil to bake your clay with, as the foil can heat up in the oven and scorch your sculptures. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Set your sculpture in the center of a baking tray.",
      "content": "Set your sculpture in the center of a baking tray. Polymer clay won’t expand when it’s heated up, so you can put as many sculptures on a baking sheet as you’d like. Make sure they aren’t touching each other, and try to center them as much as possible. [5] X Research source Centering your sculptures will ensure that each one gets an even amount of heat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the baking tray on the center rack of your oven.",
      "content": "Place the baking tray on the center rack of your oven. The center of your oven gets the most even amount of heat to ensure that your clay won’t get burned. Make sure the rack is in the exact middle of your oven and situate your baking tray in the center of it. [6] X Research source If you have to choose between the top and bottom rack, go for the bottom one. This will keep your clay away from the heating element so it’s less likely to get burned."

    {
      "title": "Bake your sculpture for the amount of time indicated on the package.",
      "content": "Bake your sculpture for the amount of time indicated on the package. Just like the temperature range, each package of polymer clay has its own time frame that you should bake it for. Look on your package and set a timer on your oven or your phone so you don’t forget about it. [7] X Research source The bake time may also depend on the thickness of your clay. Generally, the baking time is for a sculpture that’s 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick, so you may need to add on more time if yours is thicker. For example, if your sculpture is 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick and your bake time is 15 minutes, you’d multiply 15 by 2 to get 30 minutes."

      "content": "Take your sculptures out and wrap them in a kitchen towel. Use an oven mitt to grab your baking tray out of the oven and set it on your stove. Grab your sculptures and immediately wrap them in a kitchen towel to slow down the cooling process so they don’t crack. [8] X Research source You can also turn off your oven and leave your sculptures in there to cool down instead."

      "title": "Wait 10 to 20 minutes for your sculptures to cool completely.",
      "content": "Wait 10 to 20 minutes for your sculptures to cool completely. Try not to handle your sculptures until they are completely cool to avoid cracking them. Once they’re finished, you can add a glaze, paint on a decoration, or leave them as they are! [9] X Research source Once you bake polymer clay, you won’t be able to rehydrate it again."
