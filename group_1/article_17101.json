      "content": "Use Shazam or MusicID. These are popular apps that analyze sounds and identify songs from their database of recordings. If you've got Shazam on your phone and hear a song you can't identify and don't know anything about, activate the app and hold it toward the audio source and wait for a result. [1] X Research source You can also use MusicID or Google Assistant to identify songs that are playing in your environment. [2] X Research source Shazam can be used on iPhone, Blackberry, Android, and most other mobile devices. It can also be used on iPads and iPod touches. MusicID costs a few dollars to put on your iPhone and can also be used on other devices. [3] X Research source Google Assistant is available on a wide variety of smart devices. [4] X Research source Shazam was bought by Apple Music in 2018, but don’t worry—it’s still available for Android devices. In fact, the Android version even has features that iOS doesn’t, like a pop-up window that you can use to identify songs playing in another app on your phone. [5] X Research source These apps typically don't work as well with live performances. If you're watching a band doing a cover, but you can't quite place it, you'll probably need to use another method to identify the song."

      "content": "Record the song with your phone and upload it to AudioTag. Even if you can only record a brief clip of the song you like and want to identify, you can upload it to AudioTag to identify the song from its own database when you're back at your computer. [6] X Research source At the very least, you've got a recording of the song that you can use to play for friends or music aficionados and see if they recognize the tune."

      "content": "Hum it into a song ID app like SoundHound. On your phone, you can hum the melody into SoundHound, which is available for free. The app will analyze the melody you sing and give you a list of possible options. [7] X Research source On your computer, Midomi serves the same function. [8] X Research source Both of these apps are typically a lot more effective for contemporary songs. Trying to find the name of the song your grandfather used to sing while he worked tends to be more difficult on these apps, and may require other methods. WatZatSong [9] X Research source is a crowd-sourced option that works basically the same way. On this website, you can upload your clip (or yourself trying to sing and describe the song) and other people will get back to you with options."

      "content": "Play the song on a virtual keyboard. If you've got an ear for the melody and an elementary knowledge of the keyboard, you can enter the melody into Musipedia or MelodyCatcher to search for the melody. [10] X Research source These sites tend to work better for classical, wordless music and other types of non-pop music, because they have a slightly different sort of database of material to analyze."

      "content": "Google any lyrics you remember in quotes. Type any lyrics you remember into Google or another search engine, making sure to add quotation marks around the lyrics. This limits the search to those words in that order, so even if all you can remember is \"she said you would be mine,\" it'll be easier to find if you group them in quotes."

If you're looking for a song you heard during the credits of a TV show, do a quick search for \"Song playing at the end of Sopranos Episode Six, Season Five\" or \"Song in Mazda commercial.\" If you heard the song on a TV show or movie, try searching for the soundtrack on iTunes. If you find it, play free samples of each song on the album by hovering your mouse over the track number and pressing the blue play button that appears. You can also try searching on YouTube when you've narrowed your search down some."

Ask yourself if the song sounds familiar. Is the voice distinct? Could it be somebody you already listen to or like? If you think it sounds a lot like a singer or group you have heard, check that band's website or their fan sites to see if they have any new releases and listen to them."
