      "content": "GTA V takes place in California where bodies of water are plentiful. If you’re playing as Michael, you’ll have a pool and can swim in your backyard. If you’d like to swim in a bigger area, look for one of the open lakes that feed into the rivers. [1] X Research source There’s a large body of water at the center of the Tataviam mountain range, located to the northeast just outside of Los Santos. Another large lake is located in the middle of Vinewood to the north of Los Santos. The largest body of water outside the ocean is the Alamo Sea, which feeds into several small rivers. You can find the Alamo Sea west of Sandy Shores."

      "content": "Once the water becomes too deep for your character to stand and walk, they’ll automatically begin treading water. From there, you can swim across the surface of the water using the WASD keys on a PC or by using the left stick on a PlayStation (PS) or Xbox. [2] X Research source PC: The W key moves your character forward, S moves back, A moves left, and D moves right. PS3/PS4/PS5: Same as the Xbox, angle the left stick wherever you want your character to swim. Xbox 360/Xbox One/Xbox Series X/S: Angle the left stick on your controller in the direction you want the character to go."

Swimming fast in GTA can get you places faster but also increases your character’s stamina, breath capacity, and strength. As your character’s skills improve, they’ll be able to participate in triathlons in the game, which are races that require you to swim, run, and bike. PC: Accelerate with the Shift key. PS3/PS4/PS5: Use the X button to accelerate. Xbox 360/Xbox One/Xbox Series X/S: Use the A button to accelerate."

      "content": "GTA V allows you to dive and swim underwater once the water is above your character’s head. By diving underwater, you can find treasure, points of interest, and even secret easter eggs throughout the game’s open world. For example, there are a number of hidden packages scattered underwater that contain anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000 your character can collect. PC: Press the spacebar to dive. PS3/PS4/PS5: Press the R1 button. Xbox 360/Xbox One/Xbox Series X/S: Press the RB button."

      "content": "Swimming controls are inverted while underwater (similar to flying a plane in GTA when you begin to fly upside down). Beyond that, navigation is much like swimming on the surface of the water, using the left stick to move on a PlayStation or Xbox, and the WASD keys to move on PC. PC: Press Left Shift to swim forward. Press W and Left Shift to dive deeper. Press the A key to swim left and the D key to swim to the right. Hold the S and Left Shift keys to swim up and surface. [3] X Research source PS3/PS4/PS5: Press X to swim forward. Use the left stick to go left and right. Shift the left stick up to dive deeper, and shift the left stick down to swim up to the surface. Xbox 360/Xbox One/Xbox Series X/S: Press the A button to swim forward. Use the left stick to go left and right. Shift the left stick up to dive deeper, and shift the left stick down to swim up."

      "content": "The waters around Los Santos are shark-infested, and you may need to defend yourself if you encounter one. While in the water, the only weapon you can use is a knife—though keep in mind that you can attack no matter how you choose to swim, whether you’re submerged or treading water on the surface. [4] X Research source PC: Equip the knife by pressing the Tab key, then attack by pressing the R key. PS3/PS4/PS5: Equip the knife by pressing the L1 button, then attack by pressing the Circle button. Xbox 360/Xbox One/Xbox Series X/S: Equip the knife by pressing the LB button, then attack by pressing the B button."

      "content": "You can’t stay submerged forever. There’s a light blue meter in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, next to your character’s health. This meter indicates how long they can hold their breath underwater, and once it runs out, your character will begin to lose health very quickly. If you do not surface before their health runs out, your character will die. [5] X Research source You can also extend your character’s ability to stay underwater by going scuba diving in GTA V . Scuba gear is automatically unlocked after completing all main story missions in the game or by driving and exiting the dinghy (located at the Sonar Collections Dock) while in the water."
