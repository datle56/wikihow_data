[14] X Research source For example, you’re in line at the grocery store and you see a teen in front of you who is playing on their smartphone. You might say, “You seem to be really good at that. What’s the goal of the game?” Try to ask an open-ended question that requires the person to give a detailed answer rather than just replaying “yes” or “no.” A great open-ended question is something like, “You said skiing is your favorite sport--what is it about skiing that you love?”"
