      "content": "Use a good toothbrush. [1] X Research source Always look for toothbrushes that have the American Dental Association’s (ADA) seal of approval on the packaging. There are a surprising number of options you have to weigh when choosing a toothbrush. Should you use medium or soft bristles? A regular or electric toothbrush? Choose a brush size that’s not too difficult to maneuver throughout your mouth. Avoid hard-bristled brushes, as they may actually damage your gums and cause gum recession. Soft to medium bristles are recommended. Some electric toothbrushes, such as Sonic toothbrushes, have a particular movement that's beneficial because it effectively separates bacteria from the tooth surface. Studies show that the only electric toothbrush significantly better than a regular brush is a “rotation oscillation toothbrush,” in which the bristles move in both a circular and a back and forth motion at the same time.

[3] X Research source You may think you’re brushing well just because you’re brushing at all, but there’s a right way and a wrong way to brush your teeth. Keep the brush at a 45° angle to your gum line. Your stroke length should be roughly the length of one tooth. Use circular strokes for the chewing surfaces of your back teeth. Brush gently, but firmly. Applying too much pressure can strip the tooth of enamel and cause receding gums. Clean the interior surface of your teeth in an up-and-down motion. Remember to brush the surface of your tongue."

      "content": "Brush before meals at least twice a day. While the conventional wisdom is to brush after meals to remove food particles, dentists suggest you brush before meals, because they are concerned with plaque removal, not food removal. Brushing before meals actually avoids tooth and gum damage that can come from spreading and brushing acids from your meal around your mouth. [4] X Research source Even if you adopt the practice of brushing before meals, brushing before you go to bed is still essential. Although twice a day is the bare minimum, it’s recommended that you actually brush three times a day for optimal oral health."

      "content": "Brush for at least two minutes. Most people don’t brush their teeth for long enough to truly protect their tooth and gum health. Split your mouth into four quadrants: upper left, upper right, bottom left, and bottom right. Brush each quadrant for at least thirty seconds to ensure you’re brushing long enough, and hitting all parts of your mouth. Make sure you brush each tooth surface at least 10 times."

      "content": "Don’t brush too often or too vigorously. Brushing more than three times a day on a regular basis, or applying too much pressure when you brush can actually damage your gums and teeth. Dentists call this “toothbrush abrasion,” and it can result in both receding gums and enamel deterioration that can lead to sensitive teeth. The main cause is represented by the back and forth brushing with high pressure and rapid movements. If you’re using an electric brush, let it do all the work. Don’t apply extra pressure of your own."

They can also be homes for all sorts of bacteria they find in your mouth, so you need to replace them from time to time. Dentists recommend replacing your toothbrush every three to four months, or when the bristles start spreading apart making each stroke cause more harm than good"

Whereas over-brushing can be damaging to your gums, over-flossing won’t cause any harm. Flossing also prevents stains between your teeth. These are very difficult to remove even by the dentist.

      "content": "Use proper flossing technique. The ADA provides specific instructions on how to perfect your flossing technique. Use about 18 inches of floss, securing them to your fingers by winding them around the middle finger on each hand. Make sure not to cut off blood circulation to your fingertips. Unwind and rewind as necessary throughout the flossing process. Pinch the floss between your thumb and forefinger to stabilize. Use a back-and-forth sawing motion to ease the floss between your teeth, all the way up to the gum. Don’t snap the floss up hard against your gums. This can be painful, and can cause gum damage over time. Curve the floss into a “C” shape against the side of the tooth. Gently and slowly move the floss up and down the length of the tooth. Insert the floss between the tooth surface and the prominent gum, called papilla. Floss every single tooth, including the hard-to-reach ones in the back of your mouth. Floss both sides of each tooth."

Choose a mouthwash that has the ADA's seal of approval on the packaging. Mouthwash can be seen as an oral disinfectant that eliminates a high percentage of the bacteria and plaque involved in cavities or any other dental and mucosal issues. Choose therapeutic mouthwash specially formatted for gum health over cosmetic mouthwash designed for temporary breath freshening.

If the packaging says to dilute the product, follow their instructions for doing so. Use warm water. If you feel a burning sensation or the taste is too strong, dilute it further. Pour it into your mouth and swish it around your mouth vigorously for thirty to sixty seconds. Gargle the mouthwash in the back of your throat for another thirty to sixty seconds.
