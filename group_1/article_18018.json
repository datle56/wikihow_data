      "title": "Lay the wrap out flat.",
      "content": "Lay the wrap out flat. If you're using a round piece of dough, then you can lay it out any way you like. If you have a square piece, then lay it out like a diamond."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make an egg mixture.",
      "content": "Make an egg mixture. Crack a raw egg into a small bowl and whisk it with a fork until it blends completely. This will help create a mixture that holds the roll together. Once you cook the roll, it will be safe to eat. If you're using rice paper or another wrap that you don't plan on cooking, then you can not use the egg mixture to secure the wrap because it will be raw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip a pastry brush into the egg mixture and brush the two opposite sides of the wrap (top and bottom).",
      "content": "Dip a pastry brush into the egg mixture and brush the two opposite sides of the wrap (top and bottom). This will help these parts of the wrap stick together when the time comes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the filling on the rolls.",
      "content": "Place the filling on the rolls. Place this on the sheet near the bottom and spread it out in a line. This line should be about 1/2 to 2/3 inches tall. Make sure that the line doesn't overflow off the sheet. You want to leave enough room on each side of the wrap that you can comfortably fold the wrap without the contents spilling out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the left and right sides of the wrapper over the mixture.",
      "content": "Fold the left and right sides of the wrapper over the mixture. Just fold each side over until they just touch each other, or come close to touching each other, over the filling. Some people like to fold the top and bottom of the wrap first, and then tuck the sides over the top and bottom before they roll them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom of the wrap up over the filling.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom of the wrap up over the filling. Be careful to tuck it under the front side of the mixture, the side away from you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue to fold the roll.",
      "content": "Continue to fold the roll. When the line of mixture isn't visible because it is under the sheet, fold the sides near the end of the line. Hold those down while you continue to fold. Make sure that you are folding with your hands in the middle of the line of mixture."

    {
      "title": "Once the folds on the side are covered up on the side, roll the sheet through.",
      "content": "Once the folds on the side are covered up on the side, roll the sheet through. Your spring roll is now ready to cook!"

    {
      "title": "If the last corner won't fold, spread some egg mixture onto it and stick it to the rest of the roll.",
      "content": "If the last corner won't fold, spread some egg mixture onto it and stick it to the rest of the roll. This should do the trick."

      "title": "Continue the rolling method for the rest of your spring rolls.",
      "content": "Continue the rolling method for the rest of your spring rolls. You can make as many as you like, or just make one for yourself."

    {
      "title": "Fry them until they're golden brown.",
      "content": "Fry them until they're golden brown. Just 2-3 minutes on each side should do the trick. Put a bit of oil on a frying pan and fry the rolls over medium heat. Give them a minute to cool off and they're ready to go."

    {
      "title": "Place your spring roll on a plate in the shape of a diamond.",
      "content": "Place your spring roll on a plate in the shape of a diamond. If you use rice paper, which is traditionally used in many spring rolls, then you should read the instructions on how to prepare it. You may have to place it in hot water for fifteen seconds to get it ready. Each of the four corners should be pointing out, so that it is in the shape of a diamond, not a square. Keep in mind that, unlike the first method, you can't use egg paste to help the roll stick together because this roll is already cooked. You don't want to put raw egg on it if you don't plan on cooking it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the filling in the lower center of the spring roll, horizontally.",
      "content": "Put the filling in the lower center of the spring roll, horizontally. Now, scoop in the filling so it lies horizontally from left to right, with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between the filling and the left and right corners. This will keep the filling from coming out the sides. It shouldn't be put in too high -- just an inch (2.5 cm) or so at most -- so that you have plenty of space to fold the roll over the filling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom corner over the filling.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom corner over the filling. Now, pick up the bottom corner and fold it over the filling, so the bottom corner is now facing the same direction as the top corner. About an inch (2.5 cm) or so of the corner should be folded above the filling, so that there's still a good 2-3 inches (5 - 7.5 cm) between the bottom corner and the top corner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider tucking or rolling the bottom corner over the filling (optional).",
      "content": "Consider tucking or rolling the bottom corner over the filling (optional). Some people like to tuck the top corner into the filling, so it disappears into the ingredients. Some like to even roll it over the ingredients one full rotation, to secure them there. Others prefer to go the traditional route and to keep the corner folded up -- it's your call."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the left corner into the middle of the roll.",
      "content": "Fold the left corner into the middle of the roll. Fold the corner over, so it points in the opposite direction, in the middle of the roll. It should begin to resemble an envelope."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the right corner into the middle of the roll, to meet the left.",
      "content": "Fold the right corner into the middle of the roll, to meet the left. Now, just do what you did on the right side of the roll. The left and right corners should just touch. Now, you've almost finished making your envelope. Right now, it should look like an envelope with the filling inside and the flap facing up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the bottom up until you've finished folding the spring roll.",
      "content": "Roll the bottom up until you've finished folding the spring roll. Now, just roll from the bottom upwards until you've fully folded the spring roll using the envelope method. Now, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy your delicious treat."
