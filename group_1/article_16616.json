      "content": "Check that you can make your payment with money order . Money orders are a method of payment that gives the recipient a guarantee that they will receive payment. [1] X Research source Because you pay for the money order up front when purchasing it, you cannot void the payment like you could with a credit card charge, and the amount cannot bounce like a bad check. Though it’s a very secure method of payment, not all companies or people will accept money orders as a form of payment. Before securing your money order, ask the person you’re paying to whether or not it’s an acceptable form of payment. Money orders are commonly required for governmental agencies — for example, if you’re paying a speeding ticket or a court processing fee."

On this line, you should write the name of the person or company who will receive the money order. Always ask the recipient what name should be provided on the money order, as you must use a legal name rather than a nickname. For example, you may know your landlord as “Jane,” but she may need to deposit the money order as her corporate name, which might be “Smith Properties, Inc.”"
