      "title": "Put your hair in a high ponytail.",
      "content": "Put your hair in a high ponytail. Position it at the top of your head, either right up top or a few inches toward the back. There's no need to make it neat and tight; let the ponytail be a little loose. It's fine if a few strands fall out on the sides and back."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tease your ponytail.",
      "content": "Tease your ponytail. Hold it straight up and insert a comb near the tips. Backcomb your hair toward the roots to tease it and add volume and texture. Continue until your entire ponytail has been teased. It should now look messy and tousled. If you'd like, you could instead curl your hair before putting it up in a ponytail. The curly effect will make your hair look tousled, but still neat enough to wear to a nice evening event. For this look, there's no need to tease or curl the hair that's not in your ponytail."

      "content": "Wrap the second section around the base of your ponytail. Do the same thing, twisting it and winding it around the other portion of your headband. Pin it in place against your head. Take a look in the mirror: your hairband should no longer be visible."

      "content": "Pull out a few strands and loosen it up. Here's the part where things get messy. Grab the bun and move it in a circular motion to loosen it a bit. Use your fingers to pull out a few strands so it looks a little messier. Finally, pull out a few strands of hair from the area around your temples to frame your face and complete the look."

      "title": "Tease or curl your hair.",
      "content": "Tease or curl your hair. This step is optional if you're not in the mood to go all out. However, if you tease or curl your hair, it will take your messy low bun up a few notches. Lift the top layer of your hair and backcomb it toward the roots to add volume and texture. Alternately, use a curling iron to curl the top layer of your hair so it won't be completely smooth. Of course, if your hair is naturally curly and voluminous, this step is completely unnecessary; your bun will look beautifully messy on its own."

Stop pulling before your ends are all the way through the hairband. Leave several inches of the ends of your hair sticking out. You should now have a simple looped bun. If the ponytail seems loose, use a second ponytail to ensure the looped bun stays securely in place. While the look should be messy, you don't want it to be so loose it falls out."

The bigger the sections of hair, the bigger your braids will be. If you want small braids, just separate out 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 inch (1.3 cm) sections of hair from either side. For thicker braids, the sections should be 1 to 2 inches wide."
