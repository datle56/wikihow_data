      "content": "Check the ingredients to see if the sanitizer is alcohol-based. Pick up a bottle of hand sanitizer and check the ingredients label on the back of the bottle. Make sure that it contains at least 60% ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, or n-Propanal to be effective. [1] X Research source Non-alcohol-based hand sanitizer won’t work, since it’s the alcohol that dissolves the sap."

      "content": "Rub the hand sanitizer onto your hands to remove the sap. Grab the bottle of sanitizer and squirt a small amount into your palms, then rub it around vigorously. If there is any sap on the back of your hands, make sure you rub it all over your entire hand. [2] X Research source If you have sap anywhere else on your skin, like your feet or your arms, you can use the sanitizer there, too. Just be careful not to get sanitizer on any open cuts or sensitive areas of your body, as it could burn. Hand sanitizer with alcohol in it is very drying, so use caution if you have sensitive or flaky skin."

      "content": "Wipe down your saw or pruners with hand sanitizer if they’re sticky. If you used any tools to cut or prune a tree and they have sap on them, squirt a few pumps of hand sanitizer onto a paper towel. Then, wipe down the blades of your tools with the hand sanitizer before you store them. [3] X Research source If your tools are sticky, it could dull the blades or even make the tools stick together completely, leaving them unusable."

      "content": "Use cooking oil, like vegetable, olive, or canola, or margarine to get it off. Rub a small bit of oil over your hand, scrubbing lightly over the sappy spots for 30-60 seconds. When you're done, wash your hands with warm water and some dish detergent to get the sap off you hands. [4] X Research source Vegetable oils will also act as moisturizers and help ease skin irritation. For particularly difficult patches, pour a little dry baking soda directly onto the sap and rub it in with the oil to break it down."

      "content": "Put a spoonful of peanut butter on your hands. In the same way that it helps remove gum from your hair, the oils in peanut butter are great at removing sap from your hands. Rub it along the covered areas and massage it lightly into your skin. It should begin pulling the sap off your hands, and the rest will be removed after washing your hands with soap and warm water. Out of peanut butter? Try using mayonnaise in the same way. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover for big patches. These two liquids may dry your hands out and sometimes cause irritation, but they are incredibly effective. Pour some on a rag or sponge and use it to lightly scrub away the sap. Give it a little time to set in before trying to scrape it off your skin. and be sure to wash your hands with soap and water when you are done. Apply some ceramide-rich moisturizer afterwards to lock in lost moisture. Alcoholic wipes, used in first-aid kits or as a disinfectant are a great portable solution."

Red rotted wood is even more effective at removing the sap"

Make sure that your solution, no matter what it is, won't ruin your clothing or surface by finding an inconspicuous \"test area.\" Place a small drop of the cleaner on this surface and rub it in. Return 20 minutes later and check to make sure that the surface didn't discolor or warp as a result."
