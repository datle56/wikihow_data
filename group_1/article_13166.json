      "content": "Cool the oil and toss it out in a sealed container. Wait until the oil is completely cooled off before you start disposing of it. Then, drain the oil into a secure container, like the oil bottle itself. [1] X Expert Source Abyssinia Campbell Executive Chef Expert Interview. 31 August 2021. Toss the sealed bottle out in your trash can and dispose of it like you would any other trash. [2] X Research source Old cola bottles and milk jugs are great vessels for your old cooking oil (as long as you still have the lid for them). [3] X Research source If you’re getting rid of expired/unused oil, simply toss out the container itself. Just make sure that the lid is unopened or tightly sealed beforehand! You can also use a product like FryAway or a FryAway alternative like SolidiFry , Hard Oil , or stearic acid to harden the leftover oil. Once it’s solid, throw away the oil (no need to put it in a container first).

      "content": "Soak the oil in cat litter if you have a lot to get rid of. Pour small amounts of the unused (or expired) oil into the cat litter, mixing the rest of the oil in gradually. Once all the oil is all absorbed, transfer the oil-soaked litter to a sealable bag and toss it into your trash can. [5] X Research source Don’t have any cat litter? Sawdust, flour, and sand are also great mediums for absorbing oil. [6] X Research source If you have tons of oil to get rid of, you might not have a sealable container that’s big enough to handle the job. In that case, pouring the oil into an absorbent material before tossing it out can be handy. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Compost small amounts of oil with newspaper or paper towels. Grab a sheet of newspaper or a paper towel and rub it into some of the unused oil in your pan. From there, toss the oil-soaked paper towel or newspaper into your compost bin. [8] X Research source Composting works best with small portions of oil, like the leftover oil from sauteeing or pan-frying something. If you have a lot of used oil on hand (like the leftover oil from a deep fryer) it's better to dispose of it in a large, sealable container."

      "content": "Recycle the oil by following your local government’s specifications. Many cities, towns, and municipalities have specific recycling procedures in place for household materials like cooking oil. Check your local government website to see the proper procedures to learn how you can dispose of your oil in a safe and efficient way. In some places, you might be able to pour the oil into a sealable container and leave it outside next to your recycling can. [9] X Research source Other places might have specific drop-off spots where can donate your used cooking oil. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Drop the oil off at a local restaurant. Check in with a local eatery and ask if they’re willing to get rid of some of your leftover oil. Restaurants typically use bulk tanks or drums to handle their leftover oil—they might be willing to toss your old or expired oil into the mix, as long as you ask. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Strain the oil and save it for later in a glass jar. Once the oil is no longer piping hot, pour it through a metal strainer covered in multiple layers of cheesecloth. After the oil is filtered of any leftover crumbs and food bits, pour it into a sealable container. Label the oil with the current date and stash it in the refrigerator—reused oil lasts for about 1-2 months. [12] X Research source Not totally sure if you want to reuse your oil or not? Transfer it to a sealable container and stash it in the freezer for around 2 years. Try to reuse your oil in similar dishes—for instance, oil used to make fried chicken isn’t a great option for frying donuts or funnel cake. Warning: Always inspect your oil before you reuse it. If the oil smells bad, looks hazy, and/or has foam on the surface, toss it out. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Repurpose unused olive or coconut oil as a makeup remover or hair treatment. Gently rub unused oil over any makeup or cosmetics you’d like to remove. Feel free to transform your leftover olive or coconut oil into a hair mask. Working your way from the roots down, apply the oil all over your hair. Then, cover up your hair with a shower cap and let the oil soak for 1 hour before washing your hair with shampoo. Warning: Make sure that the oil isn’t rancid before using it on your hair and skin! Give the oil a sniff before you use it—if it smells bad, it’s no longer good to use. For unrefined oils (such as extra-virgin olive oil), carefully taste a small spoonful of it to see if the flavor seems off-putting. [16] X Research source"
