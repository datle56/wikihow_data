      "content": "Consider these safety tips. It’s important to protect your personal information when creating a username for a website, app, or game. Here are a few things you can do to protect your privacy: Stay anonymous . Avoid using any personally identifiable information when creating your username, such as your last name, birthdate, school, address, or social security number. Don’t include any part of your password in your username. Create a unique username for every website. This can help prevent tracking of your activity across multiple sites. Read our general guide to internet safety for more info."

      "content": "Decide on a theme. If you’re creating an account for a forum with a specific topic (e.g., car discussion), you may want your username to reflect that topic (e.g., “honda_civic_30”). If it’s a more general website (e.g., Reddit ), you can choose a more broad topic or personal interest."

      "content": "Combine words to make a unique username. This will help make your name more unique and increase the chances that it won't be taken.

      "title": "Use symbols to simulate spaces and letters.",
      "content": "Use symbols to simulate spaces and letters. Most websites won’t let you use a space in your username, but many will let you use the “_” underscore character to mimic a space. You can also use certain numbers to replace letters, such as “7” instead of “T” or “3” instead of “E”. This is known as “ leet speak ”, and is typically found in online video gaming circles. Periods are often used to separate words in usernames as well. Don’t use your birth year at the end of your username, especially if you are a minor, as it makes it very easy to identify how old you are."

This can help you compare names and combine existing ideas into something new. Don’t stress about it too much. Many websites allow you to change your username after making your account. Check the website’s username guidelines first!"

If that person is posting on a medical forum, they want to use a \"DrAngie123\" type username since it's more aligned to that community than \"DwnShftGrl\". However, if the doctor joined a motorcycle forum, it'd be more appropriate to use \"DwnShftGrl\" instead of \"DrAngie123.\""
