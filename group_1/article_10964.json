To measure bust size, wrap a cloth measuring tape around the widest part of the bust. Keep the tape taut but not tight, and make sure that it remains parallel to the floor."

      "title": "Determine your size.",
      "content": "Determine your size. Compare your bust measurement to the sizing measurements of the pattern. If your bust size is: 32 inches (81 cm), make a small. 36 inches (91 cm), make a medium. 40 inches (102 cm), make a large. 44 inches (112 cm), make an extra-large. Note that the default instructions are for a small vest, but necessary size-based alterations are noted in the substeps. You'll need five balls of yarn for a small, six for a medium or large, and seven for an extra-large. If you want to add edging to the vest, you'll need an additional one to three balls of yarn in a second, coordinating color."

      "content": "Check the gauge of your yarn. Work two single crochets and two shell stitches with your chosen yarn. The length of this pattern should be about 4 inches (10 cm). Also note that six rows of this pattern should produce material that is 4 inches (10 cm) long. Use fine to super-fine yarn for best results. Start with a G-6 (4 mm) crochet hook. If the gauge is too small with this hook, increase the hook size and try again. If the gauge is too large, decrease the hook size and try again."
