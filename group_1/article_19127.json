      "content": "Wait for a lull in the conversation. Conversations naturally have times where they drop off or have a lull in them. Typically this is when a new topic starts if you want to keep the conversation going, but it’s also the perfect time to take the steps to end the conversation. Use transition words like so, anyway, or well to begin to say goodbye. [1] X Research source Reader Poll: If you’re struggling with conversation topics, we asked 482 wikiHow readers who've needed to redirect a conversation, and 61% of them agreed the best way to change the subject is by discussing something positive.

      "content": "Summarize key points of the conversation. Before leaving the conversation, it’s nice to restate some key points of the conversation to let the other person know you were listening. By doing this you also signal to the other person that you are ready for the conversation to end. Try saying something like, “It was really nice talking to you. I didn’t know you were interested in sci fi too! It’s awesome that we have the same favorite movie!” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Give a reason you have to leave. Make one final comment about the topic you’re talking about, and then follow it up with your reason for having to leave. The reason doesn’t have to necessarily be true, but it needs to be believable and urgent enough for you to have to leave. [3] X Expert Source Michael Dickerson, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021. [4] X Research source For example, if you’re talking about a book, you can say, “Wow, I don’t remember that in the book. I’ll have to read it again. Well, it was great running into you, but I have to go. I’m late to pick up my friend from work. Have a great afternoon!”"

      "content": "Introduce the person to someone else if you can’t leave. If you are at a party and you don’t want to or can’t leave, you can get out of the conversation by introducing the person to someone else. Find someone you know, and call them over to meet the person you’re talking to. After the introduction, kindly excuse yourself to go to the restroom or get more refreshments. [5] X Research source Think of a common interest the two people have to start the introduction. For example, you can introduce someone by saying, “Here’s my friend Matt. You two have so much in common! He was also the quarterback of his high school’s football team.”"

Can you imagine if that were true? Wow!” can help you to play it off and brush aside the comment Add some levity by saying something like \"one of my many talents is knowing the perfect thing to say to anyone in any situation\" and laughing."

      "title": "Turn the insult on yourself.",
      "content": "Turn the insult on yourself. Tell the person you accidentally insulted that you were just kidding and the comment was more of a personal statement about yourself. Someone is more likely to let it go if you say that you were actually being honest about yourself and didn’t mean the comment about the other person. [6] X Research source If you insult someone's looks, make up a story that turns your comment into a personal narrative. \"I have always been self conscious about my looks, so I sometimes project onto others."

[7] X Expert Source Michael Dickerson, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021. Admit your mistake in insulting the person and try to wrap the comment with a compliment. If you insulted the person by pointing out something that you don’t like about the person, be honest about it. Say something like, “I’m sorry that I hurt you. I just think sometimes you wear too much perfume to work. Maybe I just have a really sensitive sense of smell. I really like your outfit though! You have the best wardrobe, where do you shop?” If you sent an email to the wrong person, apologize and say that the message was meant for someone else, but that you really shouldn’t have said the comment at all.

      "content": "Respond to the situation quickly. If your phone autocorrects your text message into something embarrassing or insulting, you need to send a new message as soon as possible to inform the recipient of the mistake.

People today know that most phones use autocorrect software, so when you accidentally send a message that doesn’t say what you meant to say, most people will understand the mistake.

If you turn off autocorrect, it might take you longer to type out a text message, and you still might misspell words, but you will know you’re sending a message you meant to type. Some phones will underline misspelled words for you so you can fix them on your own.

I play every weekend, and I always have a huge party to watch the World Cup. Have you ever played soccer?” Make a joke like, “Oh Mr. Accountant, don’t bore me with financials!

Even as an adult, you can claim you have to be home by a certain time because you have a busy day the next day or you need to get home to your pet. Claiming a curfew will relieve you from the possibility of the date lasting too long. You can tell your date about your curfew early in the night and then if it starts going bad, remind your date you have to get home. However, if the date is going really well, you can also say you’re willing to stay out late tonight because you’re having such a great time."

Make plans to have a friend call you 30 or 40 minutes after the date begins and make sure your phone’s ringer is turned on so you hear the call. If the date’s going bad, answer the call and say something like,“Oh no! I’ll be right there!” and then hang up. Be prepared to tell your date why you have to leave, and politely excuse yourself from the date. [12] X Research source Tell you date that you forgot to pick up your friend’s child from school.

Wipe your face and hairline with a wet paper towel and come out holding your stomach. Inform your date that you aren’t feeling well and that you’re going to go home. You can leave some cash to help pay for the date if you want to be nice. Leave quickly so your date doesn’t offer to help you home."

Tell the person you want to keep in touch and ask for a business card. [15] X Research source Ask the person to spell their name to make sure you get it right."
