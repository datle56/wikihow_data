      "content": "Use a neti pot or other sinus irrigating device. A neti pot is a device that resembles a small teapot. Used correctly, a neti pot flushes out mucus and trapped irritants, and moisturizes your sinus passages. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source The device works by putting saline or distilled water in one nostril and allowing it to drain out the other, removing unwanted irritants and germs. Fill the neti pot with about 4 ounces of saline solution or distilled water and the sterile powder packet that came with the device. Then, lean over a sink, turning your head sideways and hold the spout up to the upper nostril. Tip the pot to fill the nostril and let it run out the other nostril. Repeat the procedure using the other nostril. This process is called irrigation since you are flushing out the passages with a liquid to get rid of unwanted mucus and irritants that are causing the mucus. Use your neti pot once or twice daily. Neti pots provide a moisturizing and soothing effect to the sinuses. A neti pot can be purchased inexpensively over-the-counter. Be sure to clean your neti pot thoroughly after each use."

[2] X Research source Wet a small towel or cloth with very warm water. Place the towel on your face where you feel the most pressure. In general, cover your eyes, the area just above your eyebrows, nose, and your cheeks just below your eyes.

[4] X Research source Humidifiers are available in two primary types, cool mist, and warm mist styles, but there are many variations for each type. If dry sinus passages that lead to discomfort, irritation, and resulting mucus drainage is an ongoing problem for you, consider adding a humidifier to the appliances in your home. If you use a humidifier, be sure to clean it regularly to avoid mold growth. [5] X Expert Source Ni-Cheng Liang, MD Board Certified Pulmonologist Expert Interview. 23 October 2020. Other simple ways to provide short-term humidification include safely boiling water on the stove, leaving the bathroom door open when showering or running a hot bath, or even drying your clothes indoors."

      "content": "Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking water or other fluids helps to keep the mucus loose. While you may want to stop the runny or stuffy nose immediately, drinking fluids makes the mucus loose and runny. The fluids can help your body to get rid of the mucus you have so you can get back to normal. [7] X Research source Drinking warm fluids helps in two ways. You are providing the recommended extra fluid intake, and, also, you will breathe in more moisture since the beverage you are drinking is warm or hot. Anything that is warm works fine, such as coffee, hot tea, or even a cup of broth or soup."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Sometimes the mucus will run down the back of your throat, known as postnasal drip, and sometimes the irritants can cause your lungs to produce mucus, called phlegm. You may feel the need to cough to remove the buildup of the phlegm. Quit smoking or vaping if you do either. Try to avoid being exposed to second-hand cigarette or cigar smoke. If you know this is a trigger for you, also take care to avoid situations outside that may involve burning yard debris, or stay upwind of the smoke from a bonfire. Other pollutants that we breathe in can cause sinus problems as well. Watch for dust, pet dander, yeast, and molds, in your home and workplace. Be sure to change your air filters regularly to limit your exposure to irritants in the air of your home. Exhaust fumes, chemicals used in your work, and even smog, can trigger an episode of mucus production caused by something other than an allergen. This is termed nonallergic rhinitis."

Clear only one nostril at a time. Blowing too hard can cause small openings to develop in your sinus areas. If you have any bacteria or unwanted irritants in your nose, then you may be forcing them further back into your sinuses as you blow your nose.

      "title": "Take an antihistamine product.",
      "content": "Take an antihistamine product. Over-the-counter antihistamines are very helpful with minimizing the sinus problems associated with allergen exposure, or allergic rhinitis. Antihistamines work by blocking the reaction caused by exposure to an allergen. The reaction causes the release of histamine, and antihistamines help to minimize the bodyâ€™s response to exposure to an allergen or irritant. Antihistamines are most useful in people that have known allergies. Some are seasonal, and some are year-round risks. Seasonal allergic problems are caused by the release of substances from the plants in our environment as they begin to bloom and blossom in the spring and fall. Fall allergies are often caused by ragweed. People with year-round allergy problems are allergic to other things that are difficult to avoid in the environment. This can include everything from dust and pet dander to cockroaches and other insects that live in and around our homes. Antihistamines help, but for people that have severe seasonal allergies or year-round problems, more intense allergy therapy may be warranted. Talk to your doctor about other options."

[12] X Expert Source Ni-Cheng Liang, MD Board Certified Pulmonologist Expert Interview. 23 October 2020. Oral decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, helping the swollen tissues to shrink.

[23] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Nasal polyps can develop over time. Small polyps most often go unnoticed and cause no problems. Larger polyps can block the airflow through your sinus passages, and cause irritation that leads to excessive mucus production. Other structural abnormalities are possible, such as deviated septum, and enlarged adenoids, but they do not usually cause excessive production of mucus. Injury to the nose or surrounding area can also result in structural abnormalities, and can sometimes have related symptoms like mucus production. Talk to your doctor if you have had a recent injury to your facial area or nose."
