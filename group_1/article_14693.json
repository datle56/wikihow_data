      "content": "Slip on a pair of shredded skinny jeans. Opt for either black or acid wash denim. Look for a pair with holes at the knees or rips all the way up and down the pant legs for an edgier look. Choose your denim in a skin-tight skinny jean cut. [1] X Research source Skinny jeans are still in fashion today, so feel free to pull a pair from your wardrobe or a mainstream retailer. Keep in mind that the softer, stretchier denim of today differs from what was worn in the 80s, though. Pick out a second-hand pair of 80s jeans from a thrift shop to get a more authentic look.

      "title": "Wear a t-shirt featuring your favorite 80s rock band.",
      "content": "Wear a t-shirt featuring your favorite 80s rock band. While band members didn’t necessarily wear their own logos around, this is a great way to show off your allegiance to specific 80s rockers. Choose a black t-shirt with a large graphic featuring the name of one of the decade’s top rock groups like Iron Maiden or AC/DC. [3] X Research source A brand new t-shirt won’t look very rock-n-roll, so opt for a distressed, lived-in t-shirt instead. Choose a band t-shirt featuring muddy, worn colors like deep red or dark blue in the graphics. Make sure your t-shirt features a band you love. Others might use your t-shirt as a conversation starter. Instead of a band t-shirt, you can try a plain white, gray, or black t-shirt. Just be sure to amp up your rocker look with additional layers and accessories."

      "content": "Throw on a leather motorcycle jacket or a denim vest over your t-shirt. Try a vintage jacket from a thrift shop to get the right silhouette and a lived-in look. Find one with big shoulders and a tapered waist that’s embellished with silver zippers and studded lapels. [4] X Research source For a sleeveless look, opt for a vest. Try either a leather biker-style vest or a cutoff acid wash denim option. [5] X Research source Personalize your denim vest with patches and pins. Consider placing a large motif on the back panel of your jacket or vest so anyone approaching you from behind will know your rock allegiances. For ladies, try tulle and lace mixed with edgier leather and denim in the style of Cindy Lauper and Madonna. A denim jacket can work as well!"

      "content": "Ground your rocker look with a pair of black leather boots. Finish off your hard rock ensemble with tough black boots. Choose a pair that’s edgy and worn-in, with messy laces, scuffed and distressed leather, and heavy silver buckles. [6] X Research source If you want to aim for a sleeker, more New Age rock look, try a pair of black leather Chelsea boots instead. Avoid wearing sneakers with your 80s rocker outfit."

      "content": "Layer on heavy silver-toned jewelry. When it comes to 80s rocker jewelry, the more the better. [7] X Research source Focus on studded leather and thick chains. Stack up a selection of mismatched bracelets, wear an edgy choker, add a studded belt, and sport chains around your neck, wrists, and belt loops. Pick out a handful of chunky metal rings and consider wearing a rocker hoop earring in one ear. [8] X Research source Stick with silver-toned metal to get the 80s look. Avoid gold jewelry and accents. Work classic rock imagery – skulls, snakes, crosses, and roses – into your accessories. For instance, try a thick snake ring or a heavy skull pendant."

Feel free to start with an all-black base look and use brighter colors as accents. Alternatively, you can create a head-to-toe bleached or saturated look."

      "content": "Glam up your look with bold prints in stretchy fabrics. Try out black-and-white or colorful graphic stripes, or work diamond harlequin prints into your ensemble. Work animal prints including leopard spots and tiger stripes into your outfit in small or large quantities. Commit to the glam look with skin-tight Spandex featuring these prints. Some rock looks bordered on circus-y during the 80s. Embrace the decade’s excess and eccentricity! Think back to the bright bodysuits worn by Freddie Mercury of Queen, as well as the tight leggings that many glam metal rockers of the time wore. The glam rock styles of the 1970s heavily influenced the glam metal of the 80s. [10] X Research source"

Add light-reflective sequins, glitter, and metallic silver to the hard rock essentials and you’ll look like a glam metal rocker who just stepped off the stage. Incorporate heavy leather fringe as a nod to the western influence that was fashionable during the decade. [11] X Research source Sparkling details will scatter the light while the fringe will swing and sway as you move. These elements will make your 80s rocker look extra eye-catching. Or try out historically-inspired ruffles and metallic brocade which were favored by Prince and Adam Ant. [12] X Research source"

Go wild with a brightly colored or metallic pair of chunky platforms. Or stick with black boots in the outrageous 80s platform shape. [14] X Research source For a more down-to-earth style citing western influences, try cowboy boots. To get an authentic pair of 80s shoes, search vintage listings online.

When styling your hair, try to get it as big and voluminous as possible. [15] X Research source Curl, crimp, and frizz it out to achieve lots of texture. Keep the ends hanging loose around or below your shoulders. Add short, choppy layers around your crown and face to get that feathery lion’s mane look. [16] X Research source Hold your hair in place with tons of hairspray and volumizing product. Most 80s glam metal rockers were clean-shaven to get the androgynous look, but some hard rockers sported stubble and facial hair. [17] X Research source Don’t keep your hair straight or you may get mistaken for a 70s rocker."

At the crown and sides of your head, try to get your hair to stand straight up in a spiked ‘do. If you can, leave the bottom layer long to create a shaggy mullet. [18] X Research source Or consider spiking the front strands toward your face if your hair is shorter around the sides and back. Look at Rod Stewart and Flock of Seagulls as examples of how to style short to medium-length hairstyles. [19] X Research source Not many 80s rockers had short hair, so consider getting an 80s wig to create the iconic lion’s mane look. Ladies can sport a voluminous curly bob like Madonna.

If you prefer a classic hard rocker look, pencil on some black eyeliner around your upper and lower lids. [23] X Research source Or for a glam look, go all-out with the androgynous made-up face of 80s rock. Use bronzer and blush to sculpt your cheekbones, brush on brightly colored eyeshadow, and highlight your pout with dark lipstick. Feel free to try a full face of white and black makeup like KISS. Unlike the use of makeup in 70s glam rock, makeup in the 80s wasn’t really about gender ambiguity. Instead, it was more about visual and creative experimentation. [24] X Research source"
