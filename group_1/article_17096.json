      "content": "Get your style to be able to start getting that attention. We never want to go over the top or just down right douche. Dress to impress, but keep it subtle. By doing this it says more than I am a sexy man. It shows that you are an attractive man with style, but is also sophisticated and kind of mysterious. Every girl knows a guy in a bro shirt, bro hat, and Dickie shorts with a monster drink is going to be a punk. A cheap store where you can by your essentials such as shirts, shoes and pants is H&M, but if you also look at Ross you can find some really good buys."

      "content": "Try going for a run and lifting weights so those clothes fit better and make you look more manly. Also most sexy girls workout, which means if you impress them and start a little convo and then ask them out one day and show them your style and personality. BAMMMM you have yourself a sexy girl."

      "title": "Smell good always because you never know where you are going to meet or run into a sexy girl.",
      "content": "Smell good always because you never know where you are going to meet or run into a sexy girl. Try out different colognes to find one that you like, and remember to wear deodorant. Reader Poll: We asked 1515 wikiHow readers how theyâ€™re most likely to take care of their appearance, and only 10% of them said wearing deodorant that smells nice. [Take Poll] While this might not change your physical appearance, remember that wearing deodorant is a key part to practicing personal hygiene."

      "title": "Be confident and be yourself.",
      "content": "Be confident and be yourself. Sexy girls get hit on by guys who are overconfident and come off as assholes or man whores. You want to come off as a good guy, but slightly mysterious so she wants more and more and more of you."

    {
      "title": "Find her.",
      "content": "Find her. Sexy women are everywhere! The most attractive ones are usually considered the sexy ones. Think about what you would want your sexy girl to be doing (because you want to have some connection with her) and try out the place. If you like girls who can dance, go to a club with your new found confidence. Or if you like fit toned girls, go on a hike in your local area. Most sexy outdoors girls hike daily and usually if they are single, with their dog which is also a great convo starter."

      "title": "GO find her!",
      "content": "GO find her! Confidence and modesty will win a girl over (at least the girls you want to win) every time."
