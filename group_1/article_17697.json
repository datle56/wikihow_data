      "title": "Choose a basic toothpaste.",
      "content": "Choose a basic toothpaste. There's no need for the sparkles, swirls, and exotic flavors of some oral care products. Instead, opt for a basic white paste to polish your CD . All types of toothpaste contain enough abrasive minerals to get the job done, but you want to steer clear of the heavily abrasive kinds of toothpaste that offer whitening benefits. Basic kinds of toothpaste are cheaper than their flashier alternatives. This can be especially helpful if you have several CDs to polish. This method is best suited for getting rid of light scratches on your CD or DVD. Basically, the goal of this method is to use the light abrasive from the basic toothpaste to remove the surface layer containing the light scratches and restore the reflectivity of the disc."

      "content": "Clean and dry the CD. Run the CD under some warm water and rinse thoroughly. Then, using a soft, clean cloth, dry the CD and double-check to make sure you've removed all traces of toothpaste or moisture. After you've cleaned and dried the CD, use a soft cloth to buff the surface of the CD."

      "title": "Decide which compound you will use.",
      "content": "Decide which compound you will use. Several common household products can be used to polish the CD, but 3M rubbing compound and Brasso are probably the most tried and true. You can also use fine-grit polishing compounds designed for cars or hard finishes. If you're using Brasso, make sure to do so in a well-ventilated area, and avoid breathing in the fumes. Always read the safety instructions and warnings on any chemical product, as many (such as rubbing alcohol ) are flammable and/or can cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation.

      "title": "Apply the polishing compound to a cloth.",
      "content": "Apply the polishing compound to a cloth. Put a small amount of 3M compound or Brasso on a soft, clean, lint-free cloth. An old shirt or an eyeglass-cleaning cloth will both work well. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Polish the CD.",
      "content": "Polish the CD. Use a gentle, radial motion to rub the compound into the scratch. Start at the center and rub out to the edge, like spokes on a wheel. Do this 10 or 12 times all around the CD. Try to focus your efforts solely on the scratch or scratches that you have identified. When polishing the disc, make sure to lay the disc on a flat, firm surface that's non-abrasive. Data is stored on the foil or dye layers on the top of the disc (label side), and the protective top layer can easily be scratched or perforated. Pressing down on a disc on a surface that is too soft may crack it or cause it to de-laminate. Rubbing in a circular motion (as opposed to a radial motion) can cause small scratches that throw off the laser tracking system in the player."

      "title": "Remove the polishing product from the disc.",
      "content": "Remove the polishing product from the disc. Rinse the disc thoroughly with warm water and let it dry. Make sure to remove all of the compound and let the disc dry completely before trying to play it. With Brasso, wipe off excess product and let the rest dry. Then, using a clean cloth, gently wipe the disc again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test the disc.",
      "content": "Test the disc. If the problem persists, polish again for up to 15 minutes, or until the scratch is almost completely buffed out. The surface around the scratch should begin to look shiny with many tiny scratches. If you still do not notice any difference after polishing for a few minutes, the scratch may be extremely deep, or you may be polishing the wrong scratch. If the disc is still not operational, take the disc to a trained professional at a gaming store or CD repair shop."

      "content": "Determine whether or not wax is an option. Sometimes, you'll need to physically remove plastic from the disc by polishing it. However, removing a lot of plastic can affect the refractive properties of the lens, making the data unreadable. Waxing scratches is useful because even though the defects are visible to your eye, the laser sees around/through them. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wax the scratches.",
      "content": "Wax the scratches. Apply a very thin coat of petroleum jelly, chap-stick, liquid car wax, neutral shoe polish, or furniture wax to the CD's playing surface. Let the wax sit in the scratches for a few minutesâ€”remember, the idea is for the wax to fill in the scratch so it can be read again."

      "title": "Wipe away the excess wax.",
      "content": "Wipe away the excess wax. Using a clean, soft, lint-free cloth, wipe in a radial (inside-to-outside) motion. If using wax, follow the manufacturer's instructions (some need to dry before you wipe them off, while others should be wiped off while still wet)."

    {
      "title": "Test the disc again.",
      "content": "Test the disc again. If the wax or petroleum jelly does the trick, burn a new disc immediately. The waxing method is only a temporary solution meant to get the CD working long enough to transfer the data to a computer or new disc."

Before proceeding, you should come to terms with the fact that holes in the foil layer of a CD are not repairable, not even by professionals. The best way to move past them is to skip them altogether so that at least the remaining data can be accessed and saved elsewhere."
