This solution is ideal for getting rid of wasps in your home, as it doesn’t contain any harsh chemicals.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Virginia Cooperation Extension Publications and Educational resources from Virginia Tech and Virginia State University Go to source Don’t attempt to swat wasps if you have slow reflexes or haven’t practiced swatting, as you’re likely to get stung when the wasp flies away and tries to defend itself. If you don’t want to kill the wasp, Parker recommends trapping it and releasing it outside: “[Take a] cup and place it over the top of [the wasp] with a piece of paper to slide underneath that cup. Putting [the wasp] outside is a very easy, eco-friendly, and safe thing to do most of the time—unless you're allergic to wasps or bees.” [6] X Expert Source Chris Parker Founder, Parker Eco Pest Control Expert Interview. 14 May 2024."

Then, vacuum up 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of cornstarch to incapacitate them. While the vacuum is still running, open the vacuum canister, tape the opening of the bag, and then turn the vacuum off. Remove the bag and put it in the freezer overnight before throwing it away. [7] X Research source Make sure to use a vacuum that has a removable bag.

      "content": "Spray commercial wasp spray. One of the easiest and quickest ways to get rid of a wasp infestation is to use a store-bought wasp nest spray . These can be sprayed from up to 20 feet (6 m) away, so using one can reduce your risk of getting stung while handling the wasps. Put on some protective clothing and follow the instructions on the container to properly spray the wasps. Check the area for activity a few days later and repeat the treatment as necessary. [8] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source To reduce the risk of getting stung, spray the area at night, when the wasps are less active. Do not stand under the nest when you spray the wasps, as they may swarm or attack. Be sure to spray any potential nesting areas (like around your deck, pool, patio, etc.) as well so the wasps don’t come back. If you prefer a natural option, the dish soap and water (or essential oil) solution also works for wasps outdoors. The commercial spray may be more effective, however, and you don’t have to worry about breathing it in as much."

Place the trap in areas where the wasps are most active but away from areas in which people spend a lot of time. Hang them away from your outdoor living spaces and replace them frequently. [9] X Research source For example, place bait traps along your property line as far away from patios and protected areas as possible. Attach bait stations to a post or tree trunk near the wasps’ nest. If you don’t think they’ll harm other animals, hang glue traps from clotheslines or on flat surfaces where the wasps like to crawl around. These work best at the early stages of nest development, when the wasp population is small. Or, make your own drinking station bait with water and pyrethroid powder . Place a plant pot into a tray, then fill the tray with water and mix in a powder containing a pyrethroid (like permethrin) to kill the wasps. Put the pot in a sunny area so the wasps start to drink from it. Add fresh water every 1-2 days to attract more wasps and repeat the whole process every 3-5 days."

Apply 2 to 3 sprays around areas the wasps frequent, especially crevices or small areas where wasps would likely build a nest. Spray individual wasps until they’re coated and can’t fly away. If the WD-40 doesn’t kill them on its own, swat them. [10] X Research source Never spray near candles or a lit grill.

Stand far away from the nest so the wasps don’t fall on or attack you, and spray at night when they’re not as active. Wait 24 hours and check for activity. Repeat the process if necessary. [12] X Research source For the best results, apply the insecticide early in the season when the nest is still small. Other solutions like dish soap and water or essential oils and water may also work, but they aren’t as strong as wasp spray. If you do use a natural method, make sure the nest is completely coated."

Once you’re certain the insecticide has taken effect and there is no more activity, don your protective gear again and carefully knock the nest down with a long stick, pole, or broom. Again, do not stand directly underneath. Place the fallen nest in a heavy-duty plastic bag then dispose of it in an outdoor trash can with a tight-fitting lid. [13] X Research source If the nest is in a hard-to-reach area or you’re unsure you can safely remove it , call an exterminator instead. When the wasps are alive, you must knock the nest down on a regular basis to discourage the wasps. Expect to knock the nest down several times before the wasps give up and find somewhere else to build. If you have applied insecticide and most of the wasps are dead, saturate it with insecticide spray after knocking it down and then break it apart."

Then, at night while the wasps are asleep, pour a pot of boiling water down these passages. Stuff some soil into the holes after you have flooded the hive (unless the wasps begin to ascend from the nest). Always wear protection and be careful—this method can trigger a mass attack.

If you're not confident using chemical insecticides or are having trouble getting rid of wasps on your own, professional exterminators might be a safer alternative. If you have a wasp nest in the walls of your home, an exterminator can drill a hole in the window frame, floor, or wall near the nest's location, and then pump insecticides through this hole to reach the nest. [15] X Research source Hire a professional exterminator if you are on a limited timeframe—they have access to stronger chemicals, so the wasps might die more quickly. The price you can expect to pay varies depending on the size, location, and accessibility of the nest and infestation.

Purchase a decoy nest or make your own by hanging up a brown paper bag. If a real nest already exists, hang the fake within 200 feet (61 m) feet to encourage the wasps to leave. This method is most effective in the spring or summer, when wasps are first starting to appear for the season. Find fake wasp nests online or at your nearest big box store. Paper lanterns can also work. This method may not work late in the summer once wasps have already built their home. Consider hanging up other deterrents as well, like fake birds and animals."

Wasps are more active during the day, so this is when you’re most likely to see them. [24] X Research source If you notice a large number of wasps swarming around a particular area, like a tree or bush, stay away from that area until the wasps can be taken care of. Even if you don’t see wasps, pay attention to any buzzing sounds, as this could indicate that there’s an infestation somewhere you can’t see. Wasps also become more aggressive when they feel like their nest is being threatened, so if wasps are attacking more frequently, it probably means their nest is nearby."
