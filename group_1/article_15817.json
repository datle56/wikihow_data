      "content": "Respectueusement Respectueusement essentially means \"respectfully.\" You may use this semi-formal to formal phrase in addition to one of the more formal closings. For instance, you might write Veuillez agréer l'assurance de ma considération distinguée (“Please accept the assurance of my distinguished consideration”) at the end of your letter, then write Respectueusement just before your signature. [1] X Research source If you used a formal closing that ended with respectueux , use another word like cordialement before your signature so as not to repeat yourself."

      "title": "Cordialement",
      "content": "Cordialement Cordialement (which means “cordially”) is considered semi-formal, and it’s often used to close business emails—although it can also be used for letters. You can also add tres or bien to the front of the word to say “very cordially” or “kind regards,” respectively, and to give it a stronger meaning. Très cordialement is considered to be slightly more formal than cordialement , while bien cordialement is slightly less formal. [2] X Research source Cordialement is a standard choice when writing job applications, submitting complaint letters, or asking a professor or manager for a letter of recommendation."

    {
      "title": "Sincères salutations",
      "content": "Sincères salutations Sincères salutations is a semi-formal phrase that most closely translates to “best regards.” It’s best to reserve sincères salutations for letters and emails where you don’t personally know the recipient but have already established a relationship with them. For example, maybe this is the third or fourth email you’ve sent to this individual but you’ve never (or have hardly ever) interacted with them in person. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Avec mes remerciements",
      "content": "Avec mes remerciements This French closing phrase means “with my thanks,” which makes it an appropriately semi-formal ending to a professional letter where you’d like to express gratitude. Avec mes remerciements can also be added to the beginning of more formal phrases like veuillez recevoir mes salutations distinguées or je vous prie de croire à l'assurance de mes salutations distinguées.

      "title": "Merci par avance",
      "content": "Merci par avance This French expression translates to “thank you in advance” and while technically a semi-formal phrase, it’s typically applied to professional situations. Merci par avance allows you to express gratitude for something that someone is going to do for you before they’ve even done it, as you might to a colleague that you’ve asked a question to.

      "content": "En vous remerciant de l’attention que vous porterez à ma demande This formal phrase carries the same sentiment as the English “Thank you for giving attention to my request.” As the translation implies, it’s best used in business or professional situations where you’ve received a response for a request or issue you’ve raised with a formal contact."

      "title": "Je reste à votre disposition pour tout renseignement complémentaire",
      "content": "Je reste à votre disposition pour tout renseignement complémentaire This semi-formal phrase means, “Feel free to contact me for any further information.” Accordingly, it’s best used for letters and emails where you’ve explained a certain process or situation.

      "content": "Veuillez recevoir mes salutations distinguées This phrase—alternatively written as Veuillez recevoir, Monsieur/Madame, mes salutations distinguées —is used for general business or formal letters.

      "title": "Veuillez agréer l'assurance de ma considération distinguée",
      "content": "Veuillez agréer l'assurance de ma considération distinguée Literally translated to “Please accept the assurance of my distinguished consideration,” this French closing is used if you are writing to someone who would be considered your equal, or someone in a lower professional position than yourself. For example, you might use this expression if you were a business owner writing to a vendor. If you know the gender of the recipient, this phrase can also be written as Veuillez agréer, Monsieur/Madame, l'assurance de ma considération distinguée. [10] X Research source"

Alternatively, you can use the phrase veuillez agréer, Madame/Monsieur, l'expression de mes sincères salutations , which has the same meaning but is slightly more formal."

      "content": "Je vous prie d'agréer l'expression de mes sentiments respectueux This closing literally translates to “Please accept the expression of my respectful feelings.” Use this phrase if you are writing to someone who would generally be considered your superior, such as if you are applying for a job and sending a letter or email to the hiring manager or supervisor. It’s also a good choice for when you don’t know the name of your recipient. [11] X Research source If you know the gender of this individual, you can make your closing even more formal by adding monsieur or madame to the middle of the phrase—i.e., Je vous prie d'agréer, Monsieur/Madame, l'expression de mes sentiments respectueux."

      "title": "Je vous prie de croire à l'assurance de mes salutations distinguées",
      "content": "Je vous prie de croire à l'assurance de mes salutations distinguées This closing is most commonly used when writing to a dignitary or elected official, although it can be used in other scenarios.

      "title": "Amicalement",
      "content": "Amicalement Amicalement is a word with a meaning similar to “kindly” or \"best wishes\" in English. Because it’s informal but still polite, amicalemente is most appropriate for letters and emails that are addressed to acquaintances and friends who are older than you. You may also add bien to the beginning of the word to mean “in friendship.” [13] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Affectueusement",

    {
      "title": "Amitiés",
      "content": "Amitiés This informal closing means “best wishes” or “all the best” in English. It’s a common email sign-off used by French speakers, largely because it’s appropriate to use regardless of how close you are to the recipient. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "À bientôt / à plus tard / A+",
      "content": "À bientôt / à plus tard / A+ Both à bientôt and à plus tard mean “see you soon” in English, making them good sign-off choices when you’re expecting to see the recipient of your letter in the coming hours or days. A plus tard is also often shortened to A+ in texts and emails. All three of these variations are most appropriate in very informal letters or emails, although they’re primarily used in digital correspondence. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "À demain / À la semaine prochaine",
      "content": "À demain / À la semaine prochaine À demain means “see you tomorrow,” while à la semaine prochaine means “see you next week.” Both of these sign-offs are similar to à bientôt and à plus tard (which means “see you soon”), but they’re much more specific.

      "title": "Bises / Bisous / Gros bisous",
      "content": "Bises / Bisous / Gros bisous Bises, bisous, and gros bisous are all ways to say “kisses” in French. Gros bisous is more emphatic, literally meaning “big kisses,” and bises is more casual (like the written version of a cheek kiss). Unsurprisingly, these intimate letter and email closings are reserved for very close relations—like immediate relatives and close friends. [20] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Je t’embrasse",
      "content": "Je t’embrasse Je t’embrasse roughly translates to the English closing “lots of hugs.” Because this phrase is warm and informal, it’s best used as a closing for letters to extended family members. If you wouldn’t walk up to the recipient and give them a hug in person, then it’s probably better to go with a slightly more formal option."

      "title": "Embrasse ___ pour moi",

When writing a letter to either a professional or personal acquaintance, it’s customary to address the recipient with some variation of cher , which means “dear” in French.
