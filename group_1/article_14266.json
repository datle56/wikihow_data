      "title": "A doctor will anesthetize the area.",
      "content": "A doctor will anesthetize the area. Getting a cyst drained requires local or general anesthesia, depending on the severity of the cyst. Before draining your cyst, your doctor will administer local or general anesthesia to prevent you from feeling any pain from the procedure. For a small skin cyst, only local anesthesia may be necessary, and these procedures can often be performed in the doctor's office. If the cyst is deep or large, then general anesthesia may be necessary. This may require a hospital visit, but is usually an outpatient surgery.
