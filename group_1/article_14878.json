      "content": "Get a bottle each of Grand Marnier, Kahlua, and Baileys Irish Cream. You will use an even ratio of each liquor in the shot, so get bottles of the same size if you plan on making a lot. Put all the bottles in front of you on a bar or table so you’re ready to prepare this classic layered shot! [1] X Research source You can also use homemade Baileys Irish Cream in the shot. Use another type of coffee liqueur instead of Kahlua if you don’t have it."

      "content": "Fill 1/3 of a shot glass with Kahlua or other coffee liqueur. This is the easiest layer of the shot to pour and you don’t need any special technique. Pour slowly so that you don’t fill more than 1/3 of the shot glass. [2] X Research source Repeat this in multiple shot glasses if you are preparing more than 1 shot."

      "content": "Pour Baileys Irish Cream slowly over the back of a spoon into the glass. Stop pouring when the shot glass is 2/3 full. When you pour over the back of the spoon it slows the flow of the liquor enough so that the layers won’t mix. [3] X Research source A long-handled bar spoon is ideal for preparing this shot. If you don’t have a bar spoon use a medium-sized dining spoon."

The B-52 shot is now ready to drink! [4] X Research source As an alternative to a spoon, use a pourer spout on your bottle of liquor. Hold the pourer spout against the side of the glass and very slowly let the liquor pour out down the side of the shot glass. [5] X Research source"
