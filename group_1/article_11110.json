      "content": "Cut out or reduce the amount of sugars and artificial sweeteners you eat during the initial stages of your treatment. Fructose, which is found in most fruits and honey, and artificial sweeteners like Saccharin and nutrasweet, should be cut out of your diet while you work on getting better. This is because these sweets can create a good growing environment for yeast, which combats the work you are doing to try to get rid of the yeast.

      "content": "Cut back on your alcohol intake. When yeast has infected your body, the yeast actually breaks down carbohydrates you consume and turns it into a form of ethyl alcohol. Drinking more alcohol while this process is occurring will only increase the number of yeast colonies in your body. You should stop drinking alcohol of any kind for at least the first two months of your treatment. If you start drinking again after this time period, it should be in very small amounts."

While the diet itself is not a definitive cure, it can help neutralize the harm the yeast is causing your body. The average yeast control diet contains little or no sugar, no processed food and very low carbohydrate consumption. High amount of proteins (except those derived from gluten and soya) must be consumed. Eat vegetables like cabbage, lettuce, kale, mustard greens, horseradish, celery, pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, beans, onions, tomatoes and garlic. Cook with coconut, fish, or palm oil, rather than butter. Meat and fat in your diet should be derived from grass fed animals while fish should be free from contamination of mercury."
