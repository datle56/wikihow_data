While trying to get back into breastfeeding, try feeding your baby from a bottle once or twice a day instead of for every feeding. [1] X Research source To make it easier to switch back and forth, try using a round bottle nipple to mimic the feeling of a real breast. Using a slow flow bottle nipple or routinely taking the bottle out of your baby’s mouth between every 20-30 sucks (paced feeding) can simulate breastfeeding and help them switch between feeding methods, as well. Offer the breast or a finger instead of a pacifier whenever it seems like the baby wants to suck.

      "content": "Express a little milk before offering the breast to your baby. If your baby is used to the fast, immediate flow of milk that comes from a bottle, they may get frustrated while breastfeeding. Manually express or use a pump so your milk lets down before letting your baby latch so they're immediately rewarded with milk. [5] X Research source If you can, try manually expressing milk directly into your baby's mouth so they're eager to nurse. If you’re unable to express milk, try dripping a little bit of water on your breast so that it goes into your baby’s mouth."

      "content": "Check your baby's latch to ensure they're sucking effectively. Bring your baby to your breast when their mouth is wide open so they’re able to take more of the areola in their mouth. If the baby's latch is good, you'll soon hear swallowing. [7] X Research source To encourage a good latch, hold your baby somewhat upright, support their head, and align their nose with your nipple. Tilt their head back and pull them in quickly and gently when they open their mouth. Try to get more of your areola pressing against their chin than their nose. If breastfeeding is painful, take the baby off of your breast and try to latch again."
