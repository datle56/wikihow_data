Check inside the connectors on the cable and in the ports on your monitor and computer for dirt, debris, or damage to the pins. If dirt or debris is inside the cable connector or the ports, you can remove it using a can of compressed air. Aim the straw attachment inside the port or plug and release quick bursts of air. If debris is still inside, you can try to remove it with a thin toothpick. Be careful not to damage the port or the plug."

If your monitor has multiple DisplayPort inputs, try using a different one to rule out the possibility that the DisplayPort input may not be working. You can also try using an HDMI cable. If you are able to get a signal while using an HDMI cable, use that temporarily while you do further troubleshooting, even if you intend to use a DisplayPort cable. If you are setting up a new computer and just installed a new graphics card , try temporarily connecting to the display output in your motherboard rather than your graphics card. This will allow you to get a signal while you install the graphics drivers and troubleshoot your PC."
