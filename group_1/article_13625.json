      "content": "Read and study as much as possible about the religion. If you don’t have a priest or priestess in your area, it’s still possible to learn about Voodoo. Study the history of Voodoo, including the origins of the Haitian Vodou practice and how Voodoo evolved in America to avoid misconceptions about Voodoo. [1] X Research source Look for books from authoritative sources like scholars or practitioners to make sure you find the best information possible."

      "content": "Join online Voodoo communities. In America, most Voodoo practitioners seem to be clustered in areas like Louisiana and New York, which can make it difficult to find community if you aren’t in those areas. [2] X Research source Because of this, many believers have created online communities where they share their beliefs and practices. Look on sites like Reddit and Facebook to find groups, and engage with others to find support and guidance as you learn about Voodoo. Be aware that not everyone you encounter will be extremely knowledgeable about the practice. Research any advice you receive to ensure it’s supported by evidence."

      "title": "Find a priest or priestess to initiate you.",
      "content": "Find a priest or priestess to initiate you. While this is up for debate among some believers, many Voodoo followers believe you must be initiated into the religion before you can practice. Ask around or look online to see if there are any Houngans (priests) or Mambos (priestesses) in your area who are willing to teach you. This is often the best way to learn which Voodoo practices are authentic and which were misconstrued by Western media. [3] X Research source Some believe that you do not have to be initiated and can practice as long as you are respectful and understand Voodoo beliefs. If you’re unsure whether you should get initiated, try reaching out to current practitioners to get their opinions. There are many ways to practice Voodoo, so it may depend on the beliefs of each path."

Instead, it’s about connecting with ancestors and spirits to help guide you on your journey. Learn about spirits like the loa and begin finding ways to connect with them through rituals, offerings, and meditation . [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Be respectful at all times.",
      "content": "Be respectful at all times. Voodoo is a deeply spiritual practice that can be very personal for believers, especially given its history with enslaved Africans. Be sensitive when approaching the religion, and be open-minded if a practitioner approaches you about cultural appropriation. [5] X Research source Many practitioners believe anyone can practice Voodoo regardless of their background, while others feel it should be reserved for Africans and those of African descent."

      "content": "Focus your mind on a specific person. Your voodoo doll needs to represent an individual person, so while you’re making yours, picture them in your mind. Voodoo depends on a connection between the visible world that we live in and the invisible world where spirits reside. Concentrate on the person you want your doll to represent to channel their spirit from the invisible realm. [6] X Research source It’s important to note that voodoo dolls as depicted in Western media are not typically used in the traditional Haitian practice of Vodou, from which the Western idea of Voodoo originates. It’s likely that voodoo dolls actually originated from European practices, like poppets. [7] X Research source Before trying to do Voodoo, research the practices and belief system to make sure it’s right for you. Most practitioners believe anyone can practice voodoo if they respect, love, and understand the belief and its culture. Otherwise, it may be considered cultural appropriation."

A voodoo doll needs to represent a specific person, and an easy way to do that is to attach a picture of that person to a doll in the shape of the human figure. [8] X Research source Collect or print out a picture of the person that you want your voodoo doll to represent and cut out their figure. If you don’t have a picture of the person, use a personal item that you collected from them, like a lock of hair or a piece of their clothing."

Then, sew the picture onto the fabric, leaving an opening at the bottom. Fill the doll with stuffing, then sew the opening closed. [9] X Research source Use any fabric you like. Natural fibers like cotton, wool, or hemp give the doll a more authentic feeling. Any material will work for stuffing, as well, but for a more authentic voodoo doll, use natural materials like moss or leaves."

      "content": "Visualize the purpose for your voodoo doll. After you’ve added the personal effects of the person to the doll, their energy pattern is imprinted and fused with the doll. Close your eyes and set an intention with the doll, like to heal the person it represents, for example. It’s generally best to use the doll for good, as many traditional Vodou practitioners do not believe in using the craft to cause harm. It is ultimately up to you, however. [10] X Research source Hold the doll and channel all of your energy into your intention. Picture exactly what you want to happen. For example, if you intend to use the doll to heal someone of an illness , imagine the doll absorbing the illness and the living person being happy and healthy. It may also help to mentally or verbally say what you want to happen."

      "content": "Call upon one of the loa to help ensure that the spell works. Focus on one of the loa, or Voodoo deities, and ask them to help make sure that the doll embodies the person you intend it to, like praying to any other deity. It may also help to leave offerings of food, flowers, or items that represent the loa you’re calling upon. Ask the loa to help you accomplish your goal with the doll, be it good or evil. [11] X Research source You can also make a voodoo doll that contains the spirit of a loa to serve you. For example, concentrate on Ogun (the warrior loa) while you make your doll to channel his courage and bravery into your doll. Go to your local library or look online to research the loa so you can choose one that corresponds with your voodoo doll. This research is also a great way to learn what offerings to leave for each loa. For example, Agwe is a loa associated with the sea, so you may offer him shells or depictions of boats.

The final step of infusing a person’s energy into your voodoo doll is to baptize it with water, repeat the baptizing prayer, and state the person’s name in the prayer. Drizzle water over the doll and repeat the prayer 2 times, making the sign of the cross before you begin the prayer. [13] X Research source State the prayer as follows: “I baptize you, (Person’s Name), all that I do to this doll, I do to you. Amen.” Use holy water or bless a vial of water. Get holy water by visiting a Catholic church, or bless the water yourself by saying a prayer over it. Cleanse the doll or release the spirit by baptizing it in salt water."

If you want a specific person to love you , make a voodoo doll that is infused with their energy and pin it next to your pillow when you go to sleep. Speak to the voodoo doll and imagine that you are speaking to the person you want to love you. Because visualization and intent are such an important part of Voodoo practices, it is believed that the person’s soul will hear your voice and want to be with you. [14] X Research source Some people also believe pinning the voodoo doll to your bed will prevent the person you want from having physical contact with another person. Still, ultimately, your desired results are up to your intent. Be aware that there is no scientific or proven evidence that this love spell, or any love spells in this section, work."

However, for this specific Voodoo love spell, you need to be in physical contact with the person you’re trying to attract. [15] X Research source Take 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable cooking oil, place one of your eyelashes in it, and allow it to sit overnight. Have the person you want to be your soulmate dip their index finger in the oil for 1 minute. Apply the oil from their finger to your lips and kiss them. According to Voodoo belief, the person will then become your soulmate. However, the person needs to be already attracted to you in order for the spell to work."

Then, write your name 5 times on the right side of the paper. Melt purple candle wax, drip 4 drops of wax onto the left side of the paper, and fold the paper so the wax seals it. Lastly, place the paper in a dish, cover it with water, and burn a red candle on top of the paper. Red is not only associated with love and passion, but it’s also often used in Voodoo rituals to invoke the energy of the loa. [16] X Research source As the red candle wax melts into the water, Voodoo belief says that the person will become attracted to you. Binding spells can also be used for protection or to stop someone’s influence."

The 2 numbers put together make up your lucky number for the love spell. Write your lucky number on the inside of every pair of underwear that you own. This may be based on numerology , in which the number of letters in your full name represents your life path or destiny number. [17] X Research source For example, if the person you desire is named Timothy Smith, then your lucky number would be 75. Timothy has 7 letters, and Smith has 5 letters."

      "content": "Voodoo is a spiritual practice based on Haitian and Catholic beliefs. Depending on where and how it is practiced, it is also known as Vodou or Vodun. The exact practices and beliefs vary from region to region, but at its core, Vodou believes that a divine force called Bondye created the universe. It combines cultural and spiritual practices from West and Central African cultures with those of Roman Catholicism. [21] X Research source Vodou is sometimes considered both monotheistic and polytheistic, as practitioners believe Bondye alone created the universe, but they communicate with other deities or spirits known as the loa. These are sometimes compared to Catholic saints. Vodou priests are called Houngans, and priestesses are called Mambos. Together, they facilitate ceremonies for devotees to honor the loa. These ceremonies often include rhythmic drumming, dancing, and chanting. Vodou is commonly practiced in or has historical roots in Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, and Barbados."

Instead, common practices include the performance of rituals and offering gifts to the loa to gain their favor, practicing divination before casting a spell to gain insight and guidance from the loa, and using rhythmic chants, prayers, and incantations to invoke the presence and assistance of the loa. Practitioners may also cast healing/protection and love/relationship spells. [22] X Research source Some common offerings include food, drink, candles, flowers, and items that symbolize the desired outcome of the ritual or spell. Practitioners often incorporate visualization and symbolism into their spells, as well. This practice is where the idea of voodoo dolls comes into play, though they are not typically used the way they are in Western media."

      "content": "Vodou originated in Haiti in the 17th century. Haitian Vodou comprises aspects of various religions from Africa, mainly from the Vodun religion of Dahomey (modern-day Benin). Vodou was brought to Haiti by an enslaved person who was captured from Dahomey, where many tribes shared similar religious beliefs about worshiping family ancestors and being possessed by spirits. When these peoples were enslaved, they created the Vodou religion from their shared beliefs. [23] X Research source"

      "content": "Vodou was evolved into Voodoo by followers in the state of Louisiana. As enslaved people were brought to America, specifically Louisiana, they continued to practice Vodou, which enslavers prohibited. In an attempt to put a stop to the practice, the enslavers threatened the enslaved people and baptized them as Catholics. Rather than converting them, Catholic traditions were instead adopted into the practice. Over time, Vodou became known as Voodoo or Voodoo-Catholicism. [24] X Research source After the 1791 slave revolt in Haiti, many formerly enslaved people migrated to Louisiana, as well, which helped the practice spread even further. Voodoo kings and queens became important spiritual and political figures in 1800s New Orleans. The most famous Voodoo queen was Marie Laveau, a free woman of color who helped enslaved servants and escapees. It is said that she was feared and respected by white men even during the time of slavery. The word “Voodoo” comes from the Fon language of the kingdom of Dahomey (present-day Benin) and roughly translates to “god” or “spirit.” [25] X Research source"

While Voodoo has become commercialized and appropriated to attract tourists, many modern-day practitioners still incorporate their beliefs into their everyday lives. Rituals are typically held privately, but there is a formally established temple called the Voodoo Spiritual Temple in New Orleans. The New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum is also a great place to learn about the practice. [26] X Research source A Voodoo celebration, St. John’s Eve, is still celebrated on June 23rd each year for the summer solstice. This celebration began in the 1830s with Marie Laveau on Bayou St. John as a head-washing ritual and public party."

      "content": "Voodoo is not evil, and it is not black magic. Because of its portrayal in Western media, Voodoo has faced many misconceptions and prejudices from non-practitioners. Despite how it’s often depicted, Voodoo is not about voodoo dolls, zombies, and spiritual possession. Instead, true voodoo is about strength, identity, and cultural preservation. [27] X Research source Practitioners typically do not seek to do harm to others; instead, Voodoo is a personal religion that allows them to connect with spirits for guidance. In some practices, it is believed that practitioners do become possessed by the loa, during which the loa gives advice or prophecies for future events. This experience is often considered a privilege in many Voodoo traditions and is nothing to be frightened of. [28] X Research source In many cultures, Voodoo leaders are also community leaders who provide guidance, settle disputes, and provide medical care to others. Voodoo practitioners also do not worship the devil, as the devil is not a religious figure in their beliefs."
