Let your nails air dry for about a minute, then put them in a bowl of ice water for 3 minutes. Carefully remove them from the bowl, dry them, and go about your day.

      "content": "A blast of cold air can speed up the nail-drying process. If your hairdryer has a cool setting, use it to your advantage! Paint your nails, then run the cool air over them for 2 to 3 minutes. Do this between each coat, and your nails will dry super fast. Never use the hot heat setting on your nails. Hot air will melt polish, causing it to ripple and bubble, destroying your manicure. If you’re in a pinch and don’t have a blow dryer handy, try using a fan instead."

      "content": "A spritz or two from an air duster can dry your nails quickly. Have a can of compressed air sitting on your desk? Well, consider using it to dry your nails. Let your nails air dry for about 10 minutes. Hold the can about 1 to 2 ft (0.30 to 0.61 m) away from your hands, and do a quick 3 second spray over each nail. Double check that the nozzle is angled toward your nail before spraying. This works best on mostly dried nails, as spraying too much compressed air on wet nails could dent your manicure."

      "content": "Cooking spray and hairspray add shine while drying your manicure It may seem odd, but this hack is foolproof! Simply paint your nails, wait 2 minutes for them to dry, and then spray them with hairspray or cooking spray (holding the canister about 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 ft (0.15 to 0.30 m) away from your nails). Wait 30 minutes, then continue your day as normal. [2] X Research source Cooking spray helps moisturize your cuticles but may leave your fingers feeling greasy. Make sure to use air-compressed hairspray for this hack. Consider the smell of your cooking spray or hairspray. For instance, a butter cooking spray will make your fingers smell buttery."

All you have to do is drip a drop of your preferred oil on your painted nails. Let the oil soak into the paint as it dries. When the oil starts to bead on top of the paint, gently wipe it off with a cotton ball. [3] X Research source Avoid pressing down on your nail when wiping off the oil, as this could cause the polish to smudge."

      "content": "The thinner your nail polish is, the faster it’ll dry. Painting on multiple layers of nail polish may seem counterintuitive, but it can actually help your manicure dry quickly. Wipe off a bit of polish from the applicator brush before painting each nail. Let the polish dry for about 3 minutes between each coat. [7] X Expert Source Kristin Pulaski Salon Owner & Nail Specialist Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. Nail polish won’t dry completely if applied in heavy layers. Always paint your nails one by one and repeat the painting order with each layer. This way, each nail gets the same amount of time to dry in between coats."
