      "content": "Refrain from arguing. The decision to terminate your employment has already been made. Nothing you can say, at this point, will change your employer’s decision.

[2] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. However, it’s best not to let your emotions get the best of you. Whether you feel sad or angry, take a deep breath, remain calm, and try not to cause a scene. Practice breathing exercises if you feel like you're about to have an emotional outburst. Excuse yourself for a moment and then breathe in slowly while you count to 10. Hold your breath for a moment, and then slowly breathe out while counting to 10 again. Do this until you feel like you have a better grasp on your emotions."

[5] X Research source Check your state’s Department of Labor website for information about any relevant local regulations. Check your new hire paperwork to see if the contract gives you any special rights. There are cases where a contract will actually make you liable to pay back compensation if you are fired. If you were paid for relocation expenses, you will typically be required to work for the company for a certain period of time or become liable to repay the benefits given you. Most contracts only stipulate this if you quit or were fired with good cause, but your employer can write the contract so as to make you liable in all situations. [6] X Research source"

It is wrongful termination if there is any evidence that you have been fired because of discrimination against you on the basis of your race, national origin, gender, age, religion, pregnancy, family status, veteran status, disability, and, in some states, sexual orientation. Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Idaho, Massachusetts, Nevada, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming have laws that allow you to sue if you believe your employer did not have just cause. Unjust terminations include, firing an employee to prevent them from collecting sales commissions, misleading employees about prospects for promotion, and terminating someone to replace them with a person who is willing work for less.
