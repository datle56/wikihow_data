First, if you've already started writing your paper in Google Docs, we don't bother with the template—trying to work what you've already written into a template will take more time than making minor tweaks to your paper. So, jump down to Setting Margins to get started! But if you haven't written anything yet, you can use the MLA template to set your margins, enable double-spacing, set the right font, and even position the title and header. To use the template: Go to https://docs.google.com and log in. Click the Template gallery menu at the top. Scroll down to the \"Education\" section. Click the Report template that says \"MLA\" beneath it to create your new document."

[2] X Research source We're not sure why it's in Google's template, because it's not advised by the MLA or mentioned in the Purdue Owl, we advise you to fix it, as your instructor might think you've made a mistake. Here's how: Place your cursor at the end of the date. Press the delete key on your keyboard once—this will move the title awkwardly close to the date. Press Enter or Return to get the title back onto its own line. Recenter the title.
