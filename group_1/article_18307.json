      "content": "Brush dry hair straight back to smooth it down. Use a paddle brush or wide-toothed comb to get rid of any tangles and knots in your hair, starting at your ends and working up to the roots. Then, instead of parting your hair like your normally would, brush it straight back. [1] X Research source Tangled hair can get snagged on the frosting cap as you try to pull the hair through the cap’s holes, so it’s important to detangle it thoroughly before you begin. If you’re dealing with a lot of tangles, consider spraying a light layer of detangling product all over your hair before you brush it out. Frosting caps work best on short to medium length hair. If your hair is long enough to pull through the cap, you can frost it. It's possible to use a frosting cap on long hair, but pulling long hair through the cap can be tedious. Longer hair is also more prone to tangling during the process."

      "content": "Pull the frosting cap onto your head so that it fits snugly. Hold the cap with both hands and, starting at the hairline, pull it over the front of your head and tug the rest of the cap down over the crown of your head. Keep pulling down until the cap is snug against your skull. [2] X Research source Your hair should be falling loosely over your shoulders and sticking out of the bottom of the cap. You don’t need to pull the lengths of your hair up into the cap. A snug fit is crucial so that the bleach will reach the root of the hair after you pull it through the cap. If there’s a gap between the cap and your skull, you won’t be able to access the roots. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Tie the straps under your chin to secure the frosting cap in place. Frosting caps have straps on each side so that you can fasten it snugly. Grab the strings and tie them into a bow under your chin. Be sure to tie the strings snugly, but don’t tie them so tight that it hurts. [4] X Research source If the front part of the frosting cap is hanging over your eyes after you tie it, simply fold or cut that part away. You want the cap to cling to your head right in front of the hairline."

Locate the row of holes on the frosting cap right behind the hairline and select a hole as your starting point. Hold the highlighting needle at an angle and keep the hook pointed upward as you insert it into the perforated hole. Gently push the highlighting needle until the hooked end is resting against the scalp. [5] X Research source It’s important to work from front to back so that you get even results, but if you start right at the hairline, your hair will look stripy when you wear it up. Be careful inserting the needle. Use a light touch and don’t go in vertically. Always hold the needle at an angle."

Once you’ve hooked the hair, pull the highlighting needle away from your head to bring the hair through the perforation onto the outside of the cap. Be sure to pull the entire section of hair out of the hole so that it is neatly hanging outside of the cap. The hair should be exposed from root to tip.

      "content": "Continue pulling hair through the holes in a strategic way. If you pull hair out of every hole, you’ll achieve very dramatic highlights. If you want more subtle highlights, follow a particular pattern, like skipping every other hole. Work systematically from the hairline back to the crown. Then, move to a new section at the hairline and keep pulling hair out using the same pattern. [8] X Research source Most frosting caps have circles or numbers close to the holes to make strategic placement easy. Use the guides to help you remain consistent. The amount of hair you pull out of each hole can vary, depending on the results you want. For example, if you want dramatic highlights around the face, pull larger sections of hair out around the hairline."

Before you start the bleaching process, comb through the sections of hair with a fine-toothed comb.
