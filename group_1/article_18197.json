      "title": "Cut a small portion of the wrapper near the tip.",
      "content": "Cut a small portion of the wrapper near the tip. Put a piece of paper down to catch your tobacco in the event that you drop the cigar or the plastic wrapper falls off. Hold the Black and Mild vertically with the end of the cigar facing down. Use a pair of scissors to snip off the top 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of the wrapper and throw it out. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Black and Mild cigars come with a wood or plastic tip. The process is the same for both versions of the cigar. If you don’t have a pair of scissors, you can peel the wrapper where it’s sealed at the top. This will make it harder to pour the tobacco back in though."

      "title": "Roll the cigar between your palms to loosen the tobacco.",
      "content": "Roll the cigar between your palms to loosen the tobacco. With the plastic wrapper still on, point the open end of the cigar down and begin to rub it lightly between your open palms near the end of the cigar. This will loosen the tobacco, which will begin to fall out into the bottom of your wrapper. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Be careful not to crush the paper and damage the cigar. Start rubbing gently and slowly to remove the tobacco."

      "title": "Move the plastic wrapper down as you roll the cigar to create space.",
      "content": "Move the plastic wrapper down as you roll the cigar to create space. As the tobacco begins to fall out of the cigar, you’ll run out of space at the bottom of your wrapper. To create more room for the tobacco, slide the wrapper down your cigar a little bit without fully removing it. Continue moving the wrapper down as you need to make more space. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because the wrapper is bigger than the cigar itself, you shouldn’t need to fully remove it from the plastic wrap to make enough space."

      "title": "Use your thumb and index finger to roll the section near the tip.",
      "content": "Use your thumb and index finger to roll the section near the tip. Once you’ve gotten all the way to the top of the cigar, roll the sensitive section near the tip with your thumb and index finger. The paper is glued into the tip, so if you squeeze too hard, you’ll risk breaking the glue and separating the cigar from the tip. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If the tip does fall of, you can pinch the cigar back into the tip. The quality of your smoke won’t be as good though."

      "title": "Pinch the plastic or wood tip to remove the tobacco stuck in the tip.",
      "content": "Pinch the plastic or wood tip to remove the tobacco stuck in the tip. There’s going to be a little bit of tobacco stuffed in the opening of your cigar where the tip is. To dislodge it, pinch the upper portion of the tip between your thumb and index finger on each side and then flick the tip lightly with your fingernail to knock it out. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Set the wrapper aside once the tobacco is fully removed.",
      "content": "Set the wrapper aside once the tobacco is fully removed. Once you’re confident that you’ve removed almost all of the tobacco, slide the wrapper off and put it down on your piece of paper. Fold it down at the top to prevent loose tobacco from falling out. [6] X Research source You can cut a 45-degree angle into the end of the wrapper that you initially cut to make it easier to pour back in later on."

      "title": "Tap your cigar and hold it with the end facing up.",
      "content": "Tap your cigar and hold it with the end facing up. Give your cigar a final tap on the tip to knock out any remaining pieces of tobacco. Turn your cigar over so that you’re looking down the hollowed-out paper. If you look closely, you’ll see an additional layer of paper lining the inside of the cigar. This is the filter paper that you’re going to remove. [7] X Research source Blow on the tip of the cigar to get out any remaining shreds of tobacco. Keep the tip on the cigar. You don’t need to remove it to remove the paper."

      "title": "Pinch the paper near the top of the cigar with your fingers and roll it.",
      "content": "Pinch the paper near the top of the cigar with your fingers and roll it. Hold the body of the cigar loosely in your nondominant hand. Pinch the top of the paper with your free hand, using your thumb and index finger to close the opening. Roll it back and forth between your fingers by rubbing your index finger to the right as your thumb rolls to the left. Reverse the direction quickly and repeat the process until the filter paper becomes loose. [8] X Research source Use your nondominant hand to keep the cigar stationary as you roll."

      "title": "Loosen your grip and continue rolling to separate the filter paper.",
      "content": "Loosen your grip and continue rolling to separate the filter paper. As soon as you see a separation between the filter paper and the cigar, open your fingers up a little and continue to roll the tip of the cigar. You will see the filter paper begin to separate from the Black and Mild. Continue rolling the paper for an additional 45-60 seconds until the filter paper is visibly loose. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Pinch the filter paper and pull it out carefully.",
      "content": "Pinch the filter paper and pull it out carefully. Turn your cigar sideways and carefully pinch the top of the filter paper between your dominant thumb and index finger. Slowly remove the paper by pulling it straight out of the cigar. [10] X Research source If the paper isn’t loose enough, you may need to roll the cigar in the middle. If you do, avoid crushing the cigar paper by rolling it delicately. You can use a pair of tweezers if you aren’t confident that you can pull the paper out without breaking the cigar."

      "title": "Discard the filter paper.",
      "content": "Discard the filter paper. If you’re removing the filter paper for flavor or because you believe that it is unhealthy, throw the paper in the trash. If you’re removing it to slow the rate that the cigar burns, you can still use the filter paper as a filter without burning it by sticking a piece of it back at the bottom of the cigar. Cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece off and roll it into a very tight ball. Insert it into the cigar and let it fall into the tip before packing the tobacco back in. [11] X Research source Adding a ball of filter paper back to the cigar will prevent the tobacco from getting into your mouth while smoking, and will create a kind of filter without having to burn it."

      "title": "Tap the tip on the table and pick your wrapper up.",
      "content": "Tap the tip on the table and pick your wrapper up. Tap the plastic or wood tip on the table to knock the cigar paper all the way down in the tip. Take your plastic wrapper and undo the fold at the top. In your nondominant hand, pick up the cigar and tilt it a 45-degree angle to make tobacco pouring easier. [12] X Research source Make sure that you’re holding your cigar and wrapper over the sheet of paper that you put down in the event that you accidentally pour some of the tobacco out."

      "title": "Pour the tobacco back into the cigar from the plastic wrapper.",
      "content": "Pour the tobacco back into the cigar from the plastic wrapper. Lift your wrapper over the edge of your empty cigar to add the tobacco. Raise the closed end slowly without moving the mouth of the wrapper to avoid losing control as your pour. Tap the wrapper with a finger as you pour it to dislodge any tobacco that is stuck to the sides of the plastic. [13] X Research source It's hard to get all the tobacco in, so don't force it or you’ll risk ripping the paper. Some people like to leave a bit of room at the tip and fold the paper over until they're ready to smoke."

      "title": "Pack the tobacco down with your finger or a pen before smoking.",
      "content": "Pack the tobacco down with your finger or a pen before smoking. Push the tobacco down a little bit to get a more consistent smoking experience. To pack the tobacco down, press on the area near the tip with a pen or your index finger while bracing the body of the cigar in your nondominant hand. This will push the tobacco down while keeping the paper intact. [14] X Research source Keep an eye on the cigar paper while you pack the tobacco. If it starts to bend or crease, stop packing so you don’t break it."
