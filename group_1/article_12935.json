      "title": "Understand cold diffusion.",
      "content": "Understand cold diffusion. Diffusion is, by definition, a spontaneous and random process. This means no heat should be added because then the process no longer spontaneous. While heated diffusion is popular, heating essential oils also decreases their effectiveness. Heating can cause chemical reactions in the essential oil, changing the types of substances in that oil and causing an allergic response. Essential oils are also flammable, which means heating them is an unnecessary risk. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow the scent to diffuse from bottle.",
      "content": "Allow the scent to diffuse from bottle. The easiest method to diffuse an essential oil is to open the bottle of the essential oil. When you do this, wave your open hand over the top of the bottle and inhale from the air you are wafting from the bottle. You can also put the oil in a bowl and sniff directly from the bowl. This will help alleviate how strong the oil is directly from the bottle because it is less concentrated. Avoid directly sniffing out of the bottle. Essential oils are very strong and may cause strong reactions."

      "content": "Soak a cotton ball. You can also try soaking a cotton ball in the essential oil of your choice. The cotton ball can be held under your nose, placed in a cup, or laid out in a room to diffuse the oil. Bring it to your nose and mouth and move it gently so that the aroma wafts toward you. You can also use a piece of cotton cloth, a towel, or a gauze pad. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use warm water.",
      "content": "Use warm water. For more rapid diffusion of your essential oils, you can place a few drops of it into warm water. Make sure the water isn’t warmer than your body temperature so it doesn’t change the composition of the oil. To use this method, place the warm water and the bowl of oils in a central location in the room you’re in. You can also sniff from this bowl as well if you want a more concentrated sniff of the oils.

      "title": "Rub it into your skin.",
      "content": "Rub it into your skin. If you want a more direct placement of the essential oils, you can rub it into your skin. Place a drop of the essential oil on your wrists, chest, or temples. This will allow the essential oil to diffuse in the air around you. If you want, you can also rub some into your palms and bring them to your face to sniff in the aroma of the oils.

      "title": "Use a fan.",
      "content": "Use a fan. A method that increases the rate of diffusion is fanning. Place a few drops of the essential oil into water and placing the bowl near a fan. You can also place it about six to 12 inches from any source of blowing air. During cool weather, place the bowl about a foot away from a heat register. Make sure it isn't too close. It’s not likely that the heat can present a safety hazard, but you do not want to overheat the essential oils. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use terracotta or sandstone diffusers.",
      "content": "Use terracotta or sandstone diffusers. These diffusers, which can be bought at many different department stores, are highly porous. They allow the essential oils to diffuse first into the stone and then into the air. These can be placed or hung wherever they can be most useful, such as high traffic areas or in a doorway. People walking by will cause waves of air to move by the diffusers. You can also place these diffusers in front of a fan. Once the oil evaporates, you will have to refill it. You can also buy necklaces specifically designed to do this as well, which are worn around the neck."

      "title": "Buy an electric fan diffuser.",
      "content": "Buy an electric fan diffuser. Electric fan diffusers are available in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and styles. These typically come with pads that are used to soak up the oils. The oils can evaporate quickly on these, but the pads are changeable. Avoid any diffuser that heats the oils unless there are settings on the diffuser that you can set to approximate body temperature."

      "title": "Try a nebulizers or atomizers.",
      "content": "Try a nebulizers or atomizers. Nebulizers and atomizers are like humidifiers. They break up the oil into smaller droplets so they diffuse more easily. These usually contain two basic components, a base that contains the motor for the nebulizer and a glass or plastic bowl where the essential oil is placed. Glass is preferable to plastic bowls because essential oils won’t stick to glass as much as they will to plastic. Be careful with the glass bowl, because they can be expensive to replace. There are a number of companies and businesses, both online and in stores, that sell these types of diffusers. See which type seems best to you, and check to see if there are any reviews or customer comments to find the best ones."
