      "content": "They put others down to make themselves look better. Manipulators often use criticism as a way to make themselves feel and seem superior. If your friend never has anything good to say about the people around them (including their other friends), they typically won’t hesitate put you down when you’re not around. In some cases, they might even go out of their way to try to make you feel small to your face. [1] X Research source Example: Your friend wants you to go shopping with them and you've already said you can't, so they say, \"You could really use a new look. Do you never want to be asked out?\" Staying friends with a manipulator could mean finding yourself the subject of gossip or rumors. [2] X Research source It’s rare that you’ll hear a person with a manipulative personality accept responsibility for their own faults. In their minds, they can do no wrong. They may even try to spin a fault to make it look like a good thing just to save face. [3] X Research source Example: They fail a test you aced because they didn't study, and they tell you that only mindless drones do well on standardized tests to make you feel like what you've done wasn't an accomplishment."

      "title": "They always need to be in charge.",
      "content": "They always need to be in charge. Manipulative people like to be in control of social situations, and they may go out of their way to host events at their house and control the event’s activities, or insist on doing things they’re familiar with so that they never lose control or lose face in front of you. Example: You go on vacation with your friend. There are sights you want to see, but your friend insists you do what they want to do instead and makes an itinerary for you both. They may also try to push you out of your comfort zone in an attempt to make you feel more reliant on them, thus putting them in charge by default. They may attempt to take charge of your schedule, money, or social life in order to make you feel more helpless and dependent. [4] X Research source Example : You're considering buying a new phone. Your friend insists that you don't know what you're looking for and are going to waste your money, and that you should buy the same phone they have instead, even though it costs more than you're prepared to spend."

      "title": "They’re passive-aggressive.",
      "content": "They’re passive-aggressive. A lot of people try to avoid confrontation when they can, but manipulative people really don’t like it. They may employ passive-aggressive behavior to get you to do what they want instead of telling you how they feel or what they want from you. [5] X Research source Example: Instead of telling you you hurt their feelings by forgetting to call them when you said you would, they tell a mutual friend they’re mad at you and wait for the friend to bring it up to you, leaving the onus on you to make amends—because you know they’re waiting for you to. Alternatively, in a healthy friendship, they’d say, “Hey, it bothered me that you didn’t call yesterday. I know you probably just forgot or got busy, but it’s bugging me, so I wanted to bring it up.” Being direct requires taking ownership of their feelings, which requires vulnerability—something manipulative people tend to struggle with, as it may make them feel like they’re losing control."

    {
      "title": "They get defensive.",
      "content": "They get defensive. Manipulative people often don’t like to take responsibility for their mistakes. When you try to employ the tactics of a healthy friend and respectfully confront them about something they’ve done that hurt you, they’ll immediately go on the defense and be resistant to hearing your perspective on the situation. [6] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source They may even spin things around on you and make it seem like it’s actually your fault, or they may get off the subject by telling you about something you did that hurt them. Example: You confront your friend about them flaking on plans you had, and they say, \"I'm not even sure why you felt the need to bring this up. I didn't realize it was such a huge, major deal. Like, you were too busy studying last week to go out with me, but I never brought that up.\" They may get emotional, either because you’ve accused them of something or because they’re upset to hear they hurt you, and try to make you feel bad for even broaching the subject. Remember, you are not responsible for their feelings. [7] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Example: When you tell them how hurt you were that they lied to you, they break down in tears and say, \"I really am a horrible friend, aren't I?\" leaving you feeling guilty and like the problem wasn't worth bringing up."

    {
      "title": "They don’t seem to listen.",
      "content": "They don’t seem to listen. Does your conversation keep swinging back around to them, somehow? Manipulative people tend to be a little narcissistic and may try to keep the focus of all conversation on themselves. When the conversation’s about you, they might seem to stop paying attention, instead zoning out or scrolling on their phone, or they’ll interrupt you to change the subject or bring the conversation back around to themselves. Example: You're in the middle of telling a story about a date you went on over the weekend. When you mention the restaurant you went to, your friend says, \"Oh, I love that restaurant!\" and proceeds to redirect the conversation to a description of her favorite restaurants in town."

      "title": "They guilt trip you.",
      "content": "They guilt trip you. Beware of people who are always bringing up past events (like loaning you money or helping you through a difficult time) just to hold them over your head. This is a sure sign of entitlement—they feel like you owe them something, no matter what the circumstances are. [8] X Research source Be up front when you suspect you’re being guilted into doing something. It will help your friend see the error of their ways if they’re doing it unconsciously, and let them know that you’re onto them if they’re doing it intentionally. A manipulative friend might try to blame you for something going wrong, even when you had nothing to do with it. If you suspect this to be the case, try not to take it personally. Example: Your friend asks you to help them move during the summer, but you're spending the summer with family out of state and can't help them. When you tell them this, they say, \"I helped you move. I can't believe you won't help me.\""

      "content": "They’re not reliable. Think about the times that your friend has really been there for you when you needed them. If you’re having trouble recalling any of these times, it may mean that your friend is a user. [9] X Research source One-sided relationships only benefit the manipulator, which is the way they want it. Try asking your friend for a small favor. The lengths they’re willing to go to help you can tell you a lot about how much they value your friendship. Example: You've locked yourself out of your house. Your friend has a spare key, so you call them to ask if you can come grab the key. They tell you no, because they're tired and need alone time. If you try to push it, they say something like, \"I need to put my own oxygen mask on before I can help anyone else.\" Favors you've done for them go unnoticed and unreturned. If you try to bring it up, they may accuse you of viewing your friendship as transactional."

      "title": "They always try to one-up you.",
      "content": "They always try to one-up you. Whatever you’re dealing with, they’ve not only experienced it themselves and are the expert on it—but what they dealt with was so much worse than what you’re going through. This can make you feel frustrated and as if your feelings and experiences aren’t valid or important. It may also make you feel as if your friend’s needs are higher-priority than your own needs. [10] X Research source Example: You've had a bad day at work. Instead of trying to cheer you up, your friend tries to one-up you by talking about how their day was worse."

      "title": "They project their feelings onto you.",
      "content": "They project their feelings onto you. Typically, the feelings they’re projecting are negative ones. If you confront them about something they’ve done, they may try to gaslight you into thinking it’s actually you doing the thing. If you struggle with self-confidence, you may start to believe you’re in the wrong for confronting them in the first place. [11] X Research source Example: You tell them you're surprised and hurt because they decided to throw a party on your birthday weekend, when you were planning to do something for your birthday. They tell you it's unreasonable of you to be hurt and make demands on their time, and that they didn't realize you were so sensitive about something as meaningless as birthdays."

Everyone is manipulative sometimes, so if your friend exhibits some of these habits now and again, it might be frustrating, but not a big deal. You yourself probably display a few of the above signs now and then as well! But if your friend exhibits this type of behavior regularly , they might just have a manipulative personality. Look for a pattern of all take and no give in your relationship. This is a good indication that your friend is taking advantage of you whether they realize it or not. [12] X Research source"

[13] X Expert Source Allison Broennimann, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 14 December 2020. Manipulative people rely on you having flexible boundaries, so decide where you need to draw the line with this friend, and firmly communicate any needs to them and tell them if or when they cross the line. Spend some time reflecting on your personal values and limits . What are you OK with? What goes too far? This can help you establish boundaries with your friend. [14] X Research source For instance, if they have a habit of pushing you to do something even after you've said no, tell them, \"I'm going to walk away from this conversation if you keep trying to pressure me to do this. I've already given you my answer.\" If they do cross your boundaries, be sure not to yield: follow through with what you've said you'll do. Otherwise, they'll likely think your boundaries are just talk. Practice saying “no” without feeling guilty about it. Once you get used to saying no, you'll shift the balance of power in the relationship back toward the center. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Be confident.",
      "content": "Be confident. People with manipulative personalities prey on low self-esteem and self-doubt. Speaking up when you feel challenged will send the message that you’re not going to be pushed around. As long as you have confidence, you won’t feel pressured to be something that you’re not. [16] X Research source For instance, if you know someone who constantly ridicules your fashion sense to make themselves look better, you could respond by simply saying, “I like the way I dress.” Don’t apologize if you’ve done nothing wrong. People-pleasers tend to over-apologize, even for things that aren’t their fault, because it can be easier to take blame for making a manipulative person unhappy than to let them take responsibility for their own feelings. [17] X Research source By going out of your way to accommodate a critical companion, you’ll only be doing their bidding."

Feeling like you're being manipulated is enough to make anyone upset, but if you allow things to get heated, they'll just blow up into an even bigger issue. By maintaining your poise, you'll be more prepared to handle the situation productively. [18] X Research source Making you angry might even be part of their plan, since it affects your ability to reason. Delay a confrontation until you've had time to cool off. If you have a tendency to say “yes” to everything this friend asks of you, make a habit of pausing before committing one way or the other. Wait an hour or a day to reply to their text, or tell them upfront, “I need time to think about this first.” [19] X Research source"

They're a waste of time, and the longer they go on, the more leverage an experienced manipulator will have to get you to do their bidding. “Remember that these tactics to control others are usually unconscious on their part, otherwise they wouldn’t do it,” Broennimann says. “If you notice it, you’ve sort of got the hot potato of awareness, you need to decide what to do with it, if anything at all.” [21] X Expert Source Allison Broennimann, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 29 January 2021.

      "title": "Confront your friend about their manipulative tendencies.",
      "content": "Confront your friend about their manipulative tendencies. Work up the nerve to let them know that their behavior isn’t okay. Be prepared to bring up specific examples and explain how they made you feel. There’s no need for a hostile confrontation, but you should make it clear that you’re not willing to play the fool any longer. Be respectful and nonjudgmental, but be firm. Rather than making potentially offensive statements like \"You're a liar,\" which will likely just cause them to shut down, try something more tactful, like \"I think it's unfair that you twist my words when it suits you.\" “It’s not that we are purposefully manipulative in relationships,” Broennimann says. “These patterns may have worked in their family system and now that you are building a new family system with your friend…they are unconsciously trying to apply the old rules—and it’s not working for you.” [22] X Expert Source Allison Broennimann, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 29 January 2021. Keep in mind that the cycle is likely to continue unless you put your foot down once and for all. [23] X Research source If the manipulation is new, pay attention to whether there's “something happening in the relationship…that is making one or both of you anxious,” Broennimann suggests. “Has there been a big change recently, did you just finish school, or a year of classes together? Is one of you moving?” [24] X Expert Source Allison Broennimann, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 29 January 2021."

When angered, your friend might resort to childish or hurtful tactics, like complaining about you to mutual acquaintances or spreading rumors. Ignore them.

You may feel as if you have an instant bond with them. They may project positive or neutral feelings onto you in order to get you to trust them and drag you into a codependent friendship with them, in which you view them as an extension of yourself—or, more likely, view yourself as an extension of them. This makes you easier to control.
