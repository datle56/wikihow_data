      "content": "Place your stones on a dish in the freezer for at least 4 hours. If they came in a velvet bag, feel free to leave them in there. Otherwise, place your stones on a small dish in the freezer and leave them be for at least 4 hours (or longer). [1] X Research source If the stones aren’t frozen enough, they won’t have enough chilling power to cool down your drink. Whiskey stones can be made out of many different materials, including steel, soapstone, and obsidian. If you find that you’re picking up a freezer burn taste when you use your stones, try sealing them in a plastic bag before putting them in the freezer."

      "content": "Place 3 or 4 stones in the bottom of each glass. If you have square-shaped stones, you can fit 3 or 4 in your cup. If you have large spheres, you’ll only need 1 per glass. Put the stones into your cup before you pour your alcohol. [2] X Research source Whiskey stones won’t affect the flavor of your drink, so you can use them in anything you’d like."

      "content": "Pour your drink and wait 1 to 2 minutes for the liquid to chill. Whiskey stones take a few minutes to transfer their coldness to your drink. Before sipping, take a few minutes to admire the look and feel of your drink so your whiskey stones have a chance to work their magic. [3] X Research source Whiskey stones cool down your drink without diluting it with water, which is their main benefit. However, the coldness doesn't last quite as long as ice does—after about 25 minutes, your drink will probably be back to room temperature."

      "content": "Wash the whiskey stones by hand with dish soap and warm water. After each use, take your whiskey stones over to the sink and rinse them off. Use warm water and a few drops of dish soap to scrub them down and remove the alcohol taste. Whiskey stones made of actual rock can absorb a slight alcohol flavor over time, so it’s important to wash them off after you use them. If you have stainless steel or granite whiskey stones, you can run them through the dishwasher instead. [4] X Research source"

If you leave soap on your stones, you could be drinking dish soap the next time you pop them in your drink. Try to rinse your stones for at least 1 minute to make sure they’re good to go."

Rub off the excess mineral oil with a towel, then wash your stones with soap and water before using them again. You don’t need to use mineral oil every time you wash your whiskey stones, just whenever you notice they’re looking dull."
