      "title": "Determine if the cat is dead.",
      "content": "Determine if the cat is dead. When a cat is hit by a car, it might be rendered unconscious and in need of medical attention. However, it might also be dead. To determine the status of the cat, look for signs that it is breathing. [1] X Research source For instance, you could monitor the cat’s flank. If the cat is lying on its side, its flank will slowly rise and fall as is breathes in and out. Alternately, place a tissue in front of the cat’s nose. If the tissue moves forward and away from the cat’s nose, the cat is breathing in and out. Finally, pinch 1 of the cat’s rear toes lightly. If the cat pulls away, it is alive. If the cat’s body is stiff when you touch it, it is dead."

      "content": "Do not attempt to move the cat unless directed by qualified personnel. The cat might harm you, especially in its injured and fearful state, so don’t move or pick up the cat. Instead, wait for qualified personnel to arrive. [2] X Research source If a vet asks you to bring the cat to them, splint or stabilize any visible injuries, if possible. Then, wrap the cat in a towel, making sure not to cover the cat’s mouth or nose or wrap the towel too tight. Put the cat in a carrier or open container to reduce the risk of additional injuries."

      "title": "Call your local animal control agency.",
      "content": "Call your local animal control agency. The animal control agency can best determine how to help a cat hit by a car. If you can’t contact them (for instance, if you’ve encountered the injured cat outside of normal business hours), call the police. Explain the situation to the police calmly and clearly. [3] X Research source For instance, you might say, “Hello. I’ve found a cat that has been hit by a car at [your location]. The animal is still alive and needs help. Please send an animal control officer to this location. I will remain here until help arrives.”"

      "title": "Contact your vet.",
      "content": "Contact your vet. If you can’t contact the animal control agency and the police will not help, contact your vet. Vets are specially trained to help cats that have been hit by cars or suffered similar traumatic injuries. Your vet will work hard to help your cat heal. [4] X Research source Even if you are not a pet owner yourself (and therefore do not have a vet of your own), you might still know of veterinary clinics in your vicinity. Take the cat that was hit by a car to the nearest such clinic."

      "title": "Report the cat’s injuries to an animal shelter.",
      "content": "Report the cat’s injuries to an animal shelter. If you don’t know of any vets in your vicinity, or if the animal shelter or rescue organization is closer to the location of the injured cat than the vet, report the cat’s injuries to the animal shelter first. Animal shelters or cat rescue organizations have the staff and facilities necessary to help a cat hit by a car. They might direct you to take the cat to them, or contact the cat’s owner.

    {
      "title": "Contact the owner.",
      "content": "Contact the owner. When a cat is his by a car, its owner will want to know. You might be able to contact the cat’s owner by checking for a collar. Cat collars often have tags with information about the cat, including its name, the name of its owner, and the number and address where the owner can be reached. Use this information to get in touch with the owner. Even if the cat does not have a collar and tags, it might still be possible to contact the owner if the cat has been microchipped. Take the cat to a rescue organization or animal shelter so they can use a device which will be able to detect a microchip in the cat if one has been implanted."

      "content": "Discourage darting. If your cat tends to dart toward the door when you leave, get a friend or family member to hold the cat before you exit. Alternately, squirt your cat with water just before leaving. You might also choose to provide your cat with a puzzle feeder just before making an exit to keep it occupied while you leave.

To prevent your cat from racing off, only take it out with a leash and harness.

      "content": "Make indoor life enjoyable. If your cat is comfortable indoors, it will have little motivation to go outside. Provide plenty of toys for your cat, and play with it regularly. Provide a cat house or perch for your cat to lounge in. Keep the litter boxes clean. With a healthy, happy cat, you’ll discourage escape behavior.

      "content": "Neuter or spay your cat. If your cat is neutered or spayed, it will have much lower urge to roam and find a mate. Plus, neutering and spaying makes cats less quarrelsome and can reduce their likelihood for certain diseases. [10] X Research source Cats can be safely neutered or spayed at about six month of age."
