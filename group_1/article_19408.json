      "content": "Throw away any products that have beetle infestations. Look through your pantry for any products that have small brown beetles in them. Also, inspect the packaging on flour, dry mixes, bread, cookies, and spices for small holes or webbing. [1] X Research source Wrap the products in plastic wrap and throw them away outside. Drugstore beetles may also be found in books, wooden objects, or prescriptions that have been left out. While drugstore beetles aren’t dangerous or harmful, they can give an off flavor to any food they get into."

Be sure to focus on cracks, gaps, and crevices to get rid of drugstore beetles that are hiding. [2] X Research source Avoid using water to clean flour or residue off your shelves because it could leave behind a pasty residue that attracts more drugstore beetles."

      "content": "Heat or freeze products to kill drugstore beetles. Turn your oven to 125 °F (52 °C) and place any non-combustible items on the middle rack for 2–4 hours. Alternatively, put the items in your freezer for about 6 days to get rid of drugstore beetles at all stages of their life. You may also try putting your items in the fridge for 16 days as long as it’s at or below 36 °F (2 °C).

      "content": "Try putting out sticky traps . Sticky traps are baited with beetle pheromones to attract and kill adult beetles. Set the sticky traps in areas where you’ve seen the beetles to catch and kill them. Throw out and replace the traps once they’re full.

      "title": "Apply insecticides as a last resort.",
      "content": "Apply insecticides as a last resort. Stick to insecticides that contain pyrethrins, resmethrin, allethrin, or tetramethrin that are safe to use inside. Remove all the items from the shelves or drawers. Then, apply the insecticides directly to the cracks and crevices around the area. [5] X Research source Let the insecticides dry completely before laying down shelf paper and putting your items away. For long-lasting control, try using residual insecticides that contain permethrin, esfenvalerate, cyfluthrin, or bifenthrin instead. Only use insecticides if other non-chemical options aren’t working. If you’re still having trouble getting rid of drugstore beetles, then contact a professional exterminator instead. Avoid applying insecticides directly on surfaces where you store or prepare food because the chemicals could cause contamination."

      "content": "Inspect food for damage or openings before buying it. When you’re buying groceries, make sure the package doesn’t have any openings or rips where beetles could get inside. Check for any holes or webbing around the package, which could also be signs of drugstore beetle grubs. Freeze grain products for 3 days after purchasing them to ensure there aren’t any beetles.

      "title": "Store your food in airtight containers.",
      "content": "Store your food in airtight containers. Choose plastic, metal, or glass containers that have tight-fitting lids so beetles can’t get inside. Transfer open food to the containers before putting it in your pantry so beetles can’t get in. [7] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Airtight containers also help prevent beetles in one food product from getting into other things in your pantry. If possible, get clear containers so you can easily see if there are beetles inside. Store foods you don’t use as frequently, such as pancake mix, flour, and grains, in the fridge or freezer to prevent beetles from getting to them."

      "content": "Look for small brown beetles with yellowish hairs. Drugstore beetles are either brown or dark red and have bodies that grow to about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (3.2 mm) long. They also have small yellowish hairs on their body and rows of lines along their back. Their antennae end in a club shape that has 3 distinct segments. [10] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Drugstore beetles can be found worldwide, but are more common in warmer regions. Drugstore beetles lay eggs in grain products or near other food sources. Their larvae are white and C-shaped, but they are as small as 1 ⁄ 10 inch (2.5 mm) so they’re hard to see with the naked eye."
