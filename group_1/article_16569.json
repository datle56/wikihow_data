      "content": "Fill out the complaint form on the USPS website. The USPS has a form available on their website where you can ask questions or submit complaints about packages or mail, USPS postal facilities, USPS personnel, or the operation of the USPS website. Visit their Email Us page and provide your tracking number or select the reason for your inquiry to complete the form. [1] X Research source The complaint form provides categories you can use to further identify the subject of your complaint. There are blanks for names, dates, locations, and additional information. However, there is a character limit of 4,000 characters, and you cannot attach documents to the form. When filing a complaint, Claytor says, “Be very clear about what you're dissatisfied with. Only state the facts, not the emotion. You may be extremely upset and distraught, but whoever you're sending this letter of complaint to doesn't need that because it's going to overshadow the real issue.” Once you make your complaint, click through to the contact information page. You can choose to receive a response by email or phone."

      "content": "Discuss the matter with a USPS customer service agent. A customer service agent will evaluate your complaint and contact you by email or phone according to the selection you make in your complaint form. You can provide them with additional information, if necessary, and they will attempt to resolve the situation. Generally, it’s better to ask for a response by email rather than phone so you can maintain a record of your interactions with USPS customer service. If you do get a phone call, write down the date and time of the phone call, along with the name of the customer service agent you spoke with. Take notes during the call so you have a record of what they said."
