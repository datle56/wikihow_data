      "title": "Look for information about the author to assess authority.",
      "content": "Look for information about the author to assess authority. A reputable site should clearly indicate who the author is. Check the top and bottom of the page to find this information. If it is a person’s name, it should also indicate their credentials, like “MD” if the person claims to be a doctor. Keep in mind that the author might also be an organization or institution, like the Mayo Clinic or the University of Kansas. [1] X Research source If a website is authoritative, the author's information will often also include contact details, such as an email address or phone number. If you can’t figure out who wrote the website, it’s probably not a good idea to rely heavily on the information presented. An exception to that is some wikis. Wikis (like this one) are sites where many community members might add to an article. Even though you won't be able to find an author's name, you can check credibility by looking at the sources. Sometimes there will also be a note that the article has been expert verified."

      "title": "Make sure the site is accurate.",
      "content": "Make sure the site is accurate. Part of determining if the source is authoritative includes making sure that it has reliable facts. Check to see if any statistics and other facts are backed up by sources. If no sources are listed, that is a red flag. It might mean that the facts are made up or unverified. [2] X Research source If you have any doubts, check another source to see if the facts can be verified. Look at spelling and grammar. If there are a lot of basic errors, the page might not have a very credible author. A professional will usually proofread and make sure their page looks professional."

    {
      "title": "Determine the purpose of the site to see if it is objective.",
      "content": "Determine the purpose of the site to see if it is objective. Read through the homepage to see if you can figure out if there is any potential bias. When you are doing research, it’s a good idea to look for a site that simply presents facts without trying to persuade readers. For example, a website that is written by someone opposed to vaccinations is probably not the best place to learn scientific information. Ask yourself questions such as: [3] X Research source Is this site selling something? Is the information presented from only 1 point of view? Does the site attempt to persuade the reader to think a certain way?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check dates to see if the information is current.",
      "content": "Check dates to see if the information is current. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the “Last updated” information. This will tell you when the site was last changed. If the date is from a few years ago, try to find a more current source. The information could be outdated. [4] X Research source If there are links on the page, check those, too, to see if those pages are up to date. Keep in mind that it will depend on the topic as to how current you need the information you need to be. If you’re looking for information on climate change, for example, it should be updated within the last couple of months. But if you’re just looking for a recipe for spaghetti, it’s okay to go with older information."
    },
    {
      "title": "Click on the links within the article to see if the coverage is comprehensive.",
      "content": "Click on the links within the article to see if the coverage is comprehensive. A good site will typically link to other resources as a way to provide additional information. The links might take you to another page on that site or to another useful site. Click on a few links to get a sense of how much information is available. If there aren’t any outside links, that doesn’t necessarily make a site bad. It just means you might want to look for additional information. [5] X Research source For example, maybe you are reading about climate change. The site might link to helpful resources about things like statistics or predictions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for relevant information that will aid your research.",
      "content": "Look for relevant information that will aid your research. It’s easy to start browsing the internet and find yourself looking at something totally different than what you set out to find. When you are doing research, make sure that the site you are reading has information that will be useful to you. [6] X Research source If you’re doing a project about politics in the 1960s, it might be tempting to start reading about every member of the Kennedy family. Make sure to stay on track and look at pages that specifically discuss politics during that era."

      "title": "Use a search engine to find general information.",
      "content": "Use a search engine to find general information. Search engines typically yield millions of results. While this might seem good at first, it can be overwhelming to try to sort through all of the websites and determine which are the best. For this reason, it’s best to use search engines for information that is pretty general. For example, you might use a search engine to look for “local news”, but if you’re looking for scholarship on the importance of bees, it’s best to try another route. [7] X Research source For instance, if you're just looking for an easily identifiable fact, such as the population of Australia, you don't need to use anything more sophisticated than a search engine. Popular search engines include Google , Bing, and Yahoo. If you use Google, try Google Scholar to get more credible returns."

      "title": "Type in keywords to get the best results.",
      "content": "Type in keywords to get the best results. Keywords are the words you type in the search bar to bring up results. To get the most accurate hits, make your words as precise as possible. For example, if you want to learn about a golden retriever, type that in instead of “dog.” [8] X Research source Use more than 1 search engine so that you turn up as many results as possible."

      "title": "Try a subject directory to look up a specific topic.",
      "content": "Try a subject directory to look up a specific topic. A subject directory is organized by human beings, often librarians. This is different than a search engine, which relies solely on technology to come up with results. If you know exactly what you are looking for, a subject directory might be your best bet. Common subject directories include: [9] X Research source Base-Search TheNerdWorld MiningCo"

      "content": "Search a research database for academic projects. The information in databases is targeted to a specific audience and is authoritative. Databases are not free, so you’ll need to access them through a library. Ask the librarian at your school or local library to help you. In the database, you can search for academic articles in the sciences and the humanities. [10] X Research source Academic Search Complete and JSTOR are 2 of the most popular databases."
