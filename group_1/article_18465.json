      "title": "Alphabet Game",
      "content": "Alphabet Game If you’re waiting in line somewhere where there’s a lot to look at, like at a theme park, playing the Alphabet Game is a great way to pass the time. Take turns looking around your surroundings to spot something that starts with the next letter of the alphabet. For example, the first person might find an apple for “A” and the second person might find a backpack for “B.” Challenge yourselves to find every letter of the alphabet, including tricky ones like “X” or “Q.” [3] X Research source You can also try an alphabet memory game like I Went to the Market, in which you take turns listing items you’d by at the store in alphabetical order. For example, the first person would say, “I went to the market and bought avocados.” The second person would say, “I went to the market and bought avocados and blueberries.” The list keeps growing until someone forgets one of the items."

Choose a category (like “Take a photo of something red”) and have everyone take a picture. If you want to make the game more interesting, turn it into a challenge; see who can take a picture of the most interesting object or who can capture a photo the quickest. If you have kids, another version of the challenge is to have them scroll through your camera roll to find specific photos, like a photo of a pet or a family member."

      "title": "Fortunately, Unfortunately",
      "content": "Fortunately, Unfortunately Fortunately, Unfortunately is a fun storytelling game that can lead to some wacky scenarios! The first player will come up with a sentence to start the story. The next player will add a related sentence that starts with “Unfortunately.” The player after that will start their sentence with “Fortunately,” and the pattern continues until you complete your story. [5] X Research source For example, a story might start like this: “I got a new puppy.” The next person could add, “Unfortunately, he ran away.” The next would say, “Fortunately, he came back with $100.” Then someone could add, “Unfortunately, he robbed a bank to get it.”"

      "title": "Chopsticks",
      "content": "Chopsticks To start playing Chopsticks , each player will hold up one finger on each hand. You’ll then take turns tapping another player’s hand to transfer your “points” to them. For example, if you were holding up one finger, then tap a player who was also holding up one finger, they would then have to hold up two fingers and you’d put yours down. When someone has five fingers up on a single hand, that hand is “dead” and out of the game. The last person with a hand remaining wins. [6] X Research source This game involves basic math and strategy skills, so it may not be the best option if you’re looking to distract little ones. Chopsticks may seem tricky at first, but after a few rounds, you’ll probably get the hang of it."
