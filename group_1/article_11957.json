It is far harder for people to help you if you're secretive and do things that seem inexplicably strange. Knowing will help people to make allowances and support you as best they can. Be willing to be honest about your irritability and reclusive behavior with those you trust . They need to know it's not personal, but that you need space or time out every now and then."

Spend time with people who see the world in a positive way and ask them to share their visions, ideas, and approaches to life with you. Most positive people will be more than happy to reveal the things that help them keep upbeat and happy about their lives. Learn from them. Remember that misery loves company. It can be incredibly hard to keep away from negative people as down and out as you're feeling, but do your best to avoid them. You won't be doing either of you a favor by confirming each other's fears that the rest of the world is terrible."

Reintroducing daily attention to grooming can help improve your mood and give you a sense of well-being. Get a new haircut or new clothes as part of cheering yourself up.

      "content": "Try to get some sleep . Sleep is essential to a healthy, balanced body. Lack of sleep can aggravate negative thinking and easily becomes a vicious cycle whereby your negative thoughts keep you awake and disable your ability to get enough sleep. Waking unrefreshed and feeling tired is a common complaint during depression, and even too much sleep can leave depressed persons feeling tired. [4] X Research source Breaking this cycle requires enforcing a strict sleep routine of the same bedtime and waking time every day, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, not exercising three hours prior to bed, removing anything distracting from your bedroom, and keeping your room at a suitable temperature. Read how to fall asleep for more help. It won't be easy breaking a disturbed sleep cycle and many things can cause you to relapse back into insomnia or wakeful nights, so it's important to be vigilant about keeping to a routine, as well as forgiving yourself when you can't sleep."

[5] X Research source Exercise releases a natural anti-depressant chemical in your brain and gets you into doing something active. Start small with a simple walk to the local store or around the block, or to your garden gate might be the way to begin. Gradually work up to a routine that fits with your needs and enjoyment. Look for friends or group exercise sessions since having a partner will keep you more motivated. You can also look for activities that will allow you to release some of the pent-up emotions that may be built up, such as kickboxing. Playing sports is a great way to get regular exercise, stay occupied, focus on self-improvement and meet new people. Some studies have found that people who participate in sports have somewhat fewer symptoms of depression. Choose a sport that is exhausting to quiet the chatter in your mind and leave you feeling wrung out—just don't overdo it. Join a team or class in your area and commit to showing up to as many of these meetings as possible, even if you may not feel like going some days."

For depressed persons, the first step is often the hardest, so making yourself do things can be a huge difference in your day and getting you started. Engage in a hobby you enjoy or think you'll enjoy. Immerse yourself in it. It doesn't have to be expensive or difficult. As long as it's interesting it will serve the purpose. Care for pets. The routine involved in pets needing to be fed, groomed, and played with can be very satisfying for a depressed person. This is especially so because pets don't provide a sense of judgment, but only return love and acceptance. Introduce structure into your everyday life. Make a schedule of what to do every day, no matter how mundane, and gradually expand this as you start to feel better. It doesn't matter whether you work or not. A schedule can put some direction back into a day that might otherwise feel empty or aimless.

The antidote is to do things that you used to enjoy or that are fun for people around you — \"one fun thing a day to keep the blues at bay.\" As with everything else, do this gradually. One fun thing a day, such as watching a beloved comedy or reading a funny book can give you a sense of fun for a while. Make time to laugh more. This can be watching comedy skits or TV shows that make you laugh, and learn how to take time and enjoy those moments more. Schedule positive events into your life. Go out to dinner, the movies, or for a walk with friends. Take it slowly. If you used to enjoy gardening , plant a single plant. If you used to enjoy a long walk, take a short one.

This will be the place where you let out your darkest thoughts — no holds barred — because you don't need to worry that anyone will judge you for them.

[8] X Research source This can be a good way of moving through your depression once it's better under control, and is often an ideal technique to use when your healing seems to have temporarily plateaued. Helping other people going through hardships removes your concentration from yourself and onto others, which can be good if you're prone to too much introspection. Don't overdo volunteering. If you become involved in charity or volunteer work and you feel exhausted or used up, that's a sign you're overdoing it or may not even be ready to help others just yet. It doesn't mean you won't be able to do this, but it does mean take care of yourself first."

      "content": "Think of it as a journey to wellness. Depression can feel endless when the lethargy takes over and everything seems too hard. For this very reason, it's important to view getting well as a journey of gradual steps, rather than something with an instant cure. There will be times that your determination is challenged by self-questioning and despair , but this is precisely when you must do your best to avoid being \"depressed about being depressed!\" Here are good ways to start: Name your beast. Winston Churchill called his depression his \"black dog.\" By turning it into a pet, he made a difficult situation into a controllable one. In naming it, you make it a condition and not a definition of who you are. You can say something like \"My black dog is making me feel irritable today,\" instead of saying \"I'm always an irritable no-hoper.\" [9] X Research source Find a role model. Think you're alone in being depressed? Go to the library and pull out five biographies. It's highly likely that at least one of those high-achievers suffered from depression. Do a little research online to find famous people who have overcome depression. Read about the many celebrities who are revealing their battles with depression. Read their stories. Take heart in the fact that there are others who have overcome depression, and now you have the benefit of their experiences to draw from too! Be gentle with yourself. [10] X Expert Source Vernita Marsh, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Consultant, & Speaker Expert Interview. 7 April 2022. Life isn't a race or a competition. The reality is that you matter, you have great value as a person, and making things harder for yourself is akin to beating yourself up. Avoid obsessing about your depression or creating a shrine to it to hide behind when things all seem to hard. The feedback loop of hopelessness and despair created by being angry with yourself for being depressed will deepen your despair. Go back to naming your beast and setting it apart from who you are. Accept that the journey to wellness is a matter of baby steps. List the things that are bothering you outside of your depression. [11] X Research source It could be unpaid bills, a lack of vacations, or a tough job. In another column, write down some practical things that you think you can do to deal with the things that are bothering you. For example, find ways to pay these bills, plan a vacation, and figure out how to get a new job."

[12] X Expert Source Vernita Marsh, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Consultant, & Speaker Expert Interview. 7 April 2022. Cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, or other forms of psychological therapy are helpful when you're unlearning negative thinking and establishing patterns of thinking that support your self-esteem and increase your self confidence . While it is best to read up in this area and speak with someone qualified to help guide you through the ways to change your thinking, there are some important things to keep in mind. Think of this way—every thought produces a feeling and every feeling produces a behavior. When you think positive thoughts, you can begin to treat yourself kindly and do nurturing and kind things for yourself. [13] X Expert Source Vernita Marsh, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Consultant, & Speaker Expert Interview. 7 April 2022. Acknowledge the feeling will pass. This can be a very difficult step, but it's vital because it helps you to start banishing thoughts of hopelessness. [14] X Research source List all of your good points. When you're depressed, it's easy to understate the positive things about yourself. Turn this around by listing everything that is good about you. Include achievements from the past and hopes for the future, however few or random they may seem. If you can't write this list, have a trusted friend or family member start one for you. This is a list to keep building upon as you work through your depression. Self-acceptance is a vital part of recovering from depression because you acknowledge that there are good things about yourself, but also that you have challenges to overcome. This will help you stop judging yourself more harshly than anyone else. Make decisions, however small, and act on them. Again, while this is very difficult to do during depression, it is a vital element in facing the sense of helplessness that tends to overwhelm depressed persons. [15] X Research source Small decisions like getting out of bed, calling friends, or cleaning up the kitchen all add up. Once you act on them, they become achievements. Learn how to replace faulty or negative thinking by focusing on it. Ask questions such as: Am I assuming the worst? Am I condemning myself because something bad has happened? Am I focused on my weaknesses rather than my strengths? [16] X Research source It is helpful to arrange the negative thought in one column and a rationalization in another column, so that you can confront and undo the negative thinking. In one column you may write the thought: \"I'm a failure,\" and in the other you challenge that thought with: \"I made a mistake. I've made mistakes in the past and things have turned out okay. I've also had many triumphs.\" Learn assertiveness techniques once you've challenged the harder aspects of your negative thinking processes. Assertive techniques will allow you to find a pathway to standing up for yourself without giving in to feelings of anger, fear, or powerlessness. Knowing how to assert yourself is an important part of not falling back into depressive patterns in the future."
