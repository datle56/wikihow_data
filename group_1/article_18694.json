      "content": "Gain weight to plump up your cheeks. If you’re underweight, gaining weight naturally adds to your body mass and might plump up your cheeks. Keep a food journal to help you keep track of what you’re consuming. In the beginning, eat about 200 more calories than you typically do in a day. Focus on eating nutrient-rich, calorie-dense meals and snacks throughout the day, and drink healthy smoothies to get more calories. Don’t forget to drink plenty of water to keep your skin plump and hydrated. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Seeds, nuts, nut butters, avocados, fatty fish, and dairy products are all rich in nutrients and healthy fats. Focus on strength training rather than cardio training while you attempt to gain weight. Consider working with a nutritionist during this process, and be sure to talk to your doctor before making lifestyle changes. Keep in mind that the fat may not appear immediately around your face. Depending on your body type, you may notice weight gain in other parts of your body first."

      "content": "Do facial exercises. Open your mouth wide and curl your upper and lower lips inward so that they cover your front teeth. Keep them taut over your teeth and draw the corners of your mouth outward. Gently shift your jaw forward, too. Stay in this position for about 30 seconds. You’ll feel tightness around your cheek muscles and mouth area. Release to a normal resting face when you’re done. Repeat this exercise 5 times per day. [2] X Research source Another exercise is to fill your cheeks with air while you purse your lips like a pufferfish. Hold this for 5-10 seconds, then relax and release the air. Repeat the exercise. This time, move the air from side to side 5-10 times as you hold the pose. Release the pose. Fill your cheeks with air one more time. Hold your index finger on your lips like you’re shushing someone. Move the air from under your upper lip to under your lower lip. Repeat 5-10 times and release. [3] X Research source Another option is to blow up balloons – or just pretend – to improve circulation to your facial muscles. When practicing face yoga, sit upright, open up your chest, and lower your shoulders to release the tension in your body. Gentle facial exercises stimulate circulation in your cheeks, which might make your skin look more radiant and full."

      "content": "Highlight your cheeks with light-colored concealer or powder. “There are definitely things you can do to...manipulate the shape of the face,” says Schober. Apply your foundation, concealer, and setting powder as usual. Then use a powder brush to dust on a layer of matte powder 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone on your cheekbones and any sunken-in areas. [4] X Research source Or apply a liquid or cream concealer that’s 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone around your cheeks to make them pop. Apply the lighter concealer to any areas around your face featuring dark shadows that draw your cheeks downward. Schober recommends choosing a concealer 1-2 shades lighter than your foundation. Try eliminating dark undereye circles or dark lines around your mouth with a color-correcting concealer to make sure the upper parts of your cheeks really stand out. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use blush to contour the apples of your cheeks. Try out a shimmery powder or a cream blush formula until you find which product you like best. Schober says, “I like to use cream products to contour, and then I will put powder on top to kind of set that in.” Once you’ve applied your base of foundation, concealer, and powder, Schober recommends smiling to find the fullest part of your cheeks, known as the apples. Look in a mirror to help get the right placement. Then, use either a blush brush or your fingertips to apply the product around this area. Instead of sweeping on the blush in an angular motion, place it strategically around the bottom and outside edges to subtly contour the apples of your cheeks. Pinch your cheeks to see what color your cheeks turn when they’re naturally flushed, then choose a blush in a similar hue. Avoid extending the blush below the apples of your cheeks or your cheekbones; this will only make your face look more sunken in. [6] X Research source"
