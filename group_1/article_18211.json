      "content": "Pick a theme, location, or emotion as a prompt. To do a free-write, you need a writing prompt to help frame the exercise. You can create your prompts by focusing on a theme like love, loss, or power. You can also choose a particular location as the prompt, such as the doctor’s office, your parent’s home, or a rocket ship on Mars. [1] X Research source Emotions can also work as prompts. Focus on strong emotions like anger, rage, sadness, excitement, or fear."

      "title": "Write about a real or imaginary person as a prompt.",
      "content": "Write about a real or imaginary person as a prompt. Another option is to use a real-life person as a prompt for the free-write, such as your teacher, best friend, or pet. You can make up a person and use them as a prompt as well. Sometimes using a generic term for a person, like “father,” “lover,” or “enemy” can work well as prompts. Using a person as a prompt may be especially useful if you are struggling with creating a character in a story. Do a free-write in the voice of the character to help you generate ideas for the story."

      "title": "Use your writing as a prompt.",
      "content": "Use your writing as a prompt. You can also make up your prompts using lines from your writing or the writing of others. Flip through your favorite book and pick a sentence or phrase at random. Then, use this as the prompt for the free-write. You can also choose a line you like from your writing or a line that you are stuck on in a story. For example, you may choose a sentence like “She went into the bedroom” as the prompt. This can then be the start of free writing."

      "content": "Write without stopping during the allotted time. Put your pen to paper or click open a blank document on your computer and set the timer. Then, with the prompt in mind, start writing. Respond to the prompt. Try not to read over what you write or edit it in any way. Simply write, moving forward on the page. [4] X Research source Once the timer goes off, you can stop writing and read what you have written. Avoid doing this during the freewrite, as this will only distract you and force you to stop writing. You can then decide to keep the free-write and use it to create a new piece or add lines from it to an existing piece. You can also discard it or share it with someone else."
