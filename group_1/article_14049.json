A sexually dominant man generally wants to be in charge during sex, but that doesn't mean he's just ordering his partner around. He takes responsibility for his partner's pleasure and well-being as well. [2] X Research source Sexually dominant men are often portrayed in pop culture as successful, confident, and charismatic—basically the same traits as the \"alpha male\" generally."

A dominant man also doesn't point fingers at anyone else or blame them for something that happened, regardless of who was actually at fault.

If you feel as though you're lacking in confidence, this is absolutely one of those \"fake it 'til you make it\" type of things. Just stand tall , keep your chin up, and take up space. If you act confident , pretty soon you'll find that you actually are!

Research shows that if you set goals based on mastering tasks, you'll tend to achieve more than if you set goals based on incrementally improving your specific performance. [5] X Research source This is also more dominant behavior because instead of focusing on your past performance, you're always focused forward and in control of the trajectory of your life. Skills that you're able to master can potentially cross over into other areas of your life as well, increasing your overall performance. Mastering a skill is also a tremendous boost to your confidence and will put you will on your way to being seen as more dominant by others."

It also allows you to prepare for the worst-case scenario so you can minimize those losses. That makes it easier for you to make riskier moves that could potentially pay off pretty big. Keeping your fears in check also means you're ready to step in and take charge when a challenge arises. [6] X Research source To an outsider, a dominant man might seem impulsive—especially if he takes a lot of risks. But he's always thought through all the possibilities, even if it doesn't seem like it. A great way to take risks and grow as a person is to volunteer for leadership opportunities. Being a dominant person means you take on the challenges others are incapable of tackling."

      "content": "Step away when necessary to keep your emotions in check. Assertive, dominant folks approach problems calmly rather than reacting out of emotion without thinking things through. When people see that you can control your emotions , they'll increasingly trust you and reach out to you to take a leadership role when there's a problem. [7] X Research source If you feel your emotions boiling over, take a few minutes to be by yourself. Use deep-breathing exercises to calm yourself down and allow the emotions to pass. Then, you'll be able to approach the situation more rationally. Dominant men are typically considered to be pretty cool, calm, and collected no matter what happens. This calm strength under pressure is what makes them great in emergency situations."

You resist temptation to go out on an impulsive shopping binge or a reckless night out on the town. When you do go out, you know how to have a great time without losing yourself. [9] X Research source Because you plan in advance, you always have primary and backup plans to get home when you're going to be out drinking.

When you always know where you need to be and where everything is, people tend to believe that you would be a responsible and productive leader. Organizing your time and space also shows that you have control over what's going on in your life. For example, having control over your schedule means you won't get stressed out because you forgot about a meeting and have to rush at the last minute."

There are a lot of different ways to be sexually dominant and it might be that you're not even entirely sure yet what you're into—and that's fine! The important thing is to have the discussion and make sure the two of you are on the same page about what you want to do. [10] X Research source Answer any questions your partner might have honestly and listen to their concerns. Make sure they understand that you don't think any less of them and that you don't want to do anything to harm them. Remember that trying to dominate someone in bed without talking about it first isn't dominant—it's abusive. As disappointing as it might be to discover that your partner isn't on board with this, a truly dominant man would respect their wishes. As a note, being a dominant person doesn’t automatically mean you have to be dominant in the bedroom. In fact, the submissive person in a BDSM relationship is really the one with all the power."

It might not be the sexiest conversation you ever have, but before you and your partner agree to play with a power dynamic, it's important to know what is and is not okay for you to do with them. The easiest way to do this is to come up with a possible scene, then discuss the different situations that might come up around that scene. [11] X Research source Keep in mind that you are not in a dominant role while this discussion is going on—the two of you are meeting as equals. Once you've had this discussion, stick to what you've talked about during the scene. Even if you have a great idea, you could put your partner in an uncomfortable position if you decide to do something different while you're in the dominant role. It's usually a good idea to have this conversation before every scene, at least until the two of you have been playing together often enough that you feel confident knowing each other's limits. Let your partner come up with a safe word if they want one. Unless you're doing very specific kinds of role play, though, simply saying \"no\" or \"stop\" will usually work just fine."

As the dominant, you are the master of what happens during this particular scene, which means you can direct your partner to move (or not move) however you want. Guide them to enhance pleasure for both of you. Within the parameters you've discussed, you can do whatever you want—have fun! [12] X Research source Talk to your partner throughout the scene to make sure they understand what you want them to do and where you want them to be. Take any information you get from your partner about their feelings during the scene and use those to guide your decisions on what you'll do next.

Being a sexually dominant male is all about exploring power and control with a partner who is excited for you to control and dominate them. If at any time they don't seem like they're into whatever you're doing, it's a good time to check in with them and make sure they're still okay with going forward.

Tell them what you liked and find out what they liked, as well as what they didn't. All of this information can help you fine-tune your performance so that you'll be a better dominant for them next time. [15] X Research source Use what you learn to enhance your partner's pleasure as well.
