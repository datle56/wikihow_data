      "content": "Look for certain signs of anal gland issues. When there's a problem with the anal glands, may dogs exhibit certain symptoms, which you should learn to recognize. Be sure to ask a veterinarian if you've never had this issue before: these symptoms may be a sign of other underlying issues, such as parasites , a sore bottom from diarrhea , or a food allergy, so it's a good idea to let a vet examine your dog. This way you can either rule out these issues, or get your dog the treatment it needs. [2] X Research source The typical signs of anal gland issues include: [3] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 19 February 2021. Scooting Excessive licking of the anal area Occasional release of anal gland contents at inappropriate times (other than defecation) - you may notice a fishy odor on furnishings or coming from your dog's anus Red skin in the anal area Bleeding or pus drainage around the anus (this is a sign that you should call your vet as soon as possible - do not attempt anal expression) [4] X Research source"

If you want to wash the dog, also have ready whatever shampoo or other dog-friendly soaps you use, as well as plenty of towels.

      "content": "Secure the dog in a small room. Often, the bathroom works well for this purpose, especially if you bathe your dog in the tub. You just want to make sure the dog can't struggle free and run off during the process. The dog should be on an easy-to-clean surface. Since the process can be somewhat messy, pairing an expression with a bath is usually a smart idea."

      "content": "Position the dog in front of you in a standing position. Its rear end should be facing you. If you have a partner, they should secure the dog by wrapping one arm around the neck and the other at the side of the body, hugging the dog close to them. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Lift the dog's tail, rolling it up to expose its anus. You should be at level with the dog's bottom, in a position that is comfortable to maintain. While the process shouldn't take too long (about five minutes), the first time may require a little extra time and patience. Make sure you're in a comfortable position. The procedure won't hurt your dog, but if the glands are particularly swollen or impacted, your pet might be guarding their backside more than usual. Be careful and pay attention to your pet's body language."

      "title": "Locate the anal glands.",
      "content": "Locate the anal glands. Place two fingers (thumb and forefinger) on either side of the anus. The anal glands are beneath the skin, just under the anus, at approximately 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock. If the glands are full, you will feel a slight bulge, about cherry-sized, when pressing inward just below the anus. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Emptying the glands depends on pressing in the right place. If you can't feel the \"cherries,\" you are either in the wrong place or the glands don't need emptying. Sometimes only one gland may be full. This could be a sign that the glands were functioning normally but that one has become infected or impacted. Call your vet before attempting to express the sac. This could require a round of antibiotics."

You should not squeeze continuously, but rather in gentle pulses. Don't apply too much pressure: no more than you would apply to your own closed eye. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch the dog's bottom for expressed liquid. If you're milking correctly, the liquid should be coming out in slow drips. If nothing is coming out, try adjusting the position of your fingers. The liquid smells strongly of fish and may be anything from a clear, smooth consistency to a brownish, grainy substance. If the discharge is bloody or especially pasty, do not continue. See your vet as soon as possible about a possible impaction or infection."

      "title": "Stop after a few tries if nothing comes out.",
      "content": "Stop after a few tries if nothing comes out. You may want to try again another day. Repeated milking can be painful and cause bruises, which only exacerbates the issue. Or, the glands may be impacted, which requires veterinary intervention. [11] X Research source Don't force the expression. It may be difficult to express the anal sacs of large dogs because they are located deeper internally. If this is the case, don't persist and hurt the dog. Seek veterinary attention because the sacs may need emptying via an internal procedure (placing a gloved finger in the rectum, which is best done by a professional!)."
