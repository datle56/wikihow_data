Looking directly into someone's eyes creates an instant connection. When you make eye contact, hold it for 1-3 seconds so he feels noticed. Then, smile and look away. This is an easy way to flirt with your workplace crush without it being obvious. [2] X Research source Don't stare into his eyes for longer than a few seconds. Otherwise, he might feel uncomfortable. If you feel awkward or he asks if you need something, ask him a generic work question. You might say, “Did you get my email?” “Did you see the new quarterly numbers are out?” or “Do you know if the printer is fixed?”"

      "content": "Wink at him playfully when no one else is watching. Giving a sly wink will send him a clear signal that you're feeling flirty. However, you can also explain it away if the situation becomes awkward. Wait until no one's around or you feel confident that no one is looking. Then, wink at him as you pass each other. [5] X Research source A slow wink is more flirty than a quick wink. If you're not sure how he'll react to the wink, start with a quick wink so that it's easy to explain away. You could say, “I think I got something in my eye. I'm going to check in the mirror.”"

      "content": "Be sensual by walking by slowly and accentuating your movements. This is an easy way to cultivate sex appeal in the workplace without being obvious. Men love watching your body move, and slowing down makes it more eye-catching. Move slowly and make your regular movements bigger when he may be watching you.

      "content": "Dress well but keep your look professional . When you're trying to get a guy's attention, you want to look your best. However, it's important that you stay in dress code at all times so you don't compromise your job and career path. Choose professional outfits that make you look and feel your best but will also impress your boss.

If you're a man, you might wear a tailored blazer or pair a unique tie with your button-up shirt."

      "content": "Ask him to help you with an issue you're having. Getting help from someone is a classic flirting maneuver that's easy to brush off as innocent. If you're able to collaborate at work, invite him to work on a project with you. As another option, ask for his opinion about something.

      "content": "Learn more about him by observing him and asking questions. When you're working with him, use it as an opportunity to learn more about him. Look for a wedding ring, check his workplace for photos of a partner, or work in questions about his personal life. Only ask 1-2 questions at a time so that he doesn't realize you're fishing for information. For instance, you might go talk to him right before he gets off work so you can say, “You know what, I can come back tomorrow. I don't want to make you late for dinner with your girlfriend.”"

      "title": "Show off your personality by mentioning your hobbies and interests.",
      "content": "Show off your personality by mentioning your hobbies and interests. Talking about yourself may not seem like flirting at first glance, but it can get his attention. Rather than telling long stories about your life, briefly mention the most interesting things about yourself when you have the opportunity. Try to relate it to your work so it seems innocent. For instance, let's say you have a demanding workload this week. You might say, “I won 1st place in a marathon last year, so I'm used to going all the way.” If you're allowed to display personal photos in your work area, include pictures that show you enjoying your favorite activities. This might include a photo of you hiking, a picture of you working on a painting, and a snapshot of you reading at the beach."

[10] X Research source Try these jokes: “Have you been to that new restaurant called Karma? There's no menu because you get what you deserve.” “Do you know why the robber took a bath?

However, take your time so that you don't come on too strong. Start with compliments like, “That was a great presentation,” or “I'm always happy when I get to work with you because you're so dedicated.” Then, try, “That shirt looks great,” or “Looking stylish today!” If he seems uncomfortable, brush off the compliment and leave him alone. You might say, “I'm trying this new thing where I pay it forward with compliments, but maybe I'll try buying someone a coffee next time.”"
