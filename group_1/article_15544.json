The Effects panel lets you add text effects like drop shadow, inner shadow, and blurring. If the Text panel is grayed out and you see a yellow icon with \"A?\" next to the font's name, the font is not installed on your computer.

Still, this is handy if you're working with text that you need to resize to fit in a certain area. Here's how to scale text: [4] X Research source Press the K key on the keyboard to open the Scale tool. Click the text on the page, or click the text layer in the Layers panel on the left.

There are two ways to create a text layer: [5] X Research source One is to click the location where you want to add text. This creates a new text layer with text resizing set to Auto Width, which means that as you type, the width of the text box expands as you enter more text. The other is to click and drag your mouse to draw a text box with the desired dimensions. This not only defines the size of the text layer before you start typing, but also sets the text resizing to Fixed Width, which lets you enter more text. It also automatically wraps the text so it overflows onto the next line."

Your text layers appear in the Layers panel with a \"T\" before them."

Once you've customized an area of text to your liking, click the name of the text layer in the Layers panel so you can create a style from it. [6] X Research source For example, if you're designing a website and want all section headers to be 36pt and right aligned, you can create a Header style with those properties and apply it to every header on your website. When you make changes to a Text Style's properties later, such as its typeface, alignment, or spacing, the changes will affect all text to which you've applied that style. This is a great way to quickly change text across your entire design without tediously editing multiple text layers separately. Text Styles do not include color. You can add color using the Fill panel, or by creating a Color Style, which we'll get to later."
