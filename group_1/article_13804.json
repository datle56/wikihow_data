      "content": "Choose your weights. Select a few different dumbbell sizes to experiment with lifting. Make sure you can lift the dumbbell comfortably and repeatedly. Your focus for lateral raises will be building muscle tone, not on lifting heavy weights. While dumbbells are most popularly used for this exercise, they are not a requirement for doing lateral raises. You can use a resistance band if you’d prefer not to use dumbbells. The main difference between using a resistance band versus free weights is that with a resistance band, you will use your feet to keep the band in place as you pull up on the ends of the band. Your form and technique should be the same as it is with free weights. [1] X Research source Selecting the correct weight is important and key for lateral raises, but do not get caught up with finding the perfect weight. Using a lighter weight will cause tension and resistance with the more reps you do each set."

Keep your thumbs wrapped around the dumbbell handles, or turned toward the ceiling if you want to work out different muscle groups. Get your torso ready for the raises by tightening your abs and core muscles. If you are using a resistance band, stand on the center of the band and take a handle or end of the band in each hand. There should be some tension in the band. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Raise the dumbbells out to the sides, just below shoulder-height. Slowly lift each dumbbell out to the sides, like wings, until your arms are almost parallel to the ground, almost at shoulder-height. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 22 February 2021. Slowly exhale as you use the muscles in the top of your shoulder to lift the dumbbells. [4] X Research source Keep your head straight and aligned with your spine. It the lats are engaged, and the shoulder blades are retracted (as they are supposed to be), it is impossible to lift the arms above shoulder height. If the arms go above shoulder height, the lats are not engaged. If you are doing the exercise correctly, your arms will not go higher than the shoulders. If you are using a resistance band, lift the ends of the band as you raise your arms to shoulder-height or just slightly below. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the raise for two to three seconds with a slight bend in your elbow. Allow yourself to build a little tension in your shoulder, making the workout more effective. Keep your core engaged and stabilized. Do not flex your wrists or position your arm so that your wrists are higher than your elbows (they should be roughly at the same height or in line). If your wrists are held too high you will shift the work away from your shoulders.

      "content": "Lower your arms slowly back to the start position. Take two to three seconds to slowly lower the dumbbells back down to your start position, steadily inhaling as you go. Your movement should be slow and controlled. If you are using a resistance band, slowly lower your hands back to the starting position. Do not allow the tension in the band to pull your arm back for you — this should be a controlled movement. [7] X Research source"
